amended indian gaming compacts approved by the governor authorize an increase in the number of permissible slot machines on indian tribal land,in exchange for a substantial payment to the state of california the state,and authorize the sale of bonds compact bonds to provide an income stream to the state in return for the state promise to limit who may engage in certain types of gaming within the indian tribes core geographic market.
defendants,california infrastructure and economic development bank and golden state transportation financing corporation golden state,then initiated the sale of such bonds.however,plaintiffs,hollywood park land company,llc,terrence fancher,mec land holdings california,santa anita companies,los alamitos race course,and bay meadows main track investors,llc filed a reverse validation action,raising three constitutional challenges to the compact bonds.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants.plaintiffs appeal,and defendants.
we shall dismiss the appeal and.as we will explain,government code section,subdivision e states the exclusive means to obtain review of such a judgment shall be by petition to the supreme court for writ of review.although the statutory dictate for direct review to the supreme court is unconstitutional because it abridges the jurisdiction conferred on the courts of appeal by article vi,section,subdivision a of our state constitution california commerce casino,schwarzenegger th,d,the statute can and must be reformed to provide that a petition for writ review in a court of appeal is the exclusive means to initiate appellate review of a trial court judgment in a reverse validation action concerning contracts and the issuance of bonds authorized by the amended indian gaming compacts.thus,we lack jurisdiction to address the issues raised in the purported appeal and.
we decline plaintiffs request to treat the appeal as a petition for writ of review.plaintiffs already obtained such review by filing a petition for writ of review in the california supreme court,which transferred it to this court.our order summarily denying the petition was a determination on the merits that the reverse validation action was untimely.
factual and procedural background 
in,congress enacted the indian gaming regulatory act igra,which provides a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments.under igra,gaming is separated into three categories.each category is subject to a different mode of regulation,subds.
this appeal concerns class iii gaming,which includes forms of gambling such as slot machines and blackjack,subd.to operate class iii gaming,a tribe must enter into a compact with the state in which the tribal land is located.the compact must set forth the terms governing the conduct of the tribe gaming activities,and the compact is subject to federal approval,subd.d.
in,governor davis executed class iii gaming compacts with indian tribes,allowing the operation of a maximum of slot machines on tribal land.in march,the voters approved proposition,which in effect ratified the compacts by amending the california constitution to permit the operation of slot machines and certain card games pursuant to compacts.cal,art.iv,subd.f.
on june,governor schwarzenegger and five of the tribes agreed to amend their compacts to allow the tribes,upon the payment of substantial fee increases,to operate more than slot machines.the five tribes are the pala band of mission indians,the pauma band of luiseno mission indians,the rumsey band of wintun indians,the united auburn indian community,and the viejas band of kumeyaay indians collectively,the five tribes.under section a of the amended compacts,the five tribes are required to pay the state,among other payments,million per year for years.as security for an revenue stream in the form of bonds that can be issued to investors,the state intended to assign to a third party the state right to receive some or all of such payments the compact assets.
section a of the amended compacts provides that if the compact bonds are issued,then the state will not authorize slot machines or banking or percentage card games within the tribes core geographic market,except to another tribe with a valid class iii gaming compact.the amended compacts also provide that the five tribes can seek injunctive relief to enjoin the authorization of such gaming,so as to protect the marketability of the bonds and to provide the stability in gaming operations needed to ensure the tribes annual payments.the tribes shall have the right to cease payments until the entity stops the prohibited gaming activities or reaches an agreement with the tribes to share revenue.
the legislature ratified the amended compacts,including the provision authorizing the issuance of the compact bonds in accordance with the terms specified in the amended compacts,stats,ch.assem.bill,eff.july,hereafter ab further section references are to the government code unless otherwise specified.
ab authorized a bank defendant,as an agent for the state,to sell specific portions of the compact,money required to be paid to the a special purpose trust incorporated as a public benefit,organization,subds.a b.the special purpose trust defendant golden state is authorized to issue the compact bonds and enter into agreements with any public or private entity and pledge the compact assets that it purchased as collateral and security for its bonds,subd.b.ab also directs that the net proceeds from the sale of the compact assets be deposited in specified amounts into the traffic congestion relief fund and the transportation deferred investment fund in the state treasury,which proceeds shall be applied as a credit to transfers from the general fund that the controller would otherwise be required to make to these traffic and transportation funds,subd.c.
multiple lawsuits ensued after the legislature ratification of the amended compacts.
on september,glendon craig and several of the plaintiffs in this action including bay meadows main track investors,llc,mec land holdings california,santa anita companies,and los alamitos race course filed,in the alameda county superior court,a lawsuit against governor schwarzenegger,the director of the department of finance,and golden state craig or the craig action.the following may,the craig plaintiffs dismissed their action without prejudice,pursuant to a tolling agreement they reached with the defendants in that action.under the agreement,the plaintiffs could file a new action asserting some or all of the claims made in craig,which new action would be deemed filed on september,for statute of limitations purposes.
in may,california commerce casino,and michael sana collectively,california commerce casino filed,in the los angeles county superior court,a lawsuit against governor schwarzenegger,the director of the department of finance,and golden state,challenging the statutes that ratified the amended compacts.the trial court sustained the defendants demurrer on the ground that the action was.the plaintiffs then filed an appeal california commerce casino,schwarzenegger,supra,th,d hereafter commerce casino,the outcome of which we will discuss later in this opinion.
on november,in accordance with the authority of ab,golden state adopted a resolution authorizing the sale,issuance,and delivery of the compact bonds.golden state resolution authorized its corporate director to execute and deliver various documents the compact bond contracts,including a sale agreement between and golden state,and a master indenture of trust.the sale agreement and the master indenture of trust provide that pursuant to the statutes enacted in accordance with ab,the state pledges to the holder of the bonds that the state will not authorize anyone other than an indian tribe with a federally authorized compact to engage in specific gaming activities within the defined core geographic market of an indian tribe that is a party to an amended compact ratified by the legislature.
on january,plaintiffs initiated the present reverse validation action.california commerce casino and the tribe submitted written responses as interested parties.code civ.
thereafter,plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint with three causes of action against defendants.
the first cause of action challenges the compact bonds and compact bond contracts on the ground they unconstitutionally surrender the state police power to regulate gaming because they contain promises that will not permit to operate casinos within the core geographic markets of the five tribes while the compact bonds are outstanding the net effect of these unconstitutional conditions being to restrict the voters ability to amend the constitution to permit class iii gaming at plaintiffs racetracks.
the second cause of action contends the compact bonds and compact bond contracts are unconstitutional because the statute that led to their authorization was passed as an urgency statute in violation of article iv,section d of the california constitution,which precludes the use of an urgency statute to grant a special privilege or franchise.
the third cause of action alleges the disposition of the compact bond proceeds required by ab violates article xvi,section c of the california constitution,which was added by proposition.according to plaintiffs,the bond proceeds will impermissibly be used to fund budget deficits and the debt obligations created by the bonds will be met with moneys derived solely from a designated source of revenue.
the procedures applicable to validation actions are set forth in code of civil procedure sections through the validating statutes.code of civil procedure section states a public agency may upon the existence of any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to this chapter,and for days thereafter,bring an action to determine the validity of such matter the statute does not specify the matters to which the validation procedure applies rather,it states that the procedure applies only if it is authorized by another statute.for example,section,subdivision d,which pertains to actions challenging the tribal compact bond securitization process,states the special purpose trust and the bank shall be treated as public agencies for purposes of chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure,and any action or proceeding challenging the validity of any matter authorized by this article shall be brought in accordance with,and within the time specified in,that chapter.and section,subdivision a provides a the state or any state board,department,agency,or authority,including,but not limited to,the state public works board,may bring an action to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations,or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure.
code of civil procedure section states for purposes of this chapter,bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations,and evidences of indebtedness shall be deemed to be in existence upon their authorization.bonds and warrants shall be deemed authorized as of the date of adoption by the governing body of the public agency of a resolution or ordinance authorizing their issuance,and contracts shall be deemed authorized as of the date of adoption by the governing body of the public agency of a resolution or ordinance approving the contract and authorizing its execution.
the validating statutes contain a statute of limitations to further the important policy of speedy determination of the public agency action.citations.the validating statutes should be construed so as to uphold their purpose,the acting agency need to settle promptly all questions about the validity of its action.citation.if the public agency does not bring a validation action,any interested person may bring an action within the time and in the court specified by section to determine the validity of such matter.code of civ.a validation action by an interested person is called a reverse validation action.citation.under the statutory scheme,an agency may indirectly but effectively validate its action by doing nothing to validate it unless an interested person brings an action of his own under section within the period,the agency action will become immune from attack whether it is legally valid or not.citations.a s to matters which have been or which could have been adjudicated in a validation action,such matters must be raised within the statutory limitations period in section et or they are waived.citation.mcleod vista unified school dist.th,d,italics omitted.
defendants demurred to plaintiffs first amended complaint on the ground that the entire action was because it was not filed within days of the ratification of the amended compacts,which authorized the bonds in question,subd.a,subd.e code civ.defendants also demurred to the second cause of action on the ground that plaintiffs challenge to the enactment of ab as urgency legislation was moot even if a valid emergency did not exist,the only effect would be to delay the effective date of the statute from july,to january,which was prior to the actions taken by golden state and to issue and sell the compact bonds.
the trial court ruled that plaintiffs three causes of action were not because the pertinent date for measuring the statute of limitations was november,the date golden state and adopted resolutions authorizing the sale,execution,and delivery of the bonds,and plaintiffs reverse validation action was timely because it was filed within days of that date,on january.however,the court granted defendants demurrer to the second cause of action,which was based on mootness.
in october,defendants served a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues with respect to the remaining causes of action.they argued that the state had not contracted away its police power as alleged in the first cause of action,and that the third cause of action failed because the bonds authorized by ab did not violate the constitutional prohibition against incurring indebtedness to finance budget deficits cal,art.xvi,c and plaintiffs failed to join the five tribes as parties.
the trial court granted the motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action,but denied the motion as to the first cause of action concerning the state police power.
thereafter,in commerce casino,supra,th,d,the court of appeal upheld the los angeles county superior court ruling that the action challenging the constitutionality of ab was because it was not filed within days of the legislature ratification of the amended compacts.id.at,d.
before reaching the merits of the action,the court of appeal addressed whether it had subject matter jurisdiction in light of section,subdivision e,which states in pertinent part notwithstanding any other provision of law,the exclusive means to obtain review of a superior court judgment entered in an action brought pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure to determine the validity of any bonds to be issued,any other contracts to be entered into,or any other matters authorized by this article shall be by petition to the supreme court for writ of review.any such petition shall be filed within days following the notice of entry of the superior court judgment,and no extension of that period shall be allowed.id.at,d.
commerce casino concluded that the provision for direct review by the california supreme court was patently unconstitutional because it abridged the court of appeal appellate jurisdiction.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.thus,the court of appeal had subject matter jurisdiction to address the appeal.
commerce casino then turned to whether the appeal was timely,which depended on whether it was governed by the limitations period in the validation statutes code civ,subd.b or the typical period for filing a notice of appeal as provided for in the california rules of court.a resolution of this issue depended on whether the plaintiffs challenge to ab was subject to the validation statutes,which rendered it necessary to address the principal issue on,whether plaintiffs challenge to ab was the equivalent of a challenge to the validity of the amended compacts,which had to be filed in the trial court within days of the ratification of the amended compacts.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.
commerce casino noted there are two statutes that potentially govern validation actions challenging the validity of the amended compacts or certain matters authorized by ab,section,subdivision d and section.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.the validation provision set forth in section,subdivision d governs only challenges to the validity of matters authorized by article,the securitization of the tribal compact assets,which did not encompass a challenge to the validity of the amended compacts.id.at,d.
not all contracts are subject to validation under section commerce casino,supra,th at,d,only those that are in the nature of,or directly relate to the state or a state agency bonds,warrants,or other evidences of indebtedness.id.at,d.in that case,the amended compacts met this requirement because they were inextricably intertwined with the s tate intended use of the income stream created by them and with the bonds to be issued at a later date.therefore,the ability of the five tribes and the s tate to accomplish the statutory purpose of ab would be substantially impaired absent a prompt validating procedure as to such contract s.citation.id.at,d.commerce casino noted that the application of the validation statutes is not contingent on whether the bonds are ultimately issued at the end of the process.the applicability of the validation statutes is determined at the beginning of the financing process when the this case the amended to implement that process are approved.id.at,d.
the plaintiffs alleged that ab was unconstitutional because it granted a franchise or special privilege by use of urgency legislation it violated proposition prohibition on borrowing to fund budget deficits and it contracted away the state police power to regulate gaming.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.all three of those theories were an implicit attack on the validity of the amended compacts,since invalidating ab on constitutional grounds would also invalidate the amended compacts.id.at,d.plaintiffs proposition attack on ab was an attack on the validity of the amended compacts because they are inextricably bound up with the use of the income stream created by the amended compacts and with the bonds to be issued.commerce casino express ed no opinion as to any litigation involving the validity of any bonds issued pursuant to article,within section of ab.id.at,d.it simply h e ld plaintiffs various constitutional challenges to ab were also an attack on the validity of the amended compacts,and therefore said challenges should have been brought within days of the effective date of said compacts.id.at,d.
thus,the plaintiffs complaint in commerce casino was untimely because it was filed more than days after the legislature had ratified the compacts on july,commerce casino,supra,th at,d and the plaintiffs notice of appeal was untimely since it was filed more than days after notice of entry of judgment.code civ.therefore,the appeal was dismissed.commerce casino,supra,at,d.
after the opinion in commerce casino was filed,defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings as to the remaining first cause of action concerning the state police power,contending it was under the rationale of commerce casino.indeed,they argued that,even though the court had already resolved plaintiffs other two causes of actions on different grounds,they were also because they were identical to causes of action that commerce casino found were.all of plaintiffs challenges to the bonds were challenges to matters authorized by the amended compacts,and an invalidation of one would implicitly invalidate the other.thus,plaintiffs should have brought the reverse validation action within days of the legislature ratification of the amended compacts.
plaintiffs opposed the motion on the ground that commerce casino did not apply because it specifically declined to express an opinion as to the validity of any bonds issued pursuant to article of ab.the decision simply held that the various constitutional challenges to ab were equivalent to an attack on the validity of the amended compacts and,thus,the challenges were untimely because they were not brought within days of the effective date of the compacts as required by section.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.in contrast,plaintiffs argued,they were not contesting the amended compacts they were challenging the validity of the compact bonds and compact bond contracts.code of civil procedure section states that bonds and contracts are deemed authorized on the date the governing body of a public agency adopts a resolution authorizing their issuance or approving the contract.section,subdivision d states the special purpose trust,golden state and the bank,shall be treated as public agencies for purposes of validation proceedings,and any action or proceeding challenging the validity of any matter authorized by this article,article shall be brought in accordance with,and within the time specified in,the chapter governing validation proceedings.section,which is in article,authorizes and golden state to take the necessary steps to issue the compact bonds and the compact bond contracts.on november,golden state adopted a resolution authorizing the sale,issuance,and delivery of the compact bonds,and authorized its corporate director to execute and deliver the compact bond contracts,the sale agreement between and golden state,and the master indenture of trust.thus,according to plaintiffs,they had from this date to bring a reverse validation proceeding challenging these actions by these designated public agencies,and plaintiffs action filed on january,was timely.
in addition,plaintiffs argued that,even if their complaint were construed as a reverse validation challenge to the amended compacts,their action was timely pursuant to the tolling agreement in the craig action.plaintiffs asserted the present action was simply a continuation of the craig complaint filed on september,and because the amended compacts were not in existence until they were approved by the secretary of the interior on september,the complaint was filed well within the limit.
the trial court granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,ruling that the compact bonds promises of gaming exclusivity,which plaintiffs contended unconstitutionally surrendered the state police power,were basically the same as those contained in the amended compacts.as commerce casino observed,the amended compacts are inextricably intertwined with the state intended use of the income stream created by the compacts and with the bonds to be issued at a later date.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.a ruling that invalidated the promise in the bonds would implicitly invalidate the promise in the amended compacts,but this would impermissibly allow seriatim challenges to a unified method of financing,which would defeat the validating procedure purpose of promptly settling all questions about the validity of a public entity action.as such,the action was because it was not filed within days of the ratification of the amended compacts on july.this was true whether the date of the present complaint or the date of the craig complaint was used.the fact that the compacts had not been published in the federal register until september,did not alter this result because,for purposes of a validation proceeding,contracts are deemed to be in existence when adopted by the governing body of the public agency of a resolution or ordinance approving the contract and authorizing its execution,which meant the date the legislature ratified the compacts was the relevant date.
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on october,days after notice of entry of the trial court judgment of dismissal.the next day,plaintiffs also filed a petition for writ of review with the california supreme court case no,pursuant to the exclusive method of review provision of section,subdivision e,even though commerce casino held that this portion of the statute is unconstitutional.on december,the supreme court transferred the matter to this court.on january,this court summarily denied the writ petition based on commerce casino.
we now proceed to address plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
plaintiffs and defendants reiterate their positions concerning the timeliness of plaintiffs complaint whether the second cause of action is moot and whether the third cause of action violates proposition.defendants contend,as they did in the trial court,that all three of plaintiffs causes of action are because they were not filed within days of the ratification of the amended compact effective july.plaintiffs insist that they are challenging the compact bonds and compact bond contracts and that,pursuant to section,subdivision d,the time for bringing a reverse validation action is measured from the date that golden state and authorized the sale of compact assets and the issuance of the bonds on november.
plaintiffs insistence that section governs creates a possible jurisdictional problem in light of their prior petition for writ of mandate pursuant to section,subdivision e.as we discussed earlier in this opinion,commerce casino held that section,subdivision e is unconstitutional because it bypasses the court of appeal and mandates direct review by california supreme court in the first instance.commerce casino,supra,th at,d.but commerce casino did not consider whether the provision requiring direct review in the supreme court could,and should,be severed from the statute,leaving a petition for writ of review in the court of appeal as the exclusive means of obtaining review of a judgment in a reverse validation action concerning the compact bonds and compact bond contracts.see,leone medical board cal th,d,hereafter leone the legislature generally has authority to enact laws specifying the mode of appellate review,by an extraordinary writ proceeding or direct appeal hotel employees restaurant employees internat.union davis cal th,d,hereafter hotel employees an unconstitutional statute is not inoperative to the extent that its invalid parts can be severed from any valid ones kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,lead opn.of lucas,where a statute is not capable of being interpreted in a constitutional manner,a reviewing court may legitimately reform or rewrite it in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution and to effectuate policy judgments clearly articulated by the legislature,when invalidating the statute would be far more destructive of the legislature will accord,people sandoval cal th,fn,d.
while we agree that the provision for direct review before the supreme court is unconstitutional for the reasons stated in commerce casino,it does not necessarily follow that the remaining portion of the statute directing the exclusive means of review shall be by petition for writ of review is similarly infirm.
we gave the parties the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing on this issue,asking them to address whether the statute could and should be reformed to excise the unconstitutional reference to direct review in the supreme court and if so,whether we lack jurisdiction to address the appeal which would require dismissal of the appeal,or whether our summary denial of the writ petition was law of the case with respect to the contentions raised on appeal.jennings marralle cal th,d,an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal,and a reviewing court must raise the issue of jurisdiction on its own initiative porter united services automobile th,d subject to certain narrow constitutional limitations,there is no right to appeal the right to appeal is wholly statutory.
as we will explain,section,subdivision e can and should be reformed to comport with the legislature intent to provide an expedient method of settling questions concerning the validity of the compact bonds and compact bond contracts.and because plaintiffs have already pursued their exclusive statutory remedy of a petition for writ of review,and this court summarily denied review on the merits,we lack jurisdiction to address their appeal and shall dismiss it.the dismissal renders it unnecessary to address plaintiffs contention that our prior summary denial of their writ petition is not law of the case with respect to the contentions they raise on appeal.
the appellate jurisdiction clause of california constitution states in part the supreme court has appellate jurisdiction when judgment of death has been pronounced.with that exception courts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior courts have original jurisdiction cal,art.vi.the clause does not grant litigants the right to bring a direct appeal rather,it specifies the constitutional power of the courts.leone,supra,cal th at,d.the appellate jurisdiction vested in the courts of appeal encompasses review by extraordinary writ as well as by direct appeal.ibid.
the legislature is permitted to enact laws specifying that an extraordinary writ petition shall be the exclusive method for obtaining review.leone,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the california supreme court has upheld statutes mandating that writ review be the exclusive method of review in certain actions.leone,supra,cal th at,d,medical license revocation actions under business and professions code section powers city of richmond cal th,d,plur.opn.of kennard,d,conc.opn.of george,california public records act actions,hereafter powers.
however,the legislature authority to specify the mode of appellate review is not unqualified.leone,supra,cal th at,d.because the appellate jurisdiction clause is a grant of judicial authority,the legislature may not restrict appellate review in a manner that would substantially impair the constitutional powers of the courts,or practically defeat their exercise.citations.if it could be demonstrated in a given case,or class of cases,that,for whatever reason,the courts of appeal or the supreme court could not effectively exercise the constitutionally granted power of appellate review by an extraordinary writ proceeding,then such a proceeding could not constitutionally be made the exclusive mode of appellate review.id.at,d,italics omitted,quoting powers,supra,cal th at,d.
the fact that an appellate court may summarily deny a writ without issuing a written opinion does not mean that extraordinary writ review is an insufficient or ineffective appellate remedy.leone,supra,cal th at,d.where a writ petition is the only authorized mode of appellate review,an appellate court must judge the petition on its procedural and substantive merits,and a summary denial of the petition is necessarily on the merits.citations.an appellate court that summarily denies a writ petition for lack of substantive merit or for procedural defect thereby fulfills its duty to exercise the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by the state constitution appellate jurisdiction clause.id.at,d.
as noted by the california supreme court,the appellate jurisdiction clause does not require the legislature to provide for direct appeals in all cases within the original jurisdiction of the superior courts it permits some variation in and experimentation with the procedures for appellate review of civil actions brought in the superior courts,provided always that the constitutional powers of the courts are not thereby impaired leone,supra,cal th at,d,powers,supra,cal th at,d.
here,as in powers and leone,there is no reason to conclude that extraordinary writ review is not a sufficient or effective appellate remedy powers,supra,cal th at,d,leone,supra,cal th at,d.validation actions are already subject to a shorter statute of limitations to further the important public policy of speedy determination of the public agency action,and to settle promptly all questions about the validity of its action.mcleod vista unified school,supra,th at,d.the legislature decision to require extraordinary writ review in validation actions concerning the compact bonds is in furtherance of this policy.there is no evidence that it is designed to preclude review on the merits or to disadvantage litigants rather,it is designed to speed the appellate review process,thereby making the appellate remedy more effective.see ab,declaring the urgent need to immediately implement the sale of the compact bonds powers,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,there is no impediment to the legislature limiting appellate review of tribal compact bonds and compact bond contracts to review by extraordinary writ the legislature simply violated the constitutional provision governing appellate jurisdiction when it mandated review in the california supreme court in the first instance.
the next question is whether we may reform section,subdivision e by severing the unconstitutional portion dictating direct supreme court review,and yet preserve the parts and applications of the section which do not violate the constitutional provision and which the legislature would have intended to put into effect if it had foreseen the constitutional restriction.in re edgar cal d.
a statute that is invalid as inconsistent with the california constitution is not ineffective and inoperative to the extent that its invalid parts can be severed from any valid ones.hotel employees,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,invalid provisions of a statute should be severed whenever possible to preserve the validity of the remainder of the statute.raven deukmejian cal d,in re kapperman cal d.and it is clear that severance of particular provisions is permissible despite the absence of a formal severance clause.legislature eu cal d,city of dublin county of alameda th,d.
however,a n invalid part can be severed if,and only if,it is grammatically,functionally and volitionally separable.citation.it is grammatically separable if it is distinct and separate and,hence,can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording of any of the measure other provisions.citation.it is functionally separable if it is not necessary to the measure operation and purpose.citation.and it is volitionally separable if it was not of critical importance to the measure enactment.citation.hotel employees,supra,cal th at,d.
the aforementioned conditions are satisfied here.section,subdivision e provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,the exclusive means to obtain review of a superior court judgment entered in an action brought pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure to determine the validity of any bonds to be issued,any other contracts to be entered into,or any other matters authorized by this article shall be by petition to the supreme court for writ of review.any such petition shall be filed within days following the notice of entry of the superior court judgment,and no extension of that period shall be allowed.if no petition is filed within the time allowed for this purpose,or the petition is denied,with or without opinion,the decision of the superior court shall be final and enforceable as provided in subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure.in any case in which a petition has been filed within the time allowed,the supreme court shall make any orders as it may deem proper in the circumstances.if no answering party appeared in the superior court action,the only issues that may be raised in the petition are those related to the jurisdiction of the superior court.nothing in this subdivision or subdivision d shall be construed as granting standing to challenge the designated tribal compacts.emphasis added.
the emphasized portions of the statute can be grammatically excised from section,subdivision e and severance of the emphasized portions will not impair operation of the rest of the statutory scheme.
the legislature made a petition for extraordinary writ the exclusive appellate remedy in order to expedite the review process.its chosen forum for review was simply intended to further expedite the process by directing that the matter go directly to the supreme court rather than waiting for that court to determine whether to grant review following a decision by the court of appeal.thus,we are confident that,if the legislature had foreseen that direct writ review in the supreme court violated the constitution,it nonetheless would have enacted the statute to provide that a petition for writ of review is the exclusive means of obtaining appellate review of a trial court judgment in a reverse validation action concerning contracts and the issuance of bonds authorized by the amended indian gaming compacts.we reach this conclusion based on the legislature declaration of urgent need to immediately implement the sale of the compact bonds stats,ch.assem.bill,its declaration that the article be liberally construed to effectuate its intent and the shortened statutes of limitation for review in the superior court and court of appeal that generally are applicable to reverse validation actions because of the important public policy of promptly settling all questions about the validity of the public agency action.code civ,mcleod vista unified school,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs disagree that reformation is appropriate but their arguments,which we discuss in part iii below,are not persuasive.
plaintiffs do not contend that the constitutional powers of the courts are impaired by the designation of a petition for writ of review as the exclusive method of review.and plaintiffs appear to concede the legislature intended to facilitate the sale of the compact bonds by expediting appellate review in validation actions challenging the compact bonds.however,they argue we should not reform section,subdivision e because it would not effectuate the legislature intent to expedite review under the unique circumstances of this case.plaintiffs state instead of resulting in a final judgment as a decision on the merits of the appeal would,a decision to reform that statute and dismiss the appeal would create a needless conflict with the decision invalidating the same statute and adjudicating the appeal in commerce casino.supreme court review would be necessary to resolve this jurisdictional issue,thus preventing any court from addressing the merits of this appeal for at least a year,and possibly more.thus,reforming the statute would in all likelihood frustrate,rather than promote,the legislature goal of adjudicating challenges to the validity of the compact bonds expeditiously.
plaintiffs argument is not convincing.our decision does not truly conflict with california commerce,which decided that section,subdivision e was unconstitutional because it impermissibly bypassed the court of appeal by mandating direct review in the supreme court.we agree with the analysis of california commerce on this point.california commerce did not address whether the statute could be reformed thus,it is not authority for a proposition not considered by it.gutierrez employment development department th,d.even assuming there is a conflict and the california supreme court granted review,this does not mean reformation of the statute would not effectuate the legislature intent to expedite the appellate process.
in deciding whether the reformation of a statute conforms with the legislature intent,we must look to its intent at the time the statute was enacted,and determine whether reformation would generally effectuate this intent.unless this is the only time section,subdivision e will ever be applied,the fact that a resolution of the present case may be delayed by reforming the statute is irrelevant to this analysis.plaintiffs present no analysis demonstrating that this will be the only time that section,subdivision e will have any application and that no further challenges to the securitization process in article will ever be forthcoming.in fact,section indicates future compacts may be entered,future compact assets sold to the special purpose trust,and further bonds issued.
plaintiffs also argue that a reformation of section,subdivision e leads to an insoluble conundrum.plaintiffs contend that if the statute can be reformed as our request for supplemental briefing suggested,then a petition for writ of review was plaintiffs only remedy to secure appellate review of the trial court judgment,however this court summary denial of plaintiffs petition for writ of review on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional,citing commerce casino,would prevent us f
