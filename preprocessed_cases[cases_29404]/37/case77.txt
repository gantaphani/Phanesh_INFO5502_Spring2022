background 
a.the igra 
before turning to the pleadings,we briefly outline the igra statutory scheme.the igra regulates gaming conducted by indian tribes on their reservations or on lands held in trust for their benefit by the secretary.the act divides all gaming into three classes,regulating each class to varying degrees.this case focuses on class iii gaming,the most heavily regulated of the classes,which includes casinos.id.the act provides that class iii gaming activities shall be lawful on indian lands only if such activities are conducted in conformance with a compact entered into by the indian tribe and the state that is in effect.d c.a compact shall take effect only when notice of approval by the secretary of such compact has been published by the secretary.d b.thus,class iii gaming is lawful only if conducted under a compact approved by both the host state and the secretary.
the igra imposes an additional layer of restrictions when a tribe seeks to conduct class iii gaming on lands that are neither within nor contiguous to the boundaries of its reservation.see a.the act generally prohibits such gaming if it would be conducted on lands acquired by the secretary in trust for the benefit of an indian tribe after october.a.one exception to this ban holds if 
the secretary determines that a gaming establishment on newly acquired lands would be in the best interest of the indian tribe and its members,and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community,but only if the governor of the state in which the gaming activity is to be conducted concurs in the secretary determination.
b a.accordingly,the act contemplates that both the secretary and the host state will play significant roles in regulating indian gaming.
factual allegations 
because this is an appeal from a dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b,we summarize the facts as alleged by ldf amended complaint.the nation is a federally recognized tribe residing in wisconsin.for several years,it has operated a number of casinos in that state pursuant to a compact.in,it negotiated an amendment to the compact with wisconsin that purports to authorize it to operate a total of nine class iii gaming facilities within the state.this case focuses on of the final version of those amendments,signed on june.paragraph provides that if any tribe other than submits an application to the secretary under b a to conduct gaming on trust lands acquired by the united states after january,and the secretary determines that the establishment would be in the best interest of the tribe and not detrimental to the community 
the state shall send a written notice to that it has received a submission from the secretary to concur in the determination t he state shall not concur in the determination if has notified the state,within sixty days of receipt of the notice,that the operation of the establishment will cause a substantial reduction of class iii gaming revenues at any of existing gaming facilities,unless the state has entered into a binding indemnification agreement with to compensate it for the reduction or the mandatory negotiations required herein have concluded and the binding arbitration procedures required herein have commenced.
after executing the amended compact,and wisconsin presented it to the secretary for approval.
ldf is a federally recognized indian tribe residing in wisconsin.it currently has an application pending with the secretary under b a to conduct class iii gaming at a site outside its reservation.outraged at what it perceived to be the nature of,ldf urged the secretary to reject that agreement.several other tribes in wisconsin joined in ldf protest.nevertheless,the secretary took no position on the validity of the amended compact between and wisconsin.the igra provides that i f the secretary does not approve or disapprove a compact before the date that is days after the date on which the compact is submitted to the secretary for approval,the compact shall be considered to have been approved by the secretary,but only to the extent the compact is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.d c.accordingly,days after the amended compact was submitted to the secretary,it was deemed approved by operation of law.
ldf then filed this suit against the secretary,relying on the apa as the sole basis for subject matter jurisdiction.plaintiff alleges that the secretary violated her fiduciary duty to treat all indian tribes equally by allowing the compact to take effect.specifically,ldf amended complaint states that the secretary exceeded her authority by granting the an affirmative right to be free from economic competition.it seeks as a remedy,among other things,an order declaring paragraph void.
which was not named as a defendant,moved to intervene for the limited purpose of seeking to dismiss the suit.the district court concluded that had an interest in defending the compact and allowed the intervention.and the secretary then moved to dismiss,and the court granted their motions on three grounds.first,the district court held that ldf had not alleged an actual or imminent injury,and therefore lacked standing to challenge the secretary action.it reasoned that one of several contingencies could occur to prevent ldf from being harmed by the provisions of the amended compact.second,the court held that the apa grant of judicial review did not extend to the secretary passive approval of the compact.third,it concluded that because ldf sought to invalidate a portion of the compact,as a signatory to that agreement,was a necessary and indispensable party.because enjoys sovereign immunity,however,the district court concluded that it could not be joined as a defendant.accordingly,the court held that dismissal was required by federal rule of civil procedure b.ldf appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court dismissal of ldf amended complaint de novo.centers centennial mortgage,cir.a court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.
appellees argue that dismissal was proper because i ldf lacks standing ii the apa does not afford judicial review of the secretary action and iii is a necessary and indispensable party which can not be joined due to its sovereign immunity.as we explain below,ldf has standing to bring this suit.we hold,however,that plaintiff has forfeited any claim that the apa affords judicial review of the secretary decision.accordingly,we do not address whether the suit must be dismissed under civil rule b.
the requirement of standing derives from the recognition that article iii of the united states constitution extends the judicial power only to cases and controversies.const.art.iii.see warth seldin,d s tanding imports justiciability whether the plaintiff has made out a case or controversy between himself and the defendant within the meaning of art.iii.in essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.id.t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.id.at.e ach element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.id.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presum e that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.id.quoting lujan wildlife fed n,d.
ldf alleges that the secretary harmed it by allowing the provisions of the compact to take effect.plaintiff,which currently has an application pending with the secretary to open a casino outside of its reservation,can do so lawfully only if that application is approved by both the secretary and wisconsin.b a.plaintiff asserts that by allowing the compact to take effect,the secretary has given wisconsin a strong incentive to reject its application.for if wisconsin approves ldf application,the compact obliges the state to pay for the revenues loses to the competing casino.ldf seeks a declaration that of the compact,the indemnification provision,is void.appellees argue that ldf allegations satisfy none of the elements of standing.we consider the elements in turn.
injury in fact 
the secretary argues that ldf lacks standing because it has not adequately pleaded an injury in fact.defendant asserts that any injury arising out of of the amended compact is not particular to ldf because it will affect all indian tribes in wisconsin other than equally.
defendant argument is based on a flawed understanding of the particularity requirement.to confer standing,an injury must be particularized,meaning that it must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.defenders of wildlife,at.in other words,a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws,and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at not state an article iii case or controversy.id.at.but the particularity requirement does not mean,contrary to the secretary interpretation,that a plaintiff lacks standing merely because it asserts an injury that is shared by many people.fed.election comm akins,d.often the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand.but their association is not invariable,and where a harm is concrete,though widely shared,the supreme court has found injury in fact.id.at.see also united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,d s tanding is not to be denied simply because many people suffer the same injury to deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured,would mean that the most injurious and widespread government actions could be questioned by nobody.defenders of wildlife,at.finding no standing but distinguishing a hypothetical case where concrete injury has been suffered by many persons.ldf alleges that the secretary passive approval of the compact places it at a competitive disadvantage when seeking state approval for gaming.this clearly amounts to a concrete injury.see clinton city of new york,d quoting kenneth davis richard pierce,administrative law treatise ed.the supreme court routinely recognizes probable economic injury resulting from government actions that alter competitive conditions as sufficient to satisfy the article iii requirement.that this injury may be shared by other tribes in wisconsin does not undermine ldf standing.we therefore reject the secretary particularity argument 
next,appellees argue that ldf has pleaded an injury that is at most conjectural,not actual or imminent.the secretary and point to a number of contingencies that,as they see it,could prevent ldf from being harmed by the compact.for example,they argue that the compact could harm ldf only if wisconsin decides to reject plaintiff application for gaming because of the state duty to indemnify under that agreement.appellees posit that wisconsin might reject ldf application for reasons unrelated to the compact,thereby averting the harm to plaintiff.
this argument misperceives the nature of the injury for standing purposes.
when the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group,a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.the injury in fact in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.
northeastern.chapter of associated contractors of am.city of jacksonville,d.in other words,the injury in fact is the inability to compete on an equal footing.see also regents of the of cal.bakke,d e ven if bakke had been unable to prove that he would have been admitted in the absence of the special program,it would not follow that he lacked standing the trial court found a sufficient injury in fact,apart from the failure to be admitted,in the university decision not to permit bakke to compete for all places in the class,simply because of his race.this analysis,moreover,is not limited to cases alleging a violation of the equal protection clause.the supreme court has applied this approach in a case raising a presentment clause challenge,see city of new york,at,and we have done the same in a case alleging a first amendment violation,see tarpley jeffers,cir.whether to apply this analysis depends on the nature of the alleged injury,not the source of the asserted right.defenders of wildlife,at.t here is absolutely no basis for making the article iii inquiry turn on the source of the asserted right.because ldf alleges an injury akin to that raised by the plaintiffs in associated general inability to compete on equal analysis controls here.
under that approach,it is clear that a decision by wisconsin to reject ldf application for reasons unrelated to the compact would not avert the harm alleged by plaintiff.the harm is not ldf inability to obtain the benefit,here,approval of its gaming application.rather,the harm lies in the denial of equal treatment,in this case,being forced to seek approval under the cloud created by the amended compact.the possibility that wisconsin might reject ldf application for legitimate reasons is therefore irrelevant to the standing analysis.
appellees also argue that the compact is unlikely to harm ldf because there is no guarantee that the secretary will approve ldf application at all,much less anytime soon.until the secretary approves that application,defendant and a
