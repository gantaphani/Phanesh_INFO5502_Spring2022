who knew that simple math could be so tricky the parties to this dispute,the state of california and two california indian tribes,signed gaming compacts intended to initiate a new era of cooperation with respect to gaming in the state.central to the compacts is a formula to calculate the number of gaming devices california tribes are permitted to license.how to interpret this opaquely drafted and convoluted formula has preoccupied the parties for some time,as the result has significant economic implications.indeed,math and money have led to a breakdown in the cooperative spirit envisioned by the compacts.
the compacts stem from the indian gaming regulatory act igra,passed by congress in and designed to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments.igra sets out three classes of lawful gaming at issue here are slot machines and other gaming machines gaming devices that are included under class iii.b ii.a gaming agreement,known as a compact,is required to conduct class iii gaming under igra.d c.
in,california and approximately california indian tribes signed substantively identical bilateral gaming compacts that authorized class iii gaming.the total number of slot machines allowed was restricted by contract language that authorized the continued operation of existing machines,permitted tribes who were not yet operating machines to operate up to machines,and provided a formula for a limited license pool for the remaining machines.the primary issue in this appeal is the interpretation of the formula for the license pool,a mere two paragraphs in a agreement.unfortunately,these provisions are not a model of clarity.as a consequence,california and certain tribes have been mired in disputes for much of the period since the bilateral compacts were signed.
this appeal springs from a disagreement between california and plaintiff cachil dehe band of wintun indians of the colusa indian community and picayune rancheria of the chukchansi indians picayune collectively,colusa the parties agree that the formula sets a ceiling on the number of licenses in the pool.but the tribes claim the formula permits more licenses,while california maintains that it sets a lower limit.acknowledging that the formula language is ambiguous,california and colusa each offered different interpretations.the district court adopted yet a different formulation,introduced by colusa as an alternative way to calculate the license pool.the parties also submitted extrinsic evidence purporting to explain their calculations.
such a posture would normally suggest that summary judgment is inappropriate,even though contract interpretation is a matter of law.nonetheless,both parties agreed that the matter should be decided on cross motions for summary judgment.an additional twist is that the parties extrinsic evidence does not support their interpretations of the formula.as a result,we interpret the compact de novo based on the plain meaning that adheres closest to the contract language.
we affirm in part the grant of summary judgment to colusa because we agree that the limit on licenses exceeds that recognized by california.however,our interpretation of the governing provisions differs slightly from the district court formulation.we also affirm the denial of california motion for summary judgment.finally,we uphold the remedy ordered by the district court of a license draw open to all eligible tribes,administered according to the process delineated in the compacts.before we wade into the somewhat discussion of numbers,it is useful to provide a background context for the formula.
background 
compacts under igra 
following a successful ballot initiative permitting california indian tribes to run nevada and new jersey type casinos,and in response to the likely imminent invalidation of that initiative,gray davis invited california tribes to negotiate class iii gaming compacts.by that number of california tribes were already operating gaming devices,although without authorization under igra.these tribes operated around devices.in late august,the california supreme court invalidated the ballot initiative permitting casino operation by indian tribes.see hotel employees rest.employees int l union davis,cal th.california and the tribes,including colusa,continued negotiating,however,intending to condition execution of the compacts on the ratification of a constitutional amendment that would exempt indian tribes from the prohibition on class iii gaming.
the final compact negotiation sessions were held on september and,and continued into the early hours of september.late on september,the lead negotiator for california presented the entire draft compact to the tribal representatives for approval.the representatives were given until september to sign letters of intent to enter into bilateral compacts with california.the compacts required legislative ratification,and the end of the legislative session was fast approaching.colusa chairman signed the tribe letter of intent in the early hours of september.in total,about tribes the compact tribes,including colusa and picayune,entered into bilateral class iii gaming compacts with california.these compacts are substantially identical.see artichoke joe cal.grand casino norton,cir.
the california legislature ratified the agreements in september.on the same day,the governor press office released an information sheet regarding the number of licenses available,stating that the compacts authorized gaming devices total statewide,including those already in operation.california voters ratified the constitutional amendment in march,enabling the compacts to be executed.colusa and picayune compacts went into effect on may.
while the colusa compact includes a variety of provisions relating to the operation and licensing of class iii gaming devices,the only provisions at issue in this appeal relate to the aggregate number of gaming devices authorized statewide in addition to those already in operation as of september,the size of the license pool.the compact provides a formula for determining that number,at a 
the maximum number of machines that all compact tribes in the aggregate may license pursuant to this section shall be the sum equal to multiplied by the number of tribes as of september,plus the difference between and the lesser number authorized under section.
the compact defines tribes as tribes that are operating fewer than gaming devices,whether or not the tribe executed a compact with the state.a.in other words,some tribes are both compact and tribes under the agreement.section,which is referenced by a,states 
the tribe may operate no more gaming devices than the larger of the following a a number of terminals equal to the number of gaming devices operated by the tribe on september,or b three hundred fifty gaming devices.
for convenience,we refer to and a as the license pool provisions.
a compact tribe may operate a certain number of gaming devices without securing licenses from the pool.this initial free pass covers either devices or the number of devices the tribe was already operating as of september,whichever is larger.colusa operated gaming devices as of september,so it was permitted to continue operating all of those devices without licenses.a compact tribe must secure a license from the statewide pool for each additional device above the tribe free pass number,up to the maximum of devices per tribe.a.
the licenses are allocated from the license pool to compact tribes that request them according to a detailed draw process.a.the draw process,which includes tiers of priority for different tribes,was designed to skew the distribution of the available licenses towards those compact tribes that did not yet conduct large gaming operations.a.
ii.administration of the license process 
for the first two years,the license draw process was administered by an accounting agency engaged by the compact tribes,sides accountancy corporation sides.in,following complaints regarding the accounting and administration of the draws and sides unwillingness to provide certain information to california,governor davis issued an executive order creating the california gambling control commission the commission,which took over the licensing process.
during its administration,sides issued licenses,exceeding by about the number that would have been available in the pool according to the governor summary information sheet,which limited the total devices to statewide,including those already in operation.after taking control,in the commission evaluated the various interpretations of the license pool provisions that had been suggested and adopted an interpretation that authorized a license pool of licenses.this number surpassed the number of licenses that sides previously issued,allowing all of those licenses to remain valid.according to the california,which has adopted the commission licenses remained in the license pool for distribution after the commission took charge.
the commission notified the compact tribes that it would conduct a draw in september.colusa was placed in the third priority tier for the first draw,in which it requested and received licenses.for the second draw in december,colusa was placed in the fourth priority tier.although colusa requested licenses,it received none.in october,the commission conducted a third draw,and colusa requested licenses.colusa was again placed in the fourth priority tier,and received only licenses.from the three draws,colusa secured licenses in total when added to the devices in operation,the licenses drawn from the pool allowed colusa to operate devices,well under the individual limit of devices per compact tribe.
iii.the colusa lawsuits 
immediately following the december draw,colusa requested that california meet and confer regarding,among other issues,the size of the license pool and colusa placement within the lower priority tier for the draw.following an unsuccessful meeting,colusa initiated suit in october.
colusa initial complaint alleged five claims for breach of the compact.only one unilateral determination of the aggregate number of licenses authorized by the compact under the license pool at issue here in its complaint,colusa sought a declaration that the license pool consisted of more than gaming device licenses,and requested that the court order california to immediately issue licenses to colusa.
the district court dismissed four of the claims on the ground that colusa was required to join other compact tribes as necessary parties under federal rule of civil procedure the fifth claim was dismissed for failure to exhaust remedies.on appeal,we reversed and held that the compact tribes did not have a protectable legal interest in the size of the license pool and were not required parties that must be joined under rule.colusa i,at.we affirmed the dismissal of the unexhausted claim.id.at.
while colusa i was pending,california negotiated compact amendments with at least five tribes.neither colusa nor picayune entered an amended compact,although colusa negotiated regarding a potential amendment.the amended compacts provided up to additional gaming devices outside of the aggregate limits established by the original compacts.
in june,also during the time colusa i was pending,colusa filed a second suit,alleging california breached the compact by refusing to conduct another round of draws,miscounting games as equal to the number of terminals,and failing to negotiate in good faith.the district court consolidated colusa two actions.in january,picayune intervened,alleging the commission breached the compact by miscalculating the size of the license pool.
the parties for summary judgment on the issue of the size of the license pool.on april,the district court granted summary judgment to colusa on the aggregate number of gaming devices authorized by the compact and on colusa placement within the priority tiers.the court entered final judgment on all claims on august,and ordered california to conduct a draw of the remaining licenses in the pool that would be open to all eligible compact tribes.california request to stay the order for thirty days was denied.california timely appealed and then moved for a stay of the district court remedy order.following denial of the stay motion,in october,california conducted a license draw open to all eligible compact tribes.in that draw,licenses were issued to ten compact tribes,including colusa and picayune.

interpretations of license pool provisions offered by parties 
the license pool provisions are repeated here,to facilitate their explanation.the calculations fall naturally into two steps 
the maximum number of machines that all compact tribes in the aggregate may license pursuant to this section shall be the sum equal to step multiplied by the number of tribes as of september,plus step the difference between and the lesser number authorized under section.
section provides 
the tribe may operate no more gaming devices than the larger of the following a a number of terminals equal to the number of gaming devices operated by the tribe on september,or b three hundred fifty gaming devices.
a.the parties original interpretations 
from the beginning of this litigation,colusa and california have agreed on the operation of step of the a sum.the compact defines tribes as tribes that were operating fewer than gaming devices as of september,whether or not they ultimately entered compacts.a i.there are such tribes.step is therefore 
the parties vigorously dispute the operation of step.that step is defined by the following formula 
lesser number authorized under section 
in the original summary judgment submissions,california and colusa championed two competing interpretations of step.the parties agreed,however,on these important predicates 
section must be applied in a way that will encompass all compact tribes,even though the language of on its own applies only to a single tribe.
to apply in a way to aggregate all compact tribes 
should be multiplied by a particular number of tribes.this will serve to aggregate the language of b three hundred fifty gaming devices.
the total number of devices operated by tribes with fewer than devices acts as the aggregate number for the language of a a number of terminals equal to the number of gaming devices operated by the tribe on september.as of september,the total number of gaming devices operated by tribes operating fewer than devices was.
to complete step,the aggregate number for a should be subtracted from the aggregate number for b.
in sum,for their original interpretations,the parties agreed that the a sum was equal to 
with x representing the number of tribes that should be multiplied by in order to aggregate b.
the value of number of tribes that should be multiplied by in order to aggregate b is where california and colusa parted ways.california claimed x should be,because tribes operated fewer than gaming devices,but more than zero,as of september,it argued that a tribe can not be authorized to operate zero gaming machines,and so the tribes operating zero machines should not be counted.california maintained the license pool therefore contained 
x licenses 
colusa disagreed,and contended in its original summary judgment filing that x equaled,because reflected those california tribes that operated fewer than devices on september,including those operating zero colusa claimed that the plain meaning of operate under would cover those tribes operating no devices,as well as those operating between zero and devices.according to colusa,the license pool contained 
x licenses 
b.the district court adoption of colusa alternative formulation 
in a footnote in its original summary judgment filing,and expanded on in its reply brief,at argument,and through supplemental briefing,colusa introduced another interpretation of the license pool provisions,which the district court termed the alternative formulation.the alternative formulation employs the same interpretation of step.but step identifies whether each compact tribe,treated as an individual compact tribe,would have the limit on permissible unlicensed devices set by a or set by b.aggregate numbers are separately calculated for a and b based on those individual limits.the lesser of these two aggregate numbers is then employed in step as the lesser number authorized under section.
applied,the alternative formulation under step proceeds as follows.
section a aggregated.the compact tribes operating more than devices operated devices in total.
section b aggregated.there were compact tribes operating fewer than devices,the maximum unlicensed devices permitted each,including those tribes operating zero.x.
is less than,so is the lesser number authorized under section.
the difference between and the lesser number authorized under section licenses 
thus,the license pool under the alternative formulation contains licenses 
to begin,the district court acknowledged that t he parties do not dispute that the meaning of a is unclear and susceptible to varying interpretations.before interpreting the license pool provisions as a matter of law,the court concluded that the parties extrinsic evidence shed no light on their mutual intention at the time of contracting.the court was also influenced by its observation that the original formulations of both parties forced a strained reading of the compact language.in interpreting an ambiguous term as a matter of law,the court stated its obligation as provid ing an interpretation that will make an agreement lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect.badie bank of.the court then concluded the alternative formulation reflected these necessary qualities,and that of the three interpretations offered the alternative formulation most accurately follows the language of.a,giving the words their ordinary meaning.the conclusion that licenses are available in the pool provided the court basis for ordering a new license draw,which took place in october.
ii.de novo review of the license pool provisions 
on de novo review,we agree with the district court that the license pool provisions are ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.cellular inv.gte mobilnet,cir we also review de novo the determinations of whether contract language is ambiguous,tyler cuomo,cir,and w hether the written contract is reasonably susceptible of a proffered meaning.brinderson newberg joint venture pac.erectors,cir.that the parties and the district court each,in good faith,divine multiple results from the same formula underscores this ambiguity.for example,the opaque language of the provisions permits more than one interpretation of how the word authorized should be understood when interpreting in the context of the a sum.the fact that the term authorized is not used in the text of only exacerbates the ambiguity.
given this ambiguity,we are permitted to consider extrinsic evidence when interpreting the compact as a matter of law if the language of the provisions is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation of the party proffering the evidence.see in re bennett,cir.we use a process to determine whether extrinsic evidence passes the reasonable susceptibility barrier.the district court summarized the process in its summary judgment order 
first,the court considers,without admitting,credible evidence concerning the parties intentions to determine whether the language is reasonably susceptible to a party interpretation.winet price.second,if the language is reasonably susceptible to the party interpretation,the extrinsic evidence is admitted to aid interpreting the contract.id.citing blumenfeld macy,d.ambiguities in a written instrument are resolved against the drafter.slottow am.cas,cir.if the language at issue is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party,extrinsic evidence should not be considered.id.
although we ultimately decline to consider the extrinsic evidence,in light of the parties extensive briefing on the issue,we first address our rationale on this point before turning to interpretation of the compact.
a.the parties extrinsic evidence 
california offers extrinsic evidence to support its view that the parties mutual intention was the compact would authorize no more than approximately devices in the license pool,because the parties agreed on a statewide cap of approximately devices total the difficulty with this evidence,as we explain below,is that the foundation for this number is at odds with the plain language of the contract and with an interpretation of part of the formula that is now agreed upon by both parties.
colusa offers extrinsic evidence to counter california position and demonstrate that the compact tribes never intended that the license pool would be limited to based on a statewide cap of around.colusa claims that the tribes originally believed the license pool would,in fact,be around devices,not including the devices already in use 
use of the parties extrinsic evidence 
the district court admitted the parties extrinsic evidence,but then concluded that the parties submissions were ultimately to no avail,because the circumstances under which the compact was entered into do not aid the court in discerning the parties intentions as the submissions of the parties reveal that there was no clear consensus between the parties regarding the maximum number of gaming devices allowed under the compact at the time the agreements were executed.
california contends on appeal that the district court erred in admitting the extrinsic evidence because the credibility of the conflicting evidence should have been tested by the jury.according to california,the district court erred by skipping that step and interpreting the contract as a matter of law.
california is correct that when there is a material conflict in extrinsic evidence supporting competing interpretations of ambiguous contract language the court may not use the evidence to interpret the contract as a matter of law,but must instead render the evidence to the factfinder for evaluation of its credibility.see city of hope med.ctr.genentech,cal interpretation of a written instrument becomes solely a judicial function only when it is based on the words of the instrument alone,when there is no conflict in the extrinsic evidence,or a determination was made based on incompetent evidence.
that general principle comes with a key preliminary caveat the extrinsic evidence must qualify for admission.in this case,we never reach the question of what happens when the court is faced with conflicting admissible extrinsic evidence,because neither california nor colusa evidence qualifies for admission in the first place.if credited,california evidence,drawn heavily from the information sheet,would show that the parties agreed upon a statewide cap of around devices,which would mean the license pool should not exceed around licenses not surprisingly,california briefing glosses over the actual operation of the formula to reach in the license pool and emphasizes instead the ultimate conclusion of the total cap on devices.however,a close read of the extrinsic evidence shows that california rationale underlying its original interpretation does not give effect to the definitions in the compact or to all of the language of the formula the language of the formula simply is not susceptible to the interpretation suggested by california the evidence therefore fails at the provisional step of the admission procedure.the test of whether parol evidence is admissible to construe an ambiguity is not whether the language appears to the court to be unambiguous,but whether the evidence presented is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible.winet price.at internal citation omitted.california extrinsic evidence is not relevant because the language of the license pool provisions is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation california proposes.
in briefing before the district court,california proposed a formulation,different from its original interpretation,one that would permit licenses in the pool and around devices statewide california current formulation is the same one adopted by the commission,which selected the formulation as the most reasonable of the interpretations suggested to that point.california acknowledges that there is a gap between the limit on the license pool,allegedly reflecting the parties original intention,and its current conclusion of licenses,although it suggests the numbers are close in theory.california states that the reason for the mismatch is that,after taking control,the commission made a good faith effort to interpret the compact in a way to accommodate the excess licenses issued by sides.unlike the district court,we acknowledge that california later effort through the commission to accommodate the licenses issued by sides is not the benchmark for the state original intention under the compact however,that acknowledgment does not provide an alternative entree for california extrinsic evidence.california continues to urge an application of the compact that results in a license pool of devices,but is not able to demonstrate a connection between its extrinsic evidence regarding original intention and that interpretation.further,the language of the license pool provisions is not reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that would produce a license pool of devices.
colusa extrinsic evidence suffers from the same infirmity as that of california.the tribe evidence tends to show that the compact tribes believed the license pool included around licenses.colusa offers no connection between this extrinsic evidence regarding its initial intentions and the alternative formulation it now supports,which concludes that only licenses are available in the pool.like california proffer,colusa evidence may not be admitted to construe the license pool provisions.
it is solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of the extrinsic evidence.parsons bristol dev,cal.california and colusa,however,have not provided credible evidentiary support for their interpretations of the disputed provisions.even if we indulge in every reasonable inference that can be drawn from this evidence,the issue of the interpretation of the license pool provisions can not be reasonably construed as turning on the credibility of such insubstantial evidence.new haven unified sch.dist.taco bell,concluding that,although defendant introduced extrinsic evidence,it was of marginal relevance,and therefore the appellate court should retain interpretation as a judicial function.
in union fire ins.of pittsburgh,argonaut ins,cir,we concluded that summary judgment on an ambiguous insurance contract claim was permissible under california law when there was a lack of evidentiary support for competing interpretations of the contract language.that reasoning applies equally here,when considering california argument 
while offering nothing to support the interpretation it urges,california contends that once the district court determines that a contract is reasonably susceptible to more than one reading,as its findings suggest here,it can not resolve a dispute over the proper interpretation of the contract on a summary judgment motion the rationale for the proposition is simple ambiguity in a contract raises a question of intent,which is a question of fact precluding summary judgment.
the usual statement of the rule,however,assumes there is at least some evidentiary support for competing interpretations of the contract language.california can not rely on the mere possibility of a factual dispute as to intent to avert summary judgment.nor can it expect the district court to draw inferences favorable to it when they are wholly unsupported.
because the extrinsic evidence submitted by both parties is inadmissible,no genuine issue of material fact precluded the district court from interpreting the ambiguous license pool provisions as a matter of law or precludes us from doing the same.we turn to that challenge now.
interpretation of the license pool provisions 
we have the task of interpreting the ambiguous license pool provisions as a matter of law without the help of extrinsic evidence to support the proposed formulations but we are not left to do so on a blank slate.the language of the license pool with the backdrop of the compact,common sense,and an eye toward mathematical us to interpret the provisions in a manner that gives meaning to all of the terms.the district court concluded that neither of the parties offerings provided an acceptable interpretation of the license pool provisions.we agree that those interpretations are not reasonable.for example,the original interpretations appear to ignore the language of step of the a sum that requires finding the difference between and the lesser number authorized under.
nor does the alternative formulation,adopted by the district court,provide a viable choice.the alternative approach treats the difference between and language of step as an afterthought in the aggregation process,to be subtracted from whichever aggregate number is deemed the lesser number authorized under section.yet it is not a natural reading of.a that only half of step was designed to aggregate,and the other half was intended merely to make a minor adjustment.a more reasonable reading of step,one that would give meaning to the difference between and language,includes both elements in the aggregation process.
concluding the alternative formulation is unsatisfactory,we turn a fresh eye to the meaning of the.a sum.to reiterate,the a sum sets the number of machines that all compact tribes in the aggregate may license pursuant to this section.in other words,the sum calculates the size of the license pool.
because step is undisputed,we turn to step,which requires calculating the difference between and the lesser number authorized under section.a reasonable reading of step within a is that it contemplates application of step to all compact tribes in order to calculate how many machines all compact tribes in the aggregate may licence.if all of step is not applied,then part of the step language is left hanging as surplusage or an afterthought.if step is not applied to each compact tribe,then the aggregation is incomplete.therefore,to give step meaning and consistent application,it makes sense to apply all of step to each compact tribe in order to create an aggregate number.
standing on its own,is written so as to apply to a single compact tribe,and sets the number of devices the tribe may operate without securing licences.it states a tribe may operate no more gaming devices than the larger of the following two options.accordingly,calculates two numbers for each compact tribe.the tribe may operate either the smaller or the larger number of devices calculated in a and b without securing licenses.stated another way,the tribe is authorized under section to operate either number of devices.of course,within the context of setting individual limits,the larger of these two numbers would be the pertinent number for the individual tribe,as that sets the limit of free pass devices.
step of the a sum references the same numbers calculated under on its own.however,under step the key number is the smaller number calculated for each tribe,the lesser number authorized under section.a emphasis added.step the difference between and the lesser number authorized under section is accomplished by individually identifying the two numbers for each compact tribe,selecting the smaller,and finding the difference from.colusa serves as an example 
colusa operated devices as of september.
therefore,without securing any licenses from the pool,colusa could operate devices under a or devices under b.
the lesser number authorized is.
the difference between and.
for colusa,is the step number that would be included in the aggregate.
simple math allows us to save time by grouping similar compact tribes according to how many devices they operated as of september,and using the same basic steps.we can then add the group totals to reach the same overall total for step that would result from aggregating individual calculations.the aggregate calculation would go as follows 
group compact tribes that operated more than devices as of september,tribes.
the lesser number for each such tribe is.
the difference between and the lesser number is.
group compact tribes that operated between and devices as of september,tribes.
because the number of devices operated will always be less than,the lesser number authorized for each group tribe will be identified by a.
the group tribes were operating devices in total.and,because we are aggregating,we do not have to identify the individual numbers operated.
the aggregate of the difference between and the lesser number authorized for each of these tribes is times,minus the total devices in operation by group tribes.
group compact tribes that operated zero devices as of september,tribes.a reasonable reading of the license pool provisions contemplates including these tribes in the aggregation process.this interpretation accounts for all compact tribes,in conformance with a purpose of establishing the aggregate limit for licenses available for all compact tribes.it also better reflects how an individual compact tribe that operated no devices is covered by standing on its own,and reasonably retains that coverage when applying within the context of a.
for each group tribe,will always be the lesser number authorized under,as it is less than.
the difference between and is.x.
to complete step,we add the results of each of the component calculations 
to solve the entire a sum,we then add step and step to produce,the number of machines that all compact tribes in the aggregate may license pursuant to a 
we conclude that this interpretation,specifically that licenses were authorized for distribution statewide through the license draw process,serves to make the license pool provisions lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect.badie.at.it deserves observation that,although we select a slightly different route than the district court,our ultimate conclusion regarding the size of the license pool differs from that reached by the district court by only about licenses.
iii.remedy of a license draw open to all eligible compact tribes 
on summary judgment,the district court concluded that the size of the license pool was licenses.based on this conclusion,the court determined that licenses remained in the license pool beyond the licenses california claimed were authorized.colusa requested the district court to order a draw for all compact tribes to distribute the additional licenses and the district court ordered that within days california conduct a draw of all available gaming device licenses,in accordance with the court april,order,and in which all eligible compact tribes may participate.california conducted a draw in october,following an unsuccessful motion in this court to stay the order.in that draw,licenses were requested by ten interested compact tribes,including colusa and picayune,and all requested licenses were issued.
california contends that the district court did not have the discretion to order a draw open to all eligible compact tribes,claiming the draw would impermissibly extend relief to.we review the district court choice of remedy for abuse of discretion.united states alisal water,cir.
it is worthwhile to recap the license draw scheme created by the compact to provide context for reviewing the district court remedy.the compact between california and colusa creates the right for colusa to draw from a pool of gaming device licenses that are available to all compact tribes.the tribe,along with all other compact tribes,may acquire licenses to use gaming devices in excess of the number they are authorized to use under,but in no event may the tribe operate more than gaming devices a.the compacts executed by the tribes that are not parties to this suit all include an identical right to draw from that same license pool.see,picayune compact,a.the colusa compact and the other compacts set out identical instructions for how the series of license draws must be administered.a see,picayune compact a.once a round of draws is announced,any interested compact tribe may request licenses from the pool.the requesting tribe will then be placed into a priority tier for distribution,depending on how many devices the tribe currently operates.a.that priority tier governs the maximum licenses the compact tribe may request for that round.a i v.the licenses are allocated according to the priority tiers.a.rounds are to continue until tribes stop making draws,and to resume again once a tribe requests additional licenses.a vi.
the colusa compact does not provide for a draw process for select tribes rather than for all interested compact tribes that are eligible to apply for additional licenses.see a.neither do any of the other compacts.see,picayune compact a.this circumstance is no surprise,as common sense dictates a closed draw may not be conducted under the scheme created by the compacts.the license pool operates to distribute the available licenses among all of the california tribes that took the step of entering compacts and were not already operating devices,the maximum number permitted.one purpose of the elaborate priority tier system was to skew distribution of new machines to those tribes that did not already conduct extensive gaming operations.allowing a limited draw would permanently undermine the intended distribution process,as it would use up a portion of the license pool only for the benefit of a subset of the compact tribes.because a cap is set on the license pool,licenses siphoned off for a limited draw could not be recouped later.
colusa claims injury based on the denial of licenses in earlier draws.to be effective,any remedy must allow colusa the opportunity to apply for some of the licenses remaining in the pool.the district court ordered the only effective remedy derived from the colusa open draw of available did not abuse its discretion by turning to the process for management of the license pool agreed upon by both california and colusa.indeed,the district court demonstrated prudence by mirroring its relief on a system agreed upon by the participants in the compacts,instead of crafting relief that may have had adverse effects on compact tribes 
although california argues it was improper to afford relief that benefits compact tribes,an exception to the requirement of limiting relief to the parties applies when effective relief is otherwise unavailable.see bresgal brock,cir a n injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit or protection to persons other than the prevailing parties in the if it is not a class such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.see also,easyriders freedom hannigan,cir upholding injunction from enforcing helmet law without reasonable suspicion against all motorcyclists,instead of against just fourteen individual plaintiffs,since california highway patrol policy is set on statewide level,and so in practical terms it is unlikely to expect officers would inquire whether an individual was one of t
