in march,frank iacaboni pleaded guilty to charges arising out of his operation of an illegal gambling business.he appeals the district court subsequent forfeiture order,contending that the court erred in its determination that should be forfeited.concluding that the district court reasoning is sound as to the bulk of the award,we affirm in part,but reverse and remand as to one category of funds included in the forfeiture.
factual and procedural background 
from through march,iacaboni conducted an illegal sports gambling operation in and around leominster,massachusetts.iacaboni business included a few different offices headed by individuals hired to take bets from gamblers over the telephone.iacaboni also ran a football ticket business bettors paid between and per ticket,a card on which they checked off four or more predictions in dozens of upcoming games.
in may,a grand jury indicted iacaboni on charges of conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business count i,operating an illegal gambling business count ii,conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business involving interstate travel count iii,conspiracy to launder money from to march count iv,h and money laundering on december,count v,a a i.the indictment also included forfeiture allegations seeking any property,real or personal,involved in iacaboni violations of.a.at his arraignment,iacaboni entered a plea of not guilty on all charges.
on march,iacaboni changed his plea to guilty on counts i through iv of the indictment,and the government agreed to dismiss count iacaboni also pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with money laundering in violation of a b i in connection with the december,transaction that had been the subject of count 
in april,the court held a bench trial on the forfeiture allegations.the government presented the testimony of two of iacaboni employees,robert bolaski and ryan gallagher.they described their duties,the size of their typical client roster to for bolaski,and to for gallagher,and their weekly salaries ranging from to.bolaski estimated that iacaboni business might owe approximately to to winning bettors during a bad week,and expect to collect to from losing bettors during a good week.gallagher testified that his office paid out an average of approximately per week to winning bettors over the course of a football season.both bolaski and gallagher testified that the volume of betting varied.
larry landman,one of iacaboni bettors,also testified at trial.he testified that he bet every weekend during football season,and that occasionally when he owed money to iacaboni,he would send personal checks made out to the defendant he sometimes made the notation personal loan on the checks,a practice that was his own idea,not one suggested by iacaboni.iacaboni deposited landman checks into his personal account.the government presented evidence of nineteen checks given to iacaboni by landman,only nine of which were relevant to the forfeiture analysis because of the applicable statute of limitations.these nine checks,deposited between may and december,totaled 
the court also heard testimony from robert davies,an agent of iacaboni,and tina leclair,iacaboni former girlfriend.these witnesses,along with bolaski,described the operation of the football ticket business,including how bets were placed and winnings distributed.
in june,iacaboni was sentenced to ten months in custody,a fine of,and three years supervised release.the district court heard argument on the forfeiture allegations soon thereafter.in august,the district court ordered iacaboni to forfeit pursuant to a.this amount included in funds paid to winning bettors over the and football seasons in funds paid to winning football ticket bettors representing funds involved in the december,transaction in checks from landman in salaries and in phone expenses the district court declined to order that iacaboni forfeit his residence in leominster,a penalty sought by the government this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
iacaboni contends that the district court erred in its determination of the amount to be forfeited because the payouts to winning bettors were integral to the illegal gambling business and therefore could not be considered property involved in money laundering there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that was paid out to bettors and the landman checks were not property involved in money laundering.
payments to winning bettors 
we review de novo the district court determination of what constitutes forfeitable proceeds under a a i.the court found that,an amount representing payments to winning bettors,should be forfeited the statute provides 
a whoever,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity 
a i with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity 
shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction,whichever is greater.
looking to the language of the statute,we first consider whether the payments to winning bettors constituted financial transactions involving the proceeds of illegal gambling,a specified unlawful activity.id.a.the district court concluded that this portion of the statute had been satisfied,noting the breadth of the terms financial transaction and proceeds.iacaboni,d at.
iacaboni does not contest his participation in financial transactions,but he does argue that proceeds refers to net income of the illegal gambling operation,not payouts,citing united states scialabba,cir,cert.denied,d.there,the seventh circuit held that money paid to winning players in an illegal video poker scheme could not be considered proceeds,defining proceeds as net profits.we have previously rejected iacaboni interpretation of the term proceeds in the rico forfeiture context.see united states hurley,cir quoting legislative history of rico forfeiture provisions for the proposition that the term proceeds has been used in lieu of the term profits in order to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net profits.iacaboni has offered no rationale for abandoning that approach here.
concluding that iacaboni financial transactions involved proceeds within the meaning of a,we turn to whether the transactions were intended to promote the gambling operation.iacaboni asserts that payments to winning bettors can not be considered promotion because these payments were an integral part of the illegal gambling business.defining payouts as promotion,iacaboni contends,is an impermissible alternative punishment for operating a gambling business.he argues for an interpretation of the statute that would require an additional promotional step beyond the mere operation of the illegal venture.
in addressing this argument,the district court opined that the payouts were not typical examples of promotion money laundering such as the plowing back or reinvestment of criminal proceeds through the payment of business expenses,see frederic williams,frank whitney,federal money laundering crimes and forfeitures.but the court nevertheless concluded that the transactions fell within the reach of a a i,in part because n othing makes an illegal gambling operation flourish more than the prompt payment of winners,id.at citing united states febus,cir,and in part because it was not fundamentally unfair to view as money laundering the conduct of defendant that took the proceeds of his illegal business and used them to increase the popularity and viability of his criminal operation by paying his winners.id.
we agree with the district court,and affirm on the grounds set forth in its opinion,as well as the following considerations.crimes such as the operation of an illegal gambling ring create huge sums of cash,the use or disposition of which can prove problematic for illegal gambling operators who wish to stay beneath the radar of law enforcement agencies.depositing the funds with a financial institution can trigger currency transaction rep
