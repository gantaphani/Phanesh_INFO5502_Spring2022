discussion 
barona concedes that,as the applicant,it bore the initial burden of proof regarding its eligibility for the license however,it contends that because the department granted it an interim license,the burden shifted to the protestants.
we have no need to review the department factual findings rather,we review whether,based on the whole record,the department proceeded in the manner required by law.department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.th,d bus.and.a different set of principles governs our review of administrative action to the extent that it consists of declarations or applications of legal rules or is the statement of the conclusions of law which are drawn from facts found in an adjudicatory proceeding.boreta enterprises department of alcoholic beverage control cal d.more frequently,we have articulated this concept in terms of a scope of review which insures that the discretion vested in the department over the licensing process will not be abused.the cases have phrased this standard in varying formulations but the basic idea,a judicially established limit to the admittedly broad power to the department,has remained constant.ibid.
when we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action,the touchstone of our inquiry is,of course,the statute.schaffer weast,d.here,the governing statutory scheme is the adjudication provisions of the administrative procedure act,et specifically,government code section states,a hearing to determine whether a right,authority,license,or privilege should be granted,issued,or renewed shall be initiated by filing a statement of issues.the statement of issues shall be a written statement specifying the statutes and rules with which the respondent must show compliance by producing proof at the hearing and,in addition,any particular matters that have come to the attention of the initiating party and that would authorize a denial of the agency action sought.emphasis added.in turn,government code section defines the term respondent as any person against whom an accusation is filed pursuant to section or against whom a statement of issues is filed pursuant to section.
barona was the respondent against whom a statement of issues was filed therefore,it was required to bear the burden of proof at the hearing regarding the issues raised.however,the alj declined to enforce this requirement and instead ruled i n a protest matter,as far as i interpret the law,the burden of going forward with the evidence rests with the protestants to establish that the grounds set forth in the protest are true and constitute grounds for denial of the license.
we reject the claim by barona and the department that the grant of a conditional license to barona meant the burden shifted to the protestants because barona had made a prima facie case it had good cause to obtain the license.although at oral argument they purported to find support for this claim in business and professions code section,sub.b,they
