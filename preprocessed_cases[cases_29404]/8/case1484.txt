the district court batts,issued a permanent injunction pursuant to the provision of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,et seq,prohibiting the city from restricting church use of its facility for private,catered events.in so doing,it held that the city allows secular institutions in the church neighborhood to conduct the same types of events.the city urges us to dissolve the injunction because,it claims,the church and the secular institutions are not similarly situated.finding that the formal differences the city asserts can not protect its course of conduct and that the institutions are similarly situated for all functional intents and purposes relevant here,we disagree with the city and affirm.
background 
in the winter of,the third church of christ,scientist the church,located at the corner of park avenue and street in manhattan,began to look for ways to renovate its building and keep it in useable condition.deciding that the small congregation could not raise the millions of dollars necessary on its own,the church decided to contract with a catering company,the rose group.under their agreement,the rose group would pay for the capital improvements to the building and for ongoing operating expenses.in exchange,it would receive the right to hold private functions in the church building.prior to completing this agreement,the church sought permission in the form of an from the manhattan borough commissioner of the department of buildings dob.upon obtaining this initial permission in june,the parties executed the contract,and the rose group began making the renovations and booking engagements.by early,and before neighbor began complaining,the rose group had invested substantial sums in the construction,which was well under way.
in,after receiving complaints from some of the church neighbors to which the church responded,the dob issued a notice of intent to revoke the previously given permit.that notice stated that the catering establishment is not an accessory use because it appears to be a principal commercial establishment at the premises.letter from phyllis arnold,deputy comm r,legal affairs and chief code counsel,dep t of,to fulton macdonald,third church of christ,scientist,intent to revoke.it gave the church days to submit evidence to the contrary,and decreed that in no event would dob allow catered events at the church after april.id.on november,dob issued a final revocation of the june permit.
the church immediately sued the city under rluipa provision,which prohibits a government from impos ing or implement ing a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.b.to show unequal treatment,the church presented evidence of secular institutions in the area offering similar catering and event services.its two key comparators were the beekman apartment building and the regency hotel the hotels,both of which are located in the same area and operate restaurants and event facilities in ways that allegedly were in violation of their certificates of occupancy.see dep t of,certificate of occupancy coo for the regency hotel,noting catering exclusively for the hotel residents and guests of the residents dep t of,certificate of occupancy coo for the beekman,noting catering exclusively for the hotel residents and guests of residents only.
following an initial hearing,the district court issued a temporary restraining order on.this prevented the city from enforcing dob revocation of the permit and thereby allowed the rose group to continue holding catered events at the church.the parties conducted discovery and submitted additional briefing.at oral argument before the district court in november the city for the first time asserted that it had issued notices of violation novs to the beekman and regency for operating outside their coos.the court concluded that a nov,which does no more than start an administrative process the outcome of which is uncertain,is a very different type of sanction from the revocation of an permit,such as that to which the church was subjected.accordingly,on,it imposed a permanent injunction barring the city from revoking the church permit as a violation of rluipa.third church of christ,scientist,of city of new york,d.the city timely appealed.
discussion 
we review the issuance of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.reynolds giuliani,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or render s a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the city argues that the district court erred both by treating the hotels as valid secular comparators to the church and by determining that the hotels had been treated differently.
determining whether a municipality has treated a religious entity on less than equal terms requires a comparison between that religious entity and a secular one.we have yet to decide the precise outlines of what it takes to be a valid comparator under rluipa provision,but three of our sister circuits have done so and have come to essentially the same result.
the eleventh circuit,in konikov orange county,cir,explained that a secular comparator in an challenge should be selected by looking at the evidence considered by the governmental body imposing the restriction to ascertain the criteria it used in making its determination and then identifying a secular organization meeting those same criteria.in most zoning cases,because the government focus is on the impact of the land use,the court should look for an organization having comparable community impact as the religious group.id.in konikov,the court compared a rabbi use of his home for prayer meetings,which the county wanted to prohibit,with a cub scout troop holding meetings of a similar size and frequency,which the county admitted it would allow.id.at.because both meetings would impact the community similarly,the county treatment of the rabbi violated rluipa.id.at.
along a similar line,though in evaluating a facial challenge,the third circuit held that the proper analysis focuses on the impact of the allowed and forbidden uses in light of the purpose of the regulation.lighthouse inst.for evangelism,city of long branch,cir.in lighthouse,the court examined two city zoning schemes,each of which was used by the city to deny the church a permit to use its property for religious meetings.the court struck down the use of the older of the two schemes because the ordinance aims were not well documented and it was unclear from the face of the rule how a church would cause greater harm to regulatory objectives than an assembly hall,which was permitted.id.at.the court,however,allowed the city to restrict the church use under the newer plan,which had been enacted to achieve redevelopment of the area and create a vibrant and vital downtown district,because state law prohibited the issuance of liquor licenses near houses of worship,so if churches were allowed in the area,the desired mix of retail and nightlife would become impossible to achieve.id.at internal quotations omitted.
finally,the seventh circuit,in a recent en banc ruling addressing a facial challenge,adapted the third circuit test,shifting the focus slightly from the government subjective purpose in enacting the zoning law to the law stated regulatory criteria,which it deemed more objective.river of life kingdom ministries village of hazel crest,cir en banc.the court then upheld a zoning ordinance that prohibited all noncommercial uses,including churches as well as secular assemblies like exhibition halls,clubs,and homeless shelters,because it found that the ordinance use reasonable and that it applied equally both to religious and to secular groups.id.at.
the differences in the mechanism for selecting an appropriate secular comparator that these cases present need not concern us today.though the church raises interesting questions about whether the city apparent criterion for determ
