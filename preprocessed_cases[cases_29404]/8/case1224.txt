in this case,the state of new york the state sued under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of,et cercla,to recover certain costs incurred in investigating and addressing groundwater contamination in the town of hempstead the town in nassau county,caused by pollution emanating from the new cassel industrial area the ncia.
the district court feuerstein,adopting a report and recommendation of the magistrate judge orenstein,granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action as.the district court held that the state claims were barred by the statute of limitations governing suits to recover costs for remedial actions that is,measures to permanently remediate hazardous wastes set forth in g b.that statute of limitations is triggered by the commencement of cleanup construction,and as the district court found that construction began more than six years before suit was brought,the district court held the action was.
the state argues that the cleanup activities in question are removal actions that is,measures taken to address immediate threats to public health and that suits to recover costs for removal actions are governed by the statute of limitations set forth in g a,which is triggered by the completion of the removal action.the state contends that because the removal measures here had not been completed when this action was brought,the statute of limitations had not yet begun to run.
we agree that the state action is timely.we hold that the cleanup activities here were implemented as removal measures and continued to be removal measures at all relevant times.accordingly,the district court erred in applying the statute of limitations for remedial rather than removal actions,and we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
statement of the case 
a.the contamination and investigation 
the ncia,a acre site in north hempstead,new york,sits on top of a sole source in which groundwater flows approximately to feet below the ground surface.in the early,the ncia was home to a variety of light industries.a number of these industries were involved in activities that produced volatile organic compounds vocs,which eventually found their way into the groundwater 
in,the nassau county department of health the county health department uncovered groundwater contamination at the ncia.as a consequence,in the new york state department of environmental conservation the dec listed the ncia as a class site on the state registry of hazardous waste sites 
in,the town detected vocs in two of its water supply wells at levels approaching new york state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water these wells were located in the bowling green estates water district and were approximately feet from the ncia in the direction of the flow of groundwater.the town hired dvirka and bartilucci d b,an engineering firm,to investigate.in november,d b confirmed the presence of vocs in the water,including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene,likely carcinogens,and recommended the installation of a granulated activated carbon adsorption system the gac to remove the vocs.a gac eliminates contaminants by pumping untreated water from the wells through carbon units and discharging the water into a groundwater storage reservoir.as the carbon bed reaches its useful adsorption capacity,however,its effectiveness diminishes considerably.
in the fall of,the town bought and installed a gac at the site of the two wells.on june,the county health department approved the gac for full operation.the gac commenced operations,and it has remained in operation since.
the air stripper tower 
from december,through may,the town found that rising concentrations of vocs had markedly increased the cost of running the gac system.as hempstead water commissioner daniel davis commissioner davis explained 
during this period from december through may,i became concerned that the increasing concentrations of vocs would soon render the gac treatment system ineffective and too costly or impractical to operate.my concerns led me to consider supplementing the gac treatment system in order to improve efficiency and lower the costs of operation.
davis decl.commissioner davis asked d b to recommend a system to supplement the gac.in may,d b proposed an air stripper tower a packed tower aeration system.the air stripper tower,which rests on a large concrete slab,treats the water before it is collected in a clearwell and then pumps the water to the gac.
on june and,the town took exploratory soil borings to determine whether the soil could bear the weight of an tower.the town awarded the contract to construct the air stripper tower in july.construction began in july and was completed in.the air tower commenced operations,and it has remained in operation since.
the dec investigation 
the dec began its remedial investigation of the ncia in,and thereafter it sampled groundwater monitoring wells between and,installed four early warning groundwater wells in,and collected soil and groundwater samples in and.
on may,the dec and the new york state department of health the state health department held a public meeting in hempstead to address the groundwater contamination.based on discussions at that meeting,the town began to suspect the ncia was the source of the groundwater contamination.
on may,the town followed up with a letter to the dec expressing concern about the substantial increase in the levels of contamination in the wells since requesting consideration for funding for treatment under the new york state superfund program requesting a full,immediate and intensive investigation by the dec to determine who all the polluters are so that they will be held accountable for their actions and declining to seek compensation for the gac system already in place.
in,engineers hired by the dec confirmed the existence of three voc plumes migrating underground from the ncia towards the town.in september,the dec issued its final remedial study report.the report divided the remedial strategy into three parts,and separated the ncia into three corresponding operable units addressing contamination within the ncia,contaminated groundwater directly beneath the ncia,and the migration of voc plumes from the ncia offsite.
in october,the dec issued the final record of decision rod selecting a permanent remedy to address the pollution at the ncia full plume remediation of upper and deep portions of the aquifer to ft below ground surface with in well vapor vapor treatment.this remedy involved pilot testing,the removal of contaminated soil,the construction of additional vapor stripping wells groundwater circulation wells,as well as the installation of new monitoring wells and a groundwater monitoring program.it also incorporated the existing gac and air stripper tower.the dec estimated the full remediation would cost million and take seven years 
tolling agreements 
the state entered into tolling agreements with a number of potentially responsible parties owners and operators of facilities within the ncia tolling the statute of limitations.the earliest of these agreements came into effect on june.
procedural history 
on march,the state filed this suit against defendants pursuant to section of cercla,which permits recovery of all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government or a state.the state seeks to recover for costs incurred in investigating and responding to the groundwater contamination at the ncia,as well as past,present,and future response costs incurred and to be incurred by the state in responding to releases of hazardous substances.second am.compl,
on september,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r recommending that defendants motion for summary judgment be granted on the grounds that the state claims were barred by the statute of limitations.state of new york next millenium realty,llc,no.cv,wl.the district court adopted the r r in its entirety by order dated november.
the district court concluded that the gac and the air stripper actions were remedial and that the actions were attributable to the state.it held that the state claims were subject to the statute of limitations for remedial actions,which bars claims filed more than six years after commencement of construction.the district court then concluded that the statute had begun to run either when the gac was installed in,or when three foundational borings for the air stripper were drilled on june and.next millenium,wl,at.because the earliest tolling agreement did not come into effect until june,more than six years after construction commenced on june,the district court ruled the state suit,filed on march,was.id.at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
congress created cercla to address hazardous waste spills by authorizing the united states and the states to commence cleanup with public money and then to seek the recovery of costs from polluters.a a.congress deliberately structured this regime to allow federal and state governments to respond to spills immediately while leaving the determination of liability and financial responsibility for later.see,new york shore realty,cir epa can sue for reimbursement of cleanup costs from any responsible parties it can locate,allowing the federal government to respond immediately while later trying to shift financial responsibility to others.citation omitted.
we have construed cercla liberally to advance the dual goals of cleaning up hazardous waste and holding polluters responsible for their actions.see goodrich murtha,cir because it is a remedial statute,cercla must be construed liberally to effectuate its two primary goals enabling the epa to respond efficiently and expeditiously to toxic spills,and holding those parties responsible for the releases liable for the costs of the cleanup.prisco v.a d carting,cir as a remedial statute,cercla should be construed liberally to give effect to its purposes.quoting goodrich betkoski,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
section of cercla authorizes federal and state governments to recover response costs from potentially responsible parties prps for both removal and remedial actions.a a.removal actions are or removal measures taken to respond to immediate threats to public health and safety.see also minnesota kalman abrams metals,cir removal actions are those taken to counter imminent and substantial threats to public health and welfare united states grace,cir courts have stressed the immediacy of a threat in deciding whether a cleanup is a removal action.collecting cases.accord memorandum from stephen luftig,director,office of emergency and remedial response,use of non time critical removal authority in superfund response actions,to regions i x program and legal division directors,emphasizing immediate nature of removal actions,available at http the epa guidance 
remedial actions are generally actions designed to permanently remediate hazardous waste.see also schaefer town of victor,cir remedial actions are generally or permanent containment or disposal programs quoting shore realty,at internal quotation marks omitted california ex rel.cal.dep t of toxic substances control neville chem,cir remedial actions generally are permanent responses quoting geraghty and miller,conoco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
removal and remedial actions are governed by different statutes of limitations.for removal actions,the government must seek to recoup costs within three years after completion of the removal action.g a.for remedial actions,the government must seek to recoup costs within six years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.g b 
whether a suit to recover response costs under section of cercla is a removal action or a remedial action is a question of law that we review de novo.grace,at whether the cleanup activity was a removal action or,on the other hand,a remedial action in removal action clothing is a question of statutory interpretation and thus,a legal issue that we review as a matter of law.geraghty and miller,at classification of an activity as removal or remedial is determined as a matter of law.likewise,to the extent the resolution of this legal question turns on factual issues,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying principles governing summary judgment motions.lopes dep t of soc,cir.
we hold that,to the extent it concerns the gac and air stripper tower,this suit is a removal action subject to the statute of limitations,which is triggered by the completion of the removal action.because the removal measures can not be deemed to have been completed in any sense before the state adoption of a remediation plan that incorporated them,and this action was commenced within three years of that earliest possible date,the statute of limitations had not run as of the time this action was commenced.hence,we hold that the district court erred in dismissing this action as untimely.
the nature of the cleanup measures 
we hold that the gac and air stripper tower were removal measures,for the following reasons.
first,both systems were installed in response to an imminent public health hazard,a defining characteristic of removal actions.see kalman abrams metals,at grace,at collecting cases.the contamination in hempstead drinking water posed an immediate threat.as the engineering firm d b recognized in its november report 
wells and at the iris place pump station have volatile organic compound voc concentrations approaching current new york state maximum contaminant levels for potable water.the wells are critical to the operation of the bowling green water district consequently,immediate action is required to ensure that the wells remain operational at all times.
aff.of daniel davis,ex.at emphasis added.the town installed the gac in response to this impending substantial threat to public health.
similarly,the town constructed the air stripper tower in direct response to rising voc levels that were overwhelming the gac system and diminishing its effectiveness.after commissioner davis grew concerned that the increasing levels of vocs would render the gac treatment system ineffective and too costly or impractical to operate,he issued a directive to carry out design work for the air stripper tower to ensure that the bowling green wells would be capable of supplying adequate quantities of potable water to customers in accordance with the new york state sanitary code.davis decl.there is no question these two measures were taken by the town in response to concerns about the imminent threat to safe drinking water.
second,both the gac and the air stripper tower were designed as measures to address water contamination at the endpoint the wells and not to permanently remediate the problem by prevent ing or minimiz ing the release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate from the underlying source of contamination at the ncia.see grace,at finding cleanup activity to be removal action where it did not fully eliminate the public health threat or amount to a remediation see also city of moses lake united states,d,cleanup action taken by the city at drinking wells to lower tce amounts to below maximum contaminant levels rather than abating the contamination in the aquifer or at the superfund site proper bears all of the hallmarks of a removal action an interim response to minimize and stabilize imminent harms to human health.indeed,at the time the gac and air stripper were built,neither the state nor the town knew the source of the vocs in the drinking water pumped from the wells,and they were responding to a problem,not an environmental cleanup concern.the contaminated water was already in the wells,and the water came out of the wells into the gac and air stripper tower so that the contaminants could be removed from the wells.these were not remedial measures intended to prevent the well water from being contaminated in the first place.
the gac and air stripper tower were implemented as measures to minimize and mitigate the damage from the ncia,rather than to permanently eliminate it.see remedial action defined as those actions consistent with permanent remedy.neither project was designed to remedy the underlying source of the contamination,namely,the hazard
