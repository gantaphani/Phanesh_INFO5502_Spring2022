the present appeal arises from the flouting of a protective order entered in litigation concerning eli lilly drug,zyprexa.david egilman,a plaintiff expert witness and signatory to the protective order,received confidential documents produced by eli lilly.finding much to dislike in the content of those documents,egilman wished to distribute them to the media.not wanting to release the documents to the public in a manner brazenly in disregard of the protective order,he needed a suitably minded individual to act as his partner and to subpoena those documents.egilman contacted new york times reporter alex berenson,who put him in touch with alaska attorney and advocate james gottstein,who readily agreed to help.gottstein,who was not a signatory to the protective order,intervened in an unrelated alaskan guardianship case,which he used to generate subpoenas purporting to require egilman to produce all documents in his possession pertaining to zyprexa.failing to abide by the terms of the protective order,egilman distributed a large volume of documents to gottstein,who in turn copied and forwarded them to a variety of other interested parties.the next day,the times began a series of articles based on the information contained in those documents.
understandably alarmed,eli lilly applied for and received a series of orders culminating in an injunction,which barred gottstein from disseminating the documents and required their return.in re zyprexa injunction,d.gottstein now appeals that injunction,claiming that the district court erred in finding that his issuing subpoenas was part of a sham proceeding,that he aided and abetted the violation of the protective order,that the documents at issue were confidential,that the court could bind him under the protective order and that the court possessed personal jurisdiction to issue the injunction against him.we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects.
background 
approximately schizophrenia patients have taken the drug zyprexa,which some allege has produced negative side effects purportedly known to,but not disclosed by,the drug manufacturer,eli lilly.some lawsuits ensued,which were consolidated pursuant to and assigned to the honorable jack weinstein of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.in re zyprexa prods.liab,d.that court entered a protective order,case management order,which facilitated litigants sharing of confidential discovery.in re zyprexa prods.liab,wl.among other things,allowed attorneys to share confidential documents with experts,required experts to sign an endorsement of protective order and provided a mechanism to dispute whether a document marked confidential had been correctly designated.the protective order contemplated another court subpoenaing produced materials,but required that the designee of the subpoena notify the producing party in writing prior to the production of confidential materials and allow it a reasonable opportunity to object.
at some point during the litigation,one of the plaintiffs firms,the lanier law firm,retained david egilman as a potential expert witness.having first attempted to modify it,egilman signed the endorsement of protective order the firm sent myriad documents produced by eli lilly to egilman so that he could begin preparing his expert testimony.egilman ultimately received some documents and became quite determined to share their contents with the media.he contacted new york times reporter alex berenson and explained his interest.egilman understood that he was subject to,however,and thus required an accomplice to subpoena the documents.berenson put egilman in touch with james gottstein for that very purpose.
gottstein is an alaskan attorney and an advocate for patients rights.after talking to egilman about eli lilly confidential documents and their mutual desire to see those materials disseminated to the public,gottstein intervened in an unrelated case in which the alaskan office of public advocacy had been granted guardianship and the right to make treatment decisions for a patient,william bigley.at that time,gottstein had no idea if the patient had taken zyprexa or if the state would use zyprexa in its treatment of the patient.yet within hours of intervening,he issued a subpoena that purported to compel egilman to produce all documents in his possession relating to that particular drug.despite being addressed to egilman in massachusetts,however,the subpoena issued from the superior court for the state of alaska.gottstein placed the request for documents pertaining to zyprexa in the middle of requests for documents relating to other drugs,none of which he expected egilman to possess.the subpoena,issued on december,called for production of the material by december.
in an effort to comply,however perfunctorily,with,egilman faxed a note and copy of the subpoena to eli lilly corporate general counsel.he did not,however,inform the firm that retained him of the subpoena nor did he apprise eli lilly litigation counsel.nevertheless,the fax was routed internally and,on december,the lanier law firm told egilman not to produce any documents until eli lilly planned motion to quash the subpoena had been ruled upon in the alaskan court.unbeknownst to lanier and eli lilly,however,egilman had already begun to distribute a plethora of documents to gottstein the day before.
this clandestine production of eli lilly documents resulted from gottstein having served an amended subpoena on december,which called for the production of the documents prior to the date and time set for the deposition.this subpoena,again purporting to bind egilman in massachusetts,also issued from the superior court for the state of alaska.in violation of the protective order,egilman informed no one of this second subpoena and began transmitting documents electronically to gottstein on december.gottstein immediately disseminated the documents to a number of associates.
realizing the magnitude of the information breach,eli lilly took the matter to the special master for discovery,peter woodin,who ordered gottstein and egilman to return all material immediately.gottstein refused to acknowledge the special master authority over him,so eli lilly took the matter up with magistrate judge roanne mann,who determined that gottstein had aided and abetted a breach of.eli lilly then took the matter to district judge brian cogan,who was sitting as a judge and who issued a temporary injunction.the mdl court extended judge cogan injunction pending a full hearing on the matter,which it conducted on january and.the mdl court issued an injunction on february,from which gottstein now appeals.
discussion 
i.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it characterized the alaskan subpoenas as a sham and found that gottstein aided and abetted egilman violation of the protective order 
gottstein challenges the district court factual determination that the subpoenas he caused to be served on egilman were a pretense.he also contests the district court closely related finding that he aided and abetted the violation of id.at passim.we review such factual conclusions for abuse of discretion,which may be found where the court,in issuing the injunction,relied on clearly erroneous findings of fact or an error of law.knox salinas,cir see also in re complaint of messina,cir holding that we will overturn the factual findings of the district court only where we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court finding that gottstein conspired with egilman to violate is amply supported by the record.egilman called gottstein on november,explaining that he possessed secret zyprexa documents produced through litigation and that they contained some alarming things in them.he informed gottstein that the documents were under a protective order understanding that egilman would not produce the zyprexa documents except pursuant to a subpoena,gottstein needed to find an appropriate case as a vehicle with which to generate one.gottstein obtained egilman contact information for the subpoena,as well as the latter email and phone number.egilman knew that gottstein intended to distribute the zyprexa documents when he obtained them.
there is therefore no question that gottstein and egilman were in close contact with one another and strategized how best to facilitate the dissemination of documents protected by.the subpoenas served on egilman merely formalized and facilitated what had already been agreed to.they both understood that issuing a subpoena was a necessary ploy for achieving that distribution in a fashion ostensibly consistent with the protective order to which egilman was bound as a signatory.it is therefore unsurprising that the manner in which egilman and gottstein responded to the subpoenas and caused them to issue,respectively,was designed to delay eli lilly learning of them and taking action to prevent production.neither gottstein nor egilman informed eli lilly litigation counsel or the lanier law firm of the first that both knew would have resulted in eli lilly learning of the subpoena existence promptly.nor did either of gottstein and egilman inform anyone else of the second,secret subpoena,which called for earlier production.they hindered eli lilly recognizing the purpose of the subpoenas by burying the request for zyprexa documents in the middle of requests for documents for some other drugs.this is all strong evidence of gottstein and egilman acting in concert.
further evidence of the subpoena being a sham abounds,and this similarly evidences the fact of concert between egilman and gottstein.when introduced to egilman through berenson,gottstein wasted no time in planning an end run around the protective order.he searched for,found and then intervened in a case of state guardianship that was wholly unrelated the zyprexa litigation.gottstein admitted that he had no evidence at the time of causing the subpoenas to be served on egilman that zyprexa was relevant to the case in which he had intervened.on receipt of the material,gottstein quickly disseminated it to a list of recipients without even reviewing it or applying it to his alaskan patient case.it bears noting,too,that the subpoenas duces tecum issued through the alaskan state court were presumably without legal force in massachusetts,where egilman resided and was served this further supports the district court determination that the subpoenas were a sham.
in sum,the record is unequivocal that gottstein schemed with egilman to bypass the protective order and,in fact,aided and abetted the latter violation of the same.it is equally clear that the subpoenas issued to egilman were part of a sham proceeding.the district court did not err,let alone clearly err,in so finding.
faced with these clear facts,gottstein is forced to resort to a variety of unavailing assertions.first he contends that,because at least one of his two purposes was supposedly proper,the district court erred in characterizing the subpoenas as a pretense.he relies on sussman bank of israel,cir and focuses on that court holding that a party should not be penalized for or deterred from seeking warranted judicial relief merely because one of his multiple purposes in seeking that relief may have been improper.id.at.of course,sussman was concerned with the distinct issue of a plaintiff being subject to.sanctions for filing a nonfrivolous complaint pursuant to an improper purpose.id.but even putting this distinction aside,gottstein reliance on sussman necessarily flounders on the fact that he is incapable of demonstrating that any of his purposes in subpoenaing and disseminating eli lilly confidential documents was proper.
gottstein asserts that his dual purposes were to obtain evidence for use in bigley case and other future cases,and to make evidence of suppressed hazards or illegal marketing or other evidence of zyprexa hazards and lilly sic misconduct known to the public.however,the qualitative nature of a purpose can not be divorced from the manner in which it is pursued.even if we were to assume that either of his proffered goals in subpoenaing egilman were otherwise legitimate,the fact of his aiding and abetting the violation of a lawful protective order to achieve that end precludes our finding a proper purpose.gottstein appears to focus on the discrete act of his causing the two subpoenas to issue,essentially asking that we consider those actions divorced from the larger context of which they were a part.yet we have already determined that the district court was on firm ground in finding that gottstein his serving egilman with the two and abetted egilman violation of the protective order.causing a subpoena to be served,with notice that compliance with it by the complicit recipient would violate a court lawful order,can not be characterized as legitimate,even if the improperly obtained documents might otherwise be useful had they been obtained appropriately.ultimately,gottstein nebulous assertion that the subpoenas were somehow grounded in law and fact does not legitimize the manner in which they were employed to facilitate the violation of a court order nor does it take away from their being part of a sham proceeding.
gottstein second argument is no more fruitful.he submits that he acted independently as a lawyer in the interests of his client,which,he contends,precludes any finding that he aided and abetted egilman violation of the protective order.to support this conclusion,gottstein focuses on regal knitwear nlrb,for the proposition that a nonparty who act s independently of a party found in violation of a court order can not be an aider and abettor if the nonparty actions were based on a genuinely independent interest.gottstein contends that he had an interest in the documents that was independent of egilman.of course,the record does not support a finding that gottstein acted independently of egilman,which is the end of the matter.aiding and abetting a party is not acting independently,as gottstein himself admits.we would also point to our prior decision in state org.for women terry,where we held that a court inquiry into the fact of aiding and abetting is directed to the actuality of concert or participation,without regard to the motives that prompt the concert or participation,cir,vacated on other grounds sub,pearson planned parenthood margaret sanger clinic manhattan.
ultimately,the district court finding that gottstein acted in concert with egilman to release the confidential material,and related determination that gottstein aided and abetted egilman violation of,seem to us the only reasonable conclusions in light of the facts in the record.the district court certainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding.
ii.gottstein challenges to the protective order fail 
gottstein challenges the protective order on a number of grounds,all of which fail.he asserts first that the district court erred by assuming inherent authority to use its power to enforce injunctions under rule d to enforce a protective order under rule c instead.we reject this argument by virtue of the obvious fact that the district court did not enforce against order to which gottstein was not privy.gottstein seems to miss the fact that the injunction against which he appeals merely enjoined him from further disseminating the documents produced by eli lilly and company subject to and required him forthwith to return any such documents and copies still in his possession in re zyprexa injunction,d at.it did not purport to bind gottstein to the provisions of the protective order.id.at passim.thus,gottstein assertion that the court enforce d a protective order under rule c against him is wholly mistaken.nor,as gottstein contends,did the court impose liability.the district court made this abundantly clear,observing that this is not a contempt proceeding,and the court is not now punishing anyone for any alleged violation of court orders.rather,this proceeding seeks to prevent irreparable harm to lilly by enjoining those persons whose actions threaten such harm.id.at.
gottstein next argues that the substantive provisions of the protective order were insufficiently detailed,since they did not delineate the acts sought to be restrained and failed t
