this appeal poses a question of first impression.how does a court determine whether a bankruptcy court has a debtor retention of a professional pursuant to a in this case,we find that the bankruptcy court order was a section a,and that no later developments rendered that approval improvident,and therefore affirm the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cedarbaum.
background 
between and,smart world technologies,llc,freewwweb,llc,and smart world communications,collectively,smart world provided free internet service to subscribing customers.when it failed to generate a profit,smart filed for bankruptcy in and agreed to sell its subscriber most valuable juno online services,juno as part of the bankruptcy proceeding.shortly after the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york blackshear,approved the sale of the subscriber list to juno,smart world alleged that juno was undercounting the number of subscribers.
on august,juno filed an adversary complaint seeking declaratory relief that its conduct was proper and its obligation to smart world was limited to paying only for qualified subscribers.in response,smart world bankruptcy counsel began negotiating to retain appellee,the law firm of riker,danzig,scherer,hyland perretti,llp riker danzig,to represent smart world in the juno litigation in an effort to maximize the sale price from juno.these negotiations culminated in a contingency fee proposal memorialized in an october,letter from riker danzig to smart world bankruptcy counsel.smart world then applied to the bankruptcy court for an order approving the retention of riker danzig as special litigation counsel pursuant to and,the sections of the bankruptcy code providing for of compensation for debtors counsel.
in response to several objections to the conditions of the retention,riker danzig agreed to modify the terms at a november,hearing before judge blackshear,informing the court that the amended terms were basically worked out in the hallway before we were called.worldcom,smart world largest creditor,told the court that its initial concern was that because it and other creditors were already involved in settlement negotiations with juno,riker danzig might be positioned to reap a huge windfall if those negotiations culminated in a monetary settlement.however,it explained that the revised contingency fee proposal was a nice compromise because it provided an incentive for all parties to reach a quick resolution.
at the hearing,judge blackshear preliminarily approved this revised proposal orally from the bench,stating that the contingency basically addresses the reasonableness if he willing to take that chance,on success being paid and unsuccess not getting anything,that to me addresses the reasonableness of his fee and i not going to review the time records of the individual merely because of the fact that he agreed to a contingency fee.nonetheless,judge blackshear required riker danzig to submit a written fee application incorporating the modified terms.the following day,november,the terms were documented in a letter from james rothschild,a lawyer at riker danzig,to smart world bankruptcy counsel,the rothschild letter,which read as follows 
this is to confirm the results of the court hearing yesterday wherein my october,letter to you was slightly modified.as per the agreement placed before the honorable cornelius blackshear,riker,danzig,sherer,hyland perretti,llp riker danzig will handle disputes between the debtor and juno online services juno on a contingent fee basis.riker danzig will take the case in consideration of the following payment terms riker danzig will be paid all expenses off of the top any recovery and,after payment of expenses,will receive of the first obtained from juno riker danzig share of funds in excess of but less than million will be a if the litigation lasts less than months,b if the litigation lasts from months to months,c if the litigation lasts between months and months,d if the litigation lasts more than months and riker danzig will receive of all funds received in excess of million.finally,riker danzig fee for any monies received after months shall be.
the following day,november,judge blackshear issued his retention order.although the order did not specifically cite,it authorized smart world to retain riker danzig in connection with the juno litigation and stated that all compensation shall be fixed upon further application of this court and shall be in accordance with the within application and the letter of james rothschild,dated november,and annexed hereto and made a part hereof.
in early,juno informed riker danzig that it had reached a settlement with smart world creditors.however,at a february hearing,the bankruptcy court determined that a settlement had not actually been reached,but was sufficiently close at hand to grant juno request to stay the litigation.that stay remained in place for the next two years.
in may,juno and the creditors filed a joint motion to settle the adversary proceeding under a settlement plan in which juno would pay million to smart world creditors.smart world opposed the settlement,arguing that it had not been able to value its claims against juno without discovery,and that the creditors lacked standing to settle the proceeding over its objection.although the bankruptcy court disagreed and approved the settlement,this court reversed,holding that smart world creditors did not have standing to settle the adversary proceeding over the objections of the.see in re smart world,llc,cir hereinafter,smart world i.
back in bankruptcy court,smart world creditors filed a plan of liquidation,which now included a million settlement with juno.once again,smart riker to the proposed settlement,arguing that it continued to undervalue the claim by undercounting the number of subscribers.the bankruptcy court disagreed and confirmed the plan,including the settlement.
riker danzig then applied for a fee award of plus expenses.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court peck,found that judge blackshear had riker danzig fee pursuant to a,which allows a court to alter a fee only if its terms and conditions prove to have been improvident in light of developments not capable of being anticipated at the time of the fixing of such terms and conditions.a.however,judge peck found four events incapable of being anticipated the divergence of positions between smart world and its creditors the fact that riker danzig took instructions directly from the officers and majority shareholders of smart world the unusually prolonged litigation and the fact that riker danzig was an obstacle,not an asset,to the approval of the settlement.as a result,the bankruptcy court reduced riker danzig award to plus in expenses.
on appeal to the district court,judge cedarbaum reversed in a thorough and thoughtful opinion.see in re smart world,llc,hereinafter,smart world ii.the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the fee agreement was under section,but disagreed that there had been any developments incapable of being anticipated.id.at.the court distinguished between unanticipated events and events not capable of being anticipated,noting that a court may set aside a fee under section a only if the latter occurred.id.at.the court held that divergent litigation positions were to be expected since a debtor and its creditors may very well disagree on matters in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding that the length of the litigation was largely a product of the stay imposed by the court and the successful appeal to the second circuit and that the success of the appeal justified riker danzig litigation strategy.id.at.as a result,the district court reversed and ordered a fee award of and in expenses id.at.
