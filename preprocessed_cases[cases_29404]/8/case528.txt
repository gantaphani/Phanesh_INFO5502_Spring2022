this appeal involves two claims of instructional error and a belated claim of error concerning the procedure to be followed by a trial court under the amendments to federal rule of civil procedure.concluding,as we do,that no substantive or procedural error tainted the challenged jury instructions,we affirm.
background 
we rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this appeal in context.
emilio decaro worked for hasbro,at its plant in longmeadow,massachusetts,for over two decades,most recently as a first pressman.in that capacity,the plaintiff operated printing presses used to embellish thousands of sheets of cardboard and paper hourly.
in,the plaintiff informed hasbro that his doctors had diagnosed him as afflicted with multiple sclerosis.notwithstanding this diagnosis,he valiantly continued to work.by,however,his condition had deteriorated and he began a regimen of chemotherapy.he left work and,in july of that year,applied for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits.
the plaintiff ssdi application has particular pertinence here.in it,he made a series of factual averments touching upon his physical condition,some in his own hand and others in the form of answers provided orally to a government scrivener who typed his responses into the application.these averments the accuracy of which was disputed at trial included claims that the plaintiff was unable to work and descriptions of his particular physical impairments.
the plaintiff attempted to return to work on november.a company nurse dashed his hopes after observing the plaintiff physical appearance,she forbade him from resuming his position without a doctor note.on november,the plaintiff physician wrote a letter opining that the plaintiff should eschew employment until the following february.
on february,the plaintiff again tried to reclaim his job.the company demurred,citing the lack of a contemporaneous medical clearance.this sort of pas de deux occurred at least twice more during the next four months the short of it is that hasbro did not allow the plaintiff to return to work.
disappointed by hasbro unwillingness to restore him to its work force,the plaintiff brought suit against the company in a massachusetts state court.in his complaint,filed on june,he asserted a gallimaufry of discrimination and breach of contract claims,all arising under state law.this asseverational array included claimed violations of massachusetts principal statute massachusetts general laws ch.
hasbro removed the case to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on the basis of diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.see a.following a period of pretrial discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in hasbro favor on the breach of contract claim an jury trial ensued on the discrimination claims.
as the trial wound down,the district court convened a charge conference,see.b,to discuss how the jury was to be instructed.a court reporter attended the charge conference and memorialized what transpired.the court commented upon the parties proposed instructions and indicated generally which instructions it would give and which it would eschew.
among other things,hasbro proposed an instruction concerning both the effect of the statements contained in the plaintiff application for ssdi benefits and his receipt of those benefits.its proposed instruction read in relevant part 
on his application for those benefits decaro represented that he was disabled and unable to work.decaro is bound by his statements on his application for disability and you must presume the truth.
the court noted that it would give an ssdi instruction,but not one that was stated with as much intensity as hasbro suggested instruction.instead,the court planned to say that the jury is entitled to take into consideration the statements made by decaro in his application for ssdi benefits and may find that those statements are evidence that in fact he viewed himself as unable to perform the essential functions of his job.
switching to a different subject,the plaintiff noted conflicting characterizations of the evidence about what hasbro knew anent his disability and whether and when he had requested some sort of accommodation to permit him to work notwithstanding that disability.accordingly,he proposed an instruction relating to an employer duty under massachusetts law to provide a reasonable accommodation,even in the absence of any request that it do so.the court stated that it had read the relevant case law,see,leach comm r of.rehab.comm n,and had concluded that massachusetts law does not impose such an affirmative duty on the employer in the circumstances at hand.
the attorneys for the parties delivered their summations the next day.immediately thereafter,the court charged the jury and simultaneously gave a written copy of the charge to each party.
with respect to the receipt of ssdi benefits and the statements made in the plaintiff application for those benefits,the court instructed 
defendant has pointed to the fact that,while plaintiff was out on voluntary medical leave,plaintiff applied for,and has been continuously receiving,social security disability benefits since november.plaintiff application for those benefits included representations about the physical requirements of the first pressman position and statements about his physical limitations at the time of his application.
you should examine the statements made by plaintiff in the application for social security disability benefits and consider whether these statements constitute admissions by him that he was in fact unable to perform the essential functions of his job,with or without a reasonable accommodation,at the time he completed his social security disability application.a plaintiff is not permitted to say one thing in applying for disability benefits and another thing,entirely the opposite,in seeking damages for discrimination.
in making this examination you should consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the submission of the application.to the extent that you find that statements made in plaintiff application for social security disability benefits were made by plaintiff,you may decide that they reflected the truth when made,and you may consider them as evidence related to decaro ability to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position,with or without accommodation,on the dates he attempted to return to work.
at the same time,keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for social security disability benefits is different from the standard you must apply in determining whether plaintiff was able,with or without reasonable accommodation,to perform the essential functions of his job.the fact that decaro received social security disability benefits is not in itself necessarily fatal to a claim that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job.however,the receipt of benefits and the statements made by plaintiff in applying for them are items of evidence you may consider in making this determination.
with respect to the initiation of a reasonable accommodation,the court instructed 
when a plaintiff in a disability discrimination case contends that he was entitled to a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of his job,he must present evidence to persuade the jury that he actually initiated a request for the accommodation and engaged in an interactive process with the employer to work out the possible accommodation.as part of this process the employer may request medical records and make inquires of the employee about his medical condition.if you find on the facts of this case that plaintiff never requested a specific accommodation,then you can not find that defendant violated plaintiff rights by failing to offer him one.
after completing its charge but before allowing the jury to retire,the court brought counsel to sidebar.of the jury inquired about objections.see.b.the plaintiff attorney objected to the ssdi instruction on two grounds,asserting that the instruction i simply overstates the law in massachusetts and ii should have told the jurors that the receipt of ssdi benefits was not fatal at all to the claims being tried.the lawyer also objected to the accommodation instruction insofar as it obligated the plaintiff,as a condition precedent to recovery,to request a specific accommodation.the district court overruled these objections and sent the jury to the jury room to deliberate.
to assist the jurors in their task,the court gave them a written copy of its charge.it also prepared a special verdict form.see.a.the form,a replica of which is attached hereto as appendix a,posed a series of questions.neither party interposed any objection to either the use or the wording of the special verdict form.the parties thus waived the right to object to these matters on appeal.see clausen,cir la amiga del pueblo,robles,cir.
in due course,the jury concluded its deliberations.the first question on the special verdict form has four,and the jurors answered all four in the negative.these answers memorialized their conclusion that,on the dates in question,the plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of the first pressman position with or without an accommodation.because those answers were dispositive,the accordance with directions contained in the special verdict in favor of hasbro and refrained from answering any other questions set out in the form.
this timely appeal ensued.we have jurisdiction under.
ii.analysis 
we divide our analysis into two segments.the first deals with the objections made at sidebar.the second deals with a newly emergent claim of procedural error.
a.the sidebar objections.
the plaintiff briefs assign error to the overruling of his objections to the ssdi and accommodation instructions.the defendant counters,as a threshold matter,that the plaintiff claims of instructional error have been waived.in its view,the plaintiff failed to comply at sidebar with either rule c,which requires that an objection stat e distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection,or rule d b,which requires that an objection to a failure to instruct be accompanied by a statement of the desired instruction.
the strictures of rule are not to be taken lightly.baron suffolk county sheriff dep t,cir.accordingly,there is a high price to be paid for noncompliance.a substantial failure to comply with those requirements normally results in forfeiture of the objection to which the failure relates.surprenant rivas,cir.forfeited objections are reviewed only for plain error.toscano chandris,cir.d.
we begin with the plaintiff objections to the ssdi instruction.the objections,quoted above,are not models of clarity and,although such objections have to be evaluated in light of the colloquy that transpired at the charge conference the day before,see gray genlyte group,cir wilson.overseas,cir,saying that something simply overstates the law or that the jury should be admonished that receipt of ssdi benefits is not fatal at all does not go very far toward preserving particular legal points.this is especially so where,as here,the judge did not say that receipt of the ssdi benefits was fatal.the purpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.
in this case,the problem is compounded.the plaintiff offers an array of grounds on appeal,and the extent to which each ground might have been apparent from the pretrial discussion varies.
in the end,however,the degree to which the ssdi objections are or are not preserved does not alter the outcome of the appeal.consequently,we will assume for argument sake that the objections to the ssdi instruction were preserved.
no such reservation is required for the plaintiff asseveration that the jury should have been instructed on an employer duty to initiate consideration of a reasonable accommodation.that objection presented a fairly clear choice between giving such an instruction or withholding it,and the objection echoed an instruction proposed by plaintiff counsel and discussed in some detail at the charge conference.that the objection itself was terse did not,in the idiosyncratic circumstances of this case,deprive it of force.after all,the root purpose of rule is to ensure that the district court is given actual notice of the nature and grounds of a party claim that the court instructions are deficient style points are not awarded for the form of an objection.see wilson,at.
we turn,then,to the merits of the objections,starting with a few words about the standard of review.
preserved claims of instructional error are reviewed under a split standard.we review de novo questions as to whether jury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law,while reviewing for abuse of discretion questions as to whether the court choice of phraseology in crafting its jury instructions is unfairly prejudicial.see united states nascimento,cir elliott warren,cir.
the ssdi instruction.the plaintiff challenges the ssdi instruction as inconsistent with the supreme court decision in cleveland policy management systems,d he argues that the effect of the instruction was to establish a forbidden presumption that the receipt of ssdi benefits precludes a finding that an employee is able to perform the essential functions of his job,with or without an accommodation.
in order to put this claim of error into perspective,it is useful to step back and examine cleveland.there,a district court granted summary judgment in favor of an employer in a suit brought under the americans with disabilities act ada,et.the district court reasoned that the plaintiff application for and receipt of ssdi benefits estopped her as a matter of law from claiming that she was capable of performing the essential functions of her job.the fifth circuit affirmed but softened the reasoning it held that the receipt of ssdi benefits creates a rebuttable presumption that the employee can not perform the essential functions of her job.cleveland policy mgmt,cir.because the plaintiff had failed to proffer evidence sufficient to overcome that presumption,her appeal failed.id.
the supreme court saw the matter differently.the justices reversed,finding the ssdi scheme and the ada scheme separate and distinct.at.consequently,receipt of benefits under the former scheme does not create any presumption conclusive or rebuttable with respect to a parallel ada claim.id.at.withal,the court was careful to note that an employee may not simply ignore seeming contradictions between statements made in an application for ssdi benefits and elements of an ada claim.id.at.rather,the employee must explain such seeming contradictions.id.
seen in this light,we believe that the district court ssdi instruction comports with the thrust of the cleveland court holding.pertinently,the court told the jury that the mere fact that decaro received ssdi benefits is not in itself necessarily fatal to his claim.the court further told the jury to consider whether the statements made by the plaintiff in applying for ssdi benefits constituted admissions as to his inability to perform the essential functions of his job.in resolving that point,the jurors were urged to consider all the facts and circumstances.finally,the court warned the jury to keep in mind that the standard for determining eligibility for ssdi benefits is different from the standard you must apply in determining whether plaintiff was able,with or without reasonable accommodation,to perform the essential functions of his job.these are correct statements of the law,consistent both with cleveland and with massachusetts law.see russell cooley dickinson.
relatedly,the plaintiff argues that the court erred in failing either to use the phrase not fatal at all or to emphasize that a change in conditions from one date to another could constitute an acceptable means of harmonizing seemingly contradictory statements.the first of these points is flatly incorrect instructing the jury that the plaintiff statements and the consequent receipt of benefits were not fatal at all would have usurped the jury province the point of the cleveland decision is that such statements may
