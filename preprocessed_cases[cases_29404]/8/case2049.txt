background 
ferrelli worked at river manor as a licensed practical nurse from january,until november,the day she was terminated.ferrelli,who is white,contends that she was terminated on the basis of race.river manor maintains that ferrelli was terminated for failing to follow the proper procedures for distributing controlled drugs to the resident patients.ferrelli denies river manor misconduct charges and contends that employees with more serious infractions were not terminated and that she was treated in a way that no employee was treated prior to and at termination.
prior to filing the instant suit,ferrelli contested her termination in several other fora.first,she sought an adjudication by the state of new york unemployment insurance appeal board the board that she was not terminated for misconduct,a determination that would entitle her to unemployment benefits.the board found that river manor had relied primarily on hearsay to support its finding of misconduct and that ferrelli sworn the board held was not inherently entitled to greater weight.accordingly,the board concluded that ferrelli should not be disqualified from receiving benefits.second,ferrelli filed a grievance through her union,which ultimately resulted in an arbitration decision concluding that ferrelli had engaged in misconduct,but that the appropriate response was suspension for approximately nineteen months rather than termination.the arbitrator ordered river manor to reinstate ferrelli and to pay her approximately months of back pay.third,ferrelli filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission,which issued a letter on december.acting pro se,ferrelli then filed her title vii complaint in the district court.
two and a half months after filing her complaint,ferrelli filed a written application for counsel,a request she renewed several times during pretrial proceedings.at the initial conference,magistrate judge gold denied her application for counsel on the basis that just looking at the outer circumstances of your case,they do raise the same likelihood of or indications of likely merit on the surface,and that her case was not compelling.ferrelli was given leave to renew her request after discovery,if the case survive ed a dispositive motion.at a subsequent conference convened to address ferrelli failure to cooperate in discovery,ferrelli renewed her request for counsel,asserting that she could not answer the interrogatories for reasons that pertain to my safety.she also informed the magistrate judge that my life is in danger and i do need federal protection,and that i do have the legal knowledge or training to do this.at a later status conference,ferrelli explained that she could not answer defendant interrogatories because this is a conspiracy against me involving river manor and others,and that she could not provide any information without the assistance of an attorney.
at all of these conferences,magistrate judge gold informed ferrelli that she was required to answer defendant requests to disclose which of defendant employees had allegedly discriminated against her.at the last conference,the magistrate judge warned her of the likelihood that she would be barred from presenting any witnesses that she did not divulge.nevertheless,ferrelli continued to resist answering defendant discovery requests.thereupon river manor filed a motion to preclude ferrelli from presenting certain evidence related to the information she refused to disclose,and on march,the magistrate judge filed a report recommending that judge korman grant the motion.ferrelli filed a timely objection to the report on april,in which she again alleged criminal conduct by the defendant including attempted murder,and stated i have been denied the mental capacity to proceed in this case prose sic.with the court permission i in need of the court intervention to give me an attorney,in order for me to prevail and successfully proceed forward.on april,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation by memo endorsement.
the defendant then moved for summary judgment,to which ferrelli only reply,dated six days after her opposition papers were due,asserted that 
t he denial of my amendment rights by the city and by the state of new york,has been and is contin u ous,and on going in the day and in the night without pause and has hampered my ability to maintain a suit within the federal court while laboring under such a defect of reason,and mental incapability and to maintain said suit from the onset.
as of february,it has become impossible,and without federal intervention to stop any further damage to my body,and to stop any further damage to my mind by those employe d by new york city,and by the state of new york namely members of the new york city police department who have engaged in or have summon ed on their behalf those who have engaged in the use of children,the use of two special agents of the,attempted murder,murder,arson,bank robbery,fraud,compromising police investigations,extortion,bombings,conspiracy,and the taking of this community and setting it aside from articles of the constitution gives cause for me to say that federal rule of civil procedure is not paramount in this case at this time.
the district court subsequently granted defendant motion for summary judgment by memo endorsement,and ferrelli filed a timely appeal.a panel of this court appointed appellate counsel and ordered briefing on whether,when faced with appellant claim that she lacked the mental capacity to respond to defendant motion for summary judgment,the district court should have inquired into appellant mental capacity and considered appointing a guardian ad litem or assigned counsel.
discussion 
standard of review 
ferrelli contends that the district court erred by failing to conduct an inquiry into her mental capacity to determine whether it should appoint a guardian ad litem and by failing to appoint counsel.we review a district court decisions as to whether to appoint a guardian ad litem under rule c and whether to appoint counsel under f for abuse of discretion.see,jenkins chem.bank,cir appointment of counsel developmental disabilities advoc,melton,cir appointment of guardian ad litem.
appointment of guardian ad litem 
rule c provides,in relevant part,that t he court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.c the rule gives us no guidance regarding the circumstances that warrant a competency inquiry,or whether a pro se plaintiff should receive special consideration under the rule.in providing a standard to guide the district court discretion in this area,we are mindful of the need to protect the rights of the mentally incompetent.however,in light of the volume of pro se filings in this circuit,we can not disregard the potential burden on court administration associated with conducting frequent inquiries into pro se litigants mental competency 
ferrelli argues that rule c requires a district court to sua sponte make a determination of competency whenever a substantial question exists regarding the plaintiff mental capacity.thus,ferrelli maintains that,because her own requests for counsel,coupled with her statements,raised a substantial question regarding her mental competency,they were sufficient to trigger the district court obligation to determine whether rule c protection was warranted.we disagree.neither the language of rule c nor the precedent of this court or other circuits imposes upon district judges an obligation to inquire sua sponte into a pro se plaintiff mental competence,even when the judge observes behavior that may suggest mental incapacity.
rule c requires that when an incompetent person is not represented by a guardian,the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for that person or shall make such other order as it deems proper to protect the incompetent interests.ferrelli urges that this language obligates a court to conduct a sua sponte inquiry into a litigant competency when he or she demonstrates signs of incapacity.we read nothing in the rule itself that obligates a district court to monitor a pro se litigant behavior for signs of mental incompetence.the obligation imposed by the final sentence of rule c the duty to appoint or make such other order arises after a determination of incompetency.if a court were presented with evidence from an appropriate court of record or a relevant public agency indicating that the party had been adjudicated incompetent,or if the court received verifiable evidence from a mental health professional demonstrating that the party is being or has been treated for mental illness of the type that would render him or her legally incompetent,it likely would be an abuse of the court discretion not to consider whether rule c applied see hudnall sellner,cir noting that if there has been a legal adjudication of incompetence and that is brought to the court attention,the rule provision is brought in play.standing alone,however,a litigant bizarre behavior is insufficient to trigger a mandatory inquiry into his or her competency.see id.
ferrelli relies heavily on united states acres of land,cir,and krain smallwood,cir,to support her interpretation of rule c.those cases do not address the precise issue we must resolve here what factors trigger a sua sponte inquiry into a pro se plaintiff mental competence in acres,the pro se defendant indicated to the court that he was incapable of representing himself and provided a social security administration ssa report that found him to be completely physically and mentally disabled.see acres,at.the government attorneys in that case advised the court that,in view of the ssa determination,the court might be required to inquire into defendant condition or appoint a guardian ad litem pursuant to rule c.see id.at.the ninth circuit held that under those circumstances,the district court was required to consider the propriety of appointing a guardian ad litem for the pro se defendant.see id.at.
in krain,a magistrate judge determined that a substantial question existed regarding the plaintiff competency to proceed pro se,and ordered him to produce information needed to determine whether he was competent.krain,at.when krain failed to provide that information,the district court dismissed his complaints with prejudice.see id.the ninth circuit reversed and remanded,holding that when a substantial question exists regarding the competence of an unrepresented party the court may not dismiss with prejudice for failure to comply with an order of the court.id.neither acres nor krain supports the proposition that rule c requires the district court to determine a pro se litigant competency simply because the litigant asserts her own incompetence or displays apparent signs of mental incapacity in both cases the ninth circuit held that where a substantial question as to a pro se litigant mental competency had already been identified by the district court,it was error for the district court to fail to consider appointing a guardian ad litem.neither acres nor krain supports the proposition that rule c requires courts to make a sua sponte determination of a pro se litigant mental competence 
the fourth circuit holding in hudnall supports our interpretation of rule c.in that case,the fourth circuit declined to find that a pro se defendant bizarre and behavior at trial required the district court to conduct a collateral judicial inquiry into the defendant mental competency.see at.the hudnall court recognized the practical problem presented by a case in which a presumably competent party might be thought to be acting oddly,or foolishly,or in prosecuting or defending a civil lawsuit,with or without counsel.id.at.the fourth circuit also observed,as do we,that p arties to litigation behave in a great variety of ways that might be thought to suggest some degree of mental instability,and that there is no necessary relationship between mental incompetence of the sort that would warrant the appointment of a legal representative and various forms of mental derangement or personality disorder that may cause utterly bizarre and destructive conduct in litigation.id.like the fourth circuit,we do not read rule c to require a court to attempt to distinguish between the truly incompetent and those of a personality disorder or other in a foolish or bizarre way,hold irrational beliefs,or are simply inept.
although we do not find that rule c requires courts to inquire into the necessity of appointing a guardian ad litem absent verifiable evidence of mental incapacity,we also note that nothing in that rule prevents a district court from exercising its discretion to consider sua sponte the appropriateness of appointing a guardian ad litem for a litigant whose behavior raises a significant question regarding his or her mental competency.indeed,such consideration may be particularly appropriate in the case of a defendant who shows signs of severe incapacity,in part because a judgment entered against a mentally incompetent defendant not represented by a guardian or a guardian ad litem may be subject to collateral attack at a later date.see id.at.at the same time,the district judge should be aware that due process considerations attend an incompetency finding and the subsequent appointment of a guardian ad litem.see neilson,cir finding of incompetence made pursuant to rule c must meet requirements of due process thomas humfield,cir holding that,under the circumstances,due process required that the district court conduct a hearing prior to appointment of guardian ad litem.in this case,had judge korman decided sua sponte to conduct an inquiry into ferrelli mental competency,such an inquiry would not have constituted an abuse of his discretion.neither rule c nor relevant precedent required him to conduct an inquiry,however,and we do not find that his failure to do so fell beyond the bounds of his wide discretion in this area.
appointment of counsel 
ferrelli also contends that the magistrate judge and the district judge erred in denying her request for counsel.the decision of whether to app
