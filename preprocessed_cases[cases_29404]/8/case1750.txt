bryan noble,a citizen of jamaica,petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section c of the immigration and nationality act,c ina in re bryan noble,no.a june,bia opinion.the bia sustained the government appeal and vacated the decision of immigration judge ij margaret mcmanus granting noble application.in re bryan noble,no.a immig.city,ij decision.
noble now petitions for review,arguing that the bia applied an incorrect legal standard,as established by agency regulations,to its review of the ij determination that noble had been rehabilitated subsequent to his extensive history of criminal behavior.because we conclude that the bia did not reject a finding of fact by the ij that noble was rehabilitated,but instead evaluated the nature and extent of his rehabilitation as one equity among many in exercising its discretion,we conclude that the petitioner is,in substance,asking us to review an exercise of discretion by the bia.we do not have jurisdiction to do so,and we therefore dismiss the petition.
background 
noble entered the united states on a visitor visa in,at the age of twelve.he became a lawful permanent resident on march.soon thereafter,he was arrested for the first time.he was subsequently arrested on six other occasions.most of his arrests were all led to criminal proceedings in new york state courts.
the petitioner legal troubles prompted the initiation of his immigration proceedings and two delays thereof.nearly fifteen years after they began,noble now petitions this court to review the bia denial of discretionary relief from removal.

on april,shortly after his probationary sentence was imposed,noble was again arrested,this time for criminal impersonation.he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for which he was sentenced to pay a fine.
seven months later,noble was arrested following a police.at the time of his arrest,he had bags of cocaine base crack,individually packaged for sale,at his feet.on october,before the prosecution had been resolved,noble was arrested in the course of another police drug raid for possession of crack with the intent to sell.at the time of this arrest,noble also had in his possession a loaded pistol with a defaced serial number.on february,while these two cases were pending,noble was arrested yet again for possession of crack.
on november,noble pleaded guilty to the criminal charges arising from his third and fourth arrests and was sentenced,for each crime,to to years imprisonment,to run concurrently.noble served months imprisonment for these offenses.
noble removal proceedings 
on august,the ins issued an order to show cause to noble based on his previous convictions for crimes in it,the ins charged noble with removability under section a b i of the ina,a a i current version at,as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation,and section a a iii of the ina,a a iii current version at,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.noble has never disputed his deportability or removability on these bases.
on january,noble filed an application for relief under section c.while noble section c hearing was pending,he was arrested a sixth time,this time for selling crack.his deportation proceedings were administratively closed pending a resolution of charges in connection with that arrest.he later pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to a conditional discharge.
noble removal hearings were reopened but suspended again after he was arrested a seventh time on february.noble pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct arising out of a shoplifting incident,was sentenced to a conditional discharge,and was asked,and agreed,to participate in a drug recovery program.
the ij decision 
on march,almost a decade after deportation proceedings against him had begun,noble received a hearing before an ij to address his section c application.he and his wife both testified.
noble recounted his extensive criminal record and admitted to having committed additional drug offenses for which he had not been arrested and,therefore,of which the ins had not been aware.he expressed his regret about that phase of his life and asserted that he had since turned his life around.
noble wife testified to noble importance to their family as a father,stepfather,caretaker,and breadwinner.she said that,were noble removed from the united states,the family would no longer be able to afford to pay the mortgage on their home and would therefore be forced to leave it.
noble also submitted several documents in support of his relief application relating to his marriage and extensive family ties in the united states,his employment record and financial stability,his record,and his positive influence on his children.
the ij issued a written decision on january.after balancing the equities in accordance with matter of marin,bia,she granted noble a waiver of removal under section c.see ij decision at.she found noble testimony to be level of honesty convince d her that he had been forthright in all of his testimony.id.at.the ij identified several unusual and outstanding equities that offset noble extensive criminal history,including his family connections to the united states,his positive family relationships,the financial and emotional support he provided to his family,and his steady employment.id.at.addressing the issue of rehabilitation,the ij noted that noble had expressed profound remorse for his criminal convictions and regrets his criminal involvement.id.at.the ij further found that noble had demonstrated a willingness to continue his progress toward a and lifestyle.id.at.the ij said in light of the for e going analysis and noble remorse for his past actions,the court concludes that noble has finally demonstrated good efforts at rehabilitation.id.the ij concluded that noble positive equities outweighed the negative ones and granted noble request for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section c.see id.at.
the bia opinion 
the government appealed the ij decision to the bia.according to the bia,the sole question on appeal was whether the respondent merit ed section c relief in the exercise of discretion,a matter the board reviews de novo.bia opinion at.the bia considered a variety of factors the seriousness of the criminal charges against noble the number of them including those which he admitted committing but for which he had not been convicted that the circumstances under which some of these crimes were committed suggest the possibility that he was willing and able to advance his criminal enterprise by means of violence and the fact that the criminal behavior continued after his deportation proceedings began.id.at.
in light of these significant negative factors,the bia opined,noble would be entitled to relief only if he came forward with evidence of unusual or outstanding equities,including proof of genuine rehabilitation.id.the bia first acknowledged that some of noble positive factors did rise to the level of unusual or outstanding equities.id.at.the bia further noted that noble had expressed sincere remorse for his past conduct and testified honestly about that conduct in open court,thereby adhering to the ij credibility determination.id.
on the issue of rehabilitation,however,the bia observed 
r emorsefulness is not the same as rehabilitation.the fact that the respondent has continued to commit crimes after the commencement of these proceedings and after receiving explicit warnings from the ij about the potential consequences of such conduct frankly leaves us with very serious doubts as to the authenticity of noble rehabilitation.
id.after balancing the various factors in noble case,including unusual or outstanding equities in his favor,against the adverse factor of his very serious criminal history and the agency reservations
