beer,a new york beer wholesaler,appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york glasser,dismissing its action against baltika brewery,a russian brewer,based on a forum selection clause in the parties agreement.see beer baltika brewery,d.on appeal,beer argues that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because new york alcoholic beverage control law hereinafter,governing agreements between brewers and beer wholesalers,applies to the parties relationship applying to the parties relationship would not violate the dormant commerce clause and the forum selection clause is unenforceable because it violates its right under to bring a judicial action in new york for violations of the act,and contravenes a strong public policy of the forum state of protecting beer wholesalers,which is embodied in the statute 
background 
in,baltika brewery baltika,the owner of various beer brands,designated beer ski as its exclusive brand agent in new york state it did so by a letter to the state of new york division of alcoholic beverage control wholesale bureau.in,baltika and ski entered into a written agreement for the purchase and sale of worth of baltika beer and beverages.according to the agreement,ski purchased the beverages on the terms fca,verkhniy pereulok,petersburg,russia.the agreement provided all disputes or differences which may arise in the course of fulfillment of,or in connection with,the present contract,shall be considered by the arbitration court of petersburg and the leningradskaya oblast.awards of the said court shall be final and binding upon both parties.in december,the parties supplemented their agreement,extending it until july.
ski commenced an action in district court claiming that baltika had stopped performing under the contract by refusing to fill ski order,in violation of both and the parties written agreement.baltika moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b,arguing,inter alia,that the forum selection clause in the parties agreement mandated dismissal.ski opposed the motion,claiming that dismissal was precluded by because baltika established a contractual relationship with a new york licensed wholesaler for purposes of having baltika beer distributed in new york state.ski also argued that the forum selection clause is unreasonable because it contravenes new york public policy interest in protecting its licensed beer wholesalers and,if enforced,the clause would deprive ski of its statutory rights under.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint based upon the mandatory forum selection clause.beer,d at.the court concluded that did not apply because it regulates only those sales and deliveries which take place in the state of new york,none of the sales or deliveries under the contract occurred in new york,and baltika was not a brewer subject to the statute.id.at.the court determined that even if the contract fell within the scope of,the forum selection clause is enforceable because ski failed to show that the enforcement of the forum selection clause would impair rights protected by the statute and that such rights are substantial enough to constitute a strong public policy.id.at.
on appeal,ski argues three points.it contends that baltika relationship with ski is governed by new york alcoholic beverage control law applying section to the relationship between baltika and ski would not violate the dormant commerce clause and the forum selection clause is unenforceable because section precludes agreements containing a clause requiring a forum outside of new york,and when a state legislative sic provides for and believes that an forum is necessary to vindicate the rights afforded under a statute,the public policy is sufficiently elevated to overcome the presumed validity of the forum selection clause.
discussion 
standard of review 
on an appeal of a district court dismissal based on a forum selection clause,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.asoma sk shipping,cir.
whether the forum selection clause is presumptively enforceable 
this court has explained that d etermining whether to dismiss a claim based on a forum selection clause involves a analysis that proceeds in the following manner 
the first inquiry is whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement.the second step requires us to classify the clause as mandatory or permissive,to decide whether the parties are required to bring any dispute to the designated forum or simply permitted to do so.part three asks whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the forum selection clause.
if the forum selection clause was communicated to the resisting party,has mandatory force and covers the claims and parties involved in the dispute,it is presumptively enforceable.the fourth,and final,step is to ascertain whether the resisting party has rebutted the presumption of enforceability by making a sufficiently strong showing that enforcement would be unreasonable or unjust,or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.
phillips audio active,cir quoting bremen zapata,emphases in original citations omitted.in determining whether the forum selection clause is mandatory,our initial focus is on the language of the contract.id.at.a forum selection clause is viewed as mandatory when it confers exclusive jurisdiction on the designated forum or incorporates obligatory venue language.id.when only jurisdiction is specified the clause will generally not be enforced without some further language indicating the parties intent to make jurisdiction exclusive.of course if mandatory venue language is employed,the clause will be enforced.john boutari son,wines spirits,attiki imps.distribs,cir quoting docksider,sea,cir alteration and citations omitted.
here,there is no dispute that the nature of the forum selection clause in the parties agreement is mandatory.nothing in the record indicates,and ski does not contend,that the forum selection clause was not reasonably communicated to it.the parties do not dispute that ski claims arise directly from the agreement containing the forum selection clause and involve the parties to that agreement.in sum,the district court properly concluded that the forum selection clause is presumptively enforceable.
