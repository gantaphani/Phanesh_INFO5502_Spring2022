this appeal requires us to decide when a provision of the class action fairness act of cafa bars appellate review of orders remanding securities class actions to state court.
commenced this putative class action in new york state supreme court.the case was removed to the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard holwell.moved to remand the case to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.they argued that,while cafa extended federal jurisdiction for most class actions meeting certain monetary and diversity requirements,it did not apply to this action because the statute exempted suits involving claims that relate d to the rights,duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security.d c.additionally,argued that no other basis for federal jurisdiction existed.the district court granted motion to remand,and appealed to this court.
we construe the language of another provision of cafa,which governs removal of class actions and appellate review of orders remanding such actions to state court.like the parallel exception in the provision creating federal jurisdiction over class actions,d exempts from appellate review orders remanding any class action that solely involves a claim that relates to the rights,duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security we conclude that the present action falls within this provision.accordingly,we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal and must dismiss it.
background 
defendants are affiliated corporations in the mortgage business.defendant countrywide financial corporation is a holding company,of which the other defendants are subsidiaries.one subsidiary,defendant countrywide home loans,originates loans to individual consumers.the other subsidiary,defendant countrywide home loans servicing,lp,now known as bac home loans servicing,lp,countrywide servicing,services the loans originated by countrywide home loans.
to raise money to lend to consumers,countrywide home loans entered into a number of securitization transactions.in these transactions,countrywide home loans sold its mortgages to specially created trusts,which received payment of interest and principal from mortgage borrowers.the trusts in turn sold certificates to investors.these securities entitled their owners to repayments of their principal,as well as interest payments.because the trusts themselves lacked the capacity to administer the loans,they entered into agreements with countrywide servicing to administer the mortgages on their behalf.the terms of these securitization transactions,as well as the rights and duties of the parties to them,were laid out in contracts known as pooling and servicing agreements psas.countrywide home loans and countrywide servicing,as well as the trusts trustee,the bank of new york,and various other entities,were parties to the psas,but the certificate holders and countrywide financial were not.
in the summer of,the attorneys general of seven states filed lawsuits accusing the countrywide businesses countrywide of violating laws against predatory lending.the states alleged that countrywide engaged in deceptive sales practices,charged unlawful fees,and made loans it had no reasonable basis to think could be repaid.countrywide later agreed to a multistate settlement,according to which it was required to modify the terms of many of the mortgages owned by the trusts and administered by countrywide servicing on behalf of the trusts.modifying the loans created the possibility that the homeowners would make smaller payments of interest and principal to the trusts,thereby decreasing the value of the certificates.
plaintiffs are holders of certificates issued by the trusts.they filed this putative class action in new york state supreme court,seeking declaratory judgments that countrywide servicing is required under the terms of the psas to repurchase the modified loans from the trusts at a price equal to their unpaid principal plus any accrued interest.they cite language in the psas to the effect that countrywide servicing may agree to a modification of any mortgage loan if it purchases the modified mortgage loan from the trust fund 
defendants promptly removed the action to the southern district of new york.in their notice of removal,defendants cited two independent bases for federal jurisdiction.first,defendants claimed original diversity jurisdiction under cafa,d,which generally allows district courts to exercise jurisdiction over class actions based solely on state law provided that minimal diversity is present and the amount in controversy exceeds.second,defendants asserted federal question jurisdiction under,arguing that plaintiffs claim required the court to resolve a disputed,substantial question of federal law.specifically,defendants claimed that countrywide servicing duties under the psas were defined by the housing and economic recovery act of hera,which at provides a safe harbor for servicers of pooled mortgages who modify home loans meeting certain conditions.they argued that since the court would be required to adjudicate the applicability of this safe harbor in order to determine the merits of plaintiffs claim,federal jurisdiction was proper under grable sons metal products darue engineering manufacturing,d.
two weeks later,plaintiffs moved to remand.plaintiffs did not dispute that their action met the diversity and requirements for cafa jurisdiction.they argued,however,that their suit fell within an exception to cafa jurisdiction for actions that relate to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security d c.they further argued that federal question jurisdiction was extended by grable only to those claims of which federal law was an essential element.federal law,they asserted,was not an element of their claim.rather,the safe harbor of hera,if it applied,would simply provide a federal defense to a claim under state law,and therefore was not a basis for subject matter jurisdiction.the district court agreed with both of plaintiffs arguments and remanded.
defendants petitioned to file the present appeal pursuant to c,which authorizes the courts of appeals to hear at their discretion appeals from orders granting or denying motions to remand class actions.we granted petitioners leave to file this appeal,which we considered on an expedited basis in accordance with the time limit set out in c 
discussion 
this case requires us to interpret certain provisions of cafa,which expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts to allow class actions originally filed in state courts that conform to particular requirements to be removed to federal district courts.d,b estate of pew cardarelli,cir.class actions removed under cafa may be remanded to originating state courts pursuant to the general remand statute.see c section shall apply to any removal of a case under this section.the party opposing remand generally bears the burden of showing that federal jurisdiction is proper.blockbuster,galeno,cir.however,once the general requirements of cafa jurisdiction are established,plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating that remand is warranted on the basis of one of the enumerated exceptions.see brook unitedhealth group,civ.gbd,wl,at,accord serrano connect,cir hart fedex ground package,cir frazier pioneer ams.llc,cir.
as a general rule,an order to remand is not appealable.see d.at the same time that cafa expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts over most class actions,however,it expanded the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to hear appeals of orders remanding class actions to state courts.c see coll.of dental surgeons of.life ins,cir.but d sets forth three circumstances under which appellate review of such orders is barred,only one of which is relevant to the case at bar 
d section shall not apply to any class action that solely involves 
a claim that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security as defined under section a of the securities act of a and the regulations issued thereunder.
this exception to appellate jurisdiction over remand orders of class actions is identical to the third of three exceptions to cafa grant of original federal diversity jurisdiction at d c we must therefore construe the provisions together.if we find that the exception of d c does not apply to this action and that the district court had jurisdiction over it under cafa,we will necessarily find that we have jurisdiction to reverse a remand order premised on the district court erroneous conclusion.see cardarelli,at.on the other hand,if the district court lacked cafa jurisdiction over the class action because it falls within the exception,we similarly lack jurisdiction to review the order remanding the action and must dismiss the appeal.see id.as always,we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction.brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.
what this means for the case at bar is that we may examine only one of the two claims defendants make to federal jurisdiction.defendants argue both that the district court had jurisdiction under cafa and also that it had an independent basis for federal question jurisdiction under.if they had raised only as a basis for jurisdiction to the district court,and if the district court had remanded solely upon a finding that such jurisdiction did not exist,our review would be barred by d.it is only if the expansion of appellate jurisdiction under cafa provided by applies that we may review the district court order.if applies,however,the district court necessarily also had jurisdiction over the class action,since none of cafa other jurisdictional exceptions are applicable.on the other hand,if we find that the case at bar fits within the exception of d,we lack jurisdiction to review defendants arguments that the district court order of remand was improper on other grounds 
we examined the scope of the d c and d exceptions to cafa jurisdiction in estate of pew cardarelli,cir.in that case,the plaintiffs were purchasers of unsecured debt instruments issued by agway,an agricultural supply and marketing cooperative.after agway declared bankruptcy,plaintiffs filed suit against agway officers and its auditor in new york supreme court,alleging that agway financial statements had fraudulently concealed agway insolvency.plaintiffs sought relief solely under the new york state consumer fraud statute.defendants removed the suit to federal court under cafa,and plaintiffs moved to remand.the district court determined that cafa jurisdiction was absent,because the suit involved a claim relate d to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to a security.d c.
we reversed.our analysis began by noting that despite broad language that would seem to exempt any claim that relates to any security,the exception could not have been intended to cover all securities claims,no matter their nature.such an understanding of the provision would render superfluous the phrase rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to,which plainly was intended to limit the scope of the exception.additionally,it would render superfluous d a,which exempted from cafa jurisdiction any class action that solely involves a claim concerning a security covered under the securities act of.interpreting d c therefore required us to decide what limiting principle to apply to the broad language of the provision.
to answer this question,we focused on the fact that the exception only applied to suits seeking to enforce rights,duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to securities.we determined that this language was intended to differentiate claims based either on the terms of the instruments that create and define securities or on the duties imposed on persons who administer securities,cardarelli,at,from claims based on rights arising from independent sources of state law.the key distinction between suits that were immune from removal under cafa and those that were not is that immune suits sought to enforce the rights of the securities holders as holders.id.at.in cardarelli,however,plaintiffs claim sought to enforce their rights not as holders,but as purchasers they asserted that the transaction in which they had acquired the notes was tainted by fraud.thus,the claims did not seek to enforce rights,duties or obligations that were pursuant to or created by the securities,but rather rights granted to consumers by a new york statute.plaintiffs suit was therefore removable under cafa.
in contrast to cardarelli,plaintiffs here seek enforcement of their rights as holders rather than as purchasers of securities.plaintiffs sue under a provision of the psas that they claim requires countrywide servicing to repurchase from the trust those loans which countrywide agreed to modify.plaintiffs asserted right to force countrywide servicing to repurchase the loans arises from the deal instruments themselves,not from an extrinsic provision of state law,such as the consumer fraud statute that formed the basis of the action in cardarelli.thus,plaintiffs claim relates to the rights,duties and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to their certificates,and their suit is not removable under cafa.
it is true that plaintiffs sue not to enforce a term of the certificates themselves,but rather to enforce a term of the psas.but simply because the provision on which the suit depends does not appear on the certificates,it does follow that the claim is not pursuant to or created by the security.the principle we stated in cardarelli is that the securities exception of d c and d applies to suits that enforce the terms of instruments that create and define securities,at,and that it does not apply to suits to enforce rights that are superimposed by a state corporation law or common law,id.at.the fact that a certificate holder rights may be enumerated in an instrument other than the security itself is not material.securities are created and defined not simply by their own text,but also by any number of deal instruments executed between various parties.indeed,we made clear in cardarelli that the instruments that create and define securities include documents such as certificates of incorporation and bond indentures.id.for this reason,the fact that plaintiffs seek enforcement of a term of the agreements similar to bond indentures in many than of the certificates does not affect our conclusion that this suit is not removable under cafa.
likewise,the fact that the certificate holders are not themselves parties to the psas is not relevant.the focus of the inquiry is on the source of the right that the plaintiff claim seeks to enforce.as long as a plaintiff claim seeks enforcement of a right that arises from an appropriate instrument,it falls within the exception of d c and d,regardless of whether the plaintiff is a party to the instrument.
defendants argue that under our decision in cardarelli,the jurisdictional exceptions of d c and d do not apply to plaintiffs claim.cardarelli,they assert,stands for the proposition that these exceptions to cafa jurisdiction apply only to disputes over the terms of securities.such terms may be defined in other documents,such as bond indentures,but suits depending on provisions of such documents are not immune from cafa jurisdiction.defendants argue that while the psas may create and define the terms of the certificates,the psas repurchase provision does not itself define the certificates.accordingly,they argue,plaintiffs suit is subject to removal.
in making this argument,defendants attempt to draw on the legislative history of cafa.they argue that this history demonstrates that congress intended to limit cafa jurisdictional exceptions to suits for which federal jurisdiction already existed under federal securities law and to disputes concerning corporate governance,an area in which the delaware state courts had special expertise.they submit that the exceptions of d c and d were meant to preserve the ability of plaintiffs to bring suit in delaware against the managers of the companies in which they invested over the definition of the term
