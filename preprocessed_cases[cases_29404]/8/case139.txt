this is a bruising commercial dispute between business rivals.when the eponymous plaintiff,ira green,green,repaired to the federal district court,it charged the defendant,military sales service milsal,with tortious interference and defamation.after prodigious discovery and an acrimonious trial,the jury returned a verdict.the district court denied green motions and,adding insult to injury,corrected a portion of the judgment favorable to green and awarded costs to milsal.green appeals,presenting a florid palette of claimed errors.
these claims of error include an issue of first impression in this circuit.in,the civil rules were amended to enshrine a party right to demand a jury poll.see.c.here,green requested such a poll,but did not receive one.still,a party who requests a jury poll must act reasonably to preserve its rights and,in the circumstances of this case,green did not do so.consequently,its claim of error is unavailing.
the remainder of green asseverational array is more prosaic.upon careful perscrutation,we discern no reversible error and affirm the judgment below.the tale follows.
it not easy being green 
green is a rhode island corporation engaged in the marketing and distribution of military insignia and tactical products such as headlamps,carabiners,and paper.its primary customer is the army and air force exchange service aafes,which operates retail shops known as post exchanges at military bases.milsal,a texas corporation,plies the same trade from a different angle.acting as a manufacturer representative,it brokers direct sales to divers customers including aafes.
in,green acquired the assets of brigade quartermasters,brigade,which had been aafes largest supplier of tactical gear.as part of the transaction,aafes agreed to assign to green the shelf space previously reserved for brigade products at its exchanges and green,in return,ensured a continuous flow of the tactical products theretofore sold by brigade.aafes began issuing replenishment orders to green,which obtained the requisitioned products from its suppliers formerly brigade suppliers and filled aafes purchase orders.
around the time that this arrangement started,milsal hired cliff vaughn an erstwhile brigade employee.vaughn gave milsal confidential information about brigade costs and pricing arrangements.armed with this data,milsal began courting certain of brigade suppliers,touting the benefits of a model.
in short order,milsal wooed away several suppliers and persuaded them to stop filling green orders.aafes began ordering directly from the suppliers,including darling darling,a manufacturer of paper called rite in the rain.green fought back.it started marketing storm sâf a alternative to rite in the rain to aafes.
the encroachment of storm sâf on sales of rite in the rain ruffled milsal feathers.in may of,a milsal executive,scott hance,sent an to paul atherton,an aafes hierarch.hance claimed falsely,in green view that storm sâf completely dissipates in water within a matter of seconds and could compromise warzone missions.even though aafes own tests found the two brands of paper to be of equivalent quality,orders of storm sâf dwindled.
nonplussed by milsal tactics,green shifted the battlefield from the marketplace to the courtroom.invoking diversity jurisdiction,see a,green sued milsal in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.its complaint alleged defamation and tortious interference with both contractual and business expectancies.based on information acquired during protracted discovery,milsal counterclaimed.these counterclaims came to naught one was dismissed at the pleading stage,and the rest were jettisoned on summary judgment.
after eight days of trial,the jury rejected green claims for tortious interference.on the defamation claim,the jury sent a mixed message it determined that milsal ma d e false and defamatory statements concerning ira green its storm sâf products,but then determined that no damages flowed from this disparagement.
the clerk of court entered judgment for milsal on the tortious interference counts and for green on the defamation count.milsal moved to amend the judgment because,absent damages,a required element of the defamation claim had not been proven.agreeing with milsal reasoning,the district court entered an amended final judgment for milsal on all the tried counts and for green on the counterclaims.
green moved for a new trial,and milsal moved for an award of costs.as part of its motion,milsal revealed for the first time that it had paid over in counsel fees to enable it to secure the testimony of a witness.green effectively amended its new trial motion to include a claim based on this revelation.
the district court denied green new trial motion and taxed costs in favor of milsal.this timely appeal followed.
the gold standard 
in appellate litigation,the standard of review is tantamount to the gold standard.thus,we pause at the outset to limn the standards of review that are implicated by green challenge to the district court denial of its motion for a new trial.
green brought its new trial motion under federal rule of civil procedure a.under this rule,a district court may set aside the jury verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is against the law,against the weight of the credible evidence,or tantamount to a miscarriage of justice.casillas díaz palau,cir.we review the district court disposition of a new trial motion for abuse of discretion.see crowe marchand,cir.an abuse of discretion will be found whenever a reviewed ruling is based on an error of law.see united states connolly,cir.
green motion posited that a new trial is obligatory because of a series of embedded legal errors.we analyze separately each of these cascading claims of error.
some of green claims of error relate to the admission of evidence.where,as here,objections have been preserved,a district court evidentiary rulings are evaluated for abuse of discretion.see united states zaccaria,cir.even if an abuse of discretion occurs,a new trial is not required unless the error in admitting evidence had a substantial and injurious effect or influence upon the jury verdict.gomez rivera rodríguez,cir see.
green new trial motion also relies on assignments of instructional error.when examining preserved claims of instructional error,we afford de novo review to questions as to whether jury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law,while reviewing for abuse of discretion the court choice of phraseology.decaro hasbro,cir.the district court must give a jury instruction on a material issue if the evidence presented at trial could plausibly support a finding for either side.see wilson.overseas,cir see also faigin kelly,cir explaining when a refusal to give a requested instruction is reversible error.
in part,our decision on the issue raised in the new trial motion implicates the doctrine.see united states olano.to prevail on review,an appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the appellant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.the appellant must carry the devoir of persuasion as to each of these four elements.see united states.vega molina,cir.
singing the blues 
green asserts that the court below was too free in admitting evidence.it composes a siren song challenging several of the court rulings.but green arguments are,and green winds up singing the blues.
for the most part,green vision of improperly admitted evidence involves the prohibition against the introduction of hearsay testimony.by definition,hearsay is an statement offer ed in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.it follows from this definition that a witness account of an statement,not offered to prove the truth of that statement,is not inadmissible hearsay.united states walker,cir.put another way,an statement is not hearsay if it is relevant regardless of its truth say,to show state of mind.see mccormick on evidence kenneth broun,ed.as we explain below,the bulk of green hearsay objections fail because the challenged statements were offered and admitted for a purpose.
green first plaint targets the admission of the testimony of a milsal senior manager,robert gregg koefer,relating that aafes buyer atherton had conveyed to milsal an interest in set ting up certain vendors on a direct basis and that the transition would take less than two weeks.the record makes manifest that these statements were admitted not for the truth of their contents that aafes was interested in converting to a model and could do so within two weeks but to show that koefer had a state of mind when soliciting vendors.see greensleeves,smiley.indeed,the district court gave a limiting instruction directing the jury to consider koefer statements solely for this purpose.
green next challenges the admission of certain testimony by a former milsal marketing executive rick fox about fox conversation with vaughn concerning brigade financial information.pertinently,fox testified that vaughn implored him to keep the information confidential because the tactical industry is extremely small and vaughn did not want to tarnish his relationships within the industry.viewed in context,it is readily apparent that this testimony was admitted for a purpose to show fox state of mind that is,that he believed that milsal was entitled to see and use,but not disclose,the information furnished by vaughn.the truth of vaughn statements that the industry is small and that releasing the information to others might tarnish his reputation was not the issue the statements were admitted only to illuminate fox state of mind and,thus,to rebut the theory that milsal knowingly used filched information to solicit green suppliers.
we likewise reject green complaint about the admission of testimony from one of darling principals todd silver.this witness testified that a brigade competitor seeking darling business had expressed its understand ing that brigade was experiencing problems such as situations.
rumors may be admitted,without regard to their accuracy,to show their motivating effect on the listener.see,smith wilson,cir united states worman,cir.milsal argues persuasively that it offered this testimony for a purpose to show that darling was considering offers by brigade competitors and to explain darling reasons for defecting.this interpretation is plausible.regardless of whether brigade was actually experiencing problems,darling might well have been influenced by the rumors to that effect given this plausible purpose,we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its wide discretion in admitting the challenged testimony.see united states anello,cir.
green final hearsay objection is more nuanced.exhibit l which the district court admitted over objection as a full exhibit is a chain of messages between aafes in the person of dennis walker and green in the person of david lumbley.this collection of communiques conveyed to green the results of aafes comparative evaluation of rite in the rain and storm sâf.within this batch,a message from walker dated march,stated that an evaluation of storm sâf had been conducted and that the results were considered acceptable for this product and its intended use.another walker message,dated april,stated,the storm saf sic notebooks did not perform as well as the right sic in the rain.we were able to use the pad,but the pads absorbed and retained more moisture,thus giving a fragile,frayed appearance.
milsal says that the sole purpose of admitting this evidence was to confirm that the testing was done but that is a proscribed use under the hearsay rule.the exhibit was offered solely for the truth of walker statement that the product had been evaluated in,and that fact goes directly to the causation element of green defamation claim.
the district court rationale for admitting the evidence is no more convincing.the court admitted exhibit l under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.see.to invoke this exception at the time of trial,a party had to demonstrate that the proffered record was made at or near the time of the act or event recorded,by or from information transmitted by someone with knowledge,kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business,and made as part of the regular practice of that activity.id.here,the described what supposedly occurred in.this lack of contemporaneity puts the exhibit outside the compass of the business records exception.see united states goodchild,cir.and the proffer was doubly flawed the record contains no evidence that walker the author of the email had the requisite personal knowledge of either the evaluation or its results.see id.
although we conclude that the challenged portion of exhibit l should have been excluded our inquiry does not end there.an error in the admission of evidence is harmless as long as the reviewing court can say with fair assurance that the jury would in all likelihood have reached an identical verdict had the contested evidence been excluded.see gomez,at.because the statements in the exhibit were essentially cumulative of other untainted evidence their admission does not demand reversal.see harrington california,texaco,dep t of consumer affairs,cir.
green hawks one last claim of evidentiary error a claim that does not implicate the prohibition against hearsay.it argues that the district court erroneously allowed atherton to testify without a sufficient foundation about what aafes believe d and to interpret certain policies from aafes perspective.
the premise on which this argument rests can not be faulted.personal knowledge is a prerequisite for lay testimony.see.but the conclusion that green draws is unwarranted.the record makes manifest that the admission of atherton testimony did not breach this rampart.
atherton was aafes primary buyer of tactical gear.during the course of the trial,his personal knowledge of the requirements and policies governing his job was never contested.the questions that he answered fell well within the scope of his employment and,by fair inference,within the encincture of his personal knowledge.no more was exigible.
through rose colored glasses 
green advances two preserved assignments of instructional error.it views these assignments of error through glasses,and we reject them.
green first claim is as queer as a clockwork orange it asserts in what amounts to little more than an ipse dixit that the district court charge on the justification defense to tortious interference was confusing.our review of this purported shortcoming in the charge is for abuse of discretion.see decaro,at.
claims of tortious interference with contractual or business relations require proof,among other things,of the defendant intentional and improper interference with the contractual or business relationship.see greensleeves,at mesolella city of.interference is improper if it is without justification that is,if it is for an improper purpose.greensleeves,at internal quotation marks omitted.once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of tortious interference,the defendant may counter that prima facie case by showing that the interference was justified.see belliveau.the burden of proving justification rests with the defendant.see id.
in charging the jury on the tortious interference counts,the district court first explained the elements of green prima facie case and the various factors shedding light on improper purpose.it then described the justification defense to the jury 
a defendant is not liable simply for committing an intentional act that interferes with a plaintiff contracts or business relationships.the interference also must be impermissible or unjustified.in other words,a defendant would not be liable for legitimately competing with a plaintiff for business.
if you find that ira green has proven that milsal acted intentionally and for an improper purpose,the burden shifts to milsal to prove that its interference was justified 
if you find that milsal was justified in interfering with ira green contracts business relationships,you should find that milsal is not liable for tortious interference with contracts business relationships.
green suggests that this instruction,which came after the court had allocated the burden of proving the tort to green,implied that green was required to prove twice that milsal interference was improper.
this argument is vecordious.the instruction correctly informed the jury about the shifting burdens of proof and neither stated nor implied that green was obliged to rebut any evidence of justification adduced by milsal.to the contrary,the court made it clear that the jury should exonerate milsal only i f milsal was justified in interfering with ira green contracts business relationships.this portion of the instructions,read seamlessly,was neither misleading nor confusing.
green resists this conclusion.it argues that the location of a particular sentence in other words,a defendant would not be liable for legitimately competing with a plaintiff for business insinuated that milsal interference was presumed justified and,thus,misled the jury.
green is seeing ghosts under the bed.legitimate competition between business rivals constitutes a justification for interference.see ocean state physicians health plan,blue cross blue shield of,cir citing restatement second of torts.reading the challenged sentence in the context of the instructions as a whole,there is no conceivable risk that a reasonable juror would understand it as setting up a presumption that milsal efforts at competition were legitimate.
green second claim of instructional error also fails.it calumnizes the district court for refusing to instruct on defamation per se.
rhode island law supplies the substantive rules of decision in this diversity case.see hanna plumer,correia fitzgerald,cir.the rhode island supreme court has explained that a statement is defamatory per se if it charges improper conduct,lack of skill,or integrity in one profession or business,and is of such a nature that it is calculated to cause injury to one in his profession or business.marcil kells.rhode island highest court has not yet decided a case mapping the intersection of defamation per se and product disparagement.we think it reasonable to predict that the court,when faced with the question,will adopt the prevailing rule as set forth in the restatement second of torts.id.following restatement in defamation action.under the restatement,a false statement concerning the quality of goods is actionable as disparagement but is not actionable as defamation per se unless made under circumstances and in a manner that implies that the manufacturer or vendor is dishonest,fraudulent or incompetent.restatement second of torts cmt.g see ref.benzo gas motor fuel,cir a false statement directed at goods is not libelous per se as to the corporation,unless by fair construction and without the aid of extrinsic evidence it imputes to the corporation,fraud,deceit,dishonesty,or reprehensible conduct in its business.
green insists that a reasonable jury could conclude that statements disparaging the quality of storm sâf,which neither mentioned green by name nor suggested that green knew about the purported flaws,imputed to green dishonesty,fraud,or incompetence.we do not agree the evidence in the record simply will not support a plausible finding that milsal product disparagement of green wares amounted to defamation per se.
the statements in question to the effect that storm sâf dissipates quickly in water and,therefore,will compromise the warzone mission are no more than a caution against the goods,suggesting that the articles do not answer their purpose.evans harlow,eng.such statements are surely actionable as product disparagement.see,vascular solutions,marine polymer,cir per curiam.but competition is the lifeblood of a economy,and business rivals frequently knock one another wares.in the marketplace,then,criticism of the quality of goods,without more,is insufficient to ground a claim of defamation per se against either the manufacturer or the vendor.see,at collecting cases.although any statement denigrating the efficacy of a product will likely have some impact on the reputation of its manufacturer or its vendor,more is needed to sink to the level of defamation per se.there is no more here.it follows that the district court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on defamation per se.
not quite a white knight 
green soldiers on.it argues that milsal failure to disclose that it had paid counsel fees in order to secure the testimony of todd silver a principal of darling was a discovery violation.had it known,green says,it would have made devastating use of the information on to undercut milsal suggestion that silver was a white knight who had fl own miles across the country voluntarily to come and testify.
green raised this argument for the first time in what amounted to an amendment to its motion for a new trial.this was before the time for filing a motion for a new trial had elapsed.see.b.hence,the argument is cognizable as a ground for a new trial our review is for abuse of discretion.see crowe,at.
we need not tarry.even assuming that a discovery violation occurred and that is far from clear the district court supportably concluded that the fact of the payment had only meager evidentiary value.silver was a volunteer who testified without a subpoena.there was a history of litigation between green and darling.given that history,darling insistence on having an attorney present when silver testified and its demand that milsal defray its counsel fees reflect prudent business judgment.nothing about that cautious arrangement contradicts the voluntary nature of silver court appearance.
we add,moreover,that neither silver nor his company profited from the challenged payment rather,it went directly into the coffers of a law firm.as such,any inference of bias arising out of the payment would have been strained and,therefore,easily dispelled.seen in this light,the district court conclusion that the undisclosed payment did not impede green ability to litigate the case was supportable.and the court determination that this circumstance did not justify a new trial was not an abuse of discretion.see casillas díaz,at.
a gray area 
we come now to the thorniest of the arguments made in support of green new trial motion.addressing this argument takes us into a gray area surrounding the forgone jury poll.we start by sketching the relevant events.
the court submitted the case to the jurors with instructions that they complete a verdict form a reconstruction of which is annexed hereto as appendix a.when the jury returned its verdict,the court asked the foreperson to report on the jury answers to the questions posed in the verdict form.following the court lead,the foreperson read into the record the answers to questions,and.he was not asked to report on the other three questions.
that was when things began to unravel.the answers to questions and mooted questions and,so those questions were appropriately ignored.question was not moot,yet the court did not pursue that question with the jury foreperson.
the court next inquired whether any party wished to poll the jurors individually.one of green lawyers responded affirmatively.at the same time,he reminded the court that the answer to question had not been reported.
the court turned immediately to the oversight it read question aloud and asked the foreperson to announce the jury answer.once the announcement had been made,the court thanked the jurors for their service and discharged them.none of green three attorneys reminded the judge of the earlier request for a jury poll.
on green motion for a new trial,the district court concluded that its failure to poll the jury was harmless.green asseverates that the failure to poll constituted per se reversible error.milsal counters that green waived its right to a jury poll by failing to speak up when it became clear that the district court,distracted by the need to complete the reporting of the verdict,had forgotten about the earlier request.
for over two centuries,there was an open question in the federal courts about whether a party may demand a poll of the jury in a civil action as a matter of right or whether that decision is commended to the discretion of the district court upon motion by counsel.audette isaksen fishing,cir quoting kazan wolinski,cir.this uncertainty was resolved in when federal rule of civil procedure was amended by adding subsection c to make a jury poll mandatory upon timeous request.see.c after a verdict is returned but before the jury is discharged,the court must on a party request,or may on its own,poll the jurors individually.the new provision was drawn from criminal rule d with minor revisions to reflect civil rules style and the parties opportunity to stipulate to a nonunanimous verdict.c advisory committee note to amend.
a party right to poll the jury is of basic importance.audette,at quoting miranda united states,cir.individual polling helps to ensure unanimity by unmasking coercion and exploring the possibility that a juror may change her mind about a verdict after leaving the jury room.see id.at.but the right to individual polling is not of constitutional dimension,and it can be waived if not invoked in a timely manner.see humphries district of columbia,jaca hernandez delgado,cir.
in the criminal context,the prevailing rule is that a failure to poll the jury after a timely request constitutes per se reversible error.see,united states vollmer,cir virgin islands hercules,cir miranda,at.the law is much less clear in the civil context.in one of the very few cases applying rule c,a panel of the seventh circuit noted its belief that the presumption of prejudice attaching to violations of criminal rule d was fully applicable to its civil analogue.verser barfield,cir.extrapolating from this premise,the court postulated,in dictum,that a district court refusal,or even neglect,to conduct a jury poll upon a timely request is ground for a new trial.id.
the seventh circuit position has much to commend it.the criminal and civil rules on jury polling are now virtually identical.compare.d,with.c.common sense suggests that these rules should be interpreted in pari passu.
such a suggestion,though,is open to legitimate question.more than one state court,interpreting similar parallel mandatory rules,has concluded that a violation of the right to a jury poll engenders automatic reversal in criminal cases but not in civil cases.see,wiseman armstrong,distinguishing state pare,see also id.at collecting cases from other jurisdictions.those courts review a trial court failure to conduct a requested jury poll in a civil case for harmless error.see,id.
here,however,this gray area can be left unexplored.green failure to renew its jury poll request after the district court completed the announcement of the verdict takes this case outside the mainstream.we explain briefly.
green initially sought two things polling the jury and completing the reporting of the verdict.the district court sensibly,in our view attended first to completing the verdict report.after that was accomplished,green failed to renew its request.
we have noted in other contexts that a district court inadvertent failure to make a ruling is not equivalent to a denial.rather,a party who seeks a ruling must persist in his quest to some reasonable extent.desrosiers moran,cir see united states ortiz,cir.after all,the law ministers to the vigilant,not to those who sleep upon their rights.see,dow united of carpenters joiners,cir.other courts have indicated that this principle is applicable in the context where,say,counsel could reasonably have objected while the jury was filing out of the courtroom.see,united states marinari,cir.so,too,where a party could have requested that the jury be recalled for polling after dismissal but before the jury had dispersed.see,e,united states beldin,cir baker sherwood constr,cir per curiam.
in this case,green legal team had ample opportunity to act once it became apparent that the district court had forgotten green earlier request they could have done so immediately after the foreperson completed the reading of the verdict form.similarly,they could have done so either when the court purposed to discharge the jury or when the jury was filing out of the courtroom.see marinari,at counsel risks waiver of the party right to a poll by merely waiting and watching as the jury disappears behind the closed door of the jury room.
here,moreover,green counsel had a final opportunity.the district court had suggested that the jurors wait in the jury room so that the court could thank them personally.thus,when the court before adjourning asked counsel if there was anything left to say,green lawyers could have taken up the matter then and there.given this collocation of circumstances,we conclude that green request for a jury poll was waived.putnam res.pateman,cir noting,in an analogous context,that failure to object at a point when the jury could still be reconvened may constitute a waiver.
a waived claim is generally not reviewable on appeal.see united states rodríguez,cir distinguishing between waived claims and forfeited claims with respect to appellate review.in an effort to skirt this barrier,green maintains that the waiver doctrine requires a deliberate action,see,and that there is no indication that its failure to renew its request was deliberate.but claims of error can be deemed waived and where,as here,a party in effect trades a chance having the jury polled for better odds seeding the record with a promising issue for appeal,we think that deliberateness may be inferred.as we said in a different but analogous setting,t o hold otherwise would place a premium on agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.reilly united states,cir quoting merchant ruhle,cir.
to be sure,there may be an alternative explanation for what occurred that green attorneys were asleep at the switch.but even assuming,favorably to green,that the claim was forfeited rather than waived,the verdict would nonetheless be unimpugnable.appellate review of forfeited claims is for plain error,see rodríguez,at,and green claim stumbles at the third step of the framework.
the third step of review embodies a requirement that the asserted error be shown to have affected a party substantial rights.see duarte,at.for an error to affect a party substantial rights,it must be prejudicial.see id.at see also johnson united states,approving inquiry into harmlessness of error under review even in cases involving structural error.in the context of a failure to poll the jury,we think that carrying this burden requires,at the very least,some showing that the verdict was rendered under circumstances indicating a possible lack of unanimity or assent.see united states lemmerer,cir verser,at finding prejudice,in analogous circumstances,due in part to the jury initial indication that it was deadlocked,and the speed with which it then returned a verdict united states luciano,cir indicating that prejudice would exist where judge raced to record verdict despite jurors who expressed a lingering doubt.
in this case,there is nothing that might suggest to even the most wary observer that the jurors were not all of one mind.the court emphasized in its charge that the jurors verdict must be unanimous and the record offers no reason for disregarding the presumption that jurors obey such instructions.see lemmerer,at.just before the verdict was announced albeit incompletely,the court inquired whether the jurors had reached a unanimous verdict.they collectively responded in the affirmative.after the verdict had been announced,the court asked,is that the true and accurate verdict of each and every one of you all of the jurors answered yes.last but not least,in denying relief the district court noted that there was nothing in the jurors demeanor or behavior to suggest that any one of them did not agree with the verdict.green has pointed to nothing that impugns this assessment.
that ends this aspect of the matter.even if the request was merely forfeited,the poll omission can not be said to have affected green substantial rights.there was no plain error.
a silver bullet 
we move now to the district court amendment of the judgment a ruling that green challenged both at the time and in its subsequent new trial motion.we review this ruling,too,for abuse of discr
