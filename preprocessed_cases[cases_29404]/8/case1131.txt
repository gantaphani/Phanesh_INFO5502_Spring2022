these in tandem appeals arise from related suits brought in the aftermath of the initial public offering by nominal defendant facebook,facebook,the world largest social media company.in these putative shareholder derivative actions,plaintiffs allege that facebook directors breached duties owed to the company because its registration statement failed to disclose the impact of mobile usage on the company projected growth.
one of the putative derivative actions was filed in the southern district of new york.a related action was filed in california state court,and removed to the northern district of california.a third was filed in the delaware court of chancery,and removed to the united states district court for the district of delaware.before the putative derivative plaintiffs could litigate motions to remand to state court,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all of the actions to the united states district court for the southern district of new york sweet.
the district court dismissed all of the actions on threshold grounds,ruling that i plaintiffs were not actual or equitable owners of facebook stock at the time of the alleged wrongdoing,ii plaintiffs failed to adequately plead demand futility,and that iii the claims were unripe.plaintiffs in the removed actions argue that the court erred in considering these bases for dismissal before adjudicating subject matter jurisdiction.the plaintiff in the action originally filed in the southern district of new york appeals the dismissal of his action on these threshold grounds.the removed plaintiffs join,in the alternative,in these arguments.
facebook urges this court to affirm the district court in all respects,proffers additional bases to support subject matter jurisdiction as to the removed actions,and asserts a conditional pertaining to the district court refusal to enforce a forum selection clause adopted before plaintiffs filed suit.
we conclude that it was not error for the district court to decide,as a threshold matter,whether plaintiffs adequately pleaded contemporaneous share ownership,as required by federal rule of civil procedure.because none of the putative derivative plaintiffs satisfied this requirement,we affirm.we do not reach the additional bases for dismissal invoked by the district court,or advanced by facebook.
background 
facebook may,initial public offering the ipo was one of the largest in history.in preparation for this event closely watched by investors,the press,and the public facebook filed a form s registration statement the registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec.the registration statement is a disclosure document that requires a public company to,inter alia,detail its current business model and its competition,provide a prospectus of the planned security,provide information on the offering price and methodology for setting the price,disclose risks,and disclose material dealings between the company and its directors several months after the filing of the registration statement,facebook gave its lead underwriters goldman,sachs,morgan stanley,and morgan securities llc the underwriters revenue projections for the second quarter and full year of.
facebook supplemented its registration statement on may with a free writing prospectus,a,disclosure,which identified a trend the number of facebook users was increasing more rapidly than the number of advertisements.facebook offered the view that this trend was driven,at least in part,by increased usage of facebook on mobile devices,on which it had only an immaterial number of sponsored stories in users news feeds,and which displayed fewer advertisements per page compl,crocitto zuckerberg,cv crocitto compl.after the free writing prospectus was filed,facebook called analysts at the company underwriters to ensure that they were aware of the filing,and to provide them with lower revenue estimates,which were to percent off of the company earlier five billion dollar target for id.the underwriters updated their models based on this information and shared their revised models with certain institutional investors.
the final registration statement,filed on may,included the following disclosures 
facebook did not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from mobile usage 
its revenue would be negatively affected if it was unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for its mobile users 
its ability to monetize use on mobiles devices was unproven 
daily mobile users were increasing more rapidly than advertisements and,
it believed usage of facebook on mobile devices would continue to grow.

notwithstanding these predictions and disclosures,facebook registration statement provided that,in consultation with its underwriters,it had increased its ipo price range from between to dollars per share to between to dollars per share.
facebook prospectus,issued two days later,warned that the company generated a substantial majority of its revenue from advertising,and that the loss of advertisers,or reduction in spending by advertisers with facebook,could seriously harm its business.compl,levy andreessen,civ.levy compl.
that same day,on may,facebook offered million shares of common stock to the public at dollars per share,thereby valuing the ipo at more than billion dollars.
the day after,the press reported that facebook had altered its guidance on earnings before the ipo.plaintiffs allege that the public never found out about these revised numbers until after the ipo had been priced.crocitto compl.in the ensuing days,additional media coverage suggested that the underwriters had cut their earnings forecasts prior to the ipo based on allegedly selective disclosures.plaintiffs allege that when the market learned of this,the stock price was hammered.levy compl.
plaintiffs,and other shareholders whose litigation is not now at issue,filed overlapping putative derivative actions in california superior court,delaware chancery court,and the southern district of new york.all of the derivative actions alleged that facebook directors breached their duties to shareholders because the registration statement did not include a sufficient description of the effect that increasing mobile usage was projected to have on the company revenue growth.several of the actions alleged an oversight theory of liability.others alleged that three of the directors ipo sales of facebook stock amounted to insider trading.
plaintiff robert crocitto,who filed his case in the southern district of new york,alleged that he beneficially purchased facebook shares through the purchase of series membership units of sharespost private investments ii,llc.crocitto compl.sharespost private investments ii,llc sharespost is an investment vehicle,which held facebook shares.the subscription agreement governing crocitto purchase of the series membership units sharespost units provided the subscriber acknowledges that it has no direct interest in any facebook securities,and that the facebook securities are held solely by the company.crocitto at.according to crocitto own complaint,t he series membership units converted into class b common stock of facebook after the ipo.crocitto compl.an from sharespost,which crocitto attached to his amended complaint,confirms that crocitto received the shares in november six months after the ipo.crocitto at.
like crocitto,plaintiff gaye jones purchased sharespost units her subscription agreements stated that she acknowledged that she had no direct interest in any facebook securities.jones at.also,as with crocitto,the subscription agreement stated that the sharespost manager in its sole discretion shall have the right,but not the obligation to distribute the facebook shares.id.at.
plaintiff lidia levy,who originally filed her action in california,alleged that she was an owner and holder of facebook common stock continuously since may,having purchased shares in the open market the day of facebook ipo.levy compl.
facebook successfully removed the state court actions to federal courts,and asked the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl panel to transfer these removed actions to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.plaintiffs moved to remand the actions to the state courts facebook,in turn,moved to dismiss.while the remand and dismissal motions were pending,the mdl panel granted the motion to transfer.in re facebook,ipo sec.derivative,d.the mdl panel observed that p laintiffs in the removed derivative actions could present their pending motions for remand to state court to the transferee court.id.at.
following the transfer,plaintiffs renewed their motions to remand,and facebook sought dismissal of all of the related derivative actions.in granting facebook motion to dismiss,the district court concluded that a ruling on subject matter jurisdiction would involve a possible arduous inquiry.in re facebook,ipo sec.derivative,wl,at.specifically,in parsing plaintiffs myriad claims,the court would have had to delve into complicated issues of state law,and would have had to decide whether any of plaintiffs claims necessarily raise a federal question,in addition to issues arising under the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa.id.accordingly,it held that it had discretion to decide certain threshold grounds for dismissal without first adjudicating whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over the removed cases.
as to the allegation of stock ownership advanced by crocitto and jones,the district court held that ownership of sharespost units did not constitute ownership in facebook,equitable or otherwise.therefore,these plaintiffs could not pursue their claims in a derivative capacity.as to levy,the court concluded that she too failed to plead the required contemporaneous ownership.the gravamen of levy complaint challenged disclosures that were made before the ipo,but she did not allege that she acquired facebook shares before the ipo rather,she purchased facebook stock in the ipo.
jones and levy,plaintiffs in the removed actions,argue that the court erred by deciding the motion to dismiss before adjudicating their motions to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.crocitto,who originally filed his complaint in the southern district of new york,does not contest subject matter jurisdiction,and argues solely that dismissal was improper.jones and levy join,in the alternative,in this argument.
discussion 
when a determination as to subject matter jurisdiction raises a difficult or novel question,the district court has discretion to decide certain threshold bases for dismissal without deciding whether it has subject matter jurisdiction.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil.we review such an exercise of discretion for abuse of discretion.see id.whether contemporaneous stock ownership is the type of threshold question that can be resolved before adjudicating a motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.see scalisi fund asset,cir w here a challenge is made to the legal precepts applied by the district court in making a discretionary determination,plenary review of the district court choice and interpretation of those legal precepts is appropriate.
rule provides that,in a derivative action,the complaint must allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction complained of,or that the plaintiff share of membership later devolved on it by operation of law.b.we review de novo the district court dismissal on the ground that plaintiffs lacked standing to proceed in a derivative capacity because they were not contemporaneous stock owners for purposes of rule.see in re bank of derivative,cir 
the supreme court has made clear that a court should not assume hypothetical jurisdiction over a case for purposes of adjudicating the merits when its jurisdiction is in doubt,because to do so would carr y the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action.steel citizens for a better.at the same time,the court has recognized that in cases removed from state court to federal court,as in cases originating in federal court,there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy,ruhrgas,at,and a court need not make a difficult determination as to subject matter jurisdiction when another clear threshold defect would warrant denying audience to a case on the merits.sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,internal quotation marks omitted holding that a district court has discretion to grant a defendant forum non conveniens motion to transfer before disposing of any other threshold challenges.
it is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.ruhrgas,at.thus,district courts do not overstep article iii limits when they decline jurisdiction of claims on discretionary grounds without determining whether those claims fall within their pendant jurisdiction,or abstain under younger harris,without deciding whether the parties present a case or controversy.ruhrgas,at internal citations omitted.and,under certain circumstances,questions of statutory standing may properly be treated before article iii standing.ortiz fireboard.the district court dismissal of all three actions was not based on any deficiency as to the merits of the allegations pleaded rather it was based,inter alia,on lack of standing to proceed in a derivative capacity because plaintiffs were not contemporaneous stock owners.that procedure did not run afoul of the ordinary rule that an article iii court must be sure of its own jurisdiction before getting to the merits.id.
a derivative action is an exception to the normal rule that the proper party to bring a suit on behalf of a corporation is the corporation itself,acting through its directors or a majority of its shareholders.halebian berv,cir internal quotation marks omitted.failure to satisfy the contemporaneous ownership requirement of rule does not,of course,raise a jurisdictional issue under article iii.rather,it means that the putative derivative plaintiff does not have standing to represent the interests of the nominal defendant in a derivative capacity.see,berni int l gourmet rests.of,cir ruling former shareholders lacked standing to pursue a derivative action.and,the supreme court has already recognized that a prudential standing question,analogous to the derivative standing question presented here,is the type of threshold inquiry a court may make before engaging in a jurisdictional analysis.see kowalsi tesmer,assuming article iii standing to address the alternative threshold question whether attorneys had standing see also tenet doe,t he prudential standing doctrine represents the sort of threshold question we have recognized may be resolved before addressing jurisdiction.internal quotation marks omitted.
another consideration counsels in favor of our conclusion that the district court properly bypass ed,sinochem,at,the jurisdictional inquiry to dismiss the case for failure to plead contemporaneous stock ownership.the complicated questions of subject matter jurisdiction arise in this case only if plaintiffs may properly proceed in a derivative capacity.
supreme court precedent in the class certification context suggests that if a threshold,basis for dismissal is logically antecedent to the adjudication of an alleged jurisdictional defect,the court is not required to decide the jurisdictional question.specifically,the court explained that the class certification issues could properly be treated before article iii standing.ortiz,at internal quotation marks omitted see also amchem,windsor,the third circuit declined to reach questions of subject matter jurisdiction because they would not exist but for the certification.we agree that the class certification issues are dispositive because their resolution here is logically antecedent to the existence of any article iii issues,it is appropriate to reach them first.internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.
as noted,federal rule of civil procedure requires that the plaintiff in a derivative action demonstrate possession of an ownership interest in the company it seeks to represent that is contemporaneous with the conduct for which it seeks recovery.b.the
