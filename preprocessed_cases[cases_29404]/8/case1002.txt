owners of real property in rhode island were disadvantaged by being part of a group required to pay their real estate taxes annually rather than quarterly.these property owners,whose mortgage companies held their tax payments in escrow,were required to pay taxes in one lump sum other property owners,who paid their taxes directly to the municipalities,could choose to pay quarterly.the quarterly payment method is more favorable to the taxpayer because it permits the taxpayer to receive the interest on the escrowed funds until the quarter in which payment is due.
the desires of aggrieved local taxpayers to assert their claims against municipal tax collectors in federal court are pitted against the comity interests urging restraint in the exercise of federal court jurisdiction over state tax matters.the comity interests prevail the plaintiffs are left to the recourse available to them in state court.we reject as well the claim that certain private actors are state actors and affirm the dismissal of pendent state claims.
the escrow accounts relevant to this case were held by federally regulated banks,mortgage companies,and escrow agents.under the authority of the real estate settlement procedures act respa,the federal department of housing and urban development hud,has promulgated a regulation,known as regulation x,which reads in relevant part 
for the payment of property taxes from the escrow account,if a taxing jurisdiction offers a servicer a choice between annual and installment disbursements,the servicer must also comply with this paragraph k.if the taxing jurisdiction neither offers a discount for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis nor imposes any additional charge or fee for installment disbursements,the servicer must make disbursements on an installment basis.
fed.reg,emphasis added codified at k this requirement benefits the borrower because quarterly payment generally makes more sense for borrowers than does an lump sum annual payment.the following paragraph of the regulation permits the borrower and loan servicer to agree otherwise,provided the agreement is voluntary and uncoerced.k.respa regulates the mortgage and escrow companies it does not regulate municipalities.
after the passage of regulation x,many lenders in rhode island continued to make annual,rather than quarterly,payments of property taxes from escrow accounts.the difference in treatment between payments from escrow accounts and direct payments from taxpayers had arisen because the taxing municipalities took the position that taxpayers who paid through escrow accounts were not persons assessed entitled to make payment on a quarterly basis under the relevant statute,laws on this interpretation of rhode island law,the municipalities were not taxing jurisdiction s which offer ed a choice,k,between annual and quarterly payment,so that regulation x did not apply.understandably unhappy with the overescrowing of their accounts,the taxpayers took their problem to the attorney general of rhode island,who agreed with them that rhode island law,properly read,did not permit a distinction between the two groups of taxpayers.in the attorney general so advised the various municipalities and threatened to sue them if they did not mend their ways.
thereafter,in,the rhode island general assembly amended the statute.under that amendment,persons assessed now expressly includes mortgage companies and escrow agents.the legislature also provided,however,that local tax collectors who had read the statute otherwise in the past would be considered to have followed the law.see pub.laws ch.codified at laws.the local governments of rhode island appear now to comply with the law.
although the practice of overescrowing had ended,the plaintiff group of taxpayers still faced the problem of the loss of the use of their money due to overescrowing from to.the municipalities,and not the taxpayers,had received the interest on the sums paid prematurely.the taxpayers felt they were entitled to be made whole.
marie tomaiolo and a group of other named plaintiffs for simplicity,we will refer from now on to tomaiolo alone sued the tax collectors and almost all of rhode island municipalities the municipal defendants,transamerica corporation,and individuals employed by transamerica real estate tax service trets.trets is the nation largest tax servicing firm and a division of transamerica.tomaiolo alleged that transamerica and the individual employees the escrow defendants were state actors and that all the defendants collectively 
deprived affected taxpayers of their property the tax payments,or at least the interest on them without due process of law because the process due was that provided by respa,regulation x,and in violation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause 
interfered with the taxpayers rights to fair and equal taxation under that amendment equal protection clause 
violated the taxpayers rights under article,section of the rhode island constitution,requiring equal distribution of the burdens of government and guaranteeing due process and equal protection of the laws

we address the questions presented by this appeal in the following order.first,we hold that tomaiolo claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot.second,we hold that she may not recover money damages against the municipal defendants under the authority of fair assessment.third,we hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her claim under against the escrow defendants because those defendants were not acting under color of state law,as that statute requires.fourth,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over some,but not all,of the state law claims,and that it dealt correctly with those it addressed.
mootness of claims for injunctive and declaratory relief 
tomaiolo claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot and indeed were moot before the district court dismissed them.the conduct by the municipal defendants of which tomaiolo is,their demand in alleged violation of federal and state law that she and her class pay their property taxes annually rather than ceased.there is,of course,the familiar principle that a request for injunctive or declaratory relief does not become moot simply because a defendant voluntarily ceases the allegedly unlawful conduct,friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the actions of the municipal defendants,however,were not voluntary but rather compelled by superior state officials the attorney general in,and the state legislature in.tomaiolo claims for injunctive and declaratory relief concern conduct with no possibility of recurring,and are moot.see united states grant.counsel for tomaiolo conceded this point at oral argument.tomaiolo claims for damages remain.we will address these claims separately as to the municipal and the escrow defendants.
dismissal of federal claims against municipal defendants 
the district court dismissed without prejudice the claims against the municipal defendants on the basis that the claims were barred by the tax injunction act and by principles of comity.
the tax injunction act,comity,and 
our analysis of the district court decision to dismiss this claim is governed by the standard laid down by the supreme court in the case of fair assessment in real estate ass n,mcnary,d.under that standard,tomaiolo can not obtain damages for the administration of a state tax system under,even though that administration may have violated federal law,so long as state law provides her a plain,complete,and adequate remedy.id.at.before we apply fair assessment standard,however,a brief discussion of the case and subsequent developments may clarify the relevant law.
the tax injunction act of provides in its entirety 
the district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.
the act limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts,rather than merely restricting the remedies available in a given civil action.trailer marine transport rivera vazquez,cir.
by its terms the act applies to actions in which plaintiffs seek injunctions against state officers.the supreme court did not address the question whether the act applies to actions in which plaintiffs seek damages until.that year,in fair assessment,a group of property owners brought a suit for damages under,claiming that their county tax assessors had denied them equal protection and deprived them of their property without due process of law by failing to reassess old properties in a timely fashion and by retaliating against those who successfully appealed property assessments.at.in deciding the case,the supreme court stated that it would not rely on the tax injunction act.id.at.instead,it held that the principle of comity between the federal and state principle embodied in,but not limited to,the a federal court from considering the damages claim.id.at.the court said as well that the principle of comity would not apply to a case in which a state provided no plain,adequate,and complete remedy for violations of federal law in the tax collection process.id.at.
the court has since explained that what it did in fair assessment was to construe,in light of the principle of comity,to provide no cause of action for damages in state tax cases.in lehman lycoming county children services agency,d,the court noted that in fair assessment it had conclude d that does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to hear suits for tax refunds when state law provides an adequate remedy.id.at.in national private truck council,oklahoma tax commission,d,the court stated that in fair assessment the principle of noninterference with state taxation led us to construe narrowly.id.at.most recently,in quackenbush allstate insurance,d,the court observed that in national private truck council it had indicated that fair assessment was a case about the scope of the cause of action.id.at.accordingly,it is clear that fair assessment applies to this case,because tomaiolo is bringing a action for damages suffered in the allegedly unlawful administration of a state tax system.it is less a matter of supreme court the tax injunction act itself applies 
application to this case 
we proceed to apply fair assessment to this case.if tomaiolo is alleging that rhode island officials have administered the tax system of that state in violation of the federal constitution,she may not bring a case in federal court so long as rhode island provides a remedy for such violations that is plain,adequate,and complete 
tomaiolo complaint,summarized above,demonstrates that she is indeed alleging that the administration of rhode island tax system violated federal law.she responds,however,that she is not challenging the validity of applicable state law,but is merely alleging that the municipal defendants,conspiring with the escrow defendants,misinterpreted that state law that their misinterpretation put them in conflict with respa and that it also led to constitutional violations.a claim that a misinterpretation of state law led to violations of federal rights is still a claim that local officials broke federal law in interpreting and applying state law.tomaiolo argument amounts to a distinction without a difference.moreover,if underlying her federal arguments is a fundamental assertion that defendants violated state law,all the more reason to defer to the state system to determine what state law means.
tomaiolo does not seriously contest that rhode island provides a plain,adequate,and complete remedy through which taxpayers may contest their taxes and have their federal claims heard in state court.see,oster tellier,holding certain provisions of the rhode island tax code under laws unconstitutional but declining to award rebate for failure of proof of an ascertainable amount of damages see also sterling shoe norberg.p laintiff constitutional attack upon the adequacy of rhode island statutory scheme to contest tax assessments is wholly insubstantial.tomaiolo offers nothing to contradict that conclusion.in fact,she filed an identical action in the rhode island superior court,which has effectively been stayed pending the outcome of this action.
she does raise two additional arguments,which we discuss briefly.first,she argues that the outcome we reach conflicts with the historical role of the federal courts as a forum for the enforcement of federal rights,citing cases such as wright roanoke redevelopment housing authority,d,in which the court held that provided a cause of action for residents of federally funded public housing against the local housing authority that administered their program.in fair assessment itself,the court balanced the conceded interests of plaintiffs in a federal forum against the interests of state and local defendants in the uninterrupted operation of their tax systems.at.noting that the court reached its result despite the ready access to federal courts provided by monroe pape,d,and its progeny.tomaiolo argument has therefore already been taken into consideration in formulating the rule we apply.
second,she argues that this case differs from fair assessment because in that case the alleged official misconduct was continuing,so that a federal court damages award would in effect have halted it.in this case,she says,the alleged misconduct has ceased,so that federal intervention would operate only to cure the past wrong and not to affect the present operation of the system.we reject this argument because the procedure by which a state taxpayer may obtain a refund of an allegedly illegally collected tax is no less a part of the smooth functioning of the state tax system than the collection of the taxes in the first place.perhaps,as tomaiolo maintains,the disruption we would cause by intervening would be less on the facts of this case.any such difference would not be so great as to justify recognizing an exception to fair assessment along the lines she proposes.
thus,we agree that the federal claims against the municipal defendants were properly dismissed under fair assessment.
dismissal of federal claims against escrow defendants 
tomaiolo alleged that the escrow defendants acted under color of state law and thus could be reached under.unless the escrow defendants were state actors,either directly or by a close enough nexus to the state in defined ways,there is neither a claim nor a claim against them for violation of constitutional rights.see yeo town of lexington,cir discussing the requirement of state action for claims under the fourteenth amendment and.we do not reach the question whether tomaiolo otherwise asserts a cognizable claim that her constitutional rights and those of her class were violated.
we summarize briefly the relevant facts.on a grant of summary judgment,these facts are read in the light most favorable to tomaiolo.mccarthy,at.hud issued the amendments to regulation x relevant to this action in october.trets then or shortly thereafter realized that the amendments would change the way it handled escrow accounts across the country.mark williams,who managed tre
