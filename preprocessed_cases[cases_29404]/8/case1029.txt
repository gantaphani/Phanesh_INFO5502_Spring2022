chapter debtor robert spenlinhauer appeals from a district court order which affirmed a bankruptcy court ruling authorizing the chapter trustee to sell certain property of the chapter estate to the estranged siblings of the chapter debtor.we dismiss the appeal due to lack of jurisdiction.
background 
the chapter debtor and his two brothers established the jrs trust in for the purpose of leasing certain real estate situated in wells,maine when robert spenlinhauer filed a voluntary chapter petition in,his beneficial interest in the jrs trust became property of the chapter estate by operation of law.the case was converted to a chapter liquidation proceeding in,whereupon the appellee became the chapter trustee.beginning in,the trustees of the jrs,debtor brothers,john and stephen,and the chapter the terms of a sublease which the jrs trust had entered into with spencer press,a company controlled by the spenlinhauer family 
in,the chapter trustee filed a notice of sale with the bankruptcy court,see bankruptcy code,proposing to sell the chapter estate beneficial interest in the jrs trust to john and stephen spenlinhauer hereinafter purchasers for.the notice of sale did not expressly provide that the chapter trustee would also release the purchasers from any potential liability,either to the chapter estate or to the chapter debtor,arising from the purchasers administration of the jrs trust.
the chapter debtor then brought suit in federal district court against spencer press and the jrs trust trustees,claiming that their sublease renegotiations were conducted in violation of the automatic stay provisions.see bankruptcy code a a.simultaneously,in the pending bankruptcy court proceeding,the chapter debtor objected to the proposed sale,contending that the sublease renegotiations conducted by the purchasers violated the automatic stay,breached their fiduciary duties as trustees of the jrs trust,and seriously devalued the chapter debtor interest in the jrs trust,thereby rendering the proposed sale price inadequate.
on november,the bankruptcy court conducted a telephonic hearing on the chapter trustee section notice of sale,during which the chapter debtor contended that his causes of action against the purchasers for allegedly violating the automatic stay and breaching their fiduciary duties should not be included in the sale proposed by the chapter trustee,since these assets were distinct from his beneficial interest in the jrs trust.the chapter trustee responded that these causes of action were of questionable merit and value,and,in any event,that his sale of the underlying trust interest to the purchasers might,by necessary implication,release the purchasers from the claims asserted by the chapter debtor.the purchasers informed the bankruptcy court that though they had not requested a release of claims from the chapter trustee as part of the proposed sale,they nonetheless preferred a release,given the chapter debtor litigation posture.after observing that the notice of the proposed sale contained no release of claims,the bankruptcy court continued the telephonic hearing for one week in order to permit the chapter trustee to reevaluate all the facts and circumstances of the sale.
on november,the day the hearing resumed,the purchasers submitted the affidavit of gordon ayer,ayer affidavit,to spencer press,describing in detail the sublease renegotiations conducted in between spencer press and the jrs trust.during the reconvened hearing,counsel to the chapter debtor informed the bankruptcy court that he was at a bit of a disadvantage because he had not yet received the ayer affidavit,thus it was very difficult to address it in any fashion or to have submitted countering affidavits.in addition,the purchasers stated that a release of all claims must be part of the consideration for their purchase.
in light of the chapter debtor failure to adduce evidence that there had been any violation of the automatic stay or breach of fiduciary duty by the chapter trustee,the bankruptcy court announced that it would approve the sale of the chapter estate interest in the jrs trust,as well as the release of any potential causes of action against the purchasers arising from their administration of the jrs trust.thus,the court held that the purchasers had purchased in good faith,within the meaning of bankruptcy code m,m.
subsection m provides that t he reversal or modification on appeal of a bankruptcy court authorization of a sale does not affect the validity of a sale to an entity that purchased such property in good faith unless such authorization and such sale were stayed pending appeal.prior to hearing from counsel to the chapter debtor,the bankruptcy court announced its intention to deny any motion for stay.whereupon counsel to the chapter debtor interjected b y not asking for a stay,we are not giving up our rights to appeal.
in due course,the chapter debtor appealed to the district court.the district court upheld the determination that the purchasers were purchasers in good faith under subsection m,but remanded to the bankruptcy court to reevaluate whether the terms of the sale fairly encompassed a release of the chapter debtor putative causes of action against the purchasers.in re spenlinhauer.
following the remand,after yet another hearing,the bankruptcy court ruled that it could not undertake further inquiry into the scope of the sale since the district court had upheld the purchasers good faith status on appeal,and consequently subsection m precluded any reassessment of the terms of the sale consummated on november.the chapter debtor once again appealed to the district court,which adopted the bankruptcy court rationale on remand,and affirmed.in re spenlinhauer,wl.
discussion 
the chapter debtor urges us to reverse the november,order confirming the sale,for the following reasons,among others the chapter trustee concededly failed to follow the local bankruptcy court rule which requires the parties to submit their supporting affidavits not later than one business day prior to a hearing thus,the bankruptcy court abused its discretion i by relying on the pivotal ayer affidavit as evidence of the purchasers good faith,and ii by denying the chapter debtor requests for additional discovery or for an evidentiary hearing aimed at countering the deleterious evidence presented in the ayer affidavit and on remand from the district court,the bankruptcy court erroneously ruled that subsection m precluded its reassessment regarding whether the november,sale encompassed the release of claims,since the finality provisions in subsection m pertain strictly to sales of property,the chapter estate interest in the jrs trust,not to the chapter estate settlement or relinquishment of causes of action acquired by the chapter estate.
on appeal from a district court decision reviewing a bankruptcy court order,we review the bankruptcy court order directly,disturbing its factual findings only if clearly erroneous,while according de novo review to its conclusions of law.in re stoehr stoehr mohamed,cir per curiam.moreover,we may affirm the bankruptcy court order on any ground apparent from the record on appeal.see in re rauh noonan rauh,cir.before we address the substantive claims advanced on appeal,however,we must determine our appellate jurisdiction.
under the bankruptcy code,standing to appeal from a final bankruptcy court order is accorded only to a person aggrieved.see in re thompson kowal malkemus,cir.the person aggrieved paradigm,which delimits appellate jurisdiction even more stringently than the doctrine of article iii standing,see,in re alpex computer nintendo patten,cir in re porter travelers ins.porter,cir bestows standing only where the challenged order directly and adversely affects an appellant pecuniary interests.in re thompson,at.
the advent of the chapter estate and the appointment of the chapter trustee divest the chapter debtor of all right,title and interest in nonexempt property of the estate at the commencement of the case.see bankruptcy code a,a,since title to property of the estate no longer resides in the chapter debtor,the debtor typically lacks any pecuniary interest
