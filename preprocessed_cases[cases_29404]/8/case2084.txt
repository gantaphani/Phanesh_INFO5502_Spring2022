this motion to reinstate a dismissed appeal presents the narrow issue of whether to enforce the time limit agreed to by the parties in a stipulation approved by this court at a time when it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the appeal.rona hertzner moves for reinstatement of her appeal from the judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york jacob mishler,district judge dismissing her title vii suit against her superiors and other employees at the united states postal service.we conclude that the time limit is enforceable and that the appellant failed,without justification,to abide by the limit.we therefore deny the motion to reinstate the appeal.
background 
the district court entered judgment dismissing hertzner complaint on february.she filed a timely notice of appeal on march all relevant dates are for,unless otherwise indicated.on march,prior to filing the notice of appeal,she had filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to rule of the local rules of the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of new york.on may,the parties filed in this court a stipulation withdrawing the appeal without prejudice.the stipulation provided that it was subject to reinstatement by written notification to the clerk of the court within days after judge mishler decides a pending motion for reconsideration and added,if not thus reinstated,this appeal shall be deemed withdrawn with prejudice.
by order entered november,judge mishler denied the motion for reconsideration.on february,beyond the period specified in the stipulation,hertzner moved in this court to reinstate her appeal.that motion was originally granted by our staff attorney office,but,upon reconsideration after receipt of opposition papers from the appellees,the reinstatement order was rescinded.hertzner then filed the pending motion for reinstatement.
discussion 
hertzner motion for reconsideration of the district court judgment was filed within ten days of the entry of that judgment and qualified as a motion under rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.see united states ex rel.mcallan city of new york,cir motion filed within ten days requesting alteration or amendment of judgment is treated as rule e motion,even though denominated as something other than rule motion ametex fabrics,just in materials,cir.when a party files a notice of appeal before a district court disposes of one of the motions listed in rule a a,the notice of appeal becomes effective to appeal a judgment when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.frap a b i see ametex fabrics,at.thus,hertzner notice of appeal,when it was filed on march,was not then effective to appeal the judgment,but became effective on november.during that interval,the parties signed a stipulation to withdraw the appeal,without prejudice to reinstatement within days of a ruling on the motion for reconsideration.this court approved the stipulation.
as an initial matter,we consider the possibility that hertzner is not bound by the time limit of the stipulation because our court lacked jurisdiction to approve the stipulation.preliminarily,we note that hertzner might well be bound by the stipulation as a contract between herself and the appellees,irrespective of our court approval.in any event,we conclude that the suspension of the effectiveness of the notice of appeal precluded our jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the appeal,but did not impair our legal authority to enter housekeeping orders to control our own docket.
it is important that parties retain the authority to execute binding agreements with respect to the processing of appeals that might not be within the jurisdiction of this court,at least at the time the agreements are executed.the attempt to pursue an appeal in this court might be ineffective for various reasons,including the inadequacy of a notice of appeal,the prematurity of such a notice,or,as in this case,the temporary suspension of the effectiveness of a notice of appeal by the timely filing of a motion in the district court.whenever uncertainty exists as to whether an appeal is properly within our jurisdiction,an appellant should be able to eschew controversy over the status of an attempted appeal by entering into a binding stipulation with an appellee to withdraw the attempted appeal and to establish a timetable for reinstatement.our court so ordering of such a stipulation should render it enforceable,provided that the stipulation does not endeavor to permit pursuit of an appeal over which we would lack jurisdiction.if we were to deny the parties the right thus to clean the slate and to establish binding terms for properly perfecting an appeal,we would risk needless controversy between the parties perhaps requiring resolution by this court as to the status of arguably defective appeals and needless uncertainty in the district courts as to whether their jurisdiction has been displaced.the fact that the filing of a motion renders the notice of appeal ineffective until the motion is decided and thereby temporarily destroys our jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal,need not mean that we lack authority to so order and render binding an agreement between the parties concerning the future processing of an appeal.
there is nothing unusual about the authority of a court of appeals to enter orders concerning the processing of an appeal,even in the absence of an effective notice of appeal.for example,prisoners denied habeas corpus relief from a criminal conviction sometimes ask this court,prior to filing a notice of appeal in the district court,to issue a certificate of appealability coa,which is required for an appeal.see c.rather than disclaim all authority to act for lack of a notice of appeal,we send the request for a coa to the district court and instruct that court to construe the request for a coa as a notice of appeal.see marmolejo united states,cir.that step helpfully assists the processing of the appeal by putting it on track for the proper filing of a notice of appeal.similarly,when a notice of appeal is mistakenly sent to this court,we send it to a district court for proper filing.see frap d.
another way to analyze the pending issue is that,just as a court always has jurisdiction to consider its jurisdiction,see united states catholic conference abortion rights mobilization,d oneida indian nation new york,cir,we had a limited jurisdiction not only to decide that we lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate hertzner appeal while her motion was pending,but also to take those steps appropriate to implement a decision declining jurisdiction.clearly we could have granted a motion by the appellees to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.even though no ruling was legally required to deny our jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal while the motion was pending,the provision of frap a b i sufficing for that purpose,our lack of jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal did not preclude us from confirming the jurisdictional situation by so ordering the parties stipulation to withdraw the appeal.that step usefully brought clarity to the situation by making explicit what would otherwise have been inferrable only by examining the federal rules of appellate procedure and the relevant case law.and our authority to so order withdrawal of the appeal included authority to condition reinstatement of the appeal on a reasonable time schedule,especially one agreed to by the parties 
the dissent suggests that by not permitting the appeal to go forward we are letting the parties override the federal rules of appellate procedure.we disagree.although the rules provide that a notice of appeal is rendered ineffective by the filing of a motion and becomes effective upon the decision of such a motion,nothing in the rules prevents the parties from agreeing to withdraw an appeal whether or not the court of appeals then has jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal,and,subject to the approval of the appellate court,agreeing on a timetable for reinstatement of the withdrawn appeal.that is what occurred in this case.moreover,although the appellant did not have to stipulate
