these consolidated appeals arise from a tax dispute between the city of new york the city and certain foreign sovereigns who operate missions to the united nations in the city.for years,the city has assessed property taxes against these missions,maintaining that while those parts of embassy buildings that are used for diplomatic offices are exempt from property taxation under international and state law,other parts of the that are used as residences for employees and their not exempt.appellants,the permanent mission of india to the united nations the india mission and the principal resident representative of the mongolian people republic to the united nations the mongolia mission collectively the missions have resisted paying any property taxes to the city.they contend that their entire embassy buildings are tax exempt.
this dispute,and the litigation it engendered,ultimately prompted the united states department of state department of state or state department to act.in june,the state department issued a notice pursuant to its authority under the foreign missions act,et,establishing an exemption from real property taxes on property owned by foreign governments and used to house the staff of permanent missions to the united nations or the organization of american states or of consular posts.see designation and determination under the foreign missions act the state department notice or the notice.july.the notice stated that this exemption would preempt inconsistent state and local laws and also that it would apply retroactively to taxes that had been previously assessed against the designated property.id.we are now called upon to determine whether the action taken by the state department was within its statutory authority.we conclude that it was.specifically,we hold that the foreign missions act fma permits the state department to designate affirmative benefits such as tax exemptions and that the act allows the state department to make such tax exemptions preemptive of state and municipal tax laws.we also hold that,under the circumstances of this case,the state department acted within its power in designating this benefit as effective retroactively.finally,we conclude that the notice issued by the state department was procedurally proper because it falls within the foreign affairs function exception to notice and comment under the administrative procedure act,a.
background 
the india mission is housed in a story building,located at east street,new york,and owned by the government of the republic of india.the first six floors of the building,as well as the basement and the cellar,are used for diplomatic offices.the remaining floors are dedicated to residential space for security personnel,a driver,and the diplomats of the mission and of india consulate in new york the offices of which are located elsewhere in the city.all of these employees rank below the head of the mission,whose residence is not on site.the mongolian mission is housed in a building at east street in new york city that is owned by the people republic of mongolia.the first two floors are used for the mission offices.the third floor is used for the ambassador apartment.the top two floors are used as apartments for other employees of the mission.
the city has consistently taken the position that mission property used for the residences of employees is subject to taxation,and it has been levying taxes on such properties for years.both the india mission and the mongolia mission have argued that these residences are exempt from taxation under international and new york law because the residences are used for the purposes of the.they have therefore refused to pay any property taxes to the city.by operation of new york law,the unpaid taxes converted into tax liens held by the city against the relevant properties.
in april,the city filed separate complaints against several foreign missions in new york state court pursuant to d,the missions removed the cases to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.in its amended complaints,the city sought judgments for unpaid property taxes and other unpaid charges plus interest.the city also sought declaratory judgments to establish the validity of its tax liens against these missions.after limited jurisdictional discovery,the india mission and the mongolia mission moved to dismiss,contending that,pursuant to the foreign sovereign immunity act fsia,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the district court denied the motion.it concluded that under the fsia provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from jurisdiction in any case in which rights in immovable property situated in the united states are in issue,a the court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of the city tax liens.see city of permanent mission of india to the permanent mission i,d.
the missions filed an interlocutory appeal that was limited exclusively to the jurisdictional issue.we affirmed the judgment of the district court,holding that the immovable property exception to foreign sovereign immunity provided jurisdiction over the matter because what was in dispute was the extent of defendants obligations under local law here,property taxes arising directly out of ownership of real property in the united states.see city of permanent mission of india to the,cir.the supreme court granted certiorari,u,and affirmed.permanent mission of india to the city of.
the cases were then remanded to the district court for proceedings on the merits.the parties for summary judgment on the question of whether the parts of the properties used by india and mongolia to house their staff were subject to real estate taxation.the district court held that they were.see city of permanent mission of india to the permanent mission ii,d.
the district court first addressed the missions claimed tax exemption under the applicable vienna conventions a article of the vienna convention on consular relations,vccr,ratified,for the portions of the premises that house consular staff and b article of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations vcdr,ratified,for the portions of the premises that house the missions.under the vccr,
c onsular premises and the residence of the career head of consular post of which the sending state or any person acting on its behalf is the owner or lessee shall be exempt from all national,regional or municipal dues and taxes whatsoever,other than such as represent payment for specific services rendered.
vccr.c onsular premises are defined in the vccr as the buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto used exclusively for the purposes of the consular post.id.j.as the district court explained,the vcdr reaches the same result as the vccr but through a slightly more circuitous route.permanent mission ii,d at.article of the vcdr defines premises of the mission to comprise 
the buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto,irrespective of ownership,used for the purposes of the mission including the residence of the head of the mission.
vcdr i.article,in turn,provides 
the sending state and the head of the mission shall be exempt from all national,regional or municipal dues and taxes in respect of the premises of the mission,whether owned or leased,other than such as represent payment for specific services rendered.
the district court held that the plain language of the vccr and the vcdr unequivocally supports the city position that the portions of the missions used to house employees and their families are not tax exempt.permanent mission ii,d at.the court reasoned that both the vccr and vcdr limited tax exemptions to the actual office space of the consular or mission premises and to the residence of the head of the mission or consular post.the district court observed that the vccr distinguishes for tax purposes between consular premises and residence,which led the court to conclude that the provision limits the tax exemption respecting residence to the residence of the career head of consular post and none other.id.at.similarly,with respect to the vcdr,the district court found that the two provisions quoted above,when taken together,make plain that the residential exemption from taxes is limited to residence of the head of the mission,and not to others.id.at.
the district court then rejected the missions remaining arguments,including their contention that disputed portions of the missions were exempt from taxation under customary international law see id.at.accordingly,the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment,thereby validating its tax liens and its assessment of taxes with interest against india and mongolia.see id.at.the court asked the parties to submit letters regarding the amounts due to the city.in a subsequent order,the district court rejected all of the missions objections to the city calculations,including their general objection that the interest rates imposed by the city were exorbitant.see city of permanent mission of india to the permanent mission iii,d.judgment was therefore entered against the india mission in the amount of and against the mongolia mission in the amount of.id.at both the india mission and the mongolia mission filed notices of appeal.
on june,while this appeal was pending,the department of state issued a notice entitled designation and determination under the foreign missions act.invoking its authority under the fma,the state department designate d an exemption from real property taxes on property owned by foreign governments and used to house staff of permanent missions to the united nations or the organization of american states or of consular posts as a benefit for purposes of the foreign missions act.id.emphasis added.the notice further explained that the exemption shall be provided to such foreign missions on such terms and conditions as may be approved by the office of foreign missions and that any state or local laws to the contrary are hereby preempted.id.emphasis added.
the notice stated that the action taken was in accord with the tax treatment of foreign property in the united states used as residences for staff of bilateral diplomatic missions and conforms to the general practice abroad of exempting property used for bilateral or multilateral diplomatic and consular mission housing.id.citation omitted.the state department explained its action as follows 
this action is necessary to facilitate relations between the united states and foreign states,to protect the interests of the united states,to allow for a more cost effective approach to obtaining benefits for missions abroad,and to assist in resolving a dispute affecting interests and involving foreign governments which assert that international law requires the exemption from taxation of such diplomatic and consular properties.the dispute has become a major irritant in the united states bilateral relations and threatens to cost the united states hundreds of millions of dollars in reciprocal taxation.as the largest property owner overseas,the united states benefits financially much more than other countries from an international practice exempting staff residences from real property taxes,and it stands to lose the most if the practice is undermined.responsive measures taken against the united states because of the dispute also have impeded significantly the state department ability to implement urgent and congressionally mandated security improvements to our nation diplomatic and consular facilities abroad,imposing unacceptable risks to the personnel working in those facilities.this action will allow the united states to press forward with improvements that will protect those who represent the nation interests abroad.
the state department explicitly addressed the notice intended retroactive effect,asserting that the 
exemption from real property taxes provided by this designation and determination shall apply to taxes that have been or will be assessed against any foreign government with respect to property subject to this determination,and shall operate to nullify any existing tax liens with respect to such property,but shall not operate to require refund of any taxes previously paid by any foreign government regarding such property.
id.emphasis added.finally,the state department indicated that the actions taken in the notice are not exclusive and are independent of alternative legal grounds that support tax exemption.id.
we granted the government motion to submit out of time an amicus brief formally apprising the court of the notice and discussing its legal implications.we then gave the parties an opportunity to respond,and allowed the government to file a supplemental amicus brief to reply to the city arguments 
the two cases were argued together,and we have now consolidated them for disposition.
discussion 
the state department notice squarely applies to the tax dispute at issue in this case.the notice provides that,as a benefit under the fma,property owned by foreign governments and used to house staff of permanent missions or of consular posts is exempt from real property taxation states that any state or local laws to the contrary,such as those of new york city,are preempted and expressly states that the tax exemption is to apply retroactively to taxes that have previously been assessed and shall operate to nullify any existing tax liens with respect to the affected property.emphasis added.therefore,if the state department issuance of the notice was procedurally proper,and if the actions taken in the notice are within the secretary lawful authority under the fma,then the notice is dispositive of this case and requires that we find in favor of the missions irrespective of whether the missions are also entitled to immunity from taxation under either international or state law.
after outlining the relevant provisions of the fma,we address the issue of whether the notice establishing the tax exemption as a benefit is lawful as applied prospectively.we then consider whether it was within the state department authority to designate such a benefit to be effective retroactively.finally,we address whether the notice was procedurally proper,given that it was promulgated without notice and comment.
the fma was enacted in to support the secure and efficient operation of united states missions abroad,to facilitate the secure and efficient operation in the united states of foreign missions,and to assist in obtaining appropriate benefits,privileges,and immunities for those missions and organizations and to require their observance of corresponding obligations in accordance with international law.b.the act legislative history indicates that congress was troubled by the fact that an increasing number of countries denied united states missions suitable locations or rights to property or facilities,resulting in increased costs and diminished security and effectiveness.see,at.the act was designed to address this serious and growing imbalance between the treatment accorded in many countries to official missions of the united states and that made available to foreign government missions in the united states.id.at.congress sought to accomplish this by creating a statutory scheme that vests broad discretion in the secretary of state to exercise authority over foreign missions in light of relevant foreign policy considerations and concerns.republic of benin mezei,d.to this end,the act specifies that the treatment to be accorded to a foreign mission in the united states shall be determined by the secretary of state after due consideration of the benefits,privileges,and immunities provided to missions of the united states in the country or territory represented by that foreign mission c.
the term benefit whose meaning is central to the state department notice and the city challenge to defined under section a to mean 
any acquisition,or authorization for an acquisition,in the united states by or for a foreign mission,including the acquisition of a real property,b public services,c supplies,maintenance,and transportation,d locally engaged staff,e travel and related services,f protective services,and g financial and currency exchange services,and includes such other benefits as the secretary may designate.
a emphasis added.section b directs that determinations with respect to the meaning and applicability of terms listed in section a including benefit are committed to the discretion of the secretary.the legislative history indicates that this provision was included to avoid conflicting interpretations by different government agencies and courts and potential litigation that might detract from the efficient implementation of the fma or might adversely affect the management of foreign affairs,at.
section specifies the functions to be carried out by the secretary.they include,inter alia,a ssist ing agencies of federal,state,and municipal government with regard to ascertaining and according benefits,privileges,and immunities to which a foreign mission may be entitled,and p rovid ing or assist ing in the provision of benefits for or on behalf of a foreign mission in accordance with section of the act.u.section governs the p rovision of benefits.pursuant to it,the secretary may provide benefits,subject to any terms and conditions that she specifies,either u pon the request of a foreign mission,a,or when the secretary determines that such action is reasonably necessary on the basis of reciprocity or otherwise to help meet certain foreign policy goals including 
to facilitate relations between the united states and a sending state,to protect the interests of the united states,to adjust for costs and procedures of obtaining benefits for missions of the united states abroad,to assist in resolving a dispute affecting united states interests and involving a foreign mission or sending state,or to implement an exchange of property between the government of the united states and the government of a foreign country 
id.at b.if the secretary determines that action is necessary,then she may require a foreign mission a to obtain benefits from or through the secretary on such terms and conditions as the secretary may approve,or b to forego the acceptance,use,or relation of any benefit or to comply with such terms and conditions as the secretary may determine id.at b.
the fma includes a section that addresses preemption.that section provides in full 
notwithstanding any other law,no act of any federal agency shall be effective to confer or deny any benefit with respect to any foreign mission contrary to this chapter.nothing in section,or addressing the property of foreign missions of this title may be construed to preempt any state or municipal law or governmental authority regarding zoning,land use,health,safety,or welfare,except that a denial by the secretary involving a benefit for a foreign mission within the jurisdiction of a particular state or local government shall be controlling.
id.at emphasis added.
section sets forth general provisions for the regulation of foreign missions.relevant among them,section a provides the secretary with the authority to issue regulations to carry out the policy of the fma,and section g establishes that e xcept as otherwise provided,any determination required under the fma shall be committed to the discretion of the secretary.
when congress expressly confers to an agency interpretive authority over a statute that the agency is administering,our review of the agency interpretation is limited and deferential.see united states mead,mcnamee dep t of the treasury,cir.we give a policy determination made by an agency pursuant to its explicitly delegated authority controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.abf freight,nlrb,quoting chevron,natural res.def.council.our deference is especially substantial with respect to the state department administration of its delegated responsibilities under the fma because the act deals with an area bound up with security concerns and issues of reciprocity among nations.sheridan kalorama historical ass christopher.we recognize that the state department is best positioned a to assess the impact laws and policies like the city have on the effective functioning of foreign missions in the united states,and b to consider the collateral consequences those laws and policies will have on the interests of the united states missions abroad.
limited review does not,however,mean no review.though the fma vests interpretive discretion in the secretary over certain terms like benefit,it remains incumbent upon us as a court to determine whether the notice exceeds the state department statutory authority.see schweiker gray panthers,indicating that courts do not abdicate review in the context of an express delegation of substantive authority,but instead follow the limited task of ensuring that the secretary did not exceed her delegated authority or issue a regulation that is arbitrary or capricious palestine info.office shultz,explaining that judicial review of executive action under the fma is confined to determining that the secretary acted in conformity with the provisions of the statute.
the first question we must answer,therefore,is whether the fma authorizes the state department to designate property tax exemptions for mission and consular staff residences as benefits.the government,whose position appellants adopt,argues that the notice falls within the expansive authority granted in the fma to the state department.the city argues that it does not,and contends that exemptions from generally applicable local laws,including tax laws,are not within the permissible scope of the statutory term benefit.the city maintains that benefit is used in a technical,narrow,and somewhat sense in the fma.according to the city,the fma authorizes the state department to designate goods and services as benefits only for the purpose of imposing reciprocal restrictions,and not for the purpose of award ing favors to foreign missions by relieving them of their local law obligations.appellee resp.br.to amicus curiae.on this view,benefits are limited to acquisitions of existing real property,and other goods,and services that are readily available to the general public.the city argues that when the state department designates such items as benefits for a foreign mission,the action serves as a potential sanction because the designation gives the state department authority,under section,to impose restrictions on otherwise items as a way to reciprocate for restrictions imposed on united states missions abroad.the city bases its argument on the text and structure of the fma,as well as on the asserted broader purpose of the legislation,which according to the city is embodied both in the statute legislative history and in the manner in which it has subsequently been implemented by the state department.
we begin our interpretation of a federal statute with the statutory text.see united states hasan,cir.section a defines benefit as follows it first provides that benefit means any acquisition,or authorization for an acquisition,of a variety of thereafter enumerated goods and services.a a g.then,in a phrase from aforementioned list of examples,it states that benefit also includes such other benefits as the secretary may designate,id.a.the state department relies on the second part of this definition for the authority to designate as a benefit the tax exemption for mission and consular residences.
we agree that the broad and language of the second part of this definition empowers the state department to grant positive benefits,such as property tax exemptions.nothing in a limits the category of other benefits in the second part of the definition to the enumerated list of acquisition s in the.to the contrary,the illustrations used in the definition are explicitly,and the second part of the definition is best read as authorizing the state department to designate additional benefits that are consistent with the fma general purposes.such a delegation is unexceptional in a statute that confers discretionary authority to an executive department to manage foreign affairs.see zemel rusk,giving the executive authority over matters of foreign of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it customarily wields in domestic areas.and though this delegation is broad,it is not unguided.section c,for instance,directs that the treatment of a foreign mission shall be determined after due consideration of the benefits,privileges,and immunities provided to missions of the united states in the country or territory represented by that foreign mission,as well as matters relating to the protection of the interests of the united states.in addition,section sets forth the grounds on which the secretary should rely in deciding whether to provide benefits and whether to set terms and conditions on their use.indeed,in the notice,the state department expressly referenced the statutory objectives identified in sections and of the fma as the basis for its benefit designation.see.this action is necessary to facilitate relations between the united states and foreign states,to protect the interests of the united states,to allow for a more cost effective approach to obtaining benefits for u.missions abroad,and to assist in resolving a dispute affecting u.interests and involving foreign governments which assert that international law requires the exemption from taxation of such diplomatic and consular properties.
in an attempt to resist this understanding of benefit,the city invokes the principle of ejusdem generis.ejusdem generis is a textual canon of statutory interpretation that instructs courts to interpret a general term in a statute that follows a list of more specific terms to embrace only objects of the same kind or class as the specific ones.united states amato,cir.the city acknowledges,as it must,that the first part of the definition of benefit in section a a g is illustrative rather than exhaustive,but it urges that the illustration serves to restrict the scope of the second part of the definition that gives the secretary authority to designate other benefits.according to the city,the common category established by the list in section a a g,consists of acquisitions of existing real property,goods,and services that are readily available to the public for lawful acquisition.appellee resp.br.to amicus curiae.this restriction of the general term other benefits to items readily available to the public for lawful acquisition fits with the city view of the fma as authorizing the state department to designate benefits exclusively for the purpose of imposing sanctions by restricting access to items.it also necessarily would exclude tax exemptions from the permissible scope of the term because exemptions,by definition,are not generally available to the public,and their recognition as a benefit is a favor to foreign missions,not a sanction.
we find the city textual argument unconvincing.the principle of ejusdem generis is no more than an aid to construction that comes into play only when there is some uncertainty as to the meaning of a particular clause in a statute.see united states turkette.it does not warrant confining the operations of a statute within narrower limits than were intended.united states kennedy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.adopting the city argument would have precisely the effect of imposing limitations on statutory language that is purposefully broad.the dictionary definition of benefit something that promotes or a useful aid,webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged is much more expansive than the city formulation.statutory language,of course,has meaning only in context,graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,internal quotation marks omitted,and so it is possible that congress may use a general word in a sense that is more technical and limited than its standard definition,see norman peterson marital trust,cir.but there is no contextual basis for adopting a narrower than normal meaning here.and we are especially reluctant to use the principle of ejusdem generis to narrow the interpretation of benefit under the fma.for doing so would risk reading judicial limits into a term congress seems deliberately to have sought to leave in order to give the state department flexibility in an area where flexibility is particularly desirable.to the extent that some uncertainty about the scope of the term benefit exists,we are,therefore,guided first and foremost by the fma allocation of interpretive authority rather than by textual canons.see b determinations with respect to the meaning and applicability of the term benefit shall be committed to the discretion of the secretary.
moreover,and even apart from considerations of deference,we doubt that ejusdem generis is relevant to this particular statutory provision.as we previously explained,we read the other benefits part of the definition for benefits as structurally separate from the enumeration in a a g.it follows that we do not regard other benefits as a general term that necessarily embraces the same object as the specific benefits identified the second part of the definition is a delegation,not merely a.see turkette,at explaining that where a statutory provision establishes two separate categories,and the second category does not itself contain a specific enumeration followed by a general description,ejusdem generis has no bearing on the meaning to be attributed to the second category.this conclusion is reinforced when we consider the category to which the city seeks to limit the term benefits.while the specifically enumerated benefits in section a a g all plausibly fit within the category of items to which the state department may restrict access in order impose sanctions,the fma as a whole manifestly also contemplates benefits that do not fit within this limitation.section,for example,declares that the secretary shall p rovide or assist in the provision of benefits for or on behalf of a foreign mission in accordance with section.u.emphasis added.and the city fails to explain why the fma would use words like p rovide and assist if benefits are confined to generally available items upon which the secretary may only place restrictions or conditions.additionally,section a of the act permits the secretary to provide benefits to or for a foreign mission,u pon the request of that foreign mission.if a benefit is always a generally available item,the designation of which is meant to be used as a sanction,it is hard to understand why a foreign mission might request benefits.
we next consider the city argument that the fma purpose and history indicate that congress intended to establish a limited and technical meaning of benefit that the notice in this case contravened.
a review of the legislative history of the fma suggests that the city correctly characterizes the primary mischief that congress intended to address in the statute the imposition of restrictions and burdens on missions overseas and the state department inability to respond with targeted and proportionate measures.congress documented several examples of what it considered unfair treatment by foreign governments that impaired the ability of missions to purchase property abroad and to obtain facilities and services congress also recognized that,at the time,the state department did not have the legal tools to respond to such treatment because it lack ed authority to impose similar restrictions or conditions on other countries in the united states and was instead forced,if it was to act all,to take far more extreme action such as barring the country from using property or declaring some persons persona non grata,at.these extreme remedies were not generally suitable,congress explained,and so they were rarely used.id.by contrast,the fma provided mechanisms whereby the operations of foreign missions in the united states and the benefits available to them from federal,state and local authorities,public utilities,and private persons may be cleared through the federal government and adjusted according to united states needs so that the conditions under which foreign missions operate in the united states can be made to reflect the conditions under which missions of the united states are required to operate in the countries represented by such foreign missions.id.at.in other words,the fma allowed the state department to make the punishment fit the crime,pt,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we reject,however,the city invitation to treat evidence that congress passed the fma in part to create a regime as proof that congress intended to limit the state department authority to designate benefits to this function only.first,we find no evidence that congress sought to proscribe the state department from using benefits as carrots rather than as sticks in instances where the state department believed that doing so would best advance the national interest and improve treatment for united sates missions abroad.the state department made just such a judgment in this case.the notice a describes how the tax treatment foreign missions have received in the united states has led to adverse r esponsive measures taken against the united states and b explains why,if the united states were to pursue reciprocal retaliation rather than confer a positive benefit,it would likely leave the united states worse off.see.as the largest property owner overseas,the united states benefits financially much more than other countries from an international practice exempting staff residences from real property taxes,and it stands to lose the most if the practice is undermined.of course,just because a certain diplomatic tool is desirable does not mean that congress has authorized it.but in the context of a statute in which congress has expressed a clear intention that the executive branch authority be broad,palestine info.office,at,and in which congress gave interpretive authority to the state department to avoid conflicting interpretations by courts,at,it would be improper to read congress focus on the use of benefits as restrictions to exclude,implicitly,such other perfectly ordinary uses of benefits.
second,the legislative history suggests that in addition to providing the state department with new authority to respond to the treatment of united states missions abroad,the fma also had the purpose of giving the state department the ability to assist foreign missions,at their request,to obtain benefits in order to enhance the ability of foreign missions to conduct their representational duties in the united states,at accord,part,at.this additional purpose,which is reflected in statute statement of policy in section b,clearly contemplates the granting of affirmative benefits by the state department.
apart from the legislative history,the city also seeks to rely on the fma regulatory history as providing support for its interpretation.the city contends that while the state department has previously used the fma to impose restrictions on specific foreign missions by placing conditions on their acquisition of property,goods or services,the department has not historically attempted to use its authority under domestic law to grant legal exemptions.the fact that the fma can be used and indeed has been used to impose reciprocal sanctions does not,however,limit the state department authority to designate benefits in other ways that are also consistent with the statute.and in the context of a statute that was designed to facilitate flexibility,we do not believe that the supposed novelty of this benefit designation makes such a designation suspect 
we therefore conclude that the fma empowers the state department to grant positive benefits,as well as to place restrictions on existing benefits.
that the state department is authorized to confer tax exemptions as benefits to foreign missions does not necessarily mean,however,that such benefits preempt state and local tax laws.accordingly,we turn now to the question of the preemptive effect of the state department notice.a federal agency may preempt state regulation and hence render unenforceable state or local laws that are otherwise not inconsistent with federal law provided the agency is acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority.city of fcc,internal quotation marks omitted see also spggc,llc blumenthal,cir federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes.quoting fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta.but an agency literally has no power to act,let alone the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign state,unless and until congress confers power upon it.pub.serv.comm fcc.in determining whether the notice preempts the city property tax laws,we must therefore answer two questions whether the action taken by the state department in the notice was intended to preempt the city property tax laws,and if so whether the state department acted within the scope of its delegated authority in preempting those laws.see drake lab.of am.holdings,cir.
the answer to the first question is not in doubt the state department expressly addressed the preemptive effect of the notice,and provided that any state or local laws to the contrary of the notice benefit designation are hereby preempted.and even aside from that explicit assertion,it is clear that the city property taxes can not coexist with the state department notice,and so,if the latter is valid,it must prevail.see blum bacon,see also wyeth levine,recognizing that an agency regulation with the force of law can preempt conflicting state requirements when the court determines that there is a conflict.
we also answer the second question in the affirmative.the state department acted within its statutory authority in recognizing a property tax exemption as a benefit that has the effect of preempting the city inconsistent tax laws.in reaching this conclusion,we reject the city contention that section provides that nothing in the fma may be construed to preempt any state or municipal law or governmental authority regarding zoning,land use,health,safety,or welfare,except that a denial by the secretary involving a benefit for a foreign mission within the jurisdiction of a particular state or local government shall be controlling,the state department from granting a benefit that affirmatively displaces state or local tax laws.the problem with the city argument is apparent from the text of section emphasized above.section does not bar the state department from providing benefits that contravene all local laws.rather,by its terms it specifically shields only those state or local laws regarding zoning,land use,health,safety,or welfare.the section is tellingly silent with regard to state and local tax laws.
attempting to resist this textual implication,the city argues that the section implicitly forbids any preemption that it does not explicitly authorize.that is,according to the city,the provision allows the state department to exercise negative preemption by issuing controlling denials of benefits that trump contrary zoning,land use,health,safety,or welfare laws that would normally make such benefits available,but it does not otherwise allow the state department to displace state or local law.the city argument for this interpretation relies primarily on its view of the legislative history of section,as well as on background norms of interpretation that establish a presumption against preemption when congress authorizes regulatory action in an area that the states have traditionally occupied,see altria group,good.
with respect to the presumption against preemption,we can readily assume the existence of such a presumption.but we do not believe it affects the issues disputed in this case.as the supreme court has explained,the presumption against preemption is relevant to assessing whether a given state authority conflicts with,and thus has been displaced by,the existence of federal government authority.new york ferc.the presumption also operates when there is doubt about whether congress intended to provide an agency with the authority to preempt.see state rest.ass city bd.of health,cir w here the text of a preemption clause is ambiguous,courts have a duty to accept the reading that disfavors.quoting bates dow agrosciences llc.but neither matter is in doubt here there is no question that the city property tax law conflicts with the state department notice and that the state department intends to supersede that tax law.instead,the dispute is about whether the state department acted lawfully by seeking to preempt state and municipal tax law.resolving this question requires us to determine whether the state department acted within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority,and that is a matter of statutory interpretation that proceeds,in the absence of ambiguity,without any presumption one way or the other.new york,at.it is to this inquiry that we now turn.
the language,structure,and of the fma all strongly indicate that congress meant to give the state department authority to designate benefits that might conflict with and therefore preempt state and local law.see.pub.serv.comm n,at t he best way of determining whether congress intended the regulations of an administrative agency to displace state law is to examine the nature and scope of the authority granted by congress to the agency.as we have already explained,the fma delegation of authority to the state department is exceptionally broad.the secretary of state is given the power not only to designate benefits,a,but also to make d eterminations with respect to the meaning and applicability of that term,id.b.more generally,the act specifies that e xcept as otherwise provided,any determination required under the fma shall be committed to the discretion of the secretary.id.g emphasis added.furthermore,these allocations are made in the context of foreign affairs,the precise realm in which the constitution accords the executive branch greatest power,palestine info.office,at,and which is also an area in which there is often a need for the nation to speak with one voice,see am.ins.garamendi.
the plenitude of executive authority,given to the secretary of state to regulate foreign missions under the fma controls the question of whether the state department acted permissibly in designating a tax exemption benefit that preempted inconsistent state and local tax law.see crosby foreign trade council,concluding that the fullness of presidential authority delegated by congress to impose calibrated sanctions and use economic leverage against a foreign country controll ed the issue of preemption.by granting the state department the power to implement an expansive statutory term benefit and by providing the department with significant discretionary authorities designed to achieve a foreign affairs objective,the fma authorizes the department to take actions that preempt conflicting state or local laws that implicate the department supervisory function over foreign missions.id.it is simply implausible that congress would have gone to such lengths to empower the president if it had been willing to compromise his effectiveness by deference to every provision of state statute or local ordinance that might,if enforced,blunt the consequences of discretionary presidential action.the fma authorizes preemption,that is,unless,as the city argues,section constitutes statutory language to the contrary.
but,understood in context,section supports,rather than detracts from,our conclusion that the state department acted within the scope of its statutory authority.that section demonstrates that congress recognized that the state department might wish to designate benefits that contravened state or local law,and that congress chose to limit the state department authority over some of these laws,namely state or local police powers,to negative preemption only.the city argument to the contrary notwithstanding,section can not in its natural meaning be read as describing the fma scope,but rather as a savings cause that insulates certain listed state and municipal powers from preemption.as such,section provides additional support for the conclusion that the state department has the power to preempt any and all state and local laws that are not specifically protected.see drake,at a narrow saving clause may in some contexts support an inference that preemption is otherwise broad.
the legislative history of section of the fma,which the city recounts at length,if anything gives further backing to this interpretation.while the legislative history confirms that congress was concerned about preemption under the fma and attempted to balance carefully the diplomatic interests of the federal government against the interests of state and local governments,it in no ways suggests that congress intended for section to impose limits on the state department ability to designate tax exemptions with preemptive effect.
the original senate and house bills contained a different preemption provision from the one that was ultimately enacted into law as section.it read 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no act of any state or municipal government authority shall be effective to confer or deny any benefits with respect to any foreign mission contrary to this title.
cong,reproduced in,at,cong,reproduced in,pt,at.according to the reports of both the house and senate committees on foreign affairs,this provision declare d the preemptive effect of the exercise of federal jurisdiction with regard to the conferring or denying of benefits including the location or use of real property which are regulated by this title,at,part,at.the breadth of this preemption provision drew opposition,much of which was directed at the possibility that the fma might conflict with local zoning laws and with home rule for the district of columbia which was implicated by section at the location of foreign missions in washington,as well as by the more general provisions regarding benefits.
the state department tried to address these concerns.the assistant secretary of state for administration sent a letter to the senate discussing the preemptive scope of section and what effect it would have on state or municipal land use processes,in connection with regulation of the location and size of the foreign missions.see letter from thomas tracy,assistant sec y of state for,to william roth,chairman,governmental affairs,senate,reproduced in,at.the letter explained that such state and local authorities were not affected,with the exception that the secretary may disqualify a foreign government from obtaining or retaining official facilities in any location in the united states.id.the governmental affairs committee report acknowledged that some members were concerned because tracy the committee understood to describe a negative veto was not then reflected in the text of the bill,but the majority of the committee ultimately shared tracy view that the statute did not interfere with or preempt local zoning and regulatory policies.see,at.on the issue of washington home rule,the committee acknowledged that section did allow for the preemption and alteration of zoning and land use regulations,but concluded that in other respects district of columbia laws and ordinances,including tax and penal codes,could not be preempted by th e legislation.id.at emphasis added.
some in the committee were not mollified.five senators recorded their minority views and object ed to the broad federal preemption language of of the bill.id.at minority views.they believed that the effect of this provision would be to override not only laws in the district of columbia,but also other municipalities and states laws concerning such things as zoning for consulates building codes tax codes police powers and penal codes.id.emphasis added.the senators feared that if the secretary,in her discretion,determined to confer or deny any of the kinds of benefits under the fma,those benefits would be conferred or denied regardless of the requirements of local or state law.id.the senators argued that such a sweeping preemption of federal,state,and local law was not necessary to accomplish diplomatic reciprocity and was not required by the terms or intent of the vcdr.id.they also rejected the assistant secretary assurance that a negative preemption was all that was intended because they concluded that section was not so narrowly drawn.id.at.the senators reported that these concerns about state and local autonomy were shared by the national league of cities,the conference of mayors,and several state attorneys general.id 
in the end,section was amended at conference to its present form.under it,the reference to state or municipal laws being preempted was altered so that,as to any state or municipal law or governmental authority regarding zoning,land use,health,safety,or welfare,only negative preemption was permitted.
we recognize that the minority views of the report for the senate governmental affairs committee demonstrate that there were some members of congress who did not wish to give the state department the authority to do what it has done in the notice override state and municipal tax laws.see,at minority views.it is also possible to read the majority report of that committee as reflecting a view the statutory language was fma did not actually provide the state department with this power.see id.at.but when section was changed to its present form,the modified provision stated that preemption of areas like zoning and land use was limited to the exercise of a negative veto,and significantly said nothing whatever about tax laws.this silence is conspicuous.where the record indicates that there were concerns within congress that the fma would empower the state department to preempt affirmatively a variety of state and local laws including tax laws,we can not read a statutory modification that limited the state department ability to preempt affirmatively some of those including tax implicitly barring affirmative preemption of other local laws,and specifically tax laws 
having concluded that the state department decision to create an exemption from all property taxes including state and local taxes for property owned by foreign governments and used to house staff of permanent missions and consular officers was within the department authority under the fma,we now consider whether the notice also invalidates taxes previously assessed by the city and nullifies the city tax liens.once again,our inquiry involves two questions does the language of the notice require that it be given retroactive effect and if so,has congress provided the state department with statutory authority to exempt missions from taxation retroactively see bowen georgetown,rock of ages sec of labor,cir.
the language of the notice clearly resolves the first question.the notice states the exemption from real property taxes provided by this designation and determination shall apply to taxes that have been or will be assessed against any foreign government with respect to property subject to this determination,and shall operate to nullify any existing tax liens with respect to such property.emphasis added and there can be no doubt that what the state department has done is to create a retroactive rule because it attaches a new disability to prior tax assessments made by the city in the form of invalidation through federal preemption.see landgraf usi film,explaining that laws which take away or impair vested rights acquired under existing laws,or create a new obligation,impose a new duty,or attach a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed retrospective internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore turn to whether the state department had the statutory authority to confer such a retroactive property tax exemption.
retroactivity is not favored in the law.sweet sheahan,cir quoting bowen,at.courts,accordingly,have regularly employed a presumption against retroactivity as a default rule for statutory interpretation.see landgraf,at.as applied to rulemaking by executive agencies and departments,this presumption against retroactivity means that a statutory grant of legislative rulemaking authority will not,as a general matter,be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules unless that power is conveyed by congress in express terms.bowen,at accord rock of ages,at even where some substantial justification for retroactive rulemaking is presented,courts should be reluctant to find such authority absent an express statutory grant.bowen,at.
the government argues that the presumption against retroactivity is not relevant to this case because the notice involves executive action in the foreign affairs context and because it implicates only public,rather than private,rights.for this proposition,it relies by analogy on republic of austria altmann,where the supreme court declined to apply an antiretroactivity presumption to the fsia,and held that the fsia standards for sovereign immunity apply to claims based on conduct predating the fsia enactment.see id.at see also republic of iraq beaty,finding the presumption against retroactivity inapplicable to an appropriations act that authorized the president to waive the application of the fsia state sponsor of terrorism exception to iraq.
to the extent the government contends that the presumption against retroactivity is always inapplicable to cases involving public rights in the foreign affairs context,it altmann.the government highlights the statement in altmann that though the antiretroactivity presumption is not strictly confined to cases involving private rights,it is most helpful in that context.at.as we discuss below,that recognition by the court offers an important insight into the relations between the substantive values underlying the antiretroactivity presumption and the presumption application.but the statement does not suggest that the presumption against retroactivity is generally inapplicable when only public rights are implicated.the law has long been to the contrary,and altmann can not be read to abrogate those decisions sub silentio.see landgraf,at while the great majority of supreme court decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved burden s on private parties,the supreme court ha s applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary obligations that fell only on the government.united states magnolia petroleum,applying the presumption against retroactive legislation to conclude that the taxpayer was not entitled to the benefit of an intervening statute that established a more rule for calculating tax refunds owed by the federal government haven hosp.leavitt,cir applying the presumption against retroactivity to a medicare regulation because the regulation would impose new obligations on the secretary of health and human services with respect to a completed transaction,and finding it immaterial that the new payment obligation would fall on the government rather than on a private party.indeed,the holding in altmann is explicitly limited to the sui generis context of the fsia.at.
the government also has no support for the suggestion that the presumption is inapplicable because foreign affairs are implicated.though,in altmann,the issue of sovereign immunity obviously arose in the foreign affairs context,this was not the basis for the court holding in that case.instead,the altmann decision relied on the nature of sovereign immunity laws,which are in nature and are not designed to encourage primary conduct on the part of the immune sovereign or to provide a basis for reliance interests.see id.t he principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in united states courts.rather,such immunity reflects current political realities and relationships,and aims to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some present protection from the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity.emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted 
nevertheless,we do find altmann instructive.it reminds us that the antiretroactivity presumption is just presumption,rather than a constitutional command.at.and it demonstrates that the force of the presumption depends on the values that underlie it and the degree to which such values are at issue.
retroactive laws are not always pernicious.they may serve entirely benign and legitimate purposes,such as responding to emergencies,correcting mistakes,preventing attempts to undermine the transition to new legal rules,or simply giving comprehensive effect to a desirable policy change.landgraf,at.but retroactive lawmaking whether by legislation or regulation typically risks unfairness.see eastern enters.apfel.retroactive laws can be used for retribution against unpopular groups or individuals.ins cyr,quoting landgraf at accord doe pataki,cir.they frequently upset settled expectations by imposing burdens and disabilities with respect to completed transactions and actions.see altmann,at landgraf,at general motors romein.and they may undermine values that enable people to know what the law is,and to have confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.see landgraf,at.a default rule that requires congress to make a clear statement when it wishes legislation to have retroactive when it wishes to empower an agency to issue retroactive to minimize these risks by assuring that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.id.at.this requirement also fosters political accountability,by allocat ing to congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes.id.at.
in view of the values the presumption against retroactivity is designed to serve,it is not surprising that it has most frequently been applied in cases involving contractual or property rights,where predictability and stability are of prime importance,id.at,and especially to cases involving private rights,where it is particularly undermine reliance on established legal rules,see altmann,at.but where the evils of retroactivity are not present,the strength of the antiretroactivity presumption may be correspondingly diminished both because the presumption is less likely to reflect the intent of a reasonable legislator and because it is not needed to promote congressional accountability.landraf,at.in such circumstances,it may become necessary for a court to look to the statute as a whole and to determine,even in the absence of a clear statement,whether congress meant the statute to have retroactive effect,or,in the case of a delegation,whether congress intended to have the statute authorize retroactive executive rulemaking.thus,in altmann,the court declined to rely on the absence of a clear statement in the fsia and applied the fsia to conduct.it did so after recognizing that retroactive application of the statute would not a affect private rights,or b upset significant reliance interests because sovereign immunity laws are not meant to create reliance.see at.we find similar considerations relevant in the instant case,and these lead us to conclude that the fma gave the state department the power to confer a retroactive tax exemption to foreign missions.
first,the state department notice implicates only the public rights of states and municipalities,not of private persons.we have explained that under our case law,this fact is not independently sufficient to negate the antiretroactivity presumption.see haven,at.but when it is combined with other factors that suggest that the typical costs of retroactivity are not at stake,it is germane.the city is not a politically weak actor.and while there is perhaps some unfairness to the city when the federal government retroactively declares property taxes imposed by the city against foreign countries to be null and void,this unfairness inheres in the federal government unquestioned supremacy in the management of foreign relations.united states cnty.of arlington,cir maintenance of friendly relations with foreign powers transcends in importance municipal taxation.the county must yield in the interests of us all,itself included.in other words,this is manifestly not a case where retroactive lawmaking is being used to burden an unpopular or underrepresented person,group,or entity.
second,and most important,the notice does not upset expectations that were genuinely settled.it is true that this suit,which was brought to establish the validity of the city tax liens,involves rights in property,see permanent mission of india to the united nations,at internal quotation marks omitted,an area in which reliance interests are particularly strong,see landgraf,at.yet the property interests at stake here are based on the city right to impose and to collect property taxes against portions of foreign missions used for staff housing,and the status of such rights has long been uncertain.both the india mission and the mongolia mission have consistently taken the position that their entire buildings,including those portions used for staff residences,are tax exempt under the vccr and the vcdr.we need not decide today whether the missions interpretation of these treaties is correct.but we do think that the missions arguments have considerable force,and we find this fact relevant in assessing the degree to which the state department notice undermined the city preexisting expectations.
as described earlier,the vcdr exempts from taxation the premises of the mission,vcdr,which are defined as the buildings or parts of buildings used for the purposes of the mission,including the residence of the head of the mission,id.i.similarly,the vccr establishes a tax exemption for c onsular premises and the residence of the career head of consular post.vccr.the district court held that because the vccr and the vcdr specifically recognize a tax exemption for the residences of the career head of consular post and the head of the mission,the treaties implicitly exclude tax exemptions for any other residences.see permanent mission ii,d at.we are not convinced that this conclusion necessarily follows.
we agree that under the treaties,the only residences that are categorically exempt from taxation are those belonging to the head of mission and the head of the consular post respectively.and,indeed,the missions do not argue that staff residences are always exempt from taxation.rather they contend that such residences are exempt to the extent they are part of the consular premises and the premises of the mission that are tax exempt.moreover,they concede that not all staff residences would fit this description.but they argue that a residence is part of a consular premises,if it is used exclusively for the purposes of the consular post,vccr j,and similarly that a residence is part of the premises of the mission if it is part of the buildings used for the purposes of the mission,vcdr i.
under this interpretation of the treaties,it would essentially become a mixed question of law and fact whether india and mongolia are using staff residences for the purposes of the mission or exclusively for the purposes of the consular post.in the instant case,the missions insist that the residences serve significant mission and consular functions because they are located in a single facility that also houses diplomatic offices.this arrangement,the missions argue,enables staff to be on hand to work at odd hours as required by the time difference between new york city and their home countries,facilitates security,and allows staff to participate in cultural events.
we do not today hold the missions interpretation of the vccr and the vcdr to be correct there are significant arguments that go in the other direction.we disagree,though with the district court conclusion that the plain language of the vccr and the vcdr unequivocally supports the city position.permanent mission ii,d at.instead,we find the proper scope of the tax exemptions in these treaties decidedly judgment its drafters might well have shared in so regarding the treaties language,we are in accord with the not necessarily the final by the fourth circuit in county of arlington,which is the only federal appellate decision to have addressed whether the tax exemption in article of the vcdr applies to residential housing for mission staff the county of arlington court acknowledged several possible arguments in favor of an exemption,including one akin to the argument rejected by the district court in this case.see id.at while the residence of the head of mission is specifically mentioned as a mission purpose,there is no language compelling a conclusion that living quarters of other mission staff are not also a mission purpose.the court ultimately endorsed the united states candid conce ssion in its briefing for that case that the relevant provisions of the vcdr are ambiguous with respect to the tax immunity of the property in question,and the court itself stated that t here are interpretations of the vcdr calling for at least as tenable as those to the contrary.id.at.with the question of interpretation in equipoise,the court relied on the position of the state based its view on generally accepted principle s of customary international law to tip the scales in favor of finding an exemption for the staff residences.id.at.
the city denies that,in the past,there was ever any uncertainty about whether embassy properties used to house staff would be subject to taxation.it points to guidance documents published by the state department prior to the notice,which stated that a bsent a bilateral agreement,property tax exemption is not generally granted to residences owned by foreign governments used to house members of consular posts or international organizations,except for career heads of the consular posts or chiefs of missions to the international organizations.see dep t of state,foreign diplomatic and consular personnel in the united states guidance for administrative officers the guidance,available at http.more directly on point,the city notes that the state department made similar statements regarding staff residences for permanent missions to the united nations in new york city,and even made such statements to the india mission with respect to the building at issue in this case 
the city also dismisses the significance of the county of arlington decision.beyond arguing that the decision is unpersuasive a view shared by the district court in this case,see permanent mission ii,d at city contends that the state department subsequently appeared to limit the position it took in the county of arlington litigation to apply only to bilateral missions located in washington,and not to missions,typically located in places like new york city,to international organizations like the united nations.see guidance in,exemption from dues and taxes was extended on a reciprocal basis to other foreign residences used to house members of diplomatic missions in the washington metropolitan area.
we do not deny that the city had a belief that it would be able to impose property taxes on the staff residences for the missions.but that does not alter the fact that the right to impose taxes was anything but settled prior to the notice.the governing language of the vcdr and vccr is ambiguous the leading federal appellate court decision rejected the city interpretation of these treaties and recognized a tax exemption for an apartment building located in arlington,virginia that housed the staff of a foreign mission to the united states the state department issued a public notice subsequent to that decision affirming its position that,at least with respect to bilateral missions,property owned by diplomatic missions used to house the staff of such missions is exempt from general property tax,subject to reciprocal treatment of comparable property owned by the united states abroad,public notice property owned by diplomatic missions and used to house the staff of those missions is exempt from general property taxes,july,and while the city points to several statements issued by the state department that suggest staff residences for missions to the united nations and consular offices were considered taxable,none of these statements either a explain why the department considered these properties taxable even though analogous properties held by bilateral missions to the united states were not,or b address whether residential housing located on the same premises as diplomatic offices might serve the purposes of a mission or consular office 
for these reasons,we find that the presumption against retroactivity is not determinative in this case.we emphasize that our holding on this issue is narrow.we do not adopt the government contention that the antiretroactivity presumption is generally inapplicable to foreign affairs cases involving public rights.rather,we conclude that in the circumstances of this case,application of the antiretroactivity clear statement rule is misplaced because the values that underlie that rule are not sufficiently implicated.
while the fma does not contain the sort of express authorization for the state department to issue a rule that operates retroactively that overcoming full application of the antiretroactivity presumption would require,see rock of ages corp,at,we believe that the statute is best read to permit the state department to do what it seeks to do and apply the exemption to taxes that have been assessed and to nullify any existing tax liens.this follows not only from the fma substantial delegation of discretionary authority to the state department,but also from the criteria guiding the secretary benefit determinations and from the policies embodied in the statute.
the fma directs the state department to support the secure and efficient operation of united states missions abroad and to do likewise for foreign missions located in the united states.b.achieving this goal may require the mediation of conflicts between the united states and foreign countries,a prospect that the fma explicitly contemplates in setting forth criteria for the provision of benefits.see b directing the secretary to provide benefits and set terms and conditions on their enjoyment if such action is reasonably necessary to assist in resolving a dispute affecting united states interests and involving a foreign mission or sending state.we think it would be anomalous to read the fma as requiring the state department to resolve disputes involving foreign missions through the designation of benefits,and yet to tie the department hands by limiting it to prospective solutions that may not address the sources of the conflicts.
in the instant case,for instance,the state department asserted that action on its part was needed to resolv e a dispute affecting interests and involving foreign governments which assert that international law requires the exemption from taxation of such diplomatic and consular properties.it seems unlikely that this the state department tells us has become a major irritant in the united states bilateral relations and threatens to cost the united states hundreds of millions of dollars,be effectively resolved by the establishment of an exemption that was only and that left the missions on the hook for decades of property taxes along with significant back interest payments.accordingly,we can not read the fma,which was intended to give the state department flexible tools to carry out united states objectives,as so restricted.
in addition to objecting to the substance of the state department notice,the city also challenges the procedure by which the notice was promulgated.specifically,the city contends that the state department issued the notice without allowing first for notice and comment,and that doing so was improper.we disagree,and conclude that though the notice is a final rule with the force of law,it is exempt from the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act apa,because the notice involved a foreign affairs function of the united states,id.a.
the apa provides that federal courts shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by law d.section of the apa generally requires notice of a proposed rulemaking in the federal register and an opportunity for interested persons to comment.id.the section,however,exempts from its coverage regulations involving a military or foreign affairs function of the united states.rajah mukasey,cir quoting a.the apa legislative history indicates that t he purpose of the foreign affairs exemption was to allow more cautious and sensitive consideration of those matters which so affect relations with other governments that,for example,public provisions would provoke definitely undesirable international consequences.am.ass of exps.apparel grp.united states,quoting,at.
we have stated that exceptions to section should be narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.zhang slattery,cir,superseded on other grounds by statute,a internal quotation marks omitted see also jean nelson,cir citing the legislative history of the apa that indicates exceptions to notice and comment should be construed narrowly.we reaffirm that statement.but we find that the notice in the case before us easily falls within the foreign affairs exception.the state department regulation of the reciprocal treatment to be afforded foreign missions in the united states and its conferral of benefits to the missions and consular offices of foreign governments that conduct diplomatic activities within the united states relates directly to,and has clear consequences for,foreign affairs.
the city tries to resist this conclusion by reading restrictive conditions into our prior cases dealing with the foreign affairs exception.the city argues that the exception governs only if one of two circumstances is met either if the rulemaking does no more than implement a formal international agreement,see int l of teamsters peña,citing wben,united states,cir,or if public notice and comment would provoke definitely undesirable international consequences,such as a the revelation of sensitive foreign intelligence,b the impairment of relations with other countries,or c excessive delay when urgent action is required,see rajah,at recognizing these possibilities as at least three definitely undesirable international consequences that would follow from notice and comment rulemaking in that particular case.because the state department benefit designation in the notice concededly does not implement a formal international agreement,the city contends order for the exception to need to identify specific undesirable international consequences that would have followed from public rulemaking in this particular case.
but the city takes language from our prior cases out of context.the cases upon which the city relies addressed a quite different question than what is at issue here the extent to which the foreign affairs exception should apply to immigration rules.the dangers of an expansive reading of the foreign affairs exception in that context are manifest.while immigration matters typically implicate foreign affairs at least to some extent,yassini crosland,cir,it would be problematic if incidental foreign affairs effects eliminated public participation in this entire area of administrative law.reflecting such concerns,we observed in zhang slattery that while o n occasion,courts have applied the foreign affairs exception to immigration rules,courts have also regularly limited the exception in this context to prevent the exception from becom ing distended.at internal quotation marks omitted.this approach accords with congress admonition in the legislative history of the apa not to interpret the phrase foreign affairs function loosely to mean any function extending beyond the borders of the united states,at see also,at.
by contrast,the action taken by the state department to regulate the treatment of foreign missions implicates matters of diplomacy directly.recognizing the applicability of the foreign affairs exceptions in this context does not raise the same concerns of loose interpretation,see,and hence the value of analogies between the instant case and immigration cases is correspondingly low.though the foreign affairs exception extends beyond diplomacy,diplomatic functions,such as those here involved,represent the exception paradigm case.
in short,while a determination that public rule making would provoke definitely undesirable international consequences,may well be necessary before the foreign affairs exception is applied to areas of law like immigration that only indirectly implicate international relations,quintessential foreign affairs functions such as diplomatic relations and the regulation of foreign missions are different.such actions clearly and directly involve a foreign affairs function,see mast,regan.int l trade quoting,at,and so fall within the exception without a iteration of specific undesirable consequences.to hold otherwise would turn the phrase provoke definitely undesirable international consequences from an illustration given in the apa legislative,at explaining that the exception should apply only to matters which so affect the relations of the united states with other governments that,for example,public would provoke definitely undesirable international consequences emphasis added into the definition for foreign affairs function.that we are not prepared to do.
one final argument by the city against our application of the foreign affairs exception to the notice,however,merits discussion.the city contends that the legislative history of the fma demonstrates that congress did not want an exemption from notice and comment to apply to actions taken by the department of state under this particular statute.the bills passed by both the senate and the house of representatives originally contained an exemption from apa rule making under section for actions taken by the state department under the fma except for actions taken under a section of the fma addressing the location of foreign missions in the district of columbia.see g,reproduced in,at codified as enacted at g except as provided in b,actions taken under the authority of this title shall not be considered rulemaking within the meaning of section,pt,at describing the same provision.as explained by the report of the senate governmental affairs committee,this exemption was included because most of the actions under the fma were political in nature,involving considerations of foreign policy and national security,at.the provision was not unanimously endorsed,however.the minority views recorded in the report by this committee objected to the section blanket exemption.these senators argued that there were no sufficiently compelling diplomatic reciprocity reasons for exempting the office of foreign missions from federal rulemaking.see id.at minority views.for reasons that were neither explained nor even mentioned in the subsequent conference report,this blanket exemption provision from the apa was ultimately deleted from the final bill that congress enacted.
the city maintains that,in light of this legislative history,we should not interpret the foreign affairs function exception in a to apply to the state department benefit designations under the fma when congress specifically deleted such an exception from the fma itself.this contention has initial plausibility.but we decline to rely on the fma ambiguous legislative history and congress apparent decision not to enact an blanket exemption from apa rules to alter what we believe is the best interpretation of these generally applicable apa rules,section a.subsequent organic statutes may supersede or modify apa requirements,but they must do so expressly.see haven,at citing.and we are especially reluctant to modify our application of section of the apa based on what congress did not say in the fma.
because we hold that the state department notice was a lawful exercise of the department power under the fma,we decline to address the other issues originally raised in this appeal.specifically,we take no ultimate position as to whether the missions would have been exempt from property taxation in the absence of the notice,either under international law pursuant to the vccr and vcdr,or under section of the new york real property tax law.we also do not address any of the questions raised regarding the district court calculation of damages.
conclusion 
we hold that the state department acted within its statutory authority under the fma in issuing the notice.under the notice,the city tax liens are invalid and no taxes on property owned by foreign governments and used to house staff of permanent missions to the united nations or of consular posts are due and owing.accordingly,we vacate the opinion of the district court.we also reverse the judgment of the district court,and we remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the actions brought against the missions.
in addition to bringing suit against appellants,the city sued the republic of turkey turkey and the republic of the philippines the philippines.turkey subsequently settled with the city for million.see city of permanent mission of india to the,cir.the suit against the philippines was consolidated with the suits against the india mission and the mongolia mission.the district court found that parts of the building owned by the philippines were taxable,but that others were not.the parties initially filed an appeal and respectively,but those appeals were withdrawn with prejudice after the parties reached a settlement in january.see sewell chan,philippines to pay million in property taxes and interest,times,at these missions are not parties to this appeal,all subsequent references to the missions refer exclusively to the india mission and the mongolia mission.
a mission,in turn,consists of a group of people sent by one state to another it does not refer to the premises which they occupy in the receiving state.united states kostadinov,cir.
as to the philippines,the district court also considered and rejected the asserted on appeal by its property was tax exempt under section of the new york real property tax law.see permanent mission ii,d at.this new york statute exempts from taxation real property owned by a foreign government that is used exclusively for the purposes of maintaining offices or quarters for that country principal resident representative or for offices for the staff of such representatives.real prop.tax law.

the government has not taken a position,either in its briefs or at oral argument,on any of the other legal issues raised by these appeals,including the proper interpretation of the vccr and the vcdr.
privileges and immunities refer to international law obligations the united states owes to foreign missions.such obligations exist irrespective of the secretary benefit designations.see.
the senate report for the committee on foreign relations offered several examples,including that in the soviet union and eastern european countries,the united states was not permitted to purchase office and residential properties or even basic administrative support and services such as housing maintenance,utilities,or tickets for cultural events,and was instead required to obtain these items through government controlled organizations at a substantial surcharge,that in several countries including venezuela,kuwait,bahrain,the united arab emirates,and indonesia,various restrictions were placed on the state department ability to purchase or own housing,that in countries such as mexico,venezuela,singapore,and guatemala,inequitable restrictions were placed on the import and export of the private vehicles and other personal effects of diplomats,and that inequitable taxes on goods and services such as gasoline,heating oil,and construction materials were imposed in several countries including in chile,malta,and portugal,at.the house report for the committee on foreign affairs specifically singled out t he problem of taxation of diplomatic personnel as particularly vexing,observing that many host governments failed to live up their obligations under international agreements,such as the vcdr and vccr,creating considerable extra expense to foreign service members,pt,at.
the fma has been used to designate a tax exemption in at least one other instance.in a notice issued in january,the state department designated an exemption from federal and state or local excise taxes imposed with respect to tobacco products for foreign diplomatic and consular missions and personnel.see designation of benefits under the foreign missions act diplomatic and consular exemption from tobacco excise taxes.the government represents to us that this notice reaffirmed a designation made in,though there is no indication in the notice that this is so.
the city draws this term from the fma legislative history.see infra draft at.the term is meant to express the idea that the state department could tell cities and states what not to do with respect to certain matters instructing a city not to allow a mission to relocate at a certain location but could not impose affirmative obligations on the city or state in those areas by requiring a city to allow a foreign mission to locate in a certain location in contravention of that city zoning laws.the term negative preemption has been used for different and entirely distinct purposes by other courts.see,fellner triunion seafoods,llc,cir describing preemption of state law through deliberate federal inaction as negative preemption.
another senator,david durgenberger,appended his own views to the report.he indicated general support for the bill but expressed concern about the overreaching effects of section and the possibility that it would undermine decisions by local zoning boards.see,at additional views of durenberger.
there is one phrase in the conference report of the fma discussing section as modified that could be read to support the city position.in the middle of various statements regarding this provision,there appears the following should a state or local governmental entity wish to deny benefits which it is not obliged to grant,contrary to a determination by the secretary of state that such benefits should be granted,the matter would,as under present practice,be subject to resolution through discussions between the department of state and the state or local governmental,at.but in context,it is clear that the report was referencing benefit determinations relating to enumerated police as the authorization for a mission the state department can not compel a state or municipality to accept under section.as to these benefit designations,discussions in lieu of preemption were appropriate.
the notice does not,however,require a refund of taxes previously paid.see.the exemption shall not operate to require refund of any taxes previously paid by any foreign government regarding such property.
our cases considering whether agencies have been delegated the authority to promulgate rules with retroactive effect have generally relied on the same presumption against retroactivity that has been recognized for statutory interpretation.see,rock of ages,at.indeed,in bowen,the supreme court referenced the general presumption against retroactivity for the interpretation of congressional enactments and legislative rules,and then added that b y the same principle statutory grants of legislative rule making authority should not ordinarily be interpreted to include the power to issue retroactive rules.at.beyond this general presumption,some circuits have interpreted the apa to impose an additional bar to retroactive rulemaking,because of the apa definition of a rule to mean an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect,emphasis added.see,celtronix telemetry,fcc,med,sullivan,cir see also bowen,at,scalia,concurring arguing that the plain meaning of the apa definition for rule precludes an agency from adopting rules that have a primary retroactive effect in the sense of changing what the law was in the past without some special congressional authorization.our court has left open the question of whether and when a rule promulgated pursuant to the apa is permitted to be retroactive.see nlrb long island coll,cir.in the case before us,neither the parties nor the government has briefed the question of whether the apa establishes an obstacle to retroactive rule making that is independent of the presumption.we therefore do not consider the argument properly raised and decline to consider it here.see.metals,llc dempsey pipe supply,cir.
the executive ability to resolve,in some circumstances,pending claims brought against foreign sovereigns pursuant to executive agreements,see,dames moore regan,also does not undermine the existence of the
