patrick sikorski sikorski appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,district judge granting summary judgment to okemo mountain,okemo on okemo motion to renew a judgment against sikorski from and on sikorski motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for relief from the judgment on the basis of terms of a release instrument used to settle the underlying lawsuit against his and principal,united states sporting clays association ussca it is stipulated that vermont law applies to this dispute.because vermont law requires that ambiguous releases be interpreted by a as a question of fact,and reasonable people could differ as to the scope of the release at issue in this case,summary judgment for okemo as a matter of law was not appropriate.accordingly,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
okemo brought this action to renew a judgment that was entered against sikorski in.okemo had originally sued,inter alios,sikorski,ussca,and ussca president,bob davis,for a series of tort and contract claims arising out of a failed clay shooting event.sikorski was originally sued both in his representative capacity as an agent of ussca and in his individual capacity.in the course of settling the lawsuit with ussca,okemo entered into release agreements with both bob davis and ussca,who were represented by different lawyers sikorski represented himself in the underlying suit pro se.the instrument signed by okemo and ussca purported to release officers,agents,and employees of ussca of and from all,and all manner of action and actions,cause and causes of action,suits,debts,dues,sums of money,controversies,agreements,promises,damages,judgments,claims and demands whatsoever.after releasing ussca and its agents,okemo proceeded to trial against sikorski on the claims against him in his individual capacity.a copy of the release issued to ussca and its agents was not furnished to the district court after settlement,nor was it furnished to sikorski until,when okemo sought to renew its judgment.okemo concedes that the instrument released sikorski in his capacity as an agent.at issue is whether,under vermont law,the release can be construed to bar claims against sikorski in his individual capacity,since the underlying judgment okemo seeks to renew found sikorski liable only in his individual capacity 
the district court held that the instrument could not be construed as releasing sikorski in his personal capacity,principally relying upon horizon financial,hansen.the district court found that okemo having abandoned the claims against sikorski in his agency capacity after entering into the release was probative evidence that strongly suggests that the intention of the release was narrow accordingly,the district court entered judgment for okemo and renewed its judgment,notwithstanding the discovery of the release.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,dallas aerospace,cis air,cir,and a district court denial of a rule b motion for an abuse of discretion,transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,cir.in sum,we read vermont law to command a different result from the one reached by the district court.vermont law plainly requires that when the scope of the release can not be determined from the language alone,and the language of the document is ambiguous and must be clarified by reference to external evidence,construction becomes a question of fact and t herefore summary judgment on this issue is error.inv,lyttle,citing hous.goldsmith morris.accordingly,here,where the language of the release is exceptionally broad but might reasonably be construed more narrowly to release agents of the principal only in their representative capacities,a trial is necessary to consider what was within the contemplation of the parties when the release was executed,which in turn is to be resolved in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances under which the parties acted.economou economou.
to be sure,the threshold matter of the existence of ambiguity in the release is itself a question of law.see isbrandtsen branch.a provision is ambiguous to the extent that reasonable people could differ as to its interpretation.id.and the surrounding facts in this case do not resolve the ambiguity as a matter of law in either direction.on the contrary,we conclude that reasonable people could differ about the effect of the release upon sikorski in his individual capacity for causes of action arising from the failed ussca event for the following reasons most importantly,the release could not have been more broadly drawn,but was silent about whether the instrument more specifically sought to release the class of agents from all related causes of action even in their individual capacities or whether the release sought to release agents only in their agency capacities the release included sikorski name because his name was in the caption of the case,but failed to mention him specifically elsewhere in the instrument ussca must have been negotiating to benefit its agents and employees,who were ultimately released by the instrument,but it is less clear whether ussca wanted to buy peace from every aspect of the lawsuit beyond the potential of its own liability including the benefit of not having its employees testify at any trial okemo did not disclose the terms of the release either to the original district court at the time it settled or to sikorski until,eight years after the release was signed and judgment was entered and bob davis lawyer was not aware that okemo proceeded to trial against assumed okemo settled with all parties through release instruments accordingly,a trial is warranted to determine what was contemplated by the parties at the time the release was executed.see economou,at.as the vermont supreme court wrote in a related context ordering a trial on the terms of a release,it is important that the circumstances surrounding the execution of the release be fully explored before any decision is made about its legal effect as to nonsigning part ies.smith gainer.
finally,we note that the district court reliance on horizon,which held a general release not to extend to agents in their individual capacities,is misplaced.first,horizon applied pennsylvania law,which holds that releases are generally disfavored.horizon.at.second,pennsylvania law,unlike vermont law,holds that the intent to release a nonparty must be stated with such particularity that it is beyond doubt unequivocal language is required to release a.id.at.third,the release construed in horizon was drawn more narrowly than the one before us it expressly reserved other causes of action,so could more easily be viewed as narrow.id.at.accordingly,horizon is inapposite to the question of vermont law implicated in this case.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,the judgment of the district court is hereby vacated and remanded.
back in,okemo filed suit in diversity for a series of tort and contract claims arising out of a failed event to use the summary phrase used in the majority opinion,naming as defendants united states sporting clays association ussca bob davis,who was president of ussca and patrick sikorski,who in the only claim now relevant was identified variously as an agent of ussca,an employee of ussca,and as a person acting in his own interest.in the course of litigation,ussca paid an amount in settlement and okemo executed a general release running in favor of ussca as well as its agents,employees,attorneys,and so on as usual.the case went to trial against sikorski pro se,and okemo won a judgment that has gone uncollected and was partially discharged in bankruptcy.in the current proceeding okemo seeks to renew the judgment pursuant to.stat.ann,and sikorski invokes the release which he recently discovered.
the district court cited the vermont rule that a release is construed to reflect the intent of the parties as ascertained from the surrounding circumstances,okemo mountain,sikorski,citing economu economu,and ruled that the release was not intended to discharge sikorski in his individual capacity,an intent supposedly evidenced by the surrounding circumstance that okemo pursued the claim against sikorski to judgment.since it is undisputed that the terms of the release were unknown to sikorski or the court and that ussca did not know that okemo continued to litigate against sikorski,that ruling is untenable.the majority remands for further findings on the intent of the contracting parties to release sikorski as an individual,other than as an agent,if as the majority erroneously supposes the underlying judgment is predicated on acts outside the scope of sikorski agency.
i respectfully dissent and would reverse because the remand draws ussca and davis back into litigation and thus disturbs the peace they bought eight years ago,and because the majority approach subverts the force and effect of innumerable releases bought to settle disputes in perhaps elsewhere.in my view,a release of a defendant agents and employees unambiguously releases any person who was an agent or employee of the settling defendant at least with respect to any claim arising out of the transactions and events at issue in the suit.this dissent undertakes to show that the general release at issue released agents,and that sikorski was alleged to be ussca agent in the cause of action that gives rise to the judgment up for renewal that that must be enough to effect release because otherwise the standard form fails in its principal purpose of granting peace and that it is error to limit the scope of the release to agents who are selfless and unerring.
vermont law requires that civil awards be enforced,renewed,or revived within eight years of the original judgment.stat.ann.having failed to collect on its judgment from through,okemo brought the underlying suit to renew pursuant to.virtually all of the judgment was awarded on okemo claim that sikorski fraudulently induced the ski resort to enter a joint venture with ussca concerning the failed event.the other claims litigated in are irrelevant to this appeal the complaint in the original suit,which was not amended,alleged passim that sikorski acted in tandem with ussca and davis as their agent in connection with his successful inducement of okemo to participate in the joint venture 
shortly before trial okemo settled with ussca and davis and gave them releases drafted by davis lawyer,stacy chapman,by which 
okemo remised,released,and forever discharged,and by these presents does remise,release and forever discharge ussca its officers,agents,employees,attorneys,successors and assigns,of and from all,and all manner of action and actions,cause and causes of action,suits,debts,dues,sums of money,accounts,reckoning,bonds,bills,specialties,covenants,contracts,controversies,agreements,promises,variances,trespasses,damages,judgments,extents,executions,claims and demands whatsoever,in law or in equity,which against the ussca,its officers,agents,employees,attorneys,successors and assigns,okemo ever had,now has or which its officers,agents,employees,attorneys,successors and assigns has or may have for,upon or by reason of any matter,cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the day of the date of these presents.
in words and substance,this is what is understood by lawyers and judges to be a release.as i read it,okemo released sikorski,because he was an agent,as okemo affirmatively any action against him and any controversy in which he and okemo were then embroiled.in so many words,okemo released any agent of ussca from any suit it now has by reason of any thing whatsoever.
the majority opinion recites that this instrument purported to release ussca and its agents from the tort and contract claims in the litigation,but did not entitle sikorski to summary judgment in the underlying renewal action because the district court found that okemo having abandoned the claims against sikorski in his agency capacity after entering into the release was probative evidence that strongly suggests that the intention of the release was narrow emphasis added.op.at.thus the only circumstance relied upon to show the intent of the contracting parties was okemo unilateral conduct in the bench trial that commenced three weeks after the release was executed.but the question is whether okemo could proceed to trial notwithstanding the release and it begs the question to say that it could because it did.there is zero probative value to the subsequent trial itself as evidence of the contractual intent or understanding of ussca,davis,the court,or sikorski chapman the lawyer who procured the release was unaware that okemo went to trial against sikorski the judge and sikorski were not told the terms of the release during the proceedings and sikorski,who was appearing pro se,can not be expected to have intuited the likelihood that the settling defendants would have insulated their agents and employees as well.sikorski first learned the terms of the release last year.
in vermont as elsewhere a release is a contract.economu,at.its scope is determined by the intention of the parties as expressed in the terms of the particular instrument considered in light of all the facts and circumstances that is,by a consideration of what was within the contemplation of the parties when the release was executed see also leo hillman.an exculpatory agreement such as a release is construed strictly against the parties relying on it,but if its language is clear,the parties are bound by the common meaning of the words which they chose to express the content of their understanding.douglass skiing standards,quoting duke duke.if a release is ambiguous as the majority opinion holds,then resolution of the ambiguity is a question of fact to be decided on evidence of the parties intent.investment props.lyttle.
the majority cites vermont application of these principles in smith gainer,in which a release of smith by gainer for damages arising out of an automobile accident was deemed ambiguous with respect to a subsequent action by smith against gainer for damages arising out of the same accident.id.at.smith did not address the scope of a release with respect to agents,employees,attorneys and other categories of persons discharged by a releasee indeed,the key question on remand was whether the release granted in favor of smith was negotiated by gainer insurer.id.at.
a closer and more useful precedent is leo hillman.in one malinosky killed his former girlfriend and fled into hiding.id.at.while he was at large,his legal counsel settled tort and other claims asserted by the victim sister,who signed a release discharging the killer of civil liability.id.after malinosky was apprehended,the sister as administrator of the victim estate,asserted tort and survival claims against donald hillman,the psychologist who treated malinosky prior to the murder.id.at.the doctor defense of release was rejected by the vermont supreme court 
there was nothing in the understanding between malinosky representative and the sister which indicated even the slightest consciousness of the doctor interests the motivation for the release,presumably supported by adequate consideration,appears to have been strictly bilateral.there is nothing in the record to suggest that the doctor w as aware of the negotiations between malinosky representative and the sister or that they sought to protect his interests in connection with that settlement.
id.at.thus in hillman,though the underlying loss was the same,there was no reason to think that the parties or their lawyers had in mind a category of releasees that included hillman.by the same token,if the release had discharged treating psychologists,i do not think it could have been deemed ambiguous as to hillman,nor would a hearing have been required to ascertain whether he was acting outside the scope of professional norms,or whether he was acting as a individual as no doubt he was similarly,the release here is wholly unambiguous as to any person who was in the enumerated category of ussca agent as to any claim by okemo arising out of the failed tournament.
in considering the intention of the parties,it is critical to keep in mind that a general release is bought to secure peace as well as to settle pending or impend
