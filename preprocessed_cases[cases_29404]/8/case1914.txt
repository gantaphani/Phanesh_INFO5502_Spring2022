appellants investors appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the northern district of new york scullin,dismissing as untimely an appeal from an order of the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york gerling,authorizing a bankruptcy trustee to enter into a settlement agreement.the district court found that the bankruptcy court order was a final order that,upon entry,triggered the period in which to file a notice of appeal.
background 
the principal business of the bennett funding group,and its related companies collectively bfg consisted of originating and assigning equipment lease contracts to investors,including appellants investors on march,the united states securities and exchange commission filed suit against bfg,asserting that bfg was being operated as a ponzi scheme on that same date,bfg filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions,pursuant to et.these bankruptcy proceedings were venued in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york bankruptcy court.see.
on february,appellee richard breeden,the chapter trustee for bfg,the trustee brought an adversary complaint against sphere drake insurance,plc sphere drake in the bankruptcy court.this adversary proceeding was subsequently transferred to the united states district court for the northern district of new york northern district court.sphere drake had insured bfg against shortfalls in its lease collections.the trustee complaint sought recovery of proceeds due under the policy and a declaration that the trustee was the sole and rightful recipient of any policy proceeds.also named as defendants in this case were certain john doe defendants,including,consisting of individual investors claiming rights to the proceeds of the sphere drake reinsurance policy.see breeden ades investor group in re the bennett funding group,cir.counterclaimed against the trustee,seeking the imposition of a constructive trust over policy proceeds,and against sphere drake,alleging a contract cause of action.on january,the northern district court kahn,approved and adopted the bankruptcy court recommendation to withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding in order to allow the adversary proceeding to be adjudicated with an ongoing consolidated class action the consolidated class action that bfg investors had instituted against sphere drake in the united states district court for the southern district of new york southern district court.
on december,the southern district court dismissed against sphere drake for lack of standing and dismissed counterclaim against the trustee without prejudice and subject to renewal in the bankruptcy court.see breeden sphere drake insurance,plc in re the bennett funding group.securities litigation,aff.cir.on february,the same court severed the trustee declaratory judgment action and transferred it to the northern district court,leaving the trustee claim for recovery of proceeds against sphere drake as the only portion of the adversary proceeding remaining in the southern district court.on july,the northern district court kahn,referred the transferred portion of the adversary proceeding,the trustee declaratory action,to the bankruptcy court,which reopened and reinstated it on august.
the trustee,sphere drake,and other interested parties and classes involved in a variety of cases in various courts reached a settlement which included the adversary proceeding.the settlement took on its final form in december as a stipulation and agreement of settlement agreement.the agreement stated that the agreement,and the obligations of the settling defendants thereunder,are expressly conditioned upon the prior occurrence of several specified events.one such event was that a n order approving this agreement and authorizing the trustee to consummate it,substantially in the form annexed hereto as exhibit j,shall have been entered by the bankruptcy court.exhibit j to the agreement was a proposed final order and judgment pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and to rules b and of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure approving settlement and compromise of trustee claims against the settling defendants.another event on which the agreement was conditioned was the entry of a judgment in the southern district court approving the agreement.
on march,the trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,seeking an order authorizing him to consummate the agreement.this motion explained,in relevant part,that b ecause the agreement resolves claims pending before the bankruptcy court and the southern district court,it is contingent upon approval by both courts.accordingly,counsel for the settlement class is simultaneously seeking approval of the agreement in the southern district court.on march,timely objected to the motion.
on may,the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision,findings of fact,conclusions of law,and order relating to the trustee motion the order.the bankruptcy court,though noting objection,concluded that the agreement was fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the debtors estates and authorized the trustee to consummate the agreement.
on june,appeared,as members of the settling class,in the southern district court to oppose the agreement.the southern district court approved the agreement by a final order and judgment,entered june,which terminated the class action lawsuit and remanded to the bankruptcy court for the distribution of settlement proceeds.
on june,moved the bankruptcy court to alter or amend the order pursuant to rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure adopting,permitting motions to alter or amend a judgment within ten days after entry of the judgment,or,alternatively,to provide relief from the order,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure adopting,permitting relief from judgments or orders for specified reasons.on june,pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure permitting motion to extend time to file a notice of appeal,but if motion filed untimely,requiring excusable neglect,moved the bankruptcy court for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal from the order and filed a notice of appeal from that order.on july,the clerk of the bankruptcy court issued a certificate of to,noting that its notice of appeal from the order was untimely under rule.on february,the bankruptcy court determined that the motion arose as a discrete matter within the larger bankruptcy case.the court determined that its order 
adjudicated a discrete matter within the main case and therefore it was a final and appealable order,notwithstanding the lack of a statement of finality pursuant to fed.adopting.a c.accordingly,the period for filing an appeal under fed.began to run on may,and expired on june.
the court subsequently found that rule motion was untimely,that had failed to show any ground for relief on its rule motion,and that rule motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal was untimely and that its neglect in filing the motion late was not excusable.
on march,the northern district court ordered to show cause why its appeal from the order should not be dismissed as untimely.in response argued that its notice of appeal was timely because the order was not a final order.specifically,argued that the order was not final on may,because i the order did not conform to the proposed final order and judgment that was attached to the agreement and ii the agreement upon which it was based was contingent upon the southern district court entry of a final judgment approving the agreement.on january,the northern district court scullin,ruled that the order constituted a final order and,therefore,that appeal was untimely.a judgment to that effect was entered february.

discussion 
finality of bankruptcy court orders 
this case requires us to determine if the order was a final order.if the order was a final order,appeal from that order was untimely and this court must affirm the judgment of the northern district court.if the order was not a final order,however,the appeal was not untimely,and the judgment of the northern district court must be vacated.
to appeal from an order of a bankruptcy court to a district court,a party must file a notice of appeal within the time prescribed by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.fed.a.generally,rule requires that a party file a notice of appeal within ten days of the date of the entry of the judgment,order,or decree appealed from.fed.a.for appeals of right a district court only has jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees.a.
the standards for determining finality in bankruptcy differ from those applicable to ordinary civil litigation.the need for different standards arises from the fact that a bankruptcy proceeding is umbrella litigation often covering numerous actions that are related only by the debtor status as a litigant and that often involve decisions that will be unreviewable if appellate jurisdiction exists only at the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceeding.we have thus recognized that congress intended to allow for immediate appeal in bankruptcy cases of orders that finally dispose of discrete disputes within the larger case.

by disputes we do not mean merely competing contentions with respect to separable issues rather,we apply the same standards of finality that we apply to an appeal under.given the strong federal policy against piecemeal appeals,a dispute,for appealability purposes in the bankruptcy context,means at least an entire claim on which relief may be granted.

in this case,the bankruptcy court approval of the agreement,pursuant to fed,would typically constitute a final order.the order,on its face,conclusively resolved the claims of the settlement class against the settling defendants under the terms of the agreement,the trustee and the settlement class agreed to release the claims they have been prosecuting against the settling defendants in the southern district court in exchange for a payment by the settling defendants of plus accrued interest from october.breeden sphere drake insurance,plc in re the bennett funding group,may,at.thus,the order would finally dispose of a discrete dispute it would conclusively resolve the adversary action by establishing the settlement amount and extinguishing claims.see gibraltar resources,at.
however,asserts on appeal to this court,as they did in the district court,two arguments as to why,in this case,the bankruptcy court order did not constitute a final order i the order did not conform to the proposed final order and judgment that was attached to the agreement and ii the agreement upon which it was based was contingent upon the southern district court entry of a final judgment approving the agreement.as in the district court,these arguments are unavailing.
ii.the order nonconformity with exhibit j did not affect its finality 
argues that,because the order does not conform to the stipulated judgment,it is not a final order.the stipulated judgment,exhibit j to the agreement,is a document,styled a final order and judgment that includes,in relevant part,three specific findings i notice of the hearing on the agreement is approved as reasonable and sufficient ii the settling defendants have not conceded liability,fault or wrongdoing of any kind and iii amounts to be paid on behalf of the settling defendants under the agreement are property of the estate.the order entered by the bankruptcy court,on the other hand,is a document,which includes a procedural background,jurisdictional statement,background,and roughly discussion,ending in a brief conclusion.the northern district court found,and we agree,that the order,as entered,did not fully conform to exhibit j of the agreement as required by the agreement,but that this did not affect the order finality.
with regard to the form of judgment,notes that the order was not styled as a judgment.they contend that if the judgement were so styled,it would have given them notice that an additional paper would not be forthcoming and the time to appeal had,in the bankruptcy court view,begun to run.accordingly,asserts that it would be unfair to conclude that the order was final within the meaning of a,citing in re smith corset shops,cir.however,smith corset shops deals only with the requirement that a final judgment be set forth in a separate document.see smith corset shops,at fed.see also bogaerts shapiro in re litas,cir.in this case we are dealing with a final order as opposed to a final judgment,and no separate document is necessary to effect its finality.as the northern district court found,in determining that the agreement is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the debtors estates and authorizing the trustee to enter into the agreement,the bankruptcy court clearly intended to provide to the trustee the o rder which the agreement required it to obtain.in furtherance of that intention,the bankruptcy court actually provided an order that,on its face,meets the requirements of finality by bringing to an end the adversary litigation.
asserts that,the bankruptcy court intentions notwithstanding,the order did not dispose of the relevant dispute because there were still three findings required by the stipulated form of judgement to be made and statements of those notice of the agreement was proper,that the settling defendants were not conceding liability,and that the amounts paid were the property of the not included in the order.but the omission of such statements has no bearing on the finality of the bankruptcy court order,which plainly authorized the trustee to enter into the agreement.as to the adequacy of the notice,the district court properly determined that the issue of adequacy may be a valid ground on which to challenge the provisions of the order,but it is wholly irrelevant to the finality of that order.as to the other omissions claimed by,the agreement itself sets out that the settling defendants were not conceding liability and that the amounts paid were the property of the estate.nothing in the order amended these stipulated terms,and no further statement was necessary to effectuate them.moreover,had the order materially modifie d the terms and conditions of the agreement,the agreement provided that any settling party could terminate the agreement.again,the order did not modify the terms of the agreement in any way,and no settling party has sought to terminate the agreement for any reason.
in view of the foregoing,we hold that,in this case,nonconformity of the order with the stipulated form of judgment did not affect the finality of the order,which is final on its face.
iii.approval required by the southern district court did not affect the order finality 
the northern district court determined that the order was final notwithstanding the required approval and entry of final judgment in the southern district court because was no longer a party in the southern district court proceeding and therefore could not argue against the agreement in that court nor could it appeal that court final judgment.therefore,once the bankruptcy court issued its order only opportunity to object to the agreement was by appealing from or seeking reconsideration of that order.the district court appears
