this suit arises from a decision by the akwesasne housing authority,aha,an agency of the regis mohawk indian tribe,to terminate the employment of hilda garcia,the agency executive director.garcia commenced suit in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mcavoy,against the aha and john ransom,the chairman of the aha board of commissioners,alleging discrimination,breach of contract and tort claims under variously federal and state law.the district court dismissed the action under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on the grounds that i garcia claims against both the aha and ransom must first be litigated in the courts of the regis tribe under the tribal exhaustion rule,and ii the aha,in any event,enjoys tribal sovereign immunity.on appeal,garcia challenges both grounds of dismissal.
background 
while the facts bearing upon the underlying merits will no doubt be disputed,the defendants do not we therefore accept as procedural facts contained in the complaint that are relevant to the appeal.the aha was created pursuant to a resolution of the regis tribal council.it provides public housing on the akwesasne reservation using federal funds disbursed by the united states department of housing and urban development hud.at all relevant times,ransom chaired the aha board of commissioners.
the aha hired garcia as its executive director in.she is not a member of the regis mohawk tribe.for reasons that are hotly disputed by the parties,the aha terminated her in june.
garcia challenged her termination by filing a pleading in the district court.the complaint charges both the aha and ransom with violations of federal and state laws.garcia is seeking compensatory and punitive damages,attorney fees and costs,and injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement.
count one of the pleading alleges that garcia was fired by reason of age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,adea,and was replaced by a younger man who appears to be in his middle.it is alleged and undisputed for present purposes that she received a right to sue letter from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc for the adea claim,and that she filed suit within the period following her receipt of the letter.see.
count two alleges that the termination was effected without due process and as retaliation for inter alia her exercise of first amendment rights in reporting to hud that ransom had engaged in in violation of federal regulations.garcia invokes which prohibits deprivations of constitutional rights by persons acting under color of state law and title i of the indian civil rights act icra,which provides inter alia that n o indian tribe shall make or enforce any law abridging the freedom of speech or the right of the people to petition for a redress of grievances,or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.
counts three and four allege principally that the aha breached an implied contract under state law by terminating garcia in violation of the aha formal,written policies.
finally,count five alleges that ransom intentionally interfered with garcia employment contract with the aha,acting outside the scope of his authority and for personal,retaliatory,and unlawful reasons.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,on the grounds that the claims could not be presented in federal court because garcia had not presented them to a tribal court in accordance with the tribal exhaustion rule,and the claims were barred in any event by the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity.
the district court held that it lack ed subject matter jurisdiction over the causes of action against both the aha and ransom because garcia had not yet exhausted the claims in a tribal court.see garcia akwesasne hous,d.the court also ruled that the claims against defendant aha had to be dismissed on the alternative ground of tribal sovereign immunity.see id.at.following the entry of final judgment dismissing the complaint,garcia filed this appeal.
discussion 
we consider tribal exhaustion first sovereign immunity second.
the doctrine of federal court abstention now known as the tribal exhaustion rule was announced in national farmers union insurance crow tribe,d.in general terms,the doctrine requires that federal courts abstain from hearing certain claims relating to indian tribes until the plaintiff has first exhausted those claims in a tribal court.the defendants in this case argue,and the district court agreed,that the tribal exhaustion rule mandates dismissal of garcia claims against both the aha and ransom.we review the scope of the tribal exhaustion rule de novo.bowen doyle,cir.
subject matter jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,the district court erred by treating abstention on this ground as a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.see garcia,d at.exhaustion in appropriate circumstances is required as a matter of comity,not as a jurisdictional prerequisite.iowa mut.ins.laplante,d.garcia alleged federal question jurisdiction over her federal law claims,see,and supplemental jurisdiction over her claims,see id.a.garcia assertion of diversity jurisdiction is dubious because the tribal exhaustion rule does not impair jurisdiction,and instead is analogous to principles of abstention articulated in colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d,laplante,at,the doctrine must be interpreted narrowly in light of the virtually unflagging obligation of federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.colorado river,at.
b.the reach of the doctrine 
this court and the supreme court have required abstention under the tribal exhaustion rule on just three occasions laplante,at.national farmers,at.and basil cook enters.regis mohawk tribe,cir.in each instance,the plaintiff was litigating a,ongoing tribal court action,and was asking the federal court to interfere with those tribal proceedings.these cases are procedurally distinguishable from garcia case because garcia claims have not been in tribal court.we conclude that the reasoning of these cases and the policy considerations that underlie them militate in favor of the opposite result in this case the comity and deference owed to a tribal court that is adjudicating an dispute under tribal law does not compel abstention by a federal court where a asserts state and federal claims and nothing is pending in the tribal court.
in the seminal tribal exhaustion case,national farmers,the federal court granted an injunction against enforcement of a default judgment entered in a tribal court,on the ground that the tribal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the defaulted claim.see national farmers,at.the supreme court held that even though tribal court jurisdiction presented a question of federal law,see national farmers,at,the federal court was required to stay its hand because the examination of the tribal court jurisdiction should be conducted in the first instance in the tribal court itself.id.at.the motion for an injunction could be entertained in federal court,but only after the federal court plaintiffs exhausted the jurisdictional argument in the tribal judicial system.
in laplante,the supreme court considered whether a federal court may exercise diversity jurisdiction before the tribal court system has had an opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction.laplante,at.the federal court plaintiff was an insurer that had been named as a defendant in an ongoing tribal court proceeding.in the tribal forum,the insurer lost a jurisdictional challenge.while awaiting tribal appellate review,the insurer commenced a federal diversity suit against all the other parties to the tribal court proceeding,and sought a declaration of tribal law on an issue that would have been dispositive of an affirmative defense raised in the tribal forum.id.at.see also id.at.stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part noting that the majority seems to assume that the merits of this controversy are governed by tribal law.
the court held that respect for tribal required the federal judiciary to give the tribal court a full opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction.id.at.quoting national farmers,at.see also strate contractors,d interpreting laplante.adjudication of the affirmative defense by a court would infringe upon tribal authority,because tribal courts are best qualified to interpret and apply tribal law.laplante,at.placing emphasis on the holding in national farmers,the laplante opinion added that the insurer eventually would be permitted to bring a federal court challenge to the tribal court jurisdiction,but only after pursuing all available appeals within the tribal judicial system.see id.at.
this court has had a single occasion to rule on the exhaustion of tribal remedies.in that case,the federal court plaintiffs sought both to enjoin a tribal court suit against them an analog to national farmers and to obtain rulings on the merits of issues pending in the tribal forum an analog to laplante.see basil cook,at.applying the two foundational supreme court cases,we affirmed the district court decision to stay further proceedings in federal court pending the tribal court determination of jurisdiction.id.at.
the supreme court recently explained exhaustion was appropriate in both national farmers and laplante because congress is committed to a policy of supporting tribal which favors a rule that will provide the forum whose jurisdiction is being challenged the first opportunity to evaluate the factual and legal bases for the challenge.el paso natural gas neztsosie,d quoting national farmers,at.emphasis added.we have expressed the general principle as follows p arties who challenge,under federal law,the jurisdiction of a tribal court to entertain a cause of action must first present their claim to the tribal court before seeking to defeat tribal jurisdiction in any collateral or parallel federal court proceeding.basil cook,at.
these cases bar interference by federal courts to defeat or circumvent the ongoing exercise of jurisdiction by tribal courts garcia claims,however,are pending nowhere but in the northern district of new york.other circuits have required abstention even where no proceeding was pending in tribal court.see ninigret dev.narragansett indian wetuomuck hous,cir where applicable,this prudential doctrine has force whether or not an action actually is pending in a tribal court.united states tsosie,cir t he exhaustion rule does not require an action to be pending in tribal court.crawford genuine parts,cir same see generally blake watson,the curious case of disappearing federal jurisdiction over federal enforcement of federal law a vehicle for reassessment of the tribal exhaustion abstention doctrine,marq.these courts impose the exhaustion rule in any action over which a tribal court might have had concurrent jurisdiction if the plaintiff had chosen the tribal forum.tsosie,at see also crawford,at ninigret dev,at.indeed,the ninth circuit views the absence of a pending tribal suit to be irrelevant.crawford,at.
it is unnecessary for us now to decide categorically whether and how far the doctrine of tribal exhaustion should be extended beyond the scope of its application to cases by the supreme court.the seventh circuit has observed that the two supreme court cases dealt only with the situation where a tribal court jurisdiction over a dispute has been challenged by a action in federal court however,the policies underlying the two cases seem broader than this narrow context.altheimer gray sioux,cir.we agree.and we therefore consider whether these broader policies and example,the policy of supporting tribal and,national farmers,at,the recognition that a federal court exercise of jurisdiction over matters relating to reservation affairs can impair the authority of tribal courts,laplante,at,and the view that tribal courts play a vital role in tribal,id.at.see also altheimer gray,at militate in favor of an expansion of the doctrine in this case.we conclude that they do not.
garcia claim 
several circumstances in this case,considered together,militate against abstention in this case,and suggest deference instead to the competing doctrine that a federal court must fulfill its virtually unflagging obligation to exercise its jurisdiction.colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d.
existence of the tribal court 
the appellees argue deference to the tribal forum,and identify the tribal forum as the tribal council.appellees brief at.however,we have recognized that the regis mohawk tribe has a tripartite government and that the tribal council is the legislative branch.see basil cook,at.apparently in or,an independent tribal court was being organized pursuant to recent constitutional reform.see id.at,basil cook enters.regis mohawk tribe.but in may,chief judge macavoy found in an unrelated case that tribal court exhaustion would be futile because the regis mohawk tribal court was no longer operative.macewen petroleum,tarbell.subsequently,in another episode in the basil cook litigation,chief judge macavoy received an affidavit from the tribal court administrator that the court has always remained open,basil cook enters.regis mohawk tribe,d,and a similar statement by letter from chief judge deom of the tribal court,see id.at.
it appears from published opinions that a tribal court has existed and may exist now.however,appellees in this case seek remand to the tribal council itself.abstention would result in some uncertainty as to the tribal forum for resolution of this controversy in any event,no dispute is currently being pursued in any tribal forum.moreover,neither party in this proceeding has challenged the authority of the tribal court to act.therefore,the existence of a federal proceeding does not implicate or in any way impair the authority of the tribal court to proceed.if a tribal proceeding were pending,our analysis might well be different.
the party seeking relief in federal not a member of the tribe that she is suing the dispute is therefore not.see tsosie,at finding that exhaustion was required in part because the dispute here is between two navajo indians.
garcia theories of liability are grounded if anywhere on federal and state law,not tribal law.laplante,at.see also altheimer gray,at refusing to require abstention because inter alia the dispute does not concern a tribal ordinance as much as it does state and federal law.this factor seems particularly important in light of the supreme court recent opinion in el paso natural gas neztsosie,d.
in el paso natural gas,navajos sued in tribal court,alleging that atomic energy companies were liable under navajo tort law for injuries resulting from the mining of uranium on the navajo indian reservation.see id.at.the companies countered by bringing a federal suit under the act,which i preempts all claims arising out of a nuclear incident,w ii makes such claims removable to federal court from state court and iii provides that a federal judge must determine whether the act applies in cases where removal is contested.see el paso natural gas,at.n.the lower courts abstained under the tribal exhaustion rule.see el paso natural gas,at.reversing,the supreme court held that the applicability of the act must be decided in federal court,and suggested that application of the federal statute would require a transfer of the liability claims from the tribal court to the federal forum.see id.at.id.at.noting the rare provisions for removal in the act preemption section and suggesting that the existence of a federal preemption defense in the more usual sense would not affect the logic of tribal exhaustion.
the opening paragraph of el paso natural gas can be read to say that the tribal exhaustion rule does not require abstention where the underlying,substantive claim would be removable to federal court if brought initially in state court since garcia claims would be removable if brought initially in a state court,see a c,el paso natural gas offers a potential alternative basis for our ruling in this case.we do not rely on el paso natural gas,however,because that opinion elsewhere emphasizes and relies upon the extraordinarily powerful congressional preference that nuclear accident claims be adjudicated in federal court,and it is therefore possible that the opinion is.see el paso natural gas,at.noting that the act provides clear indications of the congressional aims of speed and efficiency.
the foregoing circumstances are determinative in the absence of a competing proceeding in a tribal court.we do not decide whether these circumstances would control the outcome if a tribal proceeding had been begun and a finding were made that it was pending in a tribal court constituted to hear it,or even if such proceeding were started after the federal suit was filed.we hold that where no ongoing tribal proceeding exists,and a of the tribe properly invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court to litigate law,the tribal exhaustion rule does not mandate abstention,and the district court must therefore fulfill its unflagging obligation to exercise its discretion.the district court contrary holding was error.
on a motion invoking sovereign immunity to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that jurisdiction exists.see makarova united states,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.id.internal quotation omitted.in this case,the pertinent facts are undisputed.
claims against the aha 
as a matter of federal common law,an indian tribe enjoys sovereign immunity from suit except where congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.kiowa tribe manufacturing,d bassett mashantucket pequot tribe,cir.garcia concedes that the aha,as an agency of the regis tribe,enjoys the same presumption of immunity.see bassett,at.however,she argues that both exceptions to the immunity principle apply to this case.we consider her two arguments in turn.
congressional abrogation 
c ongressional abrogation of tribal immunity,like congressional abrogation of other forms of sovereign immunity,can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.id.at quoting santa clara pueblo martinez,d.garcia finds such unequivocal expressions in the native american housing assistance and act of nahasda,the statute that provides the aha with federal funds,and in the nahasda implementing regulations.we do not.
garcia points first to,which concerns environmental reviews of indian housing projects.an officer of the regis tribe has certified,pursuant to the section,that the tribe will assume all of the responsibilities relating to certain federal environmental laws,id.a c,and that the certifying officer consents to assume the status of a responsible federal official under the national environmental policy act and consents on behalf of the tribe and such officer to accept the jurisdiction of the federal courts for the purpose of enforcement of the responsibilities of the certifying officer as such an official,id.c a b emphasis added.this passage is limited to environmental responsibilities,and does not bear garcia construction of it as a mandated consent to suit that abrogates the tribe sovereign immunity against her claims.
garcia also points to c,which permits the attorney general of the united states to institute a civil action following a referral from the secretary of housing and urban development to enforce compliance with nahasda.potential remedies for noncompliance include recovery of block grant funds.see id.this provision does not assist garcia she is not the attorney general and the statute can not be an abrogation of sovereign immunity because,in the first place,tribes do not enjoy sovereign immunity from suit by the united states.see reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir.
finally,garcia contends that we should find a pertinent abrogation in one of nahasda implementing regulations.according to garcia,explicitly provides that the adea and the indian civil rights act icra do apply to recipients of nahasda block grants.the regulation does require recipients to comply with certain federal laws,but we see no congressional abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity.
to begin with,the regulation mentions the age discrimination act of,see,not the adea,see,which is the age discrimination statute invoked in garcia complaint regardless of whether the substantive norms of the icra,the adea,and the age discrimination act all apply to tribes,none of the laws abrogates tribal sovereign immunity from suit.the supreme court has so held with respect to the icra.see santa clara pueblo,at.s uits against the tribe under the icra are barred by its sovereign immunity from suit.and in the absence of any unequivocal expression of contrary legislative intent,we reach the same conclusion with respect to the adea and age discrimination act.neither statute makes any reference whatever to the amenity of indian tribes to suit.florida paraplegic ass miccosukee tribe,cir finding no abrogation of tribal immunity under title iii of the americans with disabilities act expressing congressional intent to waive state sovereign immunity to suit under the age discrimination act lane pena,d ambiguous reference to the existence of remedies under inter alia the age discrimination act against public entit ies did not waive the federal government sovereign immunity.
waiver of immunity 
even where congress has not abrogated immunity,a tribe may voluntarily subject itself to suit by issuing a clear waiver.c l enters.citizen band potawatomi indian tribe,d.garcia claims to have found a sufficient waiver in a sue and be sued clause in the aha enabling tribal ordinance 
the tribal council hereby gives its irrevocable consent to allowing the aha to sue and be sued in its corporate name,upon any contract,claim or obligation arising out of its activities under this ordinance and hereby authorizes the aha to agree by contract to waive any immunity from suit which it might otherwise have 
garcia akwesasne hous,d,emphasis added.we first consider the meaning of the sue and be sued clause in isolation,then address what if anything we can learn from the context in which the clause appears.
the supreme court recently noted that the law governing waivers of immunity by foreign sovereigns is instructive for a court considering an asserted waiver of tribal immunity.c l.at emphasis added.the court has reserved decision on whether parallel principles govern state and tribal waivers of immunity.id.at emphasis added.but blatchford native village,d noting that indian tribes are more like states than foreign sovereigns in some respects.in any event,however,courts consistently have applied two complementary principles to waivers a sovereign waiver must be unambiguous,and a sovereign interest encompasses not merely whether it may be sued,but where it may be sued.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d emphasis in the original internal quotations omitted state sovereign immunity see corzo banco central de reserva del peru,cir foreign sovereign immunity w hile an entity may be amenable to suit in its home country under some circumstances,it does not necessarily follow that it lacks sovereign immunity from suit in the united states.
applying those principles,courts considering a bare sue and be sued clause in the contexts of foreign and state sovereign immunity have arrived at the same conclusion the clause constitutes a waiver of immunity if at all only in the courts of the sovereign.see college sav.bank florida prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d noting that a state does not consent to suit in federal court merely by stating its intention to sue and be sued emphasis added scanlon,at.noting that a lthough a state general waiver of sovereign immunity may subject it to suit in state court,it is not enough to waive the immunity guaranteed by the eleventh amendment florida dep t of health rehabilitative servs.florida nursing home ass n,d per curiam construing a florida statute providing that a state agency was a body corporate with the capacity to sue and be sued arriba petroleos mexicanos,cir sue and be sued clause in mexican agency enabling legislation permitted some judicial remedies against the agency,but did not expose it to the subject matter jurisdiction of courts of the united states dayton czechoslovak socialist republic,ruth bader ginsburg,n o intelligent waiver of
