appellant ben gary triestman appeals from a march,order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,partially to rule b of the federal rules of civil complaint brought under the federal tort claims act ftca,b and et,against the federal bureau of prisons bop and the united states of america we conclude that triestman submissions,construed liberally and interpret ed so as to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest,pabon wright,cir quoting burgos hopkins,cir,should be read to allege a theory of liability under the ftca that the district court did not consider below.because the district court has jurisdiction to consider this theory of liability,dismissal pursuant to rule b was inappropriate and,accordingly,we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings.in addition,we recommend that the district court appoint counsel to assist triestman in further pursuing his claims.
background 
statement of facts 
at all relevant times,the bop had in place a program statement which provided that s ignaling devices will be available for inmate use in all locked housing units that do not have continuous staff coverage,and that i nmates will not be left unattended in locked areas unless a signaling device is available to them for emergencies.bop program statement.the language of this program statement makes clear that prison officials must provide continuous staff coverage to,and may not leave unattended,any inmate in a locked housing unit who does not have access to an emergency signaling device.the precise terms continuous staff coverage and unattended are not defined in the program statement.
according to triestman,while he was incarcerated at the federal correctional institution at ray brook,new york fci ray brook,the bop neglect ed its duty of care by failing to adhere to its own regulations.specifically,triestman asserts that bop,the correctional staff at fci ray brook did not provide either emergency signaling devices or continuous staffing of the areas where inmates were left unattended in locked areas,and,consequently,failed to comply with the bop program statement.it is undisputed that emergency signaling devices were not made available at fci ray brook.triestman contends that continuous staff coverage was not provided either,and that,as a result,he was left unattended in a locked area.
in support of this contention,triestman submissions have focused on the staffing policy in place at fci ray brook which,triestman argues,was so inadequate that it can not be interpreted as continuous staff coverage.under the staffing to triestman undisputed single guard was assigned to an officer station positioned in the center of numerous locked cells.triestman explains that t wice throughout the night,at regularly scheduled times,the guard is to make a cell check,and peeks into the window of each darkened cell for about seconds.between these cell checks,the inmates are entirely beyond earshot of the guard.
triestman alleges that he was preventably injured as a result of fci ray brook failure to provide continuous staff coverage.as a,federal inmate,triestman had originally been designated a low security inmate and initially housed a sic low security facility at otisville,new york.on january,due to overcrowding at otisville,triestman was transferred to fci ray brook,a security prison.upon arrival at fci ray brook,triestman was assigned to share a cell with an inmate,gerald harris,whom triestman argues was known to the bop to be a violent criminal and sexual predator.
triestman appellate brief recounts the circumstances leading to his alleged injuries 
on the morning of january,at approximately am sic,after a night of escalating cajoling,advances and threats to convince plaintiff to participate in homosexual intercourse and sodomy,gerald harris assaulted plaintiff out of frustration and extortion,whereas sic plaintiff refused to submit to harris overtures.in the assault,harris dislocated plaintiff shoulder and later burned his hand with lit cigarettes.
despite plaintiff shouts for help,no officer responded,and over this time plaintiff was at the mercy of harris,and in excruciating pain and fear 
when the officer finally did come by,plaintiff banged on the door begging to be let out the officer queried as to why through the closed door and plaintiff yelled that he had been attacked.
the officer unlocked the door and later plaintiff was escorted to the infirmary,where he was,and his shoulder reduced without anesthetics.
triestman says that,as a result of the attack,he suffered acute excruciating pain,emotional distress,and continues to suffer chronic shoulder instability as well as continuing post traumatic stress.we must,at this stage of the proceedings,accept these factual assertions as true.
ii.procedural history 
in july,triestman,proceeding pro se,filed this ftca suit in counts four and five of his complaint,triestman asserted that the bop failed to provide him signaling devices and proper staffing at fci ray brook the district court,adopting the report and recommendation of united states magistrate judge david homer,concluded,in relevant part,that counts four and five of triestman complaint were barred by the ftca discretionary function exception to the federal government limited waiver of sovereign immunity.see a barring liability for a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or employee,whether or not the discretion involved be abused see also fazi united states,cir describing the test for determining whether a government employee conduct is protected under the discretionary exception function citing united states gaubert,d berkovitz united states,d.accordingly,the district court granted the government rule b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,on the ground of sovereign immunity.
discussion 
on appeal,triestman challenges only the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the allegations in counts four and five of his,that the bop did not provide either emergency signaling devices or continuous staffing of the areas where inmates were left unattended in locked areas,and that this failure is causally related to the injuries he suffered.accordingly,we address only those counts.
standards of review and construction of pro se submissions 
where,as here,a district court grants a defendant rule b motion to dismiss,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,aurecchione schoolman transp,cir,and must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint,ex rel.attica cent,cir.see also scheuer rhodes,d.
it is well established that the submissions of a pro se litigant must be construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.pabon,at emphasis added quoting burgos,at see also brownell krom,cir forsyth fed employment guidance,cir sharpe conole,cir wright comm,cir jorgensen records,cir bennett goord,cir weixel new york city bd.of,cir cruz gomez,cir mcpherson coombe,cir graham henderson,cir.
this policy of liberally construing pro se submissions is driven by the understanding that i mplicit in the right of is an obligation on the part of the court to make reasonable allowances to protect pro se litigants from inadvertent forfeiture of important rights because of their lack of legal training.traguth zuck,cir see also ruotolo,cir recognizing that pro se litigants must be accorded special solicitude.see generally jonathan rosenbloom,exploring methods to improve management and fairness in pro se cases a study of the pro se docket in the southern district of new york,fordham urb,in this time of ever increasing legal costs and complexity of litigation,the pro se litigant is at an insurmountable disadvantage.
iii.analysis 
triestman submissions,liberally construed 
throughout this case,triestman has manifestly argued that fci ray brook staffing policy was itself negligent.he has not,however,expressly articulated the separate argument that fci ray brook employees were negligent in their enforcement of this policy.nevertheless,under the circumstances of this case,the majority of this panel light of the special solicitude that is appropriately accorded to pro se litigants,see ruotolo,at triestman submissions can be read to assert the latter claim,that the officer on duty when the incident occurred failed to patrol or respond diligently to an emergency situation out of laziness or inattentiveness.indeed,our court has,in a similar case,read such a negligent guard theory into a pro se complaint that was susceptible to various readings.see coulthurst united states,cir construing a pro se complaint as alleging negligence due to a bop employee failure to perform a diligent inspection out of laziness,hastiness,or inattentiveness,in addition to a claim that the bop inspection policy was itself negligent.
as in coulthurst,the language in triestman submissions is broad enough to cover the negligent guard theory.coulthurst,at.triestman appellate brief asserts that his injuries would have been prevented had the bop adhered to its own regulations,and,broadly,that the bop is liable for neglecting its duty of care.this language must be liberally construed.see dotson griesa,cir applying a liberal reading to plaintiff pro se appellate brief wright comm,at w e construe pro se appellate briefs and submissions liberally and interpret them to raise the strongest arguments they suggest.citation omitted ortiz mcbride,cir this court construes appellate briefs submitted by pro se litigants liberally and reads such submissions to raise the strongest arguments they suggest.citation omitted.
similarly,triestman complaint uses broad language in its assertion that the bop f ailed to institute and enforce proper staffing and patrolling for each wing of the housing units during lockdown,and thus did not provide due diligence and emergency response sic when such emergency occurred the words institute and enforce quite plainly suggest two separate but complimentary arguments that fci ray brook staffing policy fell so far outside the range of appropriate judgment that it can no longer be viewed as an exercise of discretion in attempting to comply with the bop policy statement and that fci ray brook also enforce d that policy inadequately,due to the negligent actions of its employees 
it is true that triestman,during oral argument before this panel,did not articulate the negligent guard theory for himself.but that is of no moment,as it was the obligation of the district court below to interpret triestman complaint to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.pabon,at citation omitted.
consideration of the negligent guard theory 
the negligent guard theory is a theory of liability under the ftca over which the district court clearly has subject matter jurisdiction.see coulthurst,at holding that a negligent guard theory would not fall under the discretionary function exception because s uch negligent acts neither involve an element of judgment or choice within the meaning of gaubert nor are grounded in considerations of governmental policy.therefore,triestman complaint should not have been dismissed pursuant to rule b.see aurecchione,at holding that a plaintiff complaint survived rule b dismissal where the plaintiff made a colorable pleading of subject matter jurisdiction upon which the district court could have relied to adjudicate the complaint.
while expressing no ultimate view of the merits of the negligent guard theory in this case,or even of its capacity to withstand summary judgment,we believe the claim is not so meritless that it can now be dismissed under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see aurecchione,at noting that,at the rule b stage of litigation,it is not necessary for the district court to determine which party shall ultimately prevail citing scheuer,at.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claim.indeed it may appear on the face of the pleadings that a recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the test.
the complexity of the negligent guard theory in this case is such,moreover,that we believe a claim of this sort is best made with the assistance of counsel.hence,we recommend that the district court,on remand,appoint counsel to aid triestman in pursuing this claim.mosseri fed.deposit ins.cir unpublished noting that full briefing before the district court is desirable and therefore encourag ing the district court to appoint counsel for the pro se litigant.
furthermore,we decline at this time to rule on the justiciability or merits of the theory of liability that triestman has explicitly presented to us,that fci ray brook staffing policy was itself negligent.we do so decline because,if the negligent guard theory can be made on remand,the answer that the defendants might give to such a as it touches on the clarity of the rules with which they were affect the propriety of a dismissal,pursuant to the discretionary function exception,of triestman negligent policy claim.thus,in view of the possibly inextricable relationship between the negligent guard and negligent policy theories of liability,we believe it would be inappropriate to rule on these theories in piecemeal fashion.
our learned dissenting colleague does not believe that the petitioner complaint can be read to assert the negligent guard theory of liability.in the end,that has to be a matter of judgment on which reasonable people may differ.there are many cases in which we have said that a pro se litigant is entitled to special solicitude,ruotolo,at that a pro se litigant submissions must be construed liberally,brownell,at and that such submissions must be read to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest,pabon,at.at the same time,our cases have also indicated that we can not read into pro se submissions claims that are not consistent with the pro se litigant allegations,phillips girdich,cir citation omitted,or arguments that the submissions themselves do not suggest,pabon,at that we should not excuse frivolous or vexatious filings by pro se litigants,iwachiw state dep t of motor vehicles,cir and that pro se status does not exempt a party from compliance with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law,traguth,at citation omitted in all candor,the rubric used in all these cases seems more likely to reflect the conclusion already reached by the court than to give much guidance in deciding which case falls on which side of the line.under the circumstances,we must all do our best to gauge what is appropriate.
conclusion 
we vacate the district court dismissal of appellant counts four and five,and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.additionally,we recommend that the district court appoint counsel to aid appellant in further pursuing his claims on remand.in identifying one line of argument that is clearly not barred by the discretionary function,the negligent guard express no opinion as to its ultimate merits.nor,in doing so,do we prevent counsel from pursuing other example,whether fci ray brook staffing policy falls outside the range of appropriate judgment,such that it can no longer be viewed as an exercise of discretion under the discretionary function counsel may deem appropriate.in leaving such matters to counsel judgment we,of course,do not suggest that any such arguments will be meritorious.
in january,ben gary triestman was brutally assaulted by a cellmate in the federal correctional institution at ray brook,new york.on august,he filed a lawsuit pursuant to bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d,against several prison officials,alleging that their actions and negligence had proximately caused the injuries inflicted on him in the assault.he filed the instant case on july,alleging that the federal bureau of prisons and the united states were also responsible for his injuries.he advanced a number of theories in these lawsuits,including that the bureau and individual prison officials improperly transferred him to ray brook in the first place based on an inaccurate assessment of his security level,that they acted negligent
