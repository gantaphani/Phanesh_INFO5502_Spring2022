proshipline,the,and,not a party to this proceeding,are engaged in a dispute with aspen infrastructures,the.what appears to have been a relatively simple matter,however,has metastasized,spreading across several proceedings spanning a variety of districts,states,and continents.two separate proceedings related to this dispute are pending in the southern district of new york.in one,aspen secured an ex parte order of maritime attachment against assets.in the second,proshipline sought and secured an ex parte order of attachment against aspen assets worth close to two million dollars.on aspen motion,the district court vacated proshipline attachment of aspen assets,concluding,inter alia,that both aspen and proshipline are present in the southern district of texas.on appeal in this second case only,proshipline challenges the vacatur.we affirm.
background 
the parties 
the facts underlying this appeal,including those set forth in the district court opinion and order of february,see proshipline,aspen infrastructures,d,proshipline,upon which we rely,are uncontested.aspen is an indian corporation associated with suzlon energy suzlon.we refer to aspen and suzlon collectively as aspen.aspen manufactures and markets wind that convert wind energy into electricity.it manufactures turbine components in india and then ships them to purchasers in market countries,including the united states,for installation.aspen ships these components on vessels that it.in an attempt to ensure that the vessels are used efficiently when not carrying aspen products,to avoid deadhead return of empty vessels from market countries to india,aspen entered into the contract carriage business,soliciting cargos from the market countries with destinations in asia.
on april,as part of this effort,aspen and entered into a sales and logistics service agreement,by which was appointed as aspen general sales and port service agent in the united states.in connection with this arrangement,established appellant act as aspen agent.
under the agreement,either party had the right to terminate the arrangement on days notice without stating any cause and at any time during the currency of the agreement.the contract contained a clause providing that it would be construed and enforced in accordance with english law,and a forum selection clause providing that all disputes arising from the agreement would be resolved by arbitration in singapore.
aspen eventually became dissatisfied with the arrangement.by email dated july,aspen informed that as of august,aspen will have alternate arrangements in place for its shipping services and that as of that date proshipline will cease to be our agent.email from sanjivv bangad to david pulk and neil johnson july.by letter to aspen dated july,asserted that the email constituted a purported termination of the agreement in violation of the services agreement and was actionable by.letter from richard lowe to sanjeev bangad july.by letter dated july,aspen informed that there was no contract between aspen and,that the agreement did not purport to appoint as the exclusive agent for aspen in america,and that proshipline was failing to perform in accordance with the agreement or its spirit in any event.letter from christopher chauncy to shannon,gracey,ratliff and miller,llp july.by letter dated july,told aspen that as of midnight july,will not be in a position to act in any capacity on behalf of aspen.letter from richard lowe to christopher chauncy july.
procedural history 
in october,aspen named as a defendant in a proceeding in the southern district of new york over which judge robert sweet was reassigned to preside.see aspen infrastructures team,civ.some two months later,by verified complaint dated december,proshipline,without,initiated the instant litigation against aspen,seeking a writ of maritime attachment and garnishment in the amount of.see verified complaint,proshipline,aspen infrastructures,civ,doc.we refer to the former as the first new york action and the case now before us on the second new york action.
on december,judge john keenan,sitting as part i judge,issued the order in the second new york action in the full amount.see order directing clerk to issue process of maritime attachment and garnishment,proshipline,aspen infrastructures,civ,doc.on saturday,january,proshipline counsel gave notice that an electronic fund transfer belonging to aspen in the amount of us had been restrained.declaration of john orzel.thereafter,the case,having been deemed to be related to the first new york action,was assigned to judge robert sweet.see notice of reassignment,proshipline,aspen infrastructures,civ,doc.on january,aspen moved in the second new york action to vacate proshipline attachment of its funds.see proshipline,aspen infrastructures,civ,doc.by opinion and order dated february,the district court vacated that attachment.see proshipline,d at.
the district court based its vacatur on three grounds the court lacked maritime jurisdiction because the agreement at issue was an executory requirements contract,aspen is present in the southern district of texas,where proshipline has its headquarters and principal place of business,and proshipline abused the ex parte nature of the maritime attachment rules,id.at.
proshipline appeals,asserting that the district court erred in all three respects.we affirm solely on the ground that the district court did not err in concluding that the parties were both present in the southern district of texas.
discussion 
standard of review 
we generally review the district court decision vacating a maritime attachment order for abuse of discretion.aqua stoli shipping gardner smith pty,cir.a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.therefore,we review the legal predicate for an exercise of discretion de novo.id.
ii.maritime jurisdiction 
federal law controls the interpretation of maritime contracts so long as the dispute is not inherently local.norfolk ry.james kirby,pty,d accord kossick united fruit,d.contracts that are by their terms entered into in connection with a maritime commercial venture are therefore maritime in nature and the court has jurisdiction of the claims brought thereunder pursuant to.williamson recovery,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied sub nom.columbus exploration,llc williamson,d.
in norfolk southern railway,the supreme court rejected a spatial approach,at,for determining whether contracts are maritime in nature,id.at.the court observed that maritime commerce is often inseparable from some obligations,especially in light of the fact that t he international transportation industry clearly has moved into a new age of multimodalism,transport based on efficient use of all available modes of transportation by air,water,and land.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the supreme court has endorsed a conceptual approach which,guided by the fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction the protection of maritime commerce focuses upon whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.id.internal quotation marks omitted accord williamson,at folksamerica reinsurance clean water of new york,cir sompo japan ins.union pac,cir 
iii.maritime attachment 
the power to grant attachments in admiralty,maritime attachments is an inherent component of the admiralty jurisdiction given to the federal courts under article iii of the constitution.aqua stoli,at.the historical purpose of the power has been first,to gain jurisdiction over an absent defendant and second,to assure satisfaction of a judgment.id.maritime attachments arose because it is frequently,but not always,more difficult to find property of parties to a maritime dispute than of parties to a traditional civil action.maritime parties are peripatetic,and their assets are often transitory.id.at.the traditional policy underlying maritime attachment,which is to permit the attachments of assets wherever they can be found and not to require the plaintiff to scour the globe to find a proper forum for suit or property of the defendant sufficient to satisfy a judgment,has been implemented by a relatively broad maritime attachment rule,under which the attachment is quite easily obtained.id.
rule b of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims to the federal rules of civil procedure the supplemental rules sets forth the process by which a party can attach another party assets.the rule provides 
if a defendant is not found within the district when a verified complaint praying for attachment is filed,a verified complaint may contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant tangible or intangible personal to the amount sued the hands of garnishees named in the process the court must review the complaint and affidavit and,if the conditions of this rule b appear to exist,enter an order so stating and authorizing process of attachment and garnishment.
supp.rule b supp.rule b.the plaintiff must file with the complaint an affidavit stating that,to the affiant knowledge,or on information and belief,the defendant can not be found within the judicial district.see also aqua stoli,at.orders of maritime attachment may be and normally are requested and granted ex parte,though notice of the attachment to the defendant via appropriate service is required.aqua stoli,at citing supp.rules b,e.
the admiralty rules do not explain what it means to be found within a district.supp.rule b,advisory committee notes adoption noting that t he subject seems one best left for the time being to development on a basis.this court has noted,however,that the requirement present s a inquiry first,whether the respondent can be found within the district in terms of jurisdiction,and second,if so,whether it can be found for service of process.seawind compania,crescent line,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also stx panocean uk,glory wealth shipping pte,cir.put differently,to be found within the jurisdiction so as to render an attachment inappropriate,the respondent must not only be found for service of process but also be engaged in sufficient activity in the district to subject it to jurisdiction even in the absence of a resident agent expressly authorized to accept process.seawind,at 
we thus interpret the rule to adopt a somewhat arbitrary compromise which assumes that the plaintiff will not require the protection of an attachment for security,nor should the defendant be subjected to it,if the defendant is shown to meet both prongs of the seawind test,and assumes on the other hand that the plaintiff interests are not adequately protected if the defendant is not so shown.aqua stoli,at quoting integrated container,starlines container shipping,
iv.vacatur 
the,the owner of the attached any other person with an interest in the property seized,supp.rule e,advisory committee notes amendment,can make a motion pursuant to rule e of the supplemental rules to contest the validity of the attachment.rule e entitle s the owner of the attached funds to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff is required to show why the arrest or attachment should not be vacated.supp.rule e f.the rule is designed to satisfy the constitutional requirement of due process by guaranteeing to the defendant a prompt hearing at which he can attack the complaint,the arrest,the security demanded,or any other alleged deficiency in the proceedings.supp.rule e,advisory committee notes amendment.
at such a hearing,the party who has sought the the burden of showing why the seizure should not be vacated.accord supp.rule b,advisory committee notes adoption noting that the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant can not be found within the district.the plaintiff must demonstrate that it has a valid prima facie admiralty claim against the defendant the defendant can not be found within the district the defendant property may be found within the district and there is no statutory or maritime law bar to the attachment.aqua stoli,at footnote omitted accord transportes navieros y terrestres de fairmount heavy transp,cir.
the rule established by the supplemental rules may occasionally sweep too broadly,but congress chose a determinate rule rather than a flexible standard to ensure that attachments may be obtained with a minimum of litigation.aqua stoli,at.
superficial compliance with rule b,while necessary,however,is not sufficient to determine that a maritime attachment is appropriate.williamson,at.even with an attachment secured in conformity with rule b,equitable vacatur pursuant to rule e may nonetheless be in order.we have disavowed the notion that district courts are without any equitable discretion to vacate maritime attachments that comply with rule aqua stoli,at.yet we have cautioned that equitable vacatur is appropriate only in certain limited circumstances.id.w e have not yet had occasion to determine the full scope of a district court vacatur power under the supplemental rules,williamson,at,but certain principles are.for example,equitable vacatur may be appropriate where the defendant can demonstrate that it is subject to suit in a convenient adjacent jurisdiction the plaintiff could obtain in personam jurisdiction over the defendant in the district where the plaintiff is located or the plaintiff has already obtained sufficient security for the potential judgment,by attachment or otherwise.aqua stoli,at 
maritime jurisdiction 
on appeal,proshipline contends that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to order the attachment on the ground that the contract did not confer admiralty jurisdiction.see proshipline,d at.we agree that this was error,and conclude that there is admiralty jurisdiction here.
the court proffered two reasons to support its decision first,that the dispute concerned the alleged breach of an executory contract,and second,that the contract concerned the provi sion of services to any vessel under aspen control expected to call at ports in the future,and was therefore analogous to requirements contracts that courts have found to be outside of admiralty jurisdiction,rather than the supply or repair contracts that fall within admiralty jurisdiction,id.at quoting dolco,moonriver,d,robert sweet,judge.
we conclude,however,that a contrary result is mandated by norfolk southern railway and its progeny,under which a contract confers maritime jurisdiction so long as its principal objective is maritime commerce.norfolk ry,at.the agreement at issue here specifically reference s maritime service s or maritime transactions.williamson,at quoting norfolk ry,at.accord folksamerica,at.it concerns the furnishing of services,supplies,or facilities to vessels in maritime commerce or navigation.leasing oceanic operations,cir internal quotation marks omitted.by the agreement,aspen appointed as its sales agent to establish a sales and management operation to secure freight and associated revenue to fill the excess capacity on suzlon vessels.was charged with facilitating voyages from the united states to india to ensure a full and efficient use of the vessels.on this basis,there is maritime jurisdiction.
we find unconvincing the district court suggestion that there can be no maritime jurisdiction if the contract under which relief is sought is executory in nature.more than fifty years ago,the supreme court concluded that an alleged breach of an executory contract conferred maritime jurisdiction.see archawski hanioti.accord compania argentina de navegacion dodero atlas maritime,rejecting the proposition that executory contracts are not within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts and concluding that i f such was ever the law,it is certainly not the law since the decision of the united states supreme court in archawski hanioti.and as the seventh circuit observed even earlier 
if the contract contemplate s maritime service,and ha s reference to maritime transactions,it is within the jurisdiction of the admiral ty.this doctrine is no longer subject to contention.i t has been held,and,we think,without dissent,that executory contracts of a maritime character are within the jurisdiction of the admiralty,and that damages for breach of such a contract may be awarded by the courts of admiralty.
