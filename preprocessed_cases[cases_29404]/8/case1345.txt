new york state prisoner eon shepherd,who practices rastafarianism,sued new york department of corrections officials alan twedt and christopher post,among others,under,alleging inter alia that these two defendants infringed his rights under the free exercise clause of the first amendment by touching his dreadlocks without his consent.following trial,a jury returned a verdict in favor of shepherd but awarded him only in actual damages.
shepherd now appeals from that part of an amended judgment entered on october,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york david hurd,judge,awarding him in attorney fees and ordering defendants to pay of the fee award shepherd contends that the district court erred in concluding that the prison litigation reform act plra,d,capped the maximum possible fee award in this case at percent of the monetary judgment.reviewing that legal determination de novo,we reach the same conclusion as the district court section d limits the possible award of attorney fees in this case to percent of the monetary judgment.accordingly,we affirm the amended judgment.
background 
a.the dreadlocks incident 
in his original complaint,shepherd charged numerous prison officials and employees with various violations of his constitutional rights.the court or the jury resolved all but one of these claims in favor of defendants.accordingly,we here discuss only the claim on which shepherd prevailed,as it provides the sole basis for the challenged attorney fee award.
on july,shepherd was incarcerated in new york state elmira correctional facility,a maximum security prison,where he was serving an aggregate life sentence for robbery in the first degree,robbery in the second degree,and criminal possession of stolen property.see people shepherd,dep t.that day,as shepherd was leaving for evening recreation,defendants twedt and post searched shepherd,including his hair,which was arranged in dreadlocks while one defendant held a metal detector over shepherd head,the other manually searched shepherd hair,despite shepherd telling defendants that touching his dreadlocks without his permission violated his rastafarian beliefs.see id.
district court proceedings 
in a pro se complaint filed june,shepherd charged twedt and post with violating his first amendment right to the free exercise of his religion when they touched his sacred dreadlocks and slightly tore them.compl.at,shepherd goord,cv dnh june,ecf.in may,shepherd,represented by pro bono counsel,presented his case to a jury,which returned a verdict in his favor,awarding in actual damages and no punitive damages 
shepherd moved for attorney fees in the amount of.see b.construing d to cap any fee award against defendants at percent of the awarded damages,the district court concluded that shepherd was entitled to only in attorney fees,against which it allocated percent of the damages award consistent with d,see supra at,for a final judgment of in damages and in attorney fees.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion,see mcdaniel cnty.of schenectady,cir,which we will find only where the district court based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,lynch city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because the charged abuse on this appeal is an error of law,our standard of review is de novo.see,garcia yonkers sch,cir.
shepherd submits that the district court erred in construing d to cap an attorney fee award in favor of a prevailing and against a defendant at percent of the monetary judgment.in construing this statute,we begin,as we must,with the text,see global tech appliances,seb,d amw materials testing,town of babylon,cir,which we consider in light of its statutory context,see bruesewitz wyeth llc,d united states aguilar,cir.
the possibility for fee awards in cases derives from b,which states that i n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section of this title,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.with the enactment of the plra,congress imposed substantial restrictions on b attorney fee awards to prevailing.blissett casey,cir.those restrictions state as follows 
in any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under section of this title,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that 
a the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section of this title and 
b i the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation or 
ii the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.
whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph,a portion of the judgment not to exceed percent shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney fees awarded against the defendant.if the award of attorney fees is not greater than percent of the judgment,the excess shall be paid by the defendant.
no award of attorney fees in an action described in paragraph shall be based on an hourly rate greater than percent of the hourly rate established under section of title for payment of counsel.
d emphasis added.
in this appeal,shepherd agrees that his fee application is limited by the relative reasonableness and proportionality restriction of d.he does not dispute the specific hourly rate limit of d,the application of which would necessarily reduce his initial fee demand to.his single challenge is to the construction of the highlighted language in d to cap his fee award at percent of his monetary judgment.
as this court previously has observed,the highlighted language in d is not a model of clarity.see blissett casey,at noting d unclear language.nevertheless,this language is not so ambiguous as to require us to resort to canons of statutory construction or to legislative history to discern its meaning.see bruesewitz wyeth llc.at united states gray,cir.indeed,for more than a decade,we have observed that d effectively caps a defendant liability for attorneys fees in a prisoner action at of a money judgment.torres walker,cir see blissett casey,at stating that d appears to provide that fee award is not to be borne by the defendant to the extent it exceeds percent of the judgment.
shepherd submits that this precedent is not controlling because the cap recognized in these cases did not apply in the circumstances presented.see torres walker,at holding that cap did not apply to money paid pursuant to stipulation blissett casey,at holding that cap did not apply where representation was afforded before enactment of plra.even if we were persuaded that any construction of d in these cases was dicta,that would not secure shepherd relief on this appeal.we here conclude,consistent with these precedents,that d caps the amount of attorney fees that a prevailing may recover from a defendant at percent of the monetary judgment awarded,including when the judgment is only for 
that conclusion is compelled by the statutory language.where,as here,a monetary judgment is awarded,d imposes two restrictions on the amount of fees that a may recover from a defendant.the first requires the district court to apply some part of the monetary judgment awarded to plaintiff,not to exceed percent,against any fee award.after this reduction,the excess shall be paid by the defendant,but only if the award is not greater than percent of the monetary judgment.in sum,the plain language of d signals that no attorney fee award greater than percent of the monetary judgment may be entered against a defendant.to be sure,congress might have expressed itself more clearly,but we are nevertheless satisfied that this is the most natural reading of the statute.dean united states,d adopting most natural reading
