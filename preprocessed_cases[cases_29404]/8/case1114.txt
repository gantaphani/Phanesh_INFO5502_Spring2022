plaintiff appellant federal deposit insurance corporation fdic brought this action under the securities act of as receiver for colonial bank colonial.because the complaint was filed less than three years after the fdic was appointed receiver,it was timely under the terms of the fdic extender statute,which provides the applicable statute of limitations with regard to any action brought by the fdic as conservator or receiver.d a.but because the complaint was filed more than three years after the securities at issue were offered to the public,it would be untimely under the terms of the securities act statute of repose.although they recognize that the fdic extender statute displaces otherwise applicable statutes of limitations,the defendants argue that it does not displace the securities act statute of repose,and that the complaint should be dismissed as untimely.
we do not consider this argument on a blank slate.in federal housing finance agency ubs americas,cir,we held that a materially identical extender statute for actions brought by the federal housing finance authority fhfa did displace the securities act statute of repose.the defendants do not argue that the fdic extender statute is in any way distinguishable from the one at issue in ubs rather,they assert that our ubs holding was abrogated by the subsequent supreme court decision in cts waldburger,d,which construed yet another,somewhat different federal provision,enacted as an amendment to the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla to preempt only state statutes of limitations,and not state statutes of repose.the district court agreed,and dismissed the complaint.we conclude,to the contrary,that ubs remains good law and that,under ubs,the fdic complaint was timely.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
between june and october,colonial,a federally insured bank headquartered in montgomery,alabama,invested approximately million in nine residential securities rmbs issued or underwritten by the defendants.in a turn of events,colonial suffered heavy losses on those rmbs,and on august,the alabama state banking department closed colonial and appointed the fdic as receiver.
on august,within three years of its appointment as receiver,but more than three years after the rmbs had been offered to the public the fdic brought this action in the southern district of new york,asserting claims under and of the securities act,which render several classes of persons liable for material misstatements or omissions in securities registration statements.specifically,the complaint alleges that prospectus supplements for the rmbs at issue misrepresented the ratios of the mortgage loans backing the rmbs,the occupancy status of the properties that secured the mortgage loans,and the underwriting standards used to originate those loans.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds,including that it was barred by the securities act statute of repose,which,the defendants argued,was not displaced by the fdic extender statute.while that motion was pending,this court decided ubs.one of the issues in that case,which was brought by the fhfa and also involved claims under and of the securities act,was whether those claims timeliness was governed by the securities act statute of repose or by the fhfa extender statute,b.examining the text and legislative history of the fhfa extender statute,we concluded that congress intended for it to supplant any other time limitations that otherwise might have applied.ubs,at.we emphasized that the statute by its terms established the applicable statute of limitations with regard to any action brought by fhfa as conservator or receiver.id.at,quoting b a emphasis and alteration in ubs.and we rejected the argument that the extender statute use of the term statute of limitations meant that it left in place otherwise applicable statutes of repose,observing that congress frequently uses the term statute of limitations to refer to what might more precisely be designated as statutes of repose.id.at.
the fhfa extender statute was modeled on,and is materially identical to,the fdic extender statute recognizing that ubs controlled,the defendants in this case withdrew their securities act statute of repose argument reserving the right to reassert it at a later date,and the district court louis stanton,denied the rest of the motion to dismiss.
the following year,the supreme court decided cts,in which the plaintiffs alleged injury and damage from contaminants on land on which the defendant had previously operated an electronics plant.the plaintiffs argued that their claims were timely under,the cercla amendment,which creates an e xception to state statutes of limitations for toxic tort actions.a.the supreme court,however,held that cercla preempted state statutes of limitations but left state statutes of repose in place,and that the applicable statute of repose barred the action.cts.at.it chided the court below,which had come to the opposite conclusion,for using the proposition that remedial statutes should be interpreted in a liberal manner as a substitute for a conclusion grounded in the statute text and structure.id.at.
armed with the cts decision,the defendants here reasserted their argument that this action is barred by the securities act statute of repose,in a motion for judgment on the pleadings under.c.they claimed that ubs was inconsistent with cts,because it failed to give weight to the textual markers that the cts court found instructive in its analysis of,and instead put too much emphasis on the fdic extender statute remedial purpose.the district court agreed,holding that,after cts,the fdic extender statute could not be read to displace the securities act statute of repose.accordingly,it granted judgment in favor of the defendants.the fdic timely appealed.
discussion 
in general,a panel of this court is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court.lotes hon hai precision indus,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the defendants make no attempt to distinguish the fdic extender statute from the fhfa extender statute at issue in ubs.consequently,the outcome here is controlled by ubs,unless the defendants can show that its rationale was overruled,implicitly or expressly,by the supreme court in cts.united states ianniello,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states indelicato,cir for the following reasons,the defendants have not made that showing.
cts held that,although it preempted statutes of limitations,left in place applicable statutes of repose.significantly,however,cts did not hold that a federal statute extending statutes of limitations must always be read to leave in place existing statutes of repose.instead,the supreme court explained that use of the term statute of limitations is instructive,but it is not dispositive.cts.at.the court acknowledged that congress has used the term statute of limitations when enacting statutes of repose,citing h b iii i aa and,and that only a few years before was enacted,one scholar described multiple usages of the terms,including both a usage in which the terms are equivalent and also the modern,more precise usage.id.at,citing francis mcgovern,the variety,policy and constitutionality of product liability statutes of repose,am.accordingly,cts instructs,a court must consider other features of the statutory text,before determining whether a statute displaces otherwise applicable statutes of repose.
nor did the cts opinion purport to lay out a novel framework for analyzing that question,which might cast doubt on the validity of the analysis used in ubs instead,the supreme court reiterated the uncontroversial principle that c ongressional intent is discerned primarily from the statutory text.id.at.while it did state that invoking the proposition that remedial statutes should be interpreted in a liberal manner was no substitute for a conclusion grounded in the statute text and structure,it did not direct courts never to use that canon as an interpretative aid.nor did it rule out resort to legislative history in interpreting federal statutes that alter existing statutes of limitations.in fact,cts itself relied on legislative history,citing a report that was before congress at the time was enacted that explicitly noted the distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.id.at.the defendants have pointed us to no materials making the same distinction in the fdic extender statute legislative history.
indeed,it is precisely because cts holding is firmly rooted in a close analysis of text,structure,and legislative history that it has limited bearing on this case.although they both have the effect of extending the time to file certain types of claims,the fdic extender statute and are structured and worded in fundamentally different ways.section reads,in relevant part 
a state statutes of limitations for hazardous substance cases 
exception to state statutes 
in the case of any toxic tort action brought under state law,if the applicable limitations period for such action as specified in the state statute of limitations or under common law provides a commencement date which is earlier than the federally required commencement date,such period shall commence at the federally required commencement date in lieu of the date specified in such state statute.
state law generally applicable 
except as provided in paragraph,the statute of limitations established under state law shall apply in all toxic tort actions brought under state law 
b definitions 
as used in this section 
applicable limitations period 
the term applicable limitations period means the period specified in a statute of limitations during which a civil action referred to in subsection a of this section may be brought.
commencement date 
the term commencement date means the date specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning of the applicable limitations period.
federally required commencement date 
a in general 
except as provided in subparagraph b,the term federally required commencement date means the date the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that the personal injury or property damages referred to in subsection a of this section were caused or contributed to by the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant concerned.
b special rules 
in the case of a minor or incompetent plaintiff,the term federally required commencement date means the later of the date referred to in subparagraph a or the following 
i in the case of a minor,the date on which the minor reaches the age of majority,as determined by state law,or has a legal representative appointed.
ii in the case of an incompetent individual,the date on which such individual becomes competent or has had a legal representative appointed.
section does not purport to create an entirely new statute of limitations framework for state toxic tort actions instead,it provides a limited e xception to state statutes,id.a,which otherwise remain generally applicable.id.a see also cts.at under this structure,state law is not unless it fits into the precise terms of the exception.the exception applies only if the state statute provides a commencement date which is earlier than the federally required commencement date,a,which is defined as the date the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that the injury complained of was caused or contributed to by the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant concerned.id.b a.thus,exception does not change the length of the applicable limitations period it simply modifies the time at which the limitations period begins to run,requiring states that do not already do so to apply the discovery rule.
by contrast,the extender statute establishes the applicable statute of limitations with regard to any action brought by the fdic as conservator or receiver.d a.that limitations period six years for any contract claim and three years for any tort claim applies unless the period applicable under state law is longer.id.and the extender statute further provides that 
the date on which the statute of limitations begins to run on any claim described in the previous subparagraph shall be the later of 
i the date of the appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver or 
ii the date on which the cause of action accrues.
d b rather than creating a limited exception,the extender statute thus establishes,for any action brought by the fdic as conservator or receiver,the length of the limitations period,as well as the time at which the period begins to run.as we concluded in ubs,this structure suggests that congress intended the extender statute to supersede any and all other time limitations,including statutes of repose.
because of the differences in the statutes,much of cts reasoning is simply inapplicable to the extender statute.for instance,the cts court relied on definition of applicable limitations period to mean the period during which a civil action may be brought.b.it explained that,technically speaking,only statutes of limitations limit the time in which a civil action may be brought,whereas statutes of repose can prohibit a cause of action from coming into existence in the first place.cts.at.the extender statute,however,contains no such definition of applicable limitations period.similarly,the cts court observed that includes an equitable tolling provision for minors and incompetents,b b,a feature that is typical of statutes of limitations but not of statutes of repose.cts.at.but there is no similar tolling provision in the extender statute.
the defendants and the dissent make much of the fact that the extender statute uses the term statute of limitations rather than statute of repose,and uses it in the singular.in cts,the supreme court noted that includes language describing the covered period in the singular,and observed this would be an awkward way to mandate the of two different time periods with two different purposes.id.at.but first,as we have explained,the extender statute mere use of the term statute of limitations does not settle the issue.as counsel for the defendants conceded at oral argument,congress has never used the expression statute of repose in a statute codified in the united states code.indeed,the very statute of repose on which the defendants rely here is located in a section of the code entitled limitation of actions.see.
further,when uses the term statute of limitations,and similarly refers to the applicable limitations period in the singular,it is describing the existing period that is modified by and otherwise remains generally applicable.the supreme court thus took the use of the singular as an indication that was intended to modify only one limitations period per claim the period provided by the statute of limitations and to leave in place the second period provided by the applicable statute of repose.by contrast,when the extender statute refers to the applicable statute of limitations,it is referring to the new limitations period that is created by the extender statute the fact that the extender statute purports to create only one limitations period rather than a dual statute of of repose framework such as that which ordinarily governs securities act claims does not,standing alone,tell us anything about the number of limitations periods it was intended to displace.
the defendants and the dissent also emphasize that the extender statute limitations period is tied to the concept of accrual of a claim.in cts,the supreme court explained a statute of repose is not related to the accrual of any cause of action,but instead mandates that there shall be no cause of action beyond a certain point,even if no cause of action has yet accrued.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a statute of repose typically measures that cutoff point from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.id.at.the limitations period established by the extender statute,however,runs from the later of i the date of the appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver or ii the date on which the cause of action accrues.d b.but this tells us only that the extender statute is itself a statute of limitations,and not a statute of repose.credit union admin.bd.barclays capital,cir holding that the ncua extender statute is a statute of limitations that can be waived,and collecting cases so holding.it provides no guidance on the question whether the extender statute displaces otherwise applicable statutes of repose a question on which we must thus defer to our binding ubs precedent 
finally,the defendants take aim at what they perceive to be ubs overreliance on the extender statute legislative history and remedial purpose.as noted above,the supreme court in cts directed courts not to treat the proposition that remedial statutes should be interpreted in a liberal manner as a substitute for a conclusion grounded in the statute text and structure.cts.at.the ubs opinion,however,does no such thing.rather,it begins with two paragraphs of textual analysis,which conclude that b y using these words,congress precluded the possibility that some other limitations period might apply to claims brought by fhfa as conservator.ubs,at.only then does it turn to the legislative history,which it considers relevant only t o the extent there is any ambiguity in the words of the extender statute.id.the ubs panel based its holding on what it determined to be t he more natural reading of the provision,the one that is both inline with everyday usage and consistent with the objectives of the statute overall.id.at,quoting fed.hous.fin.agency ubs,d.it thus used the extender statute legislative history and purpose as a complement to textual analysis,not as a substitute.accordingly,we perceive nothing in cts that undercuts the ubs opinion analysis of the extender statute 
we can dispose of the defendants other arguments,which are not based on the holding or reasoning of cts,more briefly.the defendants assert,for instance,that the fdic extender statute does not apply to claims under the securities act,and instead applies only to contract and tort claims.the textual basis for this argument is that the extender statute sets out limitations periods for any contract claim and any tort claim,without specifically mentioning other types of claims or claims under federal law.d a.in ubs,however,we squarely rejected that argument with respect to the fhfa extender statute,concluding that a reasonable reader could only understand that statute to apply to both the federal and state claims in that case.ubs,at.we relied on congress explicit stat ement that the statute of limitations for any action brought by fhfa as conservator shall be as specified in the extender statute.id.at,quoting b emphases in ubs.because no issue was presented in cts about the types of claims to which applied,cts has no relevance to that part of ubs holding.
similarly,the defendants and the dissent argue that reading the extender statute to displace the securities act statute of repose violates the presumption against repeals by implication,see auburn hous.auth.martinez,cir acknowledging the important principle that repeals by implication are not favored,contending that,under the fdic position,the extender statute in effect repeals the statute of repose for a class of cases those brought by the fdic as conservator or receiver.the dissent further explains that the presumption takes on added importance when it applies to the securities act statute of repose,a prominent and conspicuous provision in this nation securities regulation regime over the past eight decades.dissent at.but the cts opinion does not even mention the presumption,and the policy arguments raised by the dissent would have applied with equal force in ubs,which also dealt with the securities act statute of repose,but which nevertheless held it to be superseded by the extender statute.the presumption against repeals by implication thus does not provide us with any basis for holding that cts undermines the authority of ubs.
conclusion 
the defendants have not identified any aspect of the supreme court decision in cts that requires us to revisit our ubs holding.accordingly,that holding controls this case,and mandates the conclusion that the fdic complaint was timely.the judgment of the district court is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the fdic extender statute,d,extends statute s of limitations under state law for certain contract and tort claims,and it says nothing whatsoever about statutes of repose.nonetheless,the majority opinion interprets this statute to impliedly repeal federal and state statutes of repose,including the statute of repose in the securities act of,one of its key provisions.that result is not grounded in the text of the extender statute.instead,it is extrapolated from our court decision in fhfa ubs americas,cir,where we held that the fhfa extender statute,b,which is materially identical to the fdic,superseded the securities act repose period.but ubs was decided without the benefit of the supreme court subsequent decision in cts waldburger,d.that case discussed,in considerable detail,the differences between statutes of limitation and statutes of repose.see id.at.the majority reasoning fails,in my view,to adequately account for those differences and perpetuates the confusion surrounding the two types of statutes that existed before cts.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
the question before the supreme court in cts was whether cercla reference to a statute of limitations also encompassed a statute of repose,a question of direct relevance to this case.plaintiffs in cts had brought a nuisance action under north carolina law,which uses a statute of limitations and a statute of repose for such tort suits.at.because plaintiffs had brought suit well outside the repose period,their action was untimely unless cercla extender provision,delayed the running of both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose.the supreme court held that cercla reference to a statute of limitations means exactly what it says it extends only limitations periods,not repose periods.id.at section mandates a distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.
the majority contends that cts did not purport to lay out a novel framework for determining the scope of an extender provision.majority op.at.i read the case differently.what the court did was to focus on the central distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose and to make clear that those two types of statutes are measured from different points,seek to attain different purposes,and are targeted at a different actor.at.a statute of limitations,the court emphasized,creates a time limit for suing in a civil case,based on the date when the claim accrued and targets a plaintiff obligation to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims.id.by contrast,a statute of repose puts an outer limit on the right to bring a civil action,measured not from the date on which the claim accrues but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.id.at.in other words,a statute of repose targets a defendant right to be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.id.at.therefore,cts most certainly does provide the legal framework for determining the scope of the fdic extender statute.
cts also makes clear that in when congress passed the fdic extender statute,it knew the difference between the two types of statutes.after an historical review,the court determined that the general usage of the legal terms has not always been precise,but the concept that the statutes of repose and statutes of limitation are distinct was well enough established to be reflected in the study group report,commissioned by congress as it considered amendments to cercla.at.the report acknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent to statutes of limitation and that a recommendation to preempt the latter did not necessarily include the former.id.at.the court observed that t he scholars and professionals who were discussing this matter and indeed were advising congress knew of a clear distinction between the two.id.emphasis added.
