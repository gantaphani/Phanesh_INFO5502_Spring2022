after oral argument,bcci overseas filed a motion requesting that this court vacate the district court decision and remand the case,thereby affording the district court an opportunity to take into account changes in pakistani law that occurred subsequent to its decision.we consider both the appeal and the motion at this time.
background 
bcci overseas is one of a group of closely affiliated international banks known together as bcci or the bcci group.in,the bcci group collapsed in one of the largest bank failures in history.bank regulators moved to seize bcci assets and bring the group of banks under court supervision.appellant bcci overseas,incorporated in the cayman islands,was one of the banks closed by bank regulators.
on june,the fiduciaries of bcci overseas brought this action in the supreme court of new york,new york county,seeking repayment with interest of an alleged million loan made in may to state bank,the central bank of pakistan.state bank removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to a and b.on may,state bank moved to dismiss the case under the doctrine of forum non conveniens,arguing that pakistan would be a more appropriate forum.
a war of experts ensued as to the adequacy of pakistan as an alternative forum.both bcci overseas and state bank submitted declarations by experts in pakistani law.bcci stated that this action would be barred in pakistan by an unwaivable statute of limitations,and that even if the case were allowed to proceed,the suit would be delayed as many as years by the congestion in the pakistani court system.state bank replied with a declaration averring that a pakistani statute known as the banking companies recovery of loans,advances,credits and finances act of banking act would revive bcci overseas claim by setting a new limitations date for the action.state bank expert also declared that the banking act would provide for the case to be processed in an expedited fashion in the banking court,and that even outside the banking court the case would likely be concluded in seven to ten years at the most.
bcci overseas responded with yet another expert declaration,asserting that the banking act would not revive bcci overseas claim because the claim was already barred by the statute of limitations at the time of the enactment of the law.in addition,the declaration argued that the banking act would not apply to bcci overseas because bcci overseas is not a banking company as defined by the act.this,the declaration contended,would be so because bcci overseas is not currently transacting the business of banking in pakistan state bank expert had earlier stated that bcci overseas would qualify as a banking company under the banking act because bcci overseas was transacting the business of banking in pakistan in june and july of,when the loan contract was allegedly breached by state bank.both experts backed their opinions with textual analysis of the banking act itself.bcci expert also submitted case law in support of his construction of the act.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens.it did this subject to the following three conditions state bank agreement in writing to waive any statute of limitations defense that might be available to it in the pakistani courts the pakistani courts not refusing to hear the case on statute of limitations grounds and state bank agreement in writing to allow bcci overseas to remove any judgment received in a pakistani court out of pakistan.see bank of credit commerce int l overseas state bank of pakistan,d.subsequently,state bank filed a stipulation in which it agreed to the first and third conditions.bcci overseas appealed the dismissal.
on september,the day before appellate in this case,counsel for state bank filed a letter stating that earlier that day,he had received notice from his client that pakistan had promulgated a new banking act on august,entitled the financial institutions recovery of finances ordinance,ordinance,which repealed and,with certain modifications,the banking act of.state bank counsel noted that at least one of the modifications of the statute related to the application of statutes of limitations.under the new law,the banking court apparently may entertain a case already barred by limitations if the plaintiff satisfies the court that it had sufficient cause for not filing the case within the statutory limitations period 
after oral argument bcci overseas filed a motion requesting that this court vacate the district court decision and remand the case in light of this change in the law.bcci overseas maintains that at least three changes made in the ordinance are relevant to the district court forum non conveniens analysis the change in the law provision relating to statutes of limitations the replacement of the terms customers and finances by borrower and loan,with the result,according to bcci overseas,that the new law does not apply to bcci overseas,state bank,or to the transaction at issue and the replacement of the concept of interest with the concept of cost of funds to the financial institution,which bcci overseas contends bars it from recovering any interest in connection with its claim.bcci overseas submits that the district court,not the court of appeals,should in the first instance undertake the task of evaluating the impact of these intervening changes in pakistani law on the issue of forum non conveniens,and therefore that a remand to the district court is appropriate.
state bank counters that this court is fully capable of analyzing the impact of the new law,and state bank expert disputes bcci overseas interpretation of that law.state bank also reaffirms its consent to the addition of a condition first suggested by this court during oral argument that would require pakistani courts to accept jurisdiction of bcci overseas claim under the ordinance.but state bank argues that,if this court does add such a condition,it should also require bcci overseas to bring its claims in pakistan within a reasonable period of time.

the first step in a forum non conveniens analysis is for the court to establish the existence of an adequate alternative forum.see dirienzo,at alfadda,at.an alternative forum is generally adequate if the defendants are subject to service of process there and the forum permits litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.alfadda,at quoting piper aircraft,at.it follows that an adequate forum does not exist if a statute of limitations bars the bringing of the case in that forum.see crimson semiconductor,electronum,see also mercier sheraton int l,cir kontoulas robins,cir.
