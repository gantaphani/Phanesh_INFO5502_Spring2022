this consolidated appeal involves questions of virginia law relating to equitable and statutory tolling,and in particular whether virginia law recognizes the tolling doctrine established in american pipe construction company utah.
the plaintiffs in these four cases appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york keenan,granting summary judgment in favor of defendant merck sharp dohme corporation merck,formerly known as merck,and dismissing their product liability claims for injuries allegedly caused by merck prescription drug,fosamax the plaintiffs filed their separate lawsuits in the southern district of new york based on diversity jurisdiction under.
the plaintiffs,all residents of virginia,raise only state law claims and do not dispute either that virginia statute of limitations applies to their claims or that they filed their actions more than two years after they were first injured.instead,they argue that the statute of limitations was tolled by the pendency of a federal class action filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee on september,which alleged similar injuries and raised similar claims.in particular,the plaintiffs argue that the rule of american pipe should apply,and,accordingly,that the statute of limitations should have been tolled from september until the motion for class certification was denied in that case in january in other words,for some months.
the district court rejected the plaintiffs argument that american pipe applied to their claims and concluded instead that virginia law controlled the timeliness of the action.relying on the fourth circuit decision in wade danek medical,cir,which predicted that the supreme court of virginia would reject tolling for federal class actions filed in foreign jurisdictions,the district court held that virginia law did not permit tolling of a state statute of limitations due to the pendency of a class action filed in another jurisdiction.see in re fosamax prods.liab,d.we agree with the district court that virginia law governs the question of whether the plaintiffs claims were tolled pending the tennessee class action.but,both wade itself,and state and federal court decisions in virginia since wade,leave us less certain whether equitable or statutory tolling is available under virginia law.accordingly,we certify the following two questions to the supreme court of virginia and stay resolution of these cases in the interim 
does virginia law permit equitable tolling of a state statute of limitations due to the pendency of a putative class action in another jurisdiction 
does ann.e permit tolling of a state statute of limitations due to the pendency of a putative class action in another jurisdiction 
background 
fosamax is a prescription drug manufactured by merck that falls within a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates,which are commonly used to treat bone conditions such as osteoperosis.fosamax is a nitrogenous bisphosphonate,and nitrogenous bisphosphonates have allegedly been linked to osteonecrosis bone death of the jaw.plaintiff rebecca quarles was prescribed and took fosamax for roughly six months starting in.she was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the jaw and failure of dental implants on october,and sued merck on december.dorothy deloriea was prescribed and took fosamax in,and developed osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis of the jaw in.she commenced her action against merck on november.ora casey was prescribed and took fosamax for four years,beginning in july.she was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the jaw in,and died three years later,in december.casey estate initiated this action on january.roberta brodin was prescribed and took fosamax beginning in february and was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the jaw in.she initiated her action on may.
quarles,deloriea,casey,and brodin each sued merck in separate actions in the southern district of new york,raising exclusively virginia state law claims.the actions asserted diversity of citizenship as the basis for federal jurisdiction and alleged common claims for strict liability,failure to warn,breach of express and implied warranty,and negligence in the design,testing,development,manufacture,labeling,marketing,distribution and sale of fosamax 
in september,before the plaintiffs filed these cases,a putative class action asserting substantially identical claims on behalf of a nationwide class of fosamax users was filed in the middle district of tennessee.that action,wolfe merck,was transferred to the southern district of new york by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation the district court denied the motion to certify the class in wolfe merck on january.see in re fosamax prods.liab,md,order denying class certification.at least for purposes of this appeal,merck concedes that the plaintiffs would have been members of the certified class had the certification motion been granted by the district court.
on june,merck moved for summary judgment against all three plaintiffs,arguing that new york borrowing statute required application of virginia statute of limitations.merck further argued that,because the plaintiffs complaints were all filed more than four years after they allegedly sustained their injuries,their claims were.
citing american pipe,the plaintiffs responded that their claims were timely because virginia statute of limitations was tolled for months during the pendency of the wolfe class action,until the district court denied class certification.the plaintiffs argued that,under american pipe,which involved federal claims and a federal statute of limitations,the filing of a putative class action tolls the limitations period for absent class members,regardless of whether the claims of absent members arise under federal or state law or whether the applicable state law permits tolling.
on march,the district court granted merck summary judgment motion.see in re fosamax prods.liab,d.the court agreed with merck that new york choice of law rules applied and that new york borrowing statute,required application of the shorter limitations period,including all relevant tolling provisions,of either new york or the state where the cause of action accrued.id.at quoting stuart am.cyanamid,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because the cause of action accrued in virginia,the district court applied virginia shorter,statute of limitations.id.
the district court rejected the plaintiffs contention that the pendency of the wolfe class action tolled virginia limitations period for their claims.the court observed that american pipe involved the tolling of a federal statute of limitations period based on the filing of a prior federal,rather than state,cause of action.id.at.it held,relying on our decision in in re agent orange product liability litigation,cir,that a federal diversity court applies state law in determining whether a statute of limitations has been tolled,and that the applicable state statute of limitations here,that of virginia was tolled during the pendency of the wolfe class action only if the american pipe rule also applies under the laws of that state.d at.
the district court next addressed whether virginia law would allow the wolfe class action filed in a foreign jurisdiction tennessee to toll the limitations period of an action arising in virginia in other words,whether virginia law would allow for class action tolling.id.at.the district court asserted that n o virginia court has answered these questions,id.at,but that the fourth circuit had definitively held that the virginia supreme court would not adopt a equitable tolling rule.id.quoting wade,at internal quotation marks omitted.deferring to wade,the district court found that the plaintiffs claims were not tolled and were therefore untimely under virginia law.it accordingly granted summary judgment in favor of merck.d at.

discussion 
the central question in this appeal is whether the pendency of a putative class action filed in a different jurisdiction tolled the statute of limitations for the plaintiffs state law claims.that question turns on whether state or federal tolling law applies in this context and if state tolling law does apply,the content of virginia law.we review legal conclusions,including the application of a statute of limitations,de novo.somoza new york city dep t of,cir.
american pipe tolling 
in american pipe,the supreme court announced a rule intended to preserve the individual right to sue of the members of a proposed class until the issue of class certification has been decided.in re agent orange,at.although the plaintiffs do not dispute that virginia limitations period applies to their claims,they assert that american pipe announced a federal tolling rule that applies to all cases filed in federal court,regardless of the nature of the claims or the basis for federal jurisdiction.whether american pipe tolling is applicable to state causes of action is an open question in this circuit.
we addressed this issue in in re agent orange.in that case,three employees of the university of hawaii filed a class action seeking relief for a putative class of individuals on the hawaiian island of kauai who had been exposed to the toxic chemical agent orange.at.hawaii statute of limitations began to run in,and the employees commenced their tort action in.id.at.however,in reliance on american pipe,they asserted that the statute of limitations for their claims should be tolled based on the pendency of a separate class action filed in a different jurisdiction alleging injuries caused by agent orange.in dictum,we noted that it was doubtful that american pipe can be treated as applicable precedent given that t he limitation period of american pipe was derived from a federal statute whereas in in re agent orange,we were dealing with hawaii limitation statutes.id.at.we then concluded that the plaintiffs could not rely on the rule of american pipe in any event because they were not and could not have become a part of the other class action.see id.at.
we recognize that,like the district court here,certain district courts have interpreted our decision in in re agent orange as holding conclusively that american pipe can apply only to cases involving federal causes of action and federal statutes of limitation,and that state rather than federal law applies to tolling issues whenever jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship.see,in re rezulin prods.liab,wl,at,williams dow chem,civ,wl,at june.but see primavera familienstifung askin,d,t he second circuit has assumed the validity of justice rehnquist categorical statement in his chardon fumero soto dissent internal citations and quotation marks omitted,modified on other grounds,d.we do not read in re agent orange or any of our precedents,however,as either conclusively resolving the question of american pipe application to federal court cases arising under state law or addressing the issue of tolling.
to the extent that in re agent orange did not squarely resolve the issue,we now join the majority of our sister courts that have addressed the issue in holding that a federal court evaluating the timeliness of state law claims must look to the law of the relevant state to determine whether,and to what extent,the statute of limitations should be tolled by the filing of a putative class action in another jurisdiction.see,clemens daimlerchrysler,cir declining to import a tolling rule into california law,which otherwise does not have such a rule,and finding that t he rule of american pipe which allows tolling within the federal court system in federal question class actions does not mandate tolling as a matter of state procedure wade,at refusing to import a tolling provision into virginia law,and holding that state law tolling provisions trump conflicting federal law where a federal court sits in diversity vaught showa denko,cir t his texas rule clearly conflicts with the federal practice on class action tolling.we conclude,however,that,for this case,the federal interest in that practice does not trump the texas tolling rule.we find the reasoning of these cases compelling and agree that tolling here is properly understood to be a question of state law.see guar.trust of york,schermerhorn metro.transp,cir.
determining virginia law 
to determine questions of state law,we look principally to the opinions of that state courts.where,as here,a question of state law has not been conclusively resolved by those courts,our general practice is to look next to the law of the circuit in which the state is located,here the fourth circuit.see factors,pro arts,cir.however,where circuit law is no more conclusive,or where we have some reason to question the continuing validity of that law,certification of one or more questions to a state highest court is an option at our disposal.see,desiano warner lambert,cir.indeed,because certification was not available to the court in factors,it could not resolve the question of our ability to certify a question of state law to a state court even though the question had already been answered by the sister circuit whose jurisdiction included the state in question.we did,however,appear to anticipate the issues that might then arise.see factors,at describing the policy rationales for deferring to sister circuits on questions of state law,e xcept in those then few jurisdictions permitting a federal court to certify.when,as here,we lack sufficient indicia on which to decide an issue of state law despite a relevant prior federal court of appeals decision,certification to a state court may be warranted.factors does not prevent us from certifying a question of virginia law to a virginia court even though there is a prior decision on point from the fourth circuit.
certification 
under our rules and those of the supreme court of virginia,we may certify a question to that body where a question of state law is determinative of a claim before us and it appears that there is no controlling precedent on point in the decisions of the supreme court of virginia or the court of appeals of virginia.a cir.local.we do not certify every case that meets these criteria,but instead evaluate at least three factors in determining whether certification is appropriate the absence of authoritative state court decisions the importance of the issue to the state and the capacity of certification to resolve the litigation.town of wappinger,cir.
wade danek medical.
as the district court correctly observed,d at,the supreme court of virginia has never addressed the precise question of whether virginia law would allow for a tolling rule either equitable or statutory.the fourth circuit,however,provided some guidance over a decade ago in wade.under factors,our analysis of virginia law starts,therefore,with wade,which held that the supreme court of virginia would not adopt an equitable rule of tolling for federal class actions.
jeannette wade initiated a products liability action against the manufacturer of a spinal fixation device that doctors implanted in wade back to ease her back pain.the device caused wade to develop arachnoiditis and incontinence in april,and she had the device removed in april.at.meanwhile,two federal class actions were filed against various manufacturers of the same spinal fixation devices,including danek medical,in federal courts in pennsylvania and louisiana.id.wade and her husband were putative class members in both actions.id.wade filed her action in the eastern district of virginia in october,and the district court dismissed it as untimely.on appeal,wade argued that virginia statute of limitations was tolled by the pendency of the federal class actions.
the fourth circuit affirmed the district court dismissal,finding that the supreme court of virginia would not apply an equitable tolling rule for federal class actions filed outside virginia for three reasons.id.at.first,the court determined that virginia has no interest in promoting class action procedures in other jurisdictions because it has no class action procedures itself.second,the court explained that virginia has an interest in avoiding the flood of filings that would result if it adopted a class action tolling rule.third,the court noted that the supreme court of virginia has historically resisted
