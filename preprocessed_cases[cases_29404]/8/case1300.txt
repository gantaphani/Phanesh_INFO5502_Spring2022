factual background 
defendants criminal.the robbery scheme 
over the course of an trial,at which approximately witnesses testified,the prosecution proved that between mid and early,defendants davis and gunn,along with others,participated in a conspiracy to rob suspected drug dealers of money and drugs.of the six robberies or attempted robberies about which evidence was introduced,three occurred in the bronx,one in queens,one on long island,and one in maryland.during the maryland robbery,in which davis,but not gunn,participated,approximately was stolen.in committing robberies,one or more of the conspirators usually was armed with a gun,such that during the elmont robbery,which targeted a bronx drug dealer named robert deleon,davis shot and killed deleon wife,stephanie laing,and during the wickham robbery,davis shot and killed the robbery target,gary grey.insofar as this opinion focuses on davis venue challenge to the substantive counts pertaining to the attempted elmont robbery,we limit our further discussion of facts to those charges.
the elmont robbery 
in the fall of,gunn spoke with confederate derrilyn needham about robbing bobby sox,whom he identified as a drug dealer.trial tr.gunn directed needham to locate bobby sox,whose real name was robert deleon,and to secure his license plate number sometime thereafter,needham spotted deleon in a car parked on white plains road in the bronx.after needham copied deleon license plate number,she and gunn enlisted a contact with access to records from the new york state department of motor vehicles to run the plate.id.at.the conspirators thus learned that the vehicle was registered to stephanie laing at locustwood boulevard in elmont,long island,within the eastern district of new york.together with three other persons,gunn surveyed the elmont address and concluded that a robbery was doable.id.at.lacking confidence in his cohort,however,gunn asked needham to secure davis participation in the robbery,which she did.at this point in the conspiracy,davis had already participated with gunn and needham in one successful robbery in the bronx,as well as in failed robbery attempts in the bronx and queens.he had also participated successfully with needham in the maryland robbery.
testifying for the prosecution,robert deleon stated that in the summer and fall of,he lived with stephanie laing and their children at locustwood boulevard in elmont.during that time,he sold large quantities of marijuana in the bronx and manhattan.deleon explained that,approximately three times per month,he received to pounds of marijuana from california at his elmont home.there,he would break down the shipments into smaller packages that he personally delivered in his car to customers in the bronx and manhattan approximately six times a week.id.at.deleon would bring the money earned from these transactions back to elmont.on october,the date of the planned robbery,deleon had neither drugs nor large amounts of money in his elmont home,having received and distributed a shipment of marijuana the week before.
early on the morning of october,davis armed himself with a caliber handgun and went to the targeted residence to commit the robbery.not finding either gunn or another confederate each of whom was supposed to serve as a lookout at the scene,davis called needham at her home in the bronx and asked her to contact the two missing men to find out where they were.needham did so and reported back to davis that neither man could participate in the robbery that morning.davis then asked needham to come to elmont and herself serve as lookout.she replied that she could not do so but offered to call tammy,who agreed to provide the needed assistance.thereafter,at least three persons joined davis to carry out the elmont robbery.
on the morning of october,deleon was home with laing and the couple two children.also present in the house were deleon mother and sister.as part of the morning routine,deleon daughter went outside to warm up deleon car.as she reentered the house,davis came up behind her and forced his way inside.laing screamed when she saw the intruder and ran upstairs,with davis in pursuit.hearing the scream,deleon grabbed a glock caliber handgun from his bedroom,confronted davis,and shot him in the right shoulder.deleon then ran downstairs,where he chased and fired at the other robbers.meanwhile,the wounded davis entered the bedroom where laing had sought refuge with deleon mother,eneta brown.brown saw davis lean over to say something to laing which brown could not hear whereupon davis shot laing,first in the eye and then in the chest,killing the woman.davis also tried to shoot brown,who was trying to hide under the bed,but his gun misfired.
together with his confederates,davis then fled the scene,going first to a cousin home in brooklyn and then to a brooklyn hospital for treatment of the gunshot wound to his shoulder.when local police detectives reported to the hospital to investigate the shooting,he falsely reported being the victim of a street dispute in brooklyn.in fact,later that day,he would tell a group of persons,including needham,about the events in elmont.needham testified that davis sounded almost boastful in relaying his killing of laing.id.at.thereafter,he would also tell needham that he planned to kill bobby sox,deleon,for shooting him.
although davis never achieved that murderous objective,in the course of the january attempted wickham robbery,in which he participated with gunn and needham,davis shot and killed robbery target gary grey.davis had decided the night before the robbery to murder grey in order to prevent him from retaliating against the person who gave the robbers entry into his home.
following his march arrest by federal and state officials,davis admitted being present during the attempted elmont robbery,being fired upon,and shooting back,but claimed to have done so only reflexively,not intending to kill laing.
b.the district court rejection of davis venue challenge 
the government venue argument and the court jury charge 
in its summation to the jury,the government argued that venue in the southern district of new york for the crimes related to the attempted elmont robbery was supported by needham procurement in the bronx of the target license plate number needham efforts,in response to davis october,telephone call,to secure people to help davis commit the robbery and the robbery effect on interstate commerce in the bronx,where the robbery target dealt drugs.
in its charge to the jury,the district court stated that venue for robbery or attempted robbery is proper in any district where interstate commerce is affected or where the acts in furtherance of the robbery or attempted robbery took place.id.at.this language was taken almost verbatim from the parties joint proposed jury charge.
davis rule challenge to venue 
prior to trial,davis moved unsuccessfully to dismiss the hobbs act and firearms counts relating to the attempted elmont robbery,arguing that venue for these three crimes was lacking in the southern district of new york.davis renewed the venue challenge toward the close of evidence,moving for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to.after the verdict,the district court denied the motion,identifying two acts in furtherance of the attempted robbery that had taken place in the southern district needham procurement of deleon license plate number in the bronx,the key act enabling the robbery crew to locate deleon house and needham calling tammy from the bronx to act as a lookout,which action allow ed the crime to go forward.united states davis,cr whp,wl,at.the district court further concluded that,with venue in the southern district thus established for the underlying crime of violence,it necessarily followed that venue in the southern district was also established for the related firearms crimes.id.citing united states rodriguez moreno.
davis sentence and appeal 
the district court proceeded to sentence davis to concurrent prison terms of years on the hobbs act conspiracy count one,years on the attempted elmont robbery count two,years on the attempted wickham robbery count three,life on the use and discharge of a firearm during the attempted elmont robbery resulting in death count five,life on the use and discharge of a firearm during the attempted wickham robbery resulting in death count seven,and years on the conspiracy to traffic in more than kilograms of marijuana count eight.the district court also imposed concurrent terms of lifetime supervised release on each count of conviction and a total special assessment of.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
davis contends that the district court erred in rejecting his venue challenge to the three substantive counts of conviction pertaining to the attempted elmont robbery counts two,four,and five.he maintains that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to permit venue for these crimes to have been found in the southern district of new york.because davis is serving concurrent life sentences for shooting and killing persons in the wickham robbery as well as the elmont robbery,and because proof of the elmont robbery and the related firearms charges was properly admitted to prove the overall hobbs act conspiracy charge,it is doubtful that he would realize any practical benefit from a successful venue challenge to the counts of conviction pertaining to the elmont robbery.nevertheless,because we recognize that the fact of concurrent sentences on two counts does not moot a challenge to one count,see ball united states,we proceed to address davis venue challenge,and we conclude that it is meritless.
a.the venue requirement 
a defendant right to be tried in the state and district in which the charged crime shall have been committed is grounded in two provisions of the constitution,see const.art.iii,cl.id.amend.vi,and reiterated in.the requirement derives from colonial grievances against the crown,which had sometimes transported american colonists across the sea to stand trial in england.see drew kershen,vicinage,noting specific reference to this grievance in declaration of independence.thus,the constitution venue requirement was adopted to shield a federal defendant from the unfairness and hardship of prosecution in a remote place.united states cores,see story,commentaries on the constitution of the united states,at photo.reprint boston,hilliard,gray observing that object of constitution vicinage clause is to prevent accused from being dragged to a trial in some distant state.
despite its constitutional pedigree,venue is not an element of any crime,so as to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.rather,venue need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states tzolov,cir united states rommy,cir collecting cases the sufficiency of the evidence to support a preponderance finding of venue is a question of law that we review de novo,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states tzolov,at.
where,as here,a defendant is charged with multiple crimes in a single indictment,the government must satisfy venue with respect to each charge.see united states beech nut nutrition,cir.in considering whether the government has carried this burden,we begin by determining the locus delicti of the particular crime at issue,employing the analysis set forth in united states rodriguez moreno,which seeks first to identify the conduct constituting the offense,and then to discern the location of the commission of the criminal acts.at see also united states cabrales,t he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.united states ramirez,cir.although statutory language necessarily informs the first step of the analysis,the supreme court has rejected a rigid verb test that unduly limits the inquiry into the nature of the offense and thereby creates a danger that certain conduct prohibited by statute will be missed.united states saavedra,cir quoting united states rodriguez moreno,at.
similarly,at the second step,the law recognizes that not all crimes consist of a single,act,so as to locate venue in a single district.see united states ramirez,f d at.the commission of some crimes can span several districts.united states rommy,at.in such circumstances,congress has instructed that venue properly lies in any district in which the charged offense was begun,continued,or completed.a.
to comport with constitutional safeguards,we have construed this language to require more than some activity in the situs district instead,there must be substantial contacts,considering the site of the defendant acts,the elements and nature of the crime,the locus of the effect of the criminal conduct,and the suitability of each district for accurate factfinding.united states reed,cir accord united states royer,cir.further,to support venue,what is begun or continued in a district must be a part of the actual charged crime,not merely steps preparatory to the crime.see united states tzolov,at united states beech nut nutrition,at.
finally,there must be some sense of venue having been freely chosen by the defendant.united states reed,at.this does not mean that evidence must show that a defendant had actual knowledge that particular acts would occur in a particular district to support venue at that location.rather,it asks whether the acts occurrence in the district of venue would have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.united states rommy,at.
with these principles in mind,we consider davis venue challenge.
b.the conduct constituting the crimes of conviction 
although davis challenges venue on three counts of conviction the hobbs act attempted elmont robbery count two,c use of a firearm in furtherance of the elmont robbery count four,and j use of a firearm in furtherance of the elmont robbery resulting in death count five we need focus only on the hobbs act count in light of supreme court precedent holding that w here venue is appropriate for the underlying crime of violence,it is also appropriate for related firearms offenses committed in furtherance of the act of violence.united states rodriguez moreno,at.
in identifying the conduct constituting the charged hobbs act offense,id.at,we begin with the statutory text.the hobbs act prohibits,among other things,in any way or degree obstruct ing,delay ing,or affect ing commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by robbery or extortion.a.the statute defines robbery to mean the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence of another by means of actual or threatened force,or violence,or fear of injury,immediate or future,to his person or property.id.b.because the hobbs act criminalizes a particular type of robbery,one that obstructs,delays,or affects commerce,id.a venue for a substantive hobbs act charge is proper in any district where interstate commerce is affected or where the alleged acts took place.uni
