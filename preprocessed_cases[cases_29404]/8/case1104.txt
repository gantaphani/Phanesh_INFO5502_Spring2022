on petition for rehearing 
on september,we affirmed three orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york torres,directing certain banks to turnover assets of republic of sudan sudan to satisfy a judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs against sudan in the united states district court for the district of columbia the district court,in the amount of.sudan petitions for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc,supported by the united states of america,as amicus curiae.
after further briefing and argument,upon due consideration,we adhere to our decision to affirm.the petition is denied to the extent it seeks panel rehearing.
background 
the facts and procedural history are set forth in our september,opinion,familiarity with which is assumed.see harrison republic of sudan,cir.the panel opinion.we summarize the background as follows 
this case arises from the bombing of the cole in the port of aden,yemen,in.sailors and spouses of sailors injured in the explosion brought suit against sudan in the district court under the fsia,et,alleging that al qaeda was responsible for the attack and that sudan had provided material support to al qaeda.
the action was commenced in october,and,at plaintiffs request,the clerk of the district court served the summons and complaint on sudan in november by mailing the papers to the minister of foreign affairs of sudan via the sudanese embassy in washington.the papers were sent via registered mail,return receipt requested to

washington,dc 
as represented by plaintiffs,deng alor koul was the minister of foreign affairs of sudan at the time.
on november,the clerk of court entered a certificate of mailing certifying that the summons and complaint were sent via domestic certified mail to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs,via the sudanese embassy in washington,and that the return receipt was returned to the clerk of court and received on november.no attempt was made to serve sudan by mail to the address of the ministry of foreign affairs in khartoum,the capital.sudan failed to serve an answer or other responsive pleading within sixty days after plaintiffs service,see d,and the clerk of court thus entered a default against sudan.
on march,after a hearing,the district court lamberth,entered a default judgment against sudan in the amount of,harrison republic of sudan,d,and found,inter alia,that service on sudan had been proper,id.at.at the request of plaintiffs,on april,the clerk of the court mailed a copy of the default judgment by registered mail,return receipt requested,to sudan minister of foreign affairs,via the sudanese embassy in washington.while it does not appear that the receipt was returned,plaintiffs submitted proof that the mailing was delivered.
the judgment was thereafter registered in the southern district of new york.in december and january,the southern district issued three turnover orders,directing certain banks to turnover assets of sudan to plaintiffs.it was only after the last of these three turnover orders was entered that sudan finally filed a notice of appearance,on january.the same day,sudan appealed the turnover orders to this court 
in affirming the turnover orders,we held that service of process on the minister of foreign affairs via the sudanese embassy in washington,was sufficient to meet the requirements of the fsia.harrison,at.we also held that the district court did not err in issuing the turnover orders without first obtaining a license from the treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac or a statement of interest from the department of justice.id.at.
on october,sudan filed this petition for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc.although it had not appeared in the earlier proceedings,the united states filed an amicus brief in support of the petition on november.after further briefing,we heard argument on march.we now deny the petition to the extent it seeks panel rehearing.
discussion 
sudan and the united states argue that the panel opinion misinterprets a of the fsia and puts the united states in violation of its obligations under the vienna convention on diplomatic relations,entered into force in united states,hereinafter vienna convention.in its reply brief,sudan also makes the factual argument that the summons and complaint were not actually delivered to the embassy.finally,as to the issue of the requirement of an ofac license,the united states argues that the fsia does not override the requirement of an ofac license.we address each of these issues in turn.
interpretation of a 
sudan and the united states argue that the panel opinion incorrectly interprets a of the fsia.we acknowledge that the statutory interpretation question presents a close call,and that the language of a is not completely clear.nonetheless,for the reasons discussed below,we believe,as a matter of statutory construction,that the better reading of the statute favors plaintiffs position.accordingly,we adhere to our prior decision.
a.the plain language 
the starting point in statutory interpretation is the statute plain meaning,if it has one.united states dauray,cir.section a of the fsia reads service in the courts of the united states and of the states shall be made upon a foreign state or political subdivision of a foreign state by sending a copy of the summons and complaint and a notice of suit to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.a 
on its face,the statute does not specify a location where the papers are to be sent it specifies only that the papers are to be addressed and dispatched to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.nothing in a requires that the papers be mailed to a location in the foreign state,or indeed to any particular address,and nothing in the statute precluded the method chosen by plaintiffs.a mailing addressed to the minister of foreign affairs via sudan embassy in washington,was consistent with the language of the statute and could reasonably be expected to result in delivery to the intended person plaintiffs literally complied with the statute they sent a copy of the summons and complaint addressed to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of sudan.
the statute does not specify that the mailing be sent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs in the foreign country.if congress had wanted to require that the mailing be sent to the minister of foreign affairs at the principal office of the ministry in the foreign country,it could have said so but it did not.see burrage united states,d the role of this court is to apply the statute as it is written even if we think some other approach might accor d with good policy.quoting commissioner lundy,d cent.bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d rejecting argument that aiding and abetting liability existed because congress did not use words aid and abet in statutory text and noting that congress knew how to impose aiding and abetting liability when it chose to do so.in a,for example,congress specified that the papers be mailed to the secretary of state in washington,district of columbia,to the attention of the director of special consular services,for transmittal to the foreign state through diplomatic channels.a emphasis added.
the united states argues that the fsia service provisions require strict compliance,and that mailing the papers to the foreign minister at a place other than the foreign ministry is not authorized by the statute.amicus br.of the united states at.the united states argues that t he most natural understanding of the statute text is that the mail will be sent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs at his or her regular place of work,at the ministry of foreign affairs in the state seat of government.id.at.this argument is unpersuasive,as it would require us to read the words at his or her regular place of work or at the state seat of government into the statute.see dean united states,d courts must ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face quoting bates united states,d.
the united states argues that our reading of a is undermined by other provisions in the statute.it argues that because the fsia permits the use of an authorized agent only in the context of service under b the provision that deals with service on foreign state agencies and instrumentalities we should infer that congress did not intend to allow service on a foreign state via delivery to any entity that could,by analogy,be considered the foreign state officer or agent,including the state embassy.amicus br.of the united states at.this argument rests on the premise that the panel opinion requires an embassy to act as an agent of a foreign state.we did not so hold,and,to the extent there is any doubt,we now clarify.
we do not hold that an embassy is an agent for service or a proxy for service for a foreign state.there is a significant difference between serving process on an embassy,and mailing papers to a country foreign ministry via the embassy.here,the summons and complaint were addressed to the sudanese minister of foreign affairs,by name and title,at the sudanese embassy.the embassy accepted the papers,signing for them and sending back a return receipt to the clerk of court the embassy could have rejected the mailing,but instead it accepted the papers and then explicitly acknowledged receipt.accordingly,the papers were not served on the embassy as a proxy or agent for sudan,but they were instead mailed to the minister of foreign affairs,in the most natural way possible addressed to him,by name,via sudan embassy.
in short,while the language of the statute is not wholly unambiguous,we believe that the better reading is that it did not require service on the foreign minister at his or her regular place of work or in the state seat of government.hence,service on the foreign minister via the embassy was not inconsistent with the wording of the statute.
legislative history 
we turn to the legislative history to see whether it sheds light on the statutory interpretation question.
as we noted in the panel opinion,while the house judiciary committee report makes clear that the statute does not permit service by the mailing of a copy of the summons and complaint to a diplomatic mission of the foreign state,see,at,as reprinted in,it does not address the question of mailing the papers to the minister of foreign affairs via or care of an embassy.the report provides,
special note should be made of two means which are currently in use in attempting to commence litigation against a foreign state a second means,of questionable validity,involves the mailing of a copy of the summons and complaint to a diplomatic mission of the foreign state.section precludes this method so as to avoid questions of inconsistency with section of article of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations,ust,tias,which entered into force in the united states on december.service on an embassy by mail would be precluded under this bill.see of state bull.
as we noted in the panel opinion,the report fails to make the distinction at issue in the instant case,between s ervice on an embassy by mail,id.emphasis added,and service on a minister or foreign affairs via or care of an embassy.the legislative history does not address,any more than does the statutory text,whether congress intended to permit the mailing of service to a foreign minister via an embassy.what it does make clear,however,is that congress was concerned about the interaction of this provision and article of the vienna convention.accordingly,we must consider the vienna convention,which we discuss below.
judicial interpretation 
before turning to the vienna convention,we consider the case law on the statutory interpretation issue.
as we noted in the panel opinion,we are not alone in our reading of a.in wye oak technology,republic of iraq,the eastern district of virginia held that section a does not impose a requirement that an otherwise proper service package must be delivered to a particular destination,wl,at.june,aff on other grounds,cir.there,the court held that service via an embassy is sufficient to satisfy the fsia as long as the service is directed to the minister of foreign affairs.id.at.the eastern district of virginia also so held in rux republic of sudan,wl,at the text of a does not prohibit service on the minister of foreign affairs at an embassy address.indeed,the statute does not prescribe the place of service,only the person to whom process must be served.it is true,as sudan argues,that these were district court opinions,but sudan has not cited any case,district court or otherwise,holding that the mailing of papers addressed to the minister of foreign affairs via an embassy does not comply with the statute.
none of the cases relied on by sudan or the united states undermines our reading of a.in four of the cases,the plaintiffs served the papers on the embassy or the ambassador,without addressing them to the minister of foreign affairs.see barot embassy of the republic of zambia,cir.service package addressed to embassy autotech techs.lp integral research dev,cir.no record of service but counsel submitted affidavit stating document had been served on the embassy in washington,alberti empresa nicaraguense de la carne,cir.service package addressed to ambassador ellenbogen v.the canadian embassy,no,wl,at,service package addressed to embassy.consequently,those plaintiffs did not comply with the statute.
in another case,we interpreted a different provision of the fsia,b,and held that persons entitled to diplomatic immunity are not proper agents for service under the fsia.tachiona united states,cir.holding that b does not authorize service on foreign officials present in united states as agents for a private political party.tachiona did not address the issue before us.in two other cases,the opinions do not say to whom the papers were addressed.see lucchino foreign countries of brazil,korea,spain,mexico,argentina,d realty united arab emirates gov t,supp.
section a explicitly provides that service on a foreign sovereign must be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.a emphasis added.cases involving mailings not so addressed are not controlling.we adhere to our conclusion that the plain language of a does not foreclose the plaintiffs method of service.
ii.the vienna convention 
sudan and the united states contend that the panel opinion places the united states in violation of the vienna convention.they contend that the panel opinion will complicate international relations by subjecting the united states and other countries to service of process via any of its diplomatic missions throughout the world,despite its policy to refuse such service.as a preliminary matter,we note that these arguments were not properly raised in sudan initial briefs.nonetheless,we exercise our discretion to consider the arguments,and we reject them.
the fsia is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of the united states.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.as noted above,the legislative history of the fsia demonstrates unequivocally that the act was not intended to affect the immunity of diplomatic or consular representatives,that was established under the vienna convention and customary international law.tachiona,at quoting,at.under the terms of the vienna convention,the united states,in its role as a receiving state of foreign missions,is obligated to protect and respect the premises of any foreign mission located within its sovereign territory.bennett islamic republic of iran,d,aff,cir.
the panel opinion does not conflict with the vienna convention.the vienna convention provides that t he premises of the mission shall be inviolable,and that a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the host state civil and administrative jurisdiction.vienna convention,see also,at service on an embassy by mail would be precluded under this bill.we acknowledge that these provisions preclude service of process on an embassy or diplomat a
