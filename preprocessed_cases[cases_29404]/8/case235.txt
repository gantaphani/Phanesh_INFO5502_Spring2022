maine medical center mmc tax refund suit stalled when the district court found that jurisdictional discovery was not warranted and that without such discovery,mmc could not meet its burden of demonstrating jurisdiction.mmc appealed the district court judgment for the government,arguing that it had offered sufficient evidence to merit jurisdictional discovery.ultimately,mmc did not make an adequate threshold showing that its refund claim was timely filed,and thus the district court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.after careful review,we affirm.
facts background 
the facts of this case are largely undisputed.as early as august,maine medical center began to look into filing a tax refund claim for reimbursement of taxes paid under the federal insurance contributions act fica on behalf of its medical residents in on that date,kevin montminy,mmc acting director of audit and compliance services,discussed the potential refund claim with al swallow,mmc associate vice president of finance.over the following months,montminy continued to monitor and consider the possibility of filing a refund claim for the fica taxes.
during a march,conference call,montminy discussed the fica refund claim with two accountants from ernst young,maggie and jeanne schuster.then,in early april,montminy faxed a draft copy of the refund claim to schuster and joceyln bishop,another accountant,noting that the refund request was due on april.on april and,montminy and schuster emailed each other regarding the specific information needed to complete the refund claim.ernst young invoice later referenced professional tax services rendered through april,with a specific devoted to researching the fica refund claim.
on april,montminy,swallow,and two other mmc employees,john heye,the vice president of finance and treasurer,and gene joyner,the assistant director of financial planning,met to discuss the status of the fica refund claim.at the meeting,they decided to file the claim form on april.after the meeting,montminy initiated a series of emails with jeff winchenbach,mmc director of financial services,in order to obtain necessary details for the refund filing the email exchange continued until after the close of business on april.
at pm on april,the day the claim was due,montminy met with heye to get the final draft of the claim form approved.heye signed the form,and montminy took it back to his office to have his assistant,debbie raspiller,prepare it for certified mailing.at pm,raspiller faxed the completed signature page back to heye for his file.
montminy standard practice then would have been to drive to the main united states post office on forest avenue in portland,maine,and mail the claim via certified mail,return receipt requested.montminy believes this practice was followed however,neither he nor anyone else at mmc has a specific memory of completing the mailing,and no one at mmc is aware of the identity of the postal service employee who would have dealt with the mailing of the claim no one can locate the certified mail receipt or the return receipt mmc admits that the claim was not mailed for delivery.the internal revenue service irs asserts that it has no record of ever receiving the claim.
on december,mmc filed a refund suit against the government in the united states district court for the district of maine regarding its,and refund claims.the government conceded that the and claims were timely filed however,the government refused to answer interrogatories or provide documents in response to mmc discovery requests as they pertained to the claim arguing that the claim was not timely filed,and that because timely filing is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a refund suit,the court did not have jurisdiction over the claim.the district court referred the discovery dispute to a magistrate judge.on february,the magistrate issued an order finding that mmc lacked any basis to compel discovery from the irs,and that without further discovery,mmc could not prove the jurisdictional prerequisite of timely filing of the claim see me.med.ctr.united states,d.mmc objected to the order,but the district court denied the objections.on march,the parties filed a joint stipulation pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,voluntarily dismissing the and tax refund claims without prejudice and granting mmc the right to reinstate the claims within two years of the date of the stipulation.within the joint stipulation,the parties further requested that the district judge enter final judgment as to the refund,stipulating to the facts and conclusions of law contained in the magistrate order.the district judge construed this request as a motion for final judgment for the defendant,and entered judgment for the united states as to the refund claim.mmc then appealed that judgment to this court

originally,only proof of actual,physical delivery could satisfy a timely filed requirement.see phila.marine,at citing united states lombardo.as the irs claims that it did not receive mmc return,this method of proving timely filing is clearly not available to mmc.however,over time,courts developed what came to be known as the common law mailbox rule,t o help courts determine when the pertinent document was physically delivered,allowing for the presumption that physical delivery occurred in the ordinary time after mailing.id.emphasis added.while permitting a to presume that properly mailed documents would actually be received in due course by the addressee,unless delivery was in fact the norm,receipt by the addressee was not deemed to have occurred on the same day as the mailing.me.med,d at quoting carroll comm r,cir internal quotation mark omitted accord phila.marine,at noting that a taxpayer could not rely on the common law mailbox rule to prove timely filing because it mailed the document before the deadline,but too late for that document to arrive on time in the ordinary course of post office business.because mmc alleges that it mailed its return on the afternoon of april,and admits that it did not use delivery,there is no way the refund request could have arrived by the filing deadline the same day as it was mailed in the ordinary course of post office business.thus,the common law mailbox rule is not available to mmc as a means of proving timely filing of the refund request for purposes of a jurisdiction 
there is,however,yet another means of proving timely filing in,congress created a statutory mailbox rule when it enacted of the internal revenue code,which allows t imely mailing to be treated as timely filing when certain requirements are met.congress purpose,in enacting,was to alleviate inequities arising from differences in mail delivery from one part of the country to another.miller,at citing sylvan comm r.section provides both a general rule under a and a specific rule for registered or certified mail under c.section c allows for a registered or certified mail receipt to provide prima facie evidence of delivery on the postmark date c.however,because mmc does not possess a certified mail receipt or a return receipt,it is unable to avail themselves of the c rule therefore,the only remaining option is the general rule under a.
section a provides in relevant part 
a general rule.date of delivery.if any return,claim,statement,or other document required to be filed,or any payment required to be made,within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws is,after such period or such date,delivered by united states mail to the agency,officer,or office with which such return,claim,statement,or other document is required to be filed,or to which such payment is required to be made,the date of the united states postmark stamped on the cover in which such return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment,as the case may be.
a emphasis added.
most courts hold that a taxpayer must show eventual actual delivery,even if it is after the expiration of the statute of limitations,if that taxpayer is to take advantage of the benefits of a.see phila.marine,at section a protects the taxpayer only where the irs actually receives the document at some later time.miller,at noting that section a applies only in cases where the document is received by the after the statutory period,and citing legislative history stating that the statute applies in the case where documents are mailed and are received by the irs after the statutory period has expired lee brick tile united states,noting that a applies only where a document is actually received by the irs but belatedly delivered.this analysis is consistent with the plain language of the statute,which requires that the relevant document be delivered by the united states mail.a see also me.med,d at stating that the essential requirement of a,according to its plain language,is actual delivery quoting estate of wood comm r,cir lay,dissenting.as the irs has asserted that it has no record of receiving mmc refund claim,mmc must find some way to overcome this difficult hurdle.
mmc argues that it need not show actual delivery because it can prove,via extrinsic evidence,that its refund claim had a timely postmark.the eighth and ninth circuits have endorsed this method of satisfying.see anderson united states,cir holding that direct extrinsic proof of postmark is permissible for purposes of and that does not supplant use of common law mailbox presumption wood,f d at same.there are a number of reasons why this argument does not help mmc.first,the circuits that do allow the use of extrinsic evidence generally only do so for purposes of invoking an intra mailbox rule,phila.marine,at internal quotation marks omitted,which is not available to mmc because its refund request,allegedly mailed on the deadline,would not have arrived by that deadline in the ordinary course of post office business.second,extrinsic evidence has only been used to prove a postmark,or at the very least,actual mailing mmc offers no evidence whatsoever of the mailing itself and thus fails to provide the necessary level of proof.third,recent regulations appear to foreclose the possibility of the use of extrinsic evidence for purposes of satisfying the requirements of.we address each of these problems with mmc argument in turn.
mmc first problem arises from the fact that circuits that do allow use of extrinsic evidence in a context generally do so to invoke the common law mailbox rule.there is a circuit split as to whether extrinsic evidence may be used to meet the timely postmark requirement of,or whether an actual postmark must be produced.the second and sixth circuits have held that where the taxpayer can not show an actual postmark and is therefore not literally applicable,it is inappropriate for a court to accept testimony or other evidence as proof of actual date of mailing.deutsch comm r,cir accord miller,at.on the other hand,the eighth and ninth circuits have allowed for extrinsic evidence to give rise to the common law presumption of delivery in a context.see lewis united states,cir anderson,at wood,at however,as discussed above,because mmc claim is that it mailed its refund claim on the date of the deadline,the common law mailbox rule does not apply.in both wood and anderson,there was plenty of time for the documents to arrive in the ordinary course.see anderson,at stating that taxpayer claimed return was mailed on september,where the statutory period expired on april,wood,at noting that the return was due on march and was allegedly mailed and postmarked on march.even if we assume that a taxpayer may employ the common law mailbox rule as a means of showing timely delivery under,mmc is no closer to proving timely filing.
mmc second problem is that,even if we were to accept the premise that extrinsic evidence is a viable means of proving a postmark for purposes of,wood and similar cases may be distinguished based on the level of extrinsic proof required.at a minimum,the taxpayers in those cases offered testimony regarding actual mailing and some additional corroborating evidence.see lewis,at taxpayer offered affidavit describing personal memory of actual mailing and also proved that state return,mailed with the federal return,was received one day after the deadline,whereas the federal return was received eleven days after deadline anderson,at,taxpayer offered testimony describing her observation of the postal clerk affixing the postmark,corroborated by a friend testimony that she saw the taxpayer go into the post office and exit without the envelope wood,at taxpayer offered very specific testimony detailing the mailing and observation of the postmark,as well as corroborating testimony from the postal service employee who had a specific memory of the interaction.mmc has not come close to presenting the extraordinarily rare circumstances that would satisfy the requirements of the statute without providing an actual postmark,even according to the law of the most permissive circuits.wood,at.
here,no one at mmc can remember filing the return,there is no testimony from a postal service employee,and there is no certified mail receipt or return receipt for the mailing transaction,though mmc admits that its standard practice is to send its refund claims by certified mail,return receipt requested.further,mmc did not attempt to obtain a duplicate receipt from the postal service.there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of a postmark or actual mailing instead,there is merely evidence of preparation of the return.see me.med,d at while mmc offers strong evidence that it worked aggressively to make a timely claim of refund,it does not offer strong or independently verifiable evidence of the actual mailing of the claim.we see no reason why these circumstances would fall within the coverage of.see washton united states,cir finding no need to revisit second circuit precedent that contains the exclusive exceptions to the physical delivery rule because taxpayers offered no direct evidence of postmark and made no effort to ascertain their claim in a timely manner see also davis united states,wl,at,holding that taxpayer testimony of mailing by itself was not sufficient to meet the wood rule.
mmc third problem is that,since the time of the eighth and ninth circuit decisions,the irs has issued regulations interpreting that would appear to foreclose the use of extrinsic evidence as a means of proving a timely postmark see e the regulations lay out a general rule that requires actual delivery,e,and that the exclusive exceptions to the rule are proof of proper use of registered or certified mail,and proof of proper use by a duly designated private delivery service,id.e.the regulations further emphasize the exclusivity of the exceptions,stating that n o other evidence of a postmark or of mailing will be prima facie evidence of delivery or raise a presumption that the document was delivered.id.
the only proof mmc has offered of proper use of certified mail is montminy testimony that his standard practice would have been to send the refund claim via certified mail,return receipt requested.we doubt that this uncorroborated,testimony is the proof of proper use of certified mail to which the regulations refer.id.the rest of the evidence that mmc offers goes to the proper preparation of the return,but not to its maili
