this appeal presents several difficult questions regarding the ability of a former employee who participated in a retirement plan established pursuant to section k of the internal revenue code to bring suit against the plan trustees for breach of fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et plaintiff karen coan was the controller of a company called klc.coan asserts that klc president alan kaufman and edgar lee,as trustees of two employee retirement funds included in the company k plan,mismanaged the funds and improperly failed to diversify its investments,and that the mismanagement resulted in a combined loss to the plan of more than.coan,who was a participant in the k plan,brought suit under erisa for damages or equitable relief.the district court mark kravitz,judge granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and reaffirmed its decision upon reconsideration.see coan kaufman,d coan i coan kaufman,d coan ii.
the three issues on this appeal do not concern coan underlying claim of breach of fiduciary duty,but rather the scope of the rights of action created by erisa civil enforcement provisions.the first issue,which the district court concluded it did not need to decide,is whether coan,as a former employee who participated in the defunct klc k plan,is entitled to bring suit as a participant in a benefit plan for purposes of erisa.the second issue is whether the district court erred in dismissing the claim brought by coan on behalf of the k plan on the ground that individual plaintiffs bringing suit on behalf of employee benefit plans under erisa a,a,must comply with procedural safeguards applicable to suits brought in a representative or derivative capacity.the third issue is whether the district court erred in dismissing coan claim for individual equitable relief under section a of erisa,a,on the ground that the relief she seeks is not equitable within the meaning of the statute.we agree with the district court as to the first and third issues.although we have doubts about some of the grounds for the district court decision as to the second issue,we agree with its ultimate conclusion and therefore affirm.
background 
the facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.coan was employed at klc as its controller while klc was being acquired by another company,unicapital corporation.during that acquisition,the two defendants,kaufman and lee,rolled one of the three funds comprising klc k plan into unicapital k plan,but,for some three years thereafter,maintained control over the other two funds.at first,kaufman and lee invested money from the two funds principally in a mutual fund.later they transferred a significant portion of it to stock funds.between and,the two funds earned returns totaling about less than benchmark funds identified by coan expert.upon the final dissolution of the klc plan in,the plan assets were distributed in lump sums to its participants,including coan,according to their individual account balances.coan continued to be employed by unicapital after its acquisition of klc but was laid off soon thereafter,in july.she does not assert that any of the events relevant to this lawsuit played a role in her termination.
in september,coan brought this action in the united states district court for the district of connecticut asserting that she was doing so both individually and on behalf of klc k plan.she alleged that the plan lost some as a result of the imprudent investment decisions of kaufman and lee,which,according to coan,constituted breaches of fiduciary duty in violation of erisa a,a.
invoking section of erisa,which establishes personal liability for breaches of fiduciary duty,coan asked for damages and restitution pursuant to section a of erisa,which allows participants in an employee benefit plan to bring suit on behalf of the plan for legal and equitable remedies allegedly caused by breaches of fiduciary duty.coan also sought restitution and other appropriate equitable relief under section a of erisa,which provides equitable relief for any violation of erisa or of the terms of an plan.coan suggests that appropriate equitable relief might entail make whole monetary relief or an injunction reinstating the terminated plans,requiring the trustees to pay into them additional benefits lost through a breach of fiduciary duty,and directing them to pay the additional benefits to coan as required by the terms of the plans.coan br.at.
at the close of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that coan did not have statutory standing as a participant under erisa that coan could not recover under section a of erisa because,having failed to take any steps to include other plan participants in the action,her suit was not properly brought on behalf of klc k plan as required by section a and that section a relief was unavailable to her because the remedies coan sought were not equitable but legal.after oral argument,the district court granted the defendants motion.assuming without deciding that coan was a participant,the court agreed with the defendants that relief was,in any event,not available to coan under sections a and a of erisa.see coan i,d at.
coan moved for reconsideration,arguing principally that the district court erred in dismissing her section a claim.the district court granted the motion to reconsider,but having reconsidered,reaffirmed its decision in coan see coan ii,d at.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.island software computer,microsoft,cir.the interpretation of erisa is a question of law that is also subject to de novo review.burke kodak retirement income plan,cir,cert.denied,d.
ii.participant standing 
the rights of action that coan seeks to assert are available only than the secretary of,beneficiaries,or fiduciaries of an employee benefit plan.a a nechis oxford health plans,cir connecticut physicians health servs.of,cir.n parties lack statutory standing to bring suit under erisa even if they have a direct stake in the outcome of the litigation,cert.denied,d.coan asserts that she is a plan participant.before the district court and again on appeal,the defendants argue that coan lacks statutory standing because at the time she brought suit she was no longer a participant in the klc k plan for purposes of erisa.
after thoughtful consideration,the district court declined to decide that question.the court noted that t hough the second circuit has not yet expressly addressed this issue,many federal courts have denied participant standing to former employees such as coan where the plans in question have been terminated and their assets have been fully disbursed via lump sum distributions.coan i,d at.but it also noted that there is support in second circuit case law for a broad zone of interests approach to erisa standing that would allow coan suit.id.at citing mullins pfizer,cir.given these countervailing considerations and its ultimate conclusion that coan suit should be dismissed on other grounds,the court assumed without deciding that coan was a participant under erisa.id.at.
erisa defines a participant as any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.the supreme court has explained that i n order to establish that he or she may become eligible for benefits,a claimant must have a colorable claim that he or she will prevail in a suit for benefits,or that eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future.firestone tire and rubber bruch,d.
as the district court pointed out,several circuits have concluded that former employees such as coan who have accepted payments of their retirement benefits are no longer participants for purposes of erisa.see raymond mobil oil,cir.cert.denied,d kuntz reese,cir.per curiam,cert.denied,d.and,as the district court also noted,coan does not allege that she would be entitled to further benefits but for misrepresentations made by the defendants,so she is not entitled to participant standing on that ground.see mullins,at concluding that a former employee has participant standing when he alleged that but for the fact that the defendant misled him,he would have been a participant.
on the other hand,whether acceptance of a payment terminates a person status as a participant may depend on whether the plan is a defined benefits or a defined contribution plan coan,unlike the plaintiffs discussed in other circuits case law,participated in a k plan,which is an individual account or defined contribution plan under erisa.see.according to erisa,an individual accrued benefit s under such a plan are simply the balance of the individual account.id.b.arguably,therefore,coan claim that the distribution of her account balance would have been greater absent the defendants breach of fiduciary duty is a claim for benefits which,if colorable,means that she may become eligible for benefits and thus qualifies as a participant under erisa.see firestone,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also gray briggs,wl,at july,dist.lexis,at concluding that former employee who claimed that distributions received under a defined contribution plan were reduced because of defendants breach of fiduciary duty was a participant for purposes of erisa.
like the district court,we do not think it necessary to determine whether coan was a participant.although we have referred to a plaintiff status as a participant under erisa as a question of standing,see,nechis,at,it is a statutory requirement,not a constitutional one.unlike article iii standing,which ordinarily should be determined before reaching the merits,see steel citizens for a better,d,statutory standing may be assumed for the purposes of deciding whether the plaintiff otherwise has a viable cause of action,see id.at.citing passenger ass of passengers,d see also lerner fleet bank,cir.c ourts may determine whether a cause of action exists under a given statute,an issue of statutory construction that goes to the merits of the action,before addressing statutory standing,cert.denied,d because we agree with the district court that coan suit should be dismissed irrespective of whether she is a participant under erisa,we too will assume rather than decide that she is.
iii.section a 
coan seeks relief under section a of erisa,which provides,in relevant part,that civil actions may be brought by the secretary of labor,or by a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section of this title.a.section of erisa,in turn,provides,inter alia,that a plan fiduciary who breaches any of the responsibilities,obligations,or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach.erisa a,a.
under sections a and a,plan participants may unquestionably bring actions against plan fiduciaries for breaches of fiduciary duty.but in massachusetts mutual life insurance russell,d,the supreme court stated that such claims may not be made for individual relief,but instead are brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan.id.at.see also lee burkhart,cir concluding that russell bars plaintiffs from suing under s ection a because plaintiffs are seeking damages on their own behalf,not on behalf of the plan.
the district court decided that coan section a claim should be dismissed because she failed to take procedural steps to ensure the protection and adequate representation of absent plan participants.the court based its decision on three alternative grounds.first,it concluded that our decision in diduck kaszycki sons contractors,cir,abrogated on other grounds,see gerosa savasta,cir.explaining that other aspects of diduck are inconsistent with subsequent supreme court decisions,cert.denied,d,requires plaintiffs bringing suit on behalf of an employee benefit plan to follow federal rule of civil procedure,which sets forth procedures to be followed in shareholder derivative actions.coan ii,d at.second,the court reasoned that even if plaintiffs bringing suit under section a are not strictly required to follow rule,they must adhere to the general principles that apply in shareholder derivative actions.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.finally,the district court concluded that,in any event,coan failure to do anything to demonstrate that her action actually was intended to benefit former plan participants other than karen coan rendered specious her claim to be acting on behalf of others.id.at internal quotation marks,citation,and ellipsis omitted emphasis in original.we agree with the district court decision based on the third ground.
in her brief,coan focuses primarily on the first ground for the district court argues that the court erred in imposing the requirements of the rule on her.there is significant doubt as to whether under section a of erisa plaintiffs are required to follow rule.rule applies only to derivative actions brought by one or more shareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association.kayes pac.lumber,cir quoting rule emphasis added by kayes.by its terms,the rule does not apply to section a suits,which are neither brought by shareholders or members nor are brought to enforce the right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association.see id.at concluding that plaintiffs suing under section a do not have to meet requirements of rule in re aep erisa,d,same rcm secs.fund,stanton,cir stating that t he plain language of rule governs our construction of it.
it is true that in diduck,which the district court treated as controlling,we concluded that rule was applicable to a suit brought by participants on behalf of an erisa plan.diduck,at.but diduck involved an action brought under erisa g,g,not section a.section g authorizes fiduciaries,but no one else,to obtain unpaid contributions pursuant to erisa,which requires employers participating in erisa plans to make obligatory contributions to the plans.because section g only applies to suits by fiduciaries,it is sensible to require plan participants,if they may assert the fiduciaries right of action at all,to follow rule,which applies when the appropriate plaintiff has failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it.section a,unlike section g,provides an express right of action for because the drafters of erisa did not think fiduciaries could be relied upon to sue themselves for breach of fiduciary duty.because plan participants are expressly authorized to bring suit under section a,the situation here is not controlled by diduck.
general principles of derivative suits 
for similar reasons,we harbor some doubt about the district court second ground for dismissing coan section a claim,namely,coan failure to comply with the general principles that apply in shareholder derivative actions.coan ii,d at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the supreme court explained in daily income fund,fox,d,the term derivative action has long been understood to apply only to those actions in which the right claimed by the shareholder is one the corporation could itself have enforced in court.relying in part on this general understanding of the term derivative action,id.at,the daily income fund court concluded that the demand requirement of rule did not apply to a shareholder suit brought under section b of the investment company act of ica,b,because the ica did not grant a cause of action to the corporation,see daily income fund,at.
the court thus explained in daily income fund that because corporations could not bring suit in their own right under the ica,individual shareholders suits were not derivative.that reasoning applies with equal force here.because erisa plans can not bring suit against fiduciaries on the plans own behalf under section,the lawsuits of individual participants are not derivative either.see pressroom league income sec.fund cont l assurance,cir.in light of the frequent references in erisa and its legislative history to participants,beneficiaries and fiduciaries,the conclusion that funds also have standing to bring suit is untenable.citations omitted,cert.denied,d.section a,like the law considered by supreme court in daily income fund,creates an unusual cause of action that differs significantly from those traditionally asserted in shareholder derivative suits.daily income fund,at.we therefore doubt that section a actions can,in any meaningful sense,be governed by the same general principles of procedure that control derivative actions.coan ii,d at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
bringing suit in a representative capacity 
irrespective of the applicability of rule or the principles of derivative actions,however,we agree with the district court that coan section a claim fails because it was not brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan.russell,at.
procedural requirements of section a.in russell,the supreme court considered whether an individual participant in an erisa plan could recover damages under section a for alleged that case,delay in awarding disability harmed only the plaintiff.the court noted that section of erisa,on which the section a right of action is based requires plan fiduciaries to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty.russell,at.quoting erisa a,a emphasis added by russell.according to the court,a fair contextual reading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets,and with remedies that would protect the entire plan,rather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary.id.at.
the central holding of russell is that sections and a of erisa do not provide for the recovery of damages for breaches of fiduciary duty that affect only an individual plaintiff.see id.at.interruption in provision of plan benefits to the plaintiff lee,at health benefits denied to two persons upon bankruptcy of plan sponsor matassarin lynch,cir alleged breaches of fiduciary duty affected only the individual retirement accounts of the plaintiff and few others,cert.denied,d.unlike the plaintiffs in those cases,coan complains of an alleged breach of fiduciary to diversify plan would have harmed all the participants in the klc k plan.and she asks for,among other things,d amages restoration of losses to the plan.compl.at.
but,like the district court,we do not see how an action can be brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan if the plaintiff does not take any steps to become a bona fide representative of other interested parties.russell,at.it seems to us that the representative nature of the section a right of action implies that plan participants must employ procedures to protect effectively the interests they purport to represent.
although erisa does not specify the procedures that a plan participant must follow in order to bring suit on behalf of a benefit plan,its drafters considered the issue.as early as,four years before erisa was enacted,a senate version of the bill would have required participants and beneficiaries bringing suit for breach of fiduciary duty to bring class actions.see,e as reprinted in arnold porter legislative history employee retirement income security act of,at in their final versions,the house and senate erisa bills contained contrasting requirements the house bill provided that participants and beneficiaries must in most circumstances bring class actions in order to bring suit on behalf of a plan for breach of fiduciary duty,while the senate bill provided that they may.see summary of differences between the senate version and the house version of to provide for pension reform comm.print,as reprinted in,at 
the fact that congress,having considered mandatory and permissive provisions relating to class actions,ultimately remained silent on the issue suggests to us that it deliberately declined to adopt any general rule as to whether class actions are mandatory or permissive.see a but it does not mean that congress intended to allow individual participants and beneficiaries to bring suit on behalf of an employee benefit plan without observing any procedural safeguards for other interested parties.it seems to us,rather,that congress was content to leave the procedures necessary to protect absent parties,and to prevent redundant suits,to be worked out by parties and judges according to the circumstances on a case by case basis.
this is the approach of the common law of trusts,which offers a starting point for analysis of erisa unless it is inconsistent with the language of the statute,its structure,or its purposes.harris trust and sav.bank salomon smith barney,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted alterations incorporated.ordinarily,when a beneficiary brings suit against a trustee on behalf of the trust,other beneficiaries should be joined as parties,either as plaintiffs or as defendants,if their interests would be affected by the decree.see austin scott et,the law of trusts ed.but,as a case decided shortly before the enactment of erisa noted 
there are two exceptions to the general rule that the cestuis que trustent are necessary parties in actions by or against a trustee relating to the trust or its property.the first is where the absent parties are properly represented the second exception to the general rule arises where the beneficiaries are very numerous,so that the delay and expense of bringing them in becomes oppressive and burdensome.in such case they will not be deemed necessary parties where the trustee representing them is made a party.
hebbard colgrove,d,quoting anderson elliott,d alterations in hebbard emphasis omitted.in the latter situation,a class action is the appropriate procedural device.see see also ortiz fibreboard,d noting that actions charging a breach of trust by an indenture trustee or other fiduciary similarly affecting the members of a large class of beneficiaries,requiring an accounting or similar procedure to restore the subject of the trust,are among the c lassic examples of rule b b class actions quoting advisory committee notes on.
we think it neither necessary nor helpful to delineate minimum procedural safeguards that section a requires in all cases.but in our view,although plan participants need not always comply with rule to act as a representative of other plan participants or beneficiaries those who do will likely be proceeding in a representative capacity properly for purposes of section a.similarly,a plan participant who joins or makes a effort to join other participants as parties pursuant to rule would seem to have discharged his or her duty to proceed on behalf of the plan.ultimately,however,the requirement is only that the plaintiff take adequate steps under the circumstances properly to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan.russell,at.
application to coan lawsuit.here,the district court concluded that coan failure to do anything to demonstrate that her action actually was intended to benefit former plan participants other than karen coan rendered specious her claim to be acting on behalf of others.coan ii,d at internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted emphasis in original.we agree.allowing coan to bring this action without notifying or otherwise involving other plan participants would,it seems to us,create significant practical difficulties and opportunities for abuse.because coan does not proceed under rule,for example,we see nothing to prevent her from reaching a settlement with the defendants that would disproportionately,or even exclusively,benefit her.e a requiring courts to approve class action settlements and to direct notice to absent class members accord.requiring court approval and notice to shareholders prior to dismissal or compromise of a shareholder derivative suit.
if,on the other hand,coan were to prevail,the district court would face a difficult task in ensuring that recovery inures to the benefit of the plan as a whole.russell,at.the court would likely be required to issue an order mandating that the now defunct klc k plan be temporarily resuscitated,funds restored to it,its participants located,their entitlements calculated,and distributions disbursed to them.without the benefit of a procedural mechanism for the protection of interested parties,it is unclear how the court could satisfy itself that thei
