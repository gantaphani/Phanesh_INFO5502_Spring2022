appellant mark boyce boyce appeals a jury damages award,based on the breach of a stock option agreement,arguing that because of erroneous evidentiary rulings and erroneous jury instructions by the district court,the damages awarded are less than those to which boyce is entitled.
for the reasons stated below,the damages judgment is vacated and the case remanded for a new trial on damages consistent with this opinion.
background 
boyce employment with 
boyce is a former consultant of wit capital group,wit or the company,a company established to be the world first investment bank and brokerage firm dedicated to arranging the offering and trading of securities through the internet.wit was founded in april by andrew klein,a former securities lawyer.boyce began his consultation work for wit on february.like other employees of the company,to entice him to join and in lieu of a large salary,boyce was offered a stock option agreement in the company as part of his compensation package.stock option agreements offered to employees linked a portion of the employees compensation to wit prospects for success.under his stock option agreement,boyce was given the option to purchase shares of wit stock at an exercise price of per share.the exercise period for the option was ten years,except that,if terminated,boyce had one year within which to exercise.in addition to other terms of employment,boyce and klein memorialized boyce stock option in a memorandum entitled working with wit capital the memo was signed and dated february,by both boyce and klein.relevant to the discussion here,the fourth paragraph of the memo outlined the terms of boyce stock option.continuing,the tenth paragraph of the memo,entitled termination,stated,inter alia the stock option grant need draft copy of incentive stock option agreement may be exercised within one year if my employment services consulting relationship with the company terminates completely.
after he made several requests,in early october,boyce finally received two copies of the incentive stock option agreement isoa.significantly,the terms of the termination provision under the isoa were markedly different than those previously agreed upon by klein the new provision read,inter alia 
termination of services.a in the event that i the company or any subsidiary or parent thereof terminates your services with such entity for cause or ii you terminate your services with such entity for any reason whatsoever other than as a result of your death or disability within the meaning of section e of the code,the option may only be exercised within one month after such termination,and only to the same extent that you were entitled to exercise the option on the date your services sic was so terminated and had not previously done so.
despite directions to sign and return the isoa,boyce never did so 
in may,boyce employment with wit was terminated.he did not exercise his stock option at that time.
wit initial public offering 
thereafter,wit engaged in a series of private placements between september,and november,wit sold almost million shares of series c stock at per share to a small group of individual and institutional investors between november,and march,wit sold over million shares of series d stock at per share to both individual and institutional investors and on march,wit sold over million shares of series e stock at per share to the goldman sachs group.toward the end of its selling period of the series d stock,on february,wit board of directors agreed to seek public financing.on march,wit issued a press release stating its intention to launch an initial public offering ipo that it hoped to complete during the second quarter of the year there was no indication regarding the amount of money wit sought to raise nor any indication of the price at which wit anticipated its stock to be offered.
on march,wit filed a form registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec between its march press release and its march sec filing,wit board of directors met several times to discuss various aspects of the ipo,such as the amount of money to be raised,the valuation of the company,and the choice of an underwriter of the ipo.despite these meetings,though,wit march did not include a per share public offering price or the number of shares to be offered through the ipo.it did,however,indicate a proposed maximum aggregate offering price of million,with this figure supposedly being employed to estimate the registration fee.the company board of directors also met on april,at which time it resolved to sell up to shares of common stock in its ipo.minutes from the april board meeting also evidence,t he board discussed the potential pricing range and pricing of shares in the ipo,and establish i t was determined to adopt and appoint a pricing committee of the board to assist in negotiating and approve the final pricing terms of the ipo with the managing underwriters.
given the flurry of activities and the fact that the company had investors that were putting money into the company and were going to take the company public,and the fact that the stock was going to be worth a lot more when it went public,boyce decided to exercise his option to buy shares of wit stock at the per share strike price.thus,on march,boyce sent the company an check together with an option exercise form.on april,wit rejected boyce check and exercise form,informing boyce that his attempted exercise was untimely as he had not exercised the option within days of his termination.
wit successfully brought the company public on june,the company sold million shares of stock at per share,raising million.wit stock closed at per share on its first day of public trading.
c.the law suit and trial 
on march,boyce filed suit against wit,alleging it was liable for breach of contract resulting from its april,refusal to allow boyce to exercise his option.a focal point of the lawsuit became the value of wit stock.significantly,both before and during the trial,boyce sought to introduce evidence regarding the company stock valuation that was dated after april.for example,boyce sought to introduce wit second amended filed with the sec on may,hereinafter,the amended documents showing the price of wit stock the day of its ipo,june,documents showing the range of prices at which wit common stock was publicly traded in expert testimony from an appraisal specialist who concentrated in the valuation of corporations,and who,at a hearing testified that,in making his valuation,he considered the ipo offering price as a very good measure as to the market perception of the fair value of the stock.wit filed several motions in limine,seeking the exclusion of,evidence.ruling on the motions,the district court decided that,although it would allow evidence showing what knowledgeable investors anticipated the future conditions and performance of the company would be at the time of the breach,it would not allow in any evidence related to events after april.the district court indicated it would take a restrictive view of boyce valuation expert boyce then expressed an intention to call his expert for rebuttal purposes,not as a principal witness.
in his,boyce testified in his own behalf.he also called lloyd feller,wit senior vice president and counsel feller testified,inter alia,that when he joined wit in march,he knew the company was contemplating an ipo.feller also testified that,as part of his compensation package,he was given stock options for which the company gave him a loan so he could exercise those options.boyce counsel questioned feller about the million figure contained in the company preliminary filing,its amended filing,and in the final prospectus.feller testified that the figure was a placeholder that eventually turned out to be the amount of money the company raised.
when boyce sought to introduce the company amended into evidence,the defendant objected and the objection was sustained.the district court refused admission of the amended because it was dated after april,despite containing financial information from before that date.in fact,when boyce requested the admission of only the first page of the amended identified as rebuttal evidence,the judge characterized the million figure as a wishfulness number.the judge also limited boyce examination of feller to feller knowledge of the amount of money wit sought to raise in its ipo.with his examination of feller thus stymied,boyce rested.
wit first called its founder,andrew klein.on,klein maintained he did not know how much money wit intended to raise through its ipo.while boyce sought to solicit from klein whether the alleged million figure remained consistent in later filings with the sec,the judge evidentiary ruling precluded boyce from securing any answers from klein on this issue.
next,wit called ronald readmond,both a director and chairman of wit,as well as its and chief operating officer.readmond offered detailed testimonial evidence together with summary charts of the company stock sales from its treasury.despite this knowledge,readmond testified that he did not inform the underwriters about how much money the company sought to raise and,like klein,he did not know the amount to be raised by wit ipo until may wit april breach with boyce.as with klein,during,boyce attempted to pursue a line of questioning about the million figure used in all the company filings with the sec.again,the district court forestalled such questioning the judge allowed only the asking of the single question,did this number the million or the number on the march,in a sort of casual way,continue to be approximately the same amount.trial tr.at,boyce soundview tech.group,civ.hb,wl.in response to this questioning,readmond testified that he did not remember.
finally,wit presented its expert,ma,to introduce evidence of the stock fair market value on april.unsurprisingly,ma testimony was consistent with the company position that the value of the stock at the time of the breach was.ma based her stock valuation on the company private placement were also block prior to april and just to three institutional investors capital z,draper fisher jurvetson,and goldman sachs.see id.at.
before the parties closing arguments,the district court judge made an evidentiary ruling regarding the admission of the first page of another amended,dated june.boyce had sought its introduction to show that the million figure included in the preliminary was not really a filler number,but,rather,was the actual amount of money wit intended to raise through its ipo thus,admission of this document was to challenge the credibility of both klein and readmond who testified they did not know how much money the company sought to raise.the court denied its admission,ruling boyce could accomplish this end without the first page of the june amended.in his ruling,the judge emphasized this argument may only be used as a credibility argument.memorandum from harold baer,district judge,united states district court,southern district of new york,to counselors barry fredericks and nathan dershowitz,for plaintiff kevin rover and leza maria de bella,for defendant july,re boyce soundview,civ.of cover pages to amendments.
prior to charging the jury,the parties submitted proposed jury instructions for the court consideration.among the instructions boyce sought to have included was the following 
the amount of recoverable damages is a question of fact,and the measure of damages upon which the factual computation is based is a question of law.under a breach of contract theory,damages should be calculated on the date of the breach.using the date of the breach takes expected loss profits into account.the measure of damages is based on what knowledgeable investors anticipated the future conditions and performance would be at the time of the breach.if the amount of damages is uncertain,the burden of uncertainty falls on the wrongdoer.
pl.proposed supplemental jury instruction,boyce soundview tech.group,civ.hb,wl.boyce refers to this as the knowledgeable investor instruction and the instruction on the wrongdoer rule.however,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
the amount of recoverable damages is a question of is you,the jury.and the measure of damages upon which the factual computation is based is a question of is me,the court.under a breach of contract theory,damages should be calculated on the date of the breach.using the date of the breach takes expected lost future profits into account.in summation,you heard reference by plaintiff to a rule of law denominated wrongdoer.since i may have misunderstood the reference,i just want to be sure we are all on the same page.it is a phrase that has come to be disliked.in any event,let me clarify it and indeed it may not be exactly what you heard.first,this wrongdoer rule is a rule as to alleged the burden of proof and it has to do with a shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant on the issue of damages.and the rule states that the alleged wrongdoer,the defendant,most frequently the defendant,may not object to the plaintiff reasonable estimate of the amount of damages when it is supported by evidence because that estimate was not based on more accurate data which the law goes on to say must be shown to say as a consequence of the wrongdoer misconduct making that additional evidence unavailable.so for this rule to be applicable and the burden to prove damages to shift to the defendant,you must find both the plaintiff offered a reasonable estimate in the amount of plaintiff damages and to defendant wrongdoer is to blame for plaintiff inability to offer more precise evidence.
trial tr.at.also relevant here is the court instruction on the fair market value of stock 
fair market value of an asset such as stock is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.you have heard a lot of testimony and argument on this issue,including ma opinion.keep in mind that generally the sale price for the same asset,sold close in time to the asset being valued here,april,if it is the result of arm length negotiations,is the best evidence of the asset fair market value.
id.at.the district court judge did not instruct the jury on a knowledgeable investor as requested by boyce.
after deliberating,the jury found wit did breach its stock option contract with boyce and determined boyce was entitled to in damages.
unsatisfied with some of the district court evidentiary rulings and some of its jury instructions,and pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure,boyce moved for a new trial.the district court denied boyce motion.in its opinion,the district court addressed and rejected boyce three main arguments that the court precluded boyce forward looking evidence and improperly charged the jury regarding damages that the court wrongdoer rule jury instruction was legally incorrect and that the court improperly excluded evidence dated after april.boyce soundview tech.group,wl,at.boyce makes the same arguments on appeal.
ii.discussion 
it is settled second circuit law that in a breach of contract case,damages are calculated at the time of the breach.see lucente int l bus.machs,cir hermanowski acton,aff in relevant part,cir per curiam.the same is true of the concept that damages for breach of contract should put the plaintiff in the same economic position he would have occupied had the breaching party performed the contract.oscar gruss son,hollander,cir.moreover,there is no argument that,here,the measure of damages is the difference between the option price and the market value of the stock hermanowski.at.
all parties agree that the damages to which boyce is entitled are to be measured as of april.the main argument here is over how to value the company stock on april,as this is the basis for determining damages.if we were dealing with a publicly traded stock,that determination would be straightforward we would use the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices,united states cartwright,d,as provided by the public exchange upon which the stock traded.here,though,at the time of wit breach,the company stocks were not publicly traded,although they were on their way to being so.thus,valuing the company stock is not as straightforward.
boyce objection to the jury determination of damages stems from some of the district court evidentiary rulings and some of its jury instruction rulings.boyce believes the district court erroneously excluded relevant evidence about the value of the stocks that would have helped the jury make its damages determination.similarly,boyce argues that the district court erred in excluding one requested jury instruction and in misinforming the jury on another instruction these jury instruction errors also affected the jury calculation of damages.in sum,boyce contends that the district court evidentiary and jury instruction errors warrant a new trial.
we turn first to the evidentiary rulings and then to the jury instructions.
evidentiary rulings 
when a district court evidentiary ruling is challenged on appeal,this court reviews the ruling under an standard.see zurich am.ins.abm,cir silverstein chase,cir in re,cir evidentiary rulings generally not to be disturbed unless manifestly erroneous quoting salem lines,d.either an error of law or a clear error of fact may constitute an abuse of discretion.schering pfizer,cir quoting charette town of oyster bay,cir further citation omitted.
an evidentiary ruling that is an abuse of discretion is,however,only reversible if it also affects a party substantial rights.see.a.this occurs when,for example,a district court excludes a party primary evidence in support of a material fact,and failure to prove that fact defeats the party claim.see esty,cir.
here,boyce has challenged two of the district court evidentiary rulings,claiming those rulings constitute reversible error the alleged exclusion of boyce expert testimony and the exclusion of evidence.we will examine each in turn.
exclusion of boyce expert witness 
boyce claims that the district court erroneously precluded his expert,antoon,from testifying.this is a mischaracterization of the judge ruling.while,at the kumho tire hearing,the judge indicated he would take a restrictive view of antoon testimony since much of antoon opinion was based on data,the record demonstrates that the judge did not preclude antoon from testifying.moreover,boyce counsel informed the court that he would call antoon as a rebuttal witness,not as our principal witness.the fact whatever decided not to call antoon is not an error that can be attributed to the judge.in any event,it is within the party discretion whether to call a proffered expert as a rebuttal witness.see generally strickland washington,d admonishing courts from second guessing counsel chosen trial tactics jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,a joseph mclaughlin,matthew bender ed.in the usual case,the order and mode of the presentation of evidence and interrogation of witnesses are determined by legal conventions and the parties choice of trial tactics.see also marcic reinauer transp,cir instructing that where a party does not contemporaneously object to an evidentiary ruling,that party must demonstrate plain error that is serious and flagrant,challenging the very integrity of the trial citation omitted.thus,we will not assign error to the district court for a discretionary decision made by boyce counsel in not calling its expert witness.
exclusion of evidence 
relying on lucente and oscar gruss,the district court drew a bright line,excluding all evidence of the value of the stock dated after april,because,as the second circuit unequivocally stated,new york courts have rejected awards based on what the actual economic conditions and performance were in light of hindsight.boyce,wl,at quoting oscar gruss,at emphasis added.in drawing its line,though,the court made too broad a stroke.by attempting to exclude evidence based on hindsight,the district court also excluded admissible evidence tending to show economic conditions and performance during the relevant time period.
the district judge april ruling was too mechanical and,ultimately,deprived boyce of the full benefit of his bargain.this is problematic as the primary purpose of damages is to put a wronged party in as good a position as if the breach did not occur.see oscar gruss,at lucente,at.
the clearest example of the overreach of the bright line ruling is the court exclusion of the amended although dated may,the amended contained wit first quarter financial statements prepared as of march.thus,at a minimum,the jury was precluded from considering wit balance sheet and income evidence that would aid a knowledgeable investor in anticipating the future conditions of the company and in valuing wit stock on april.because the company was in the midst of going public,requiring it to a compile and finalize its financial statements for inclusion in its prospectus,b determine how much money was feasible to raise,and c decide the initial offer price of its stock,the financial information contained in the may,amended was highly relevant and material to boyce case.we disagree with the district judge conclusion that the amended was speculative or wishful thinking.in our view,the may contained primary evidence that the fact finder could have utilized in determining the company stock value.the exclusion of the amended defeated boyce efforts to prove the fair market value of the company stock at the time of wit breach.
while it is true that an arm length willing seller the best evidence of and often the easiest method to determine fair market value,it is,by no means,the only such evidence.indeed,determining value is a factual inquiry.see am.soc y of composers,authors publishers movie channel,cir silverman comm r,cir discussing valuation for gift tax purposes.that is precisely why we noted that a valuation determination is one that is entitled to be made on all the elements of the particular case.valuation is necessarily an approximation.silverman,at citations omitted emphasis added ellipses in original see also eisenberg comm r,cir noting that for closely held corporations for which there is no public trading market,valuation of stock is based on a variety of factors.this concept is not limited only to tax matters.in fact,recently,in a criminal setting,this court has noted that,while we generally rely on fair market value as a measure of property value,in certain circumstances other measures of value may more accurately serve the purpose for which valuation is required.united states boccagna,cir see also bfp resolution trust,d discussing use of foreclosure price as measure of value in bankruptcy proceeding united states simmonds,cir using replacement value rather than fair market value in calculating restitution sarrouf new england patriots football club,affirming trial judge denial of consideration of market value as reliable indicator of value where stock not regularly traded on a recognized exchange and there was no established market for asset pollen aware,upholding trial judge use of offering price in ipo as best indicator of stock fair market value where breach of stock option occurred two months before ipo kaminsky segura,misc d,wl,at.july,noting that in certain limited circumstances,where a rigid application of the general rule that the loss sustained is measured at the time of breach would lead to an inequitable result or deny plaintiff of the benefit of the bargain,the pertinent measuring period may be extended to a reasonable period of time after the time of breach internal quotes omitted further citation omitted.
here,considering the company imminent entrance into the public market at the time of its breach to boyce,in conjunction with case law suggesting that the willing seller test is not the exclusive method for determining value,we find the silverman case instructive.we,therefore,digress for a moment to further discuss it.
in silverman,the commissioner had issued deficiency notices to taxpayers who had gifted some of their stock in a company for which they were principals.see silverman,at.the taxpayers,as principals,were planning to bring the company public.in anticipation of this transformation,the taxpayers initially instituted a plan of reorganization,which required,inter alia,increasing the number of issued shares and creating new classes of stock.see id.at.shortly thereafter,the taxpayers gifted shares of stock to various trusts benefitting their respective children.see id.the commissioner issued deficiency notices to the taxpayers based on undervaluation of the gifted shares.the taxpayers challenged the commissioner valuation in tax court.see id.at.after the tax court upheld the commissioner valuation,the taxpayers then appealed to this court.see id.
while noting that an arm length sale of stock is the best evidence of value,see id.at,this court also noted that at the time of the transfer of the stock to the trusts,there was no public market for that stock.see id.significantly,the court emphasized that the sales of company stock to employees and counsel of the company lacked the elements of arm length transactions and therefore the tax court was correct to not rely on these sales in reaching its determination of value.id.importantly,the silverman court observed that when determining a stock fair market value,one must consider the viewpoint of both the buyer and the seller the opinion of fair market value must represent not only the seller viewpoint,but also the buyer,since value in the market place reflects both influences.id.at citation omitted schonfeld hilliard,cir the value placed on an asset by a purchaser,however,does not become evidence of the asset market value unless it is also the price at which a reasonably informed seller is willing to sell the asset.ultimately,the tax court did not determine the company stock value using the arm length transaction approach.rather,it used a price to average earnings multiple of which had been suggested by the taxpayers own expert witnesses.id.at.this court found no error with the tax court method of valuation.see id.at.relying on anderson comm r,the court stated it is not necessary that the value arrived at by the trial court be a figure as to which there is specific testimony,if it is within the range of figures that may properly be deduced from the evidence.id.at quoting anderson comm r,cir,cert.denied,d.
despite the fact that silverman is a tax case and this one is not,we believe the facts of silverman are significantly analogous to this case,such that the reasoning of the silverman court is helpful here.most germane is that,like silverman and unlike oscar gruss and lucente,we are presented with a case involving determining the value of stock of a private company in the process of going public.acknowledging that fair market value is normally determined on the basis of an arm length transaction the silverman court also recognized that certain sales lack the elements of an arm length transaction,making reliance on such sales questionable.we believe this observation is paramount to boyce case because the stock sales by wit,upon which the company relies to establish its stock fair market value,were primarily to institutional investors and employees.in fact,wit expert,ma,testified that her valuation of the company stock was based on block sales to three institutional investors.similar to the silverman stock sales,sales to company insiders that were not viewed as arm length,we believe the judge should have considered the nature of wit,stock sales to employees and institutional investors in weighing the evidentiary relevance of these sales for establishing the stock fair market value.
moreover,regarding the amended that contained the company financial statements that boyce sought to admit,we are unpersuaded by the company present argument that the district court was correct in excluding the amended because the statements reflected pro forma financials and the company did not approve the financial statements until april,after the april breach.def.br.at.first,the company was obligated to prepare truthful and accurate financials their pro forma nature is irrelevant.second,the approval of the statements is also irrelevant what is relevant here is that the information in the statements concerned the company financial picture,and therefore compromise clearly permissible evidence.moreover,had the amended been admitted,the company would have been free to challenge the finality of the information contained therein.
we are mindful that the district court must walk a delicate balance in allowing the jury to consider only evidence in foresight,and not hindsight.this,however,does not justify the district court judge imposition of april as a date for consideration of value evidence.the jury should have been able to make its valuation determination on all relevant elements of the case,whether dated,april,or,perhaps,some short time period thereafter.our precedent supports the conclusion that consideration of evidence dated can properly be considered by the fact finder in making this determination without violating the rule against considering evidence in hindsight.however,because the judge abided by his april bright line rule without weighing other factors of the case and determining their aggregate significance,we believe boyce substantial rights were affected.thus,boyce is entitled to a new trial on damages.
jury instructions 
within this circuit,the law is settled that a litigant is entitled to have the jury instructed as to his claims and theories of law if supported by the evidence and brought to the attention of the court.see carvel diversified mgmt.group,cir.yet,a trial court has discretion in the style and wording of jury instructions so long as the instructions,taken as a whole,do not mislead the jury as to the proper legal standard,or adequately inform the jury of the law.parker sony pictures entm t,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
when a party challenges a court jury charge,this court reviews the jury instructions de novo and as a whole.see lnc,first fidelity bank,cir luciano olsten,cir.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.lnc,at quoting anderson branen,cir see also luciano,at.an erroneous instruction requires a new trial unless the error is harmless.lnc,at quoting united states masotto,cir see also luciano,at instructing that a new trial will not be granted unless,taken as a whole,the jury instructions gave a misleading impression or inadequate understanding of the law internal citations and quotations omitted.an erroneous jury instruction is harmless if it is clear that it did not influence the jury verdict.see lnc,at quoting masotto,at.
here,boyce claims that the district court erred in refusing to charge the jury with the knowledgeable investor instruction requested by him,thus requiring reversal.he also contends that the court committed reversible error in misinforming the jury on the wrongdoer rule,an instruction boyce sought.for the reasons stated below,the court,concludes that the district court indeed,committed reversible error in both instances.
the knowledgeable investor jury instruction 
at the time of wit breach on april,time during which wit was preparing to go public,as evidenced by the company march press release announcing those was not unreasonable for boyce,as a knowledgeable investor,to anticipate that the value of wit stock was higher than the per share exercise price of his stock option or higher than the per share price at which wit was selling its stock in private placements and block sales to large institutional investors.we believe there was sufficient evidence,despite the court bright line approach to evidentiary admissions,to support boyce theory that knowledgeable investors anticipated the future conditions and performance of the stock to be greater than the,block sale,per share price.indeed,as wit founder klein testified,the reason institutional investors invested early in the company was because the stock would be worth a lot more money than the price that they paid to be shareholders.he similarly testified that offering stock to early employees was used as an incentive to induce these people to join wit when it was a company.
