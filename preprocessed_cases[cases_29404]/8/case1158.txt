these appeals present the important question of whether unions may intervene into a litigation where the actual parties to that litigation,including a mayoral administration,have agreed to a settlement.the intervenors in this case,a group of police unions,endeavored to challenge the ruling of united states district judge shira scheindlin that the city of new york city policy was carried out in a discriminatory manner,as well as her imposition of various reforms to that policy.we previously ordered these cases to be reassigned from judge scheindlin to another district judge.the case was reassigned to united states district judge analisa torres who,in a july,decision,denied the unions motions to intervene in these cases.the unions appealed this decision and also moved to intervene in the underlying appeals before our court.with a new mayoral administration elected to office,the city entered into a settlement with plaintiffs pursuant to which plaintiffs will not oppose a motion by the city to terminate the district court jurisdiction after a period of five years if the city can show substantial compliance with the reforms contained in judge scheindlin remedial order.the city therefore opposes the unions motions,moves to voluntarily dismiss its appeals on the underlying merits,and requests,with plaintiffs consent,expedited issuance of the mandate to begin the remedial process.
we hold that the police unions motions to intervene are untimely and do not assert an interest that the law seeks to protect.the unions knew,or should have known,of their alleged interests in these controversial and public cases well before they filed their motions in september.for years now,has been the subject of extensive public filings and intense media scrutiny.whatever the merit of the unions claim that judge scheindlin rulings were incorrectly premised upon statistical evidence purporting to place million stops at issue,allowing the unions to revive a dispute by intervening at this late juncture would substantially prejudice the existing parties and unduly encroach upon the city inherent discretion to settle a dispute against it.in other words,granting the unions motions in the wake of the november mayoral election would essentially condone a collateral attack on the democratic process and could erode the legitimacy of decisions made by the representatives of the people.
furthermore,the police unions interests in their members reputations and collective bargaining rights are,as a matter of law,too remote from the subject of the action to warrant intervention as a party.we stress that our holding is limited to the particular and highly unusual circumstances presented here and should in no way be construed to encourage premature intervention in cases of public concern where government defendants have discretion to settle.
accordingly,judge torres july,decision is affirmed as being within her discretion,the police unions motions to intervene in the appeals are denied,the city motion for voluntary dismissal of the appeals with prejudice is granted,and the causes are remanded for such further proceedings before judge torres as may be appropriate in the circumstances.the mandate shall issue seven days from the date of the filing of this opinion.
background 
on january,united states district judge shira scheindlin entered a preliminary injunction against defendants in ligon city of new york,finding that plaintiffs had shown a clear likelihood of proving at trial that the new york city police department nypd had a practice of making unlawful trespass stops outside of certain residential buildings in the bronx 
on august,after a bench trial that followed plaintiffs withdrawal of claims for money damages and claims against individual defendants,judge scheindlin issued an order in floyd city of new york,finding that the city had violated the fourth and fourteenth amendments by acting with deliberate indifference toward the nypd practice of making suspicionless stops and frisks and by adopting a policy of indirect racial profiling by targeting racially defined groups for stops and frisks.that same day,judge scheindlin issued an order imposing remedies in floyd and ligon in the form of various reforms to the nypd stop and frisk practices to be overseen by a monitor the city appealed in both cases and sought a stay.
on september and,the sergeants benevolent association sba,patrolmen benevolent association of the city of new york pba,detectives endowment association,dea,new york city police department captains endowment association cea,and lieutenants benevolent association of the city of new york,lba,and jointly,police unions or the unions filed notices of appeal and motions to intervene in the district court.with the exception of the sba,the police unions moved to intervene in both floyd and ligon.the sba moved to intervene in only floyd.while the sba and the pba appeal the liability and remedial orders,the dea,the cea,and the lba appeal only the remedial order.
on october,we granted the city motion for a stay and ordered that the cases be reassigned from judge scheindlin to another district judge in an opinion,dated november,we explained the reasons for that order on november,the cases were assigned to united states district judge analisa torres.
thereafter,an election to fill the various leadership positions in the city municipal government was held on november,leading,inter alia,to the election of a new administration.on november,the police unions,with the exception of the sba,moved to intervene in the floyd and ligon appeals.on november,the sba moved to intervene in only the floyd appeal.
on february,on the city motion,we remanded the causes to judge torres for the purpose of exploring settlement and for judge torres to address in the first instance the police unions motions to intervene in the district court actions we held in abeyance the police unions separate motions to intervene in the pending appeals 
on march,the parties informed judge torres that they had reached an agreement in principle for resolving the city appeals in both floyd and ligon pursuant to which the city would substantially compl y with the injunctive relief set forth in judge scheindlin remedial order,subject to the parties application to judge torres to limit the term of the monitor to three years.in the parties memorandum of law in support of their joint motion for modification of the remedial order,they explained that t he parties have also agreed that when the monitorship ends,the city will authorize the inspector general of the nypd to continue to monitor and report to the parties and the public the nypd compliance with the remedial order.they stated that the parties have also agreed that,if the city can show it has maintained substantial compliance with the aforementioned reforms for two years following the termination of the monitorship,the floyd and ligon plaintiffs will not oppose a city motion to terminate the court jurisdiction over floyd and the aspect of ligon.with these representations and agreements before her,on july,judge torres granted the parties joint motion to modify the remedial order and to enter it as an embodiment of their agreements.
on july,judge torres also issued an order denying the police unions motions to intervene,finding,inter alia,that the motions were untimely and that the police unions did not assert a legally protectable interest.judge torres held that the motions were untimely because the unions should have known for years that their members alleged reputational interests and the unions collective bargaining interests were being litigated by parties who were not invested in protecting those interests.judge torres held that plaintiffs would face significant prejudice if previously uninterested are permitted to prolong the legal wrangling and further delay plaintiffs relief,and that g ranting intervention would permit the unions to infringe upon the city prerogative to determine policing policy as manifested in its litigation strategy.
judge torres further held that the unions alleged reputational interests are not legally protectable,do not belong to the unions,or are too conclusory and speculative to be colorable on a motion to intervene.judge torres also found that the remedial order does not implicate the unions collective bargaining interests because it neither concerns wages,hours,or working conditions,nor does it prevent the unions from bargaining over these issues.the police unions appealed.
on august,with the consent of plaintiffs in floyd and ligon,the city moved to voluntarily dismiss its appeals,with prejudice,pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure b,stating that the parties reached an agreement that resolves all the issues raised by the city appeals in both floyd and ligon,and clears the way for the parties to begin the anticipated remedial process.the motion further requests,with the consent of all plaintiffs,that the court direct the expedited issuance of the mandate in each case.
discussion 
we have previously explained that i ntervention is a procedural device that attempts to accommodate two competing policies efficiently administrating legal disputes by resolving all related issues in one lawsuit,on the one hand,and keeping a single lawsuit from becoming unnecessarily complex,unwieldy or prolonged,on the other hand,and that,i n resolving the tension that exists between these dual concerns,the particular facts of each case are important,and prior decisions are not always reliable guides.because of the nature of an intervention decision,we review for abuse of discretion a district court order denying intervention as of right or by permission 
federal rule of civil procedure a provides for intervention as of right,stating in relevant part 
on timely motion,the court must permit anyone to intervene who claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant ability to protect its interest,unless existing parties adequately represent that interest federal rule of civil procedure b provides for intervention by permission,stating in relevant part that o n timely motion,the court may permit anyone to intervene who has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.
to be granted intervention as of right or by permission,an applicant must timely file an application,show an interest in the action,demonstrate that the interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action,and show that the interest is not protected adequately by the parties to the action.we have underscored that a f ailure to satisfy any one of these four requirements is a sufficient ground to deny the application.
the district court found that the police unions failed to meet the first and second requirements.we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the unions motions to intervene as of right and by permission on these grounds.
we have explained that t he timeliness requirement is flexible and the decision is one entrusted to the district judge sound discretion.it defies precise definition,although it certainly is not confined strictly to chronology.factors to consider in determining timeliness include a the length of time the applicant knew or should have known of its interest before making the motion b prejudice to existing parties resulting from the applicant delay c prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied and d the presence of unusual circumstances militating for or against a finding of timeliness.
we conclude that judge torres acted within her discretion in finding that,in the particular circumstances presented here,these factors weighed against finding that the unions timely moved to intervene.
the unions knew,or should have known,of their asserted interests in their members reputations and collective bargaining rights well before they filed their motions in september.they argue that they did not become aware of their interests until judge scheindlin august,liability order and remedial order,which,according to the unions,were expansive,disparaging,and erroneous and set forth sweeping and disruptive remedies regardless of whether this is true,the fact remains that the full scope of these cases and the potential reform measures were readily apparent from years of extensive public filings and intense media scrutiny.these public documents regarding plaintiffs claims of widespread unconstitutional stops and frisks and unlawful racial profiling by the nypd included the floyd and ligon complaints,the class certification orders,the ligon preliminary injunction hearing and order,the floyd summary judgment order,the highly publicized floyd bench trial,extensive briefing on remedies,numerous amicus briefs,and countless news articles it was widely understood that the views of the incumbent municipal administration were not shared by their likely successors.this plethora of information should have put the unions on notice of the potential political and judicial dangers that these cases posed to their interests well before judge scheindlin august,liability and remedial orders.
the unions further argue that,notwithstanding their awareness of their interests,they did not know that the city would not be protecting those interests until the new york city mayor,bill de blasio,announced on january,that he would be dropping the appeals,or at the earliest,when de blasio took the lead in the mayoral primary election in august and announced his position against stops and frisks.
as an initial matter,it is far from clear,and the unions have not shown,that the city was ever protecting the union members reputations,much less their collective bargaining rights.indeed,the interests of employers and their employees frequently diverge,especially in the context of municipal employment,where an employer interests are often not congruent with the employee and the employer may argue that the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment this inherent conflict should have become even more apparent on march,when judge scheindlin dismissed the individual defendants in floyd,some of whom were union members,pursuant to the parties stipulation.
on this record,we can not say that judge torres abused her discretion in finding that the unions should have known that their interests might not be adequately represented far in advance of any indication that the city might settle the dispute for the same reasons,the election of mayor de blasio and the city decision to settle the cases was not an unusual circumstance militating in favor of a finding of timeliness 
contrary to the unions contention,our decision to leave judge torres order undisturbed will not encourage outside parties to race to intervene in order to protect their interests whenever a government defendant could decide to settle a lawsuit.we hold only that,in the particular and highly unusual facts and circumstances presented here,it should have been readily apparent to the unions that their interests diverged from the city long before the unions filed for intervention.
judge torres also did not err in finding that granting intervention at this late stage would prejudice the existing parties.the police unions moved to intervene after liability and remedies had been adjudged.this resembles intervention,which is generally disfavored because it usually creates delay and prejudice to existing parties and undermines the orderly administration of justice.allowing intervention at this late juncture would prejudice plaintiffs and the city by postponing resolution of this dispute and frustrating both parties desire to promptly engage in reforms.intervention would disserve the balancing interest of rule in keeping a lawsuit from becoming unnecessarily complex,unwieldy or prolonged.
moreover,we have serious reservations about the prospect of allowing a union to encroach upon a government discretion to settle a dispute against it.to countenance this sort of practice,in this instance or any other,would amount to condoning a collateral attack on the democratic process would prejudice the city would not serve the interests served by rule and would erode the legitimacy o
