in this case,the government initiated a forfeiture proceeding against a prized sailboat,once owned by the late john kennedy,and secured a default judgment that obliterated the ownership interest of kerry scott lane.arguing that the government gave him inadequate notice of the forfeiture action,lane asked the district court for relief from the judgment.see.b.the court refused.lane now appeals.
after careful consideration,we conclude that the court below did not adequately consider the sufficiency of the notice as it pertained to lane interest in the sailboat.consequently,we vacate the order denying the rule b motion and remand for further proceedings.we take no view on the ultimate outcome of those proceedings.
we state the facts rather tentatively.the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing and,therefore,we piece together an account from the affidavit in support of the original forfeiture complaint,the affidavits and other papers proffered in support of lane rule b motion,and the relatively few undisputed facts.
the flash ii is a sailing vessel once owned by the late john kennedy.lane ownership interest in it dates back to,when ole anderson learned of the craft impending sale at auction.desirous of restoring the sailboat for resale but lacking the wherewithal to make the initial purchase,anderson convinced chuck fitzgerald and another faceless investor to back his bidding.the auction was held in monticello,florida,and anderson made the high bid.due to the kennedy connection,the sale created a flurry of publicity.the press coverage identified fitzgerald as the purchaser.
subsequent to the auction,fitzgerald discovered that the flash ii did not have any hull number.worried that this void would make it difficult to prove the sailboat provenance,he decided to abandon ship.anderson agreed to put together a syndicate to acquire fitzgerald interest and,on july,fitzgerald executed a handwritten agreement to sell his interest in the sloop to the consortium headed by ole anderson for lane contributed to join the consortium.
the new owners initially stored the sailboat at lane florida home.they then moved it to a shipyard in marblehead,massachusetts marblehead trading.once the flash ii had been restored,the consortium exhibited it at various nautical museums and shows.anderson did the bulk of the restoration work and managed the promotional activities lane,however,continued to pour money into the project,contributing,over time,roughly in additional capital.
on december,anderson prepared a handwritten agreement setting forth how profits from an anticipated sale of the flash ii would be divided.that document listed lane,fitzgerald,anderson,anderson mother,and two other investors as owners of the sloop.under its terms,lane was to receive of the net profits after payment of expenses and reimbursement of capital advances.
despite this spadework,the flash ii continued to remain property of the consortium.anderson purportedly rejected a prospective buyer bid of around for the sloop,believing he could sell it for a figure in excess of.
unbeknownst to lane when he first invested in the flash ii,anderson entrepreneurial pursuits apparently extended beyond marine restorations.in december of,the drug enforcement administration dea interviewed a cooperating witness the cw who identified anderson as a member of a enterprise.the cw also reported that anderson had talked him into investing close to in marijuana profits into the flash ii restoration project.he added that a nother person,possibly a doctor or dentist,also invested roughly the same amount to help finance the acquisition and restoration of the sloop.the cw did not identify this investor by name.
the cw investment was.he complained that,in,under a threat that anderson would reveal his role in the operation,he ceded to anderson his entitlement to profits from any future sale of the flash ii.the gist of this tale was confirmed when,at the dea instigation,the cw met face to face with anderson in beverly,massachusetts,on september.during that audience,anderson made it pellucid that,from his point of view,the cw no longer had any ownership interest in the flash ii.
to make a tedious tale tolerably terse,the dea concluded,based on its investigation,that the flash ii constituted property derived from the proceeds of narcotics distribution and seized the sloop from the marblehead trading yard.see a providing for civil forfeiture of property traceable to the avails of drug trafficking.anderson called lane in october of to report the seizure.although anderson offered to identify lane as an owner,lane beseeched him not to do so because he lane was in the midst of a credentialing process at a new hospital and feared that publicity about his association with a reputed would jeopardize his prospects lane claims that he did not realize at the time that his own interest in the sailboat might be at risk.lane did request,however,that anderson keep him apprised of any further developments.
on february,the government filed a civil forfeiture complaint against the flash ii.it supported the complaint with the affidavit of a dea agent.that affidavit set forth a narrative account of what the cw had told the dea at a series of meetings.based on that recital,the district court found probable cause for forfeiture and issued a preliminary order instructing the government to arrest the vessel,publish notice of the intended forfeiture,and notify ole anderson,ralph anderson of marblehead trading,harry crosby and any other persons who claimed an interest in the flash ii of the pendency of the action.
the government published notices of intent to forfeit in the boston herald on february,february,and march,and served the individuals by certified mail.lane was not personally served and claims not to have seen the published notices.
crosby was the only person who filed an answer to the forfeiture complaint.as to all other interested parties,the government moved for an entry of default.see.a see also.supp.c a i a requiring interested parties to file verified claims of interest within days after the earlier of the date of service of the government complaint or completed publication of notice under rule c.the clerk of court obliged on june.seventeen days later,crosby and the government who had negotiated a settlement jointly moved for the entry of a default judgment of forfeiture.see.b.
lane claims that,notwithstanding his request that he be kept apprised,he never heard from anderson.his efforts to contact anderson drew a blank.in frustration,he set up a search alert to identify any internet postings containing the words john ii.he asserts that he first learned of the judicial forfeiture action in late june of,when this alert led him to an article stating that the government had forfeited the sailboat and was planning to sell it at auction.
lane promptly contacted marblehead trading and,on july,received for the first time a copy of the entry of default.he immediately began hunting for counsel.on july,lane newly retained counsel had acclimated district court granted the motion for entry of a default judgment.
lane promptly filed a motion to vacate the judgment,see.b,asseverating that he was an innocent of the flash ii and that the government had failed to take reasonable steps to notify him of the institution of the forfeiture proceeding.the district court denied the motion without a hearing,stating simply that b ecause claimant admittedly knew of the seizure and deliberately declined to disclose his interest,none of the grounds for vacating a judgment under rule b apply.following an unsuccessful motion to alter or amend the order,see.e,lane prosecuted this appeal.
lane most compelling argument is that the district court abused its discretion when it rejected his motion to vacate without any inquiry into whether the government provided him adequate notice of the civil forfeiture proceeding the government counters that it was unaware of lane identity so notice by publication sufficed to assuage any legitimate concerns.we explore this battleground.
an order granting or denying a rule b motion ordinarily engenders review for abuse of
