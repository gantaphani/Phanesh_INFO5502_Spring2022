this appeal arises out of a dispute between two law firms over how to split attorneys fees due them as a result of their mutual clients recovery in the personal injury lawsuit that gave rise to this action.the appellant,the law offices of david efron efron expresses unhappiness with the percent share the district court awarded to his firm in support of efron request that we order the district court to reapportion the fees in some unspecified manner,he challenges the court factual findings that he was not credible and that he intended to mislead the court about his fee agreement with pro hac vice counsel toby fullmer fullmer,of the law firm matthews fullmer.efron also challenges the court ex parte communication with the plaintiffs in order to resolve a dispute about which lawyer represented them.after determining that the district court had ancillary jurisdiction over the attorneys fees dispute,and finding no error at all in the district court analysis or conduct,we affirm.
background 
in,plaintiff orlando alejandro ortiz alejandro suffered injuries from an electrical shock as he attempted to move a downed power line.alejandro ortiz power,cir.alejandro,along with his wife sonia rodríguez jimenez rodríguez and their two minor children collectively,plaintiffs,retained the texas law firm matthews fullmer to represent them in a lawsuit against puerto rico electric power authority prepa and its insurer.on march,matthews fullmer entered into a joint venture agreement with efron that provided that efron would perform local counsel duties in exchange for percent of the attorneys fees.
several weeks before trial in,fullmer informed efron that matthews fullmer could not try the case.efron therefore tried the case and obtained a judgment for the plaintiffs in the amounts of for alejandro,for rodríguez,and for each of the two minor children.the district court later reduced the amount due alejandro and the children to in light of a settlement agreement between those three plaintiffs and prepa insurer.prepa successfully appealed the award to plaintiff rodríguez.alejandro ortiz,at.
meanwhile,in the wake of the judgment,the relationship between efron and matthews fullmer deteriorated,with their clients becoming balls in a contest between counsel.matthews fullmer tried to fire efron as local counsel in this case and two others.efron parried the move by getting the plaintiffs to fire matthews fullmer.fullmer then convinced the plaintiffs to undue the firing and to fire efron instead.
these events bounced onto the district court docket on october,when appellees carlos iguina oharriz iguina and hatuey infante castellanos infante,having been retained by matthews fullmer as new local counsel,filed a motion for leave to appear as substitute local counsel for the plaintiffs.the next day,efron filed a motion to disqualify substitute local counsel and matthews fullmer,or,alternatively,for an attorney lien for percent of the attorneys fees.efron motion explained that he had expressed and verbally agreed,not in writing,with matthews fullmer that efron would receive percent of the attorneys fees because of the additional work and responsibility in this case,including trial.
in response to these dueling motions,the district court understandably found itself unclear as to the plaintiffs,and whether the plaintiffs were being protected as counsel fought with one another.the court issued the following order 
the court is deeply concerned about the serious allegations being made among plaintiffs putative attorneys on the basis of the record now before us and particularly given the serial,competing revocations and grants of power of attorney we are incapable of determining plaintiffs true intent,and we can not trust the claims of any of the attorneys now purporting to represent them.accordingly,all of those attorneys are hereby ordered to immediately cease communicating with plaintiffs without express,prior consent from this court 
given the serious charges being leveled,plaintiffs important rights that must be protected,and the risk of improper influence being exercised upon plaintiffs,the court intends to communicate,ex parte,with plaintiffs,in an attempt to determine if and when they might be available to attend a hearing 
these uncertainties posed a pressing problem because prepa,in response to a writ of execution issued by the court,was prepared to pay the owed to three of the plaintiffs.indeed,it appears that it was counsels conflicting desires to get their hands on this imminent payment that brought the dispute to a head.fullmer held out his hand by writing a letter which he subsequently filed with the court along with the motion to substitute local counsel to prepa counsel informing him that efron no longer represented the plaintiffs and that prepa should send the check to infante or iguina.faced with the possibility that could end up with an attorney who did not represent the plaintiffs,the district court sensibly instructed prepa to deposit any funds in satisfaction of the judgment with the court registry,where it will be held in an account until such time as plaintiffs representation is settled.
the district court next ordered efron and fullmer to appear at a hearing so that,before making any further ruling,the court could hear from the attorneys purporting to represent plaintiffs.the court also informed efron and fullmer that t he court has personally spoken twice with plaintiff sonia rodríguez jimenez,and based on those conversations we do not believe it necessary at this time to appoint a special master or to have plaintiffs appear before the court.
at the hearing,the district court inquired about two issues the events that led to the termination of efron as local counsel,and the status of the agreement between efron and matthews fullmer.fullmer described the conduct that led to his firm decision to terminate efron as local counsel on three cases,including efron decision to file a brief in this underlying case without allowing fullmer to read it first.fullmer admitted that he attempted to negotiate a new arrangement with efron,but he denied that they ever reached an agreement.in response,efron speculated that matthews fullmer wanted him off the case in order to claim a larger share of the attorneys fees and as an effort to dodge a garnishment order served on efron by a judgment creditor of the texas firm.as for the fee division between the attorneys,efron claimed that he would not have agreed to try the case for less than the lion share of the fees.
on october,the district court entered an order declaring that matthews fullmer would continue to represent the plaintiffs,with iguina and infante serving as substitute local counsel.alejandro ortiz power,civ.scc,wl,at.the order terminated efron representation and prohibited efron from contacting the plaintiffs.id.the district court nonetheless awarded efron percent of the attorneys fees id.the court found that efron and fullmer never modified the original arrangement in the march,joint venture agreement,but also found that efron was entitled to more than percent on a quantum meruit basis for the unanticipated work he performed in trying the case.id.at.
efron filed a rule e motion asking the district court to amend or omit certain findings in its october order.those findings indicated that efron made misleading statements and was not credible with respect to aspects of his dispute with fullmer.while his motion was pending,efron appealed to this court.the district court then denied the rule e motion,defending its findings on efron credibility as both necessary and.
ii.analysis 
efron raises three issues on appeal.first,he contests the district court findings with respect to his credibility and attempts to mislead the court.second,he claims that he is entitled to more than percent of the attorneys fees.third,he complains about the district court ex parte communication with plaintiff rodríguez.after determining that the district court had jurisdiction,we address each argument in turn.
ancillary jurisdiction over the fee dispute 
first,we must determine whether the district court correctly concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction to decide what is essentially a private contract dispute between.although neither side raises the issue on appeal,we have an obligation to make such a determination sua sponte.mcculloch vélez,cir.we review issues of jurisdiction de novo.cooper charter comms.entertainments i,llc,cir.
at first glance,it seems like diversity could have provided an independent basis for the district court jurisdiction over a sizable fee dispute between a texas law firm and local counsel in puerto rico.see.the district court did not assess its jurisdiction under the diversity rubric,however,and the record on appeal provides insufficient jurisdictional facts for this court to make a determination.also,the probable puerto rican citizenship and potential indispensability of new local counsel infante and iguina,to whom part of matthews fullmer fee would be due,cast some doubt on the existence of diversity jurisdiction.picciotto cont l cas,cir.
we therefore look to the possibility of jurisdiction ancillary to the court jurisdiction over the underlying suit.federal courts have often exercised authority under the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction to resolve fee disputes between parties and their attorneys that arise out of the underlying litigation.rivera domenech calvesbert law offices psc,cir per curiam dictum see also exact software,demoisey,cir collecting cases for years,indeed since the early years of the republic,federal courts have resolved fee disputes between lawyers and their clients when those disputes arise out of the underlying case wright miller,federal practice procedure ed.one of the uses of ancillary jurisdiction is over proceedings concerning costs and attorneys fees.one broad purpose of such jurisdiction is to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.kokkonen guardian life ins,d.
whether federal courts also have ancillary jurisdiction over fee disputes between attorneys who represented the same client,especially when the client was not a party to the lawyers agreement,is less clear.in one important respect,a dispute between counsel who claim collectively more than the total amount of fees owed by the client is much like a dispute between the lawyers and the client because,until it is resolved,the presence of competing and inconsistent attorneys liens may hinder the client receipt of the amount due the client.even without consideration of this possible impact on the client,other circuits have found ancillary jurisdiction over disputes among counsel when the funds subject to the dispute are in the court control.compare baer first options of chicago,cir district court had ancillary jurisdiction to decide a referral fee dispute between attorneys,when the settlement approved by the court contained terms for calculating the fees and the disputed amount was held in an escrow account by the clerk of court and grimes chrysler motors,cir per curiam court had ancillary jurisdiction to decide a fee dispute between trial counsel and attorney of record after the court approved the settlement,because the settlement funds were in the court registry and therefore within its control with taylor kelsey,cir per curiam no ancillary jurisdiction existed over a purely private contract dispute between an attorney and former,because the fee dispute had no effect on the outcome of the litigation or the recovery of the plaintiffs,and the court did not have control over the disputed funds.
efron fee dispute did not arise in the course of enforcing or approving a settlement agreement,as was the case in grimes and baer,but it did emerge in direct response to the court decision to allow partial execution on its judgment.the district court needed to resolve the ancillary fee dispute in order to complete the execution on the underlying judgment.see kokkonen,at.the district court control over of the partially executed judgment therefore conferred authority to determine the proper recipients of those funds in order to conclude the court responsibilities in the underlying action.see baer,at grimes,at.
findings on credibility and misleading statements 
efron first challenges the district court findings that he attempted to mislead the court and that he was not credible.those challenged findings addressed three representations that efron made to the court that he and matthews fullmer had expressed and verbally agreed that efron would receive percent of the fee award that efron did not put the revised fee agreement in writing because he trusted fullmer and that efron attorneys,and not matthews fullmer,facilitated preparation for the trial because the plaintiffs speak little or no english.efron made the first and third statements in his motion,and the second at the hearing.
during the hearing,fullmer testified that he denied efron request for an percent fee because fullmer firm bore the financial risk of the case by paying more than in litigation expenses.fullmer countered with alternative fee divisions of,but efron did want those,and never accepted any counteroffer.fullmer also argued that had there been a modified fee agreement,any attorney would have sought that in writing.with respect to communicating with the plaintiffs,fullmer told the court that plaintiff rodríguez speaks great english,and that he always talked with her.this testimony by fullmer provided ample support for the district court finding that the agreement alleged by efron did not exist.
but there was more.efron own testimony belied his prior representations to the court.instead of backing up his claim that there was an express verbal agreement that efron would receive percent of the attorneys fees,efron fell back to saying only that there was an implicit agreement that he would receive the lion share.in fact,efron admitted that fullmer never agreed to change the agreement w e tried to come to an agreement with fullmer.he would have nothing to do with it.he insisted that it was and the last thing he said,and i was very sorry to hear that from him,was w e have to let the court decide.in short,efron testimony materially fell short of the assertion made in his motion that he and fullmer had expressed and verbally agreed that efron would keep percent of the fee.
given the foregoing testimony,the district court as factfinder clearly had ample basis to find,as it did,that efron comments in his motion about an express verbal contract were meant to mislead the court.alejandro ortiz,wl,at.
the district court did not believe efron on two other points.the court found that efron statement that he did not ask for the fee agreement in writing because he trusted fullmer was not credible or believable,because both attorneys seem sufficiently competent not to have acted in such a manner.id.and,in light of efron misleading statements about the fee agreement and text messages between efron associate and plaintiff rodríguez,the district court which had spoken directly to one of the plaintiffs was also forced to conclude that efron was purposefully misleading the court when he represented that the plaintiffs speak little or no english.id.at.
efron complains that these unflattering findings were unnecessary dicta and ought to be amended or stricken from the order.efron never articulates a basis for such relief,and instead simply labels the court findings dicta,misrepresent ing the facts,and evidence of the district court personal bias against him.
the simple response is that,if the challenged findings were truly only dicta,we would likely not review them on appeal.see in re williams,cir c ritical comments made in the course of a trial court wonted functions say,factfinding or opinion writing do not constitute a sanction and provide no independent basis for an appeal.the more direct response is that these are precisely the kind of findings that courts or juries make in deciding disputes of this type.efron credibility was relevant,especially in resolving the he said,he said dispute between efron and fullmer.and the evidence presented to the court including efron own internally inconsistent story clearly provided the necessary support for its adverse findings that efron was not credible and had tried to mislead the court.see ryan astra tech,cir district court properly disbelieved the accuracy of a sanctioned attorney version of events in part because the lawyer account of the events and his actions d id not inspire confidence in his truthfulness.
efron seems to forget that,in this dispute,he played the role of a party and a witness.he should hardly be surprised that the district court made routine judgments about the credibility of the assertions he made in direct support of his claim for more money.district courts do this every day.see,jackson united states,cir sheppard river valley fitness one,cir.and we review such findings deferentially,especially when they bear on credibility.jennings jones,cir district court determinations of credibility are of course entitled to great deference.similarly,as a party asking the court,in effect,to equitably apportion fees to him in excess of the portion specified in his contract,he can hardly complain that the district court paid attention to his care and good faith in representing facts to the court.see texaco,dep t of consumer affairs,cir describing equitable doctrine of unclean hands.for all of these reasons,there is no basis to disturb the district court findings 
attorneys fees apportionment 
having rejected efron claim that the lawyers made any agreement regarding fees other than the agreement that allotted percent to efron,the district court nevertheless awarded efron percent of the fees.in doing so,the district court concluded that the lawyers agreement did not anticipate or address the roles ultimately assumed,and that the added work efron performed merited a percent share of the fees.fullmer has not appealed this equitable adjustment.efron,though,has,claiming that he should have received more.
it is hard to imagine our overturning such an inherently discretionary equitable apportionment by the district court.see lipsett blanco,cir b ecause determination of the extent of a reasonable fee necessarily involves a series of judgment calls,an appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.just as the court noted that efron did more than local counsel would normally do,so too it observed how matthews fullmer participated to a significant degree from the case inception up until trial,including by preparing and filing motions and securing experts,and continued to bear the financial risk of receiving no compensation for the litigation expenses it had paid.alejandro ortiz,wl,at.
efron himself points to no other specific,more appropriate apportionment,nor does he explain why the percent award is so indefensible as to be vulnerable to the limited review applicable here.the argument in efron opening brief consists of a reference to the abuse of discretion standard of review,a conclusory statement that s imply put,the magistrate resolution of the finances of this case are sic wrong,and irrelevant digressions efron does tell us that he once received percent of the attorneys fees for a medical malpractice case referred to him by matthews fullmer and for which he served as lead counsel from the outset.of course,that one data point is not an apt comparison for this case,in which matthews fullmer played a significant role.efron also latches onto fullmer suggestion during the hearing that fullmer offered and efron rejected a share,but efron fails to explain why he should now benefit from a bargain he once rejected.such a perfunctory effort on appeal borders on waiver.see rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir it should go without saying that we deem waived claims not made or claims adverted to in a cursory fashion,unaccompanied by developed argument.harriman hancock,cir appellant waived issues when he correctly identifie d the standard of review,but that was about all.waived or not,efron argument fails to show that the district court abused its discretion in determining the relative value of efron legal services.
d.the district court ex parte communication 
efron final claim of error is that the district court communication with plaintiff rodríguez violated the prohibition on ex parte communications in canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges at no time did efron object to the district court announced intention to communicate ex parte with the plaintiffs,or to the communication itself.we therefore review for plain error,a standard that requires efron to show,among other things,a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights.dávila corporación de para la difusión pública,cir.
of course,this appeal is not a judicial disciplinary proceeding.it therefore makes no difference on this appeal whether the district court violated the pertinent canon unless that violation somehow could have tainted the judgment from which efron appeals.efron,in turn,points to no such plausible nexus,and instead merely asserts in a conclusory form that such a supposed violation infringed on his due process rights.how this is so much less plainly so we are left to guess.
in any event,we can easily cut to the chase and reject efron argument on its merits.the canon allows ex parte communications for scheduling,administrative,or emergency purposes if the ex parte communication does not address substantive matters and the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural,substantive,or tactical advantage.code of conduct for united states judges canon a b.the district court clearly faced an emergency the plaintiffs local and pro hac vice counsel were at odds over who actually represented the plaintiffs.nor did the district court communication with the plaintiffs have anything to do with the substance of the underlying case or even the ancillary matter of the fee division between efron and matthews fullmer.given that the district court announced its intention to talk to the plaintiffs,and no one objected,we can not see how the court possibly violated canon a,let alone clearly or obviously violated it in a manner that caused improper prejudice to efron in this case.
efron also claims that the ex parte communications violated his due process rights in connection with disciplinary instituted against efron as a result of his conduct in a different case.how that may be so,we have no idea,and efron again does not enlighten us.in any event,that argument about another case is irrelevant to the issues before us now.
iii.conclusion 
finding no fault with the district court conduct and rulings,we affirm the district court october,order.
we use efron to refer collectively to the attorney and his law firm.the conduct of efron the individual is primarily at issue in this appeal.
the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge pursuant to c.because the magistrate judge had authority to conduct any or all proceedings in the matter,we refer to relevant rulings as those of the district court,or simply the court.
while this appeal was pending,the district court disbursed percent of the attorneys fees,or,to efron law firm.
to the extent efron challenges the district court statements on the basis that they reflect bias,his argument is utterly without merit.efron did not seek the magistrate judge recusal,and in fact affirmatively waived any claim of bias by stating,in his motion for reconsideration,that efron does not seek to recuse or disqualify the magistrate judge based on bias or prejudice.see united states rodriguez,cir a party waives a right when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it.even if efron had not waived any claim of bias,opinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.liteky united states,d.rather than antagonism,the district court displayed patience and balance in resolving a difficult and unusual problem,and it explained that it thought long and hard about whether the words the court used were proper and warranted,and
