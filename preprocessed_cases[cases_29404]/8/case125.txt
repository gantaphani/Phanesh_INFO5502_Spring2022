relator kenneth jones alleges that defendants ronald killiany and marilyn albert knowingly made false statements when submitting a grant application to the national institute on aging nia and knowingly falsified certain scientific data underlying the application.those false statements,jones contends,influenced the nia decision to award over million in federal funds to massachusetts general hospital and brigham and women hospital.in jones filed a qui tam action pursuant to the false claims act,the fca,and in a previous appeal we vacated the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.united states ex.rel.jones brigham women hosp,cir jones i.the case proceeded to trial,and a jury found for the defendants.jones appealed again and now argues that the district court erred in denying his motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.finding no reason to upset the jury considered verdict,however,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
factual background 
in our previous decision we set forth the basic facts underlying jones fca claim.see jones i,at.we repeat only those facts necessary to understand the claims that jones asserts in this latest appeal.
on october,the defendants submitted a program project grant ppg application to the nia the grant application consisted of several distinct projects proposed by researchers at massachusetts general hospital and brigham and women hospital,organized around a common goal to identify physical characteristics or mental capacities that could accurately predict the onset of alzheimer disease in patients.jones maintains that the application contained materially false claims that induced the nia to award the grant.
marilyn albert,one of the defendants,served as the principal investigator of the ppg.in that role,albert was responsible for overseeing all research under the grant,coordinating the work of the various projects,and ensuring compliance with all nih requirements.albert also signed the application submitted to the nia.four cores provided specific types of research or administrative support to the projects.as pertinent to this case,relator jones led core b,the data management and statistical core of the ppg.as the leader of that core,jones assessed,compiled,and analyzed the data produced by the various projects.
jones fca claim focuses on a single project under the ppg umbrella project.that project,led by defendant killiany,a neuroanatomist,sought to identify and measure certain regions of interest in the brain.the study goal was to determine whether any physical characteristics of those regions could be used to appreciably predict whether a person with mild memory problems would go on to develop alzheimer disease.jones asserts that,leading up to the application,killiany intentionally manipulated data that formed the cornerstone of the project proposal.that data involved the entorhinal cortex ec,a small structure in the brain that serves as a pathway into the hippocampus and may also play an independent role in a person memory.
to track changes in the ec and its relationship to alzheimer disease,at the outset of the study each participant was placed into one of two categories based on that participant clinical dementia rating.participants labeled as normal showed normal,healthy cognition,while those labeled as questionable presented mild memory problems.over the course of the study,if a questionable participant cognitive difficulties progressed to the point that she developed probable alzheimer disease,that participant was placed into yet a third category and reclassified as a converter.
a magnetic resonance imaging mri scan was taken of each participant,and those scans were used to measure the size of each participant ec.by all accounts,the ec is a difficult structure to measure it is generally only about one cubic centimeter in volume,and its boundaries are difficult to discern on an mri scan.in,killiany and another researcher,teresa gomez isla,developed a protocol to predictably locate and outline the ec.they focused on identifying the boundaries between the ec and surrounding regions of the brain and employed what they both would describe at trial as a conservative approach to measuring the ec.killiany and gomez isla functioning as raters then employed this approach for the scans of a group of participants.the raters manually traced the ec on mri scans of each participant using a trackball mouse and software called neuroview.importantly,both raters were allegedly blinded,meaning that they were not informed of a participant cognitive categorization as normal or questionable.
members of core b,the statistical core,then conducted a reliability study,comparing killiany and gomez isla tracings to determine whether two raters could,in practice,consistently implement the protocol and reach similar results.the comparison yielded an reliability measure,or pearson coefficient,of,representing a very close match and indicating that two raters could predictably trace the ec and obtain consistent measurements.
following the reliability study,gomez isla role in the study concluded.killiany pressed on and measured the ec of other participants in the study.over the course of the study,killiany measured the ec of approximately total participants.as he completed his measurements,he would periodically send his calculations to mary hyde,the data manager for the statistical core.as he progressed,however,killiany identified several anatomical anomalies in the brains of certain participants.he also testified that implementing the protocol presented a learning curve.as he encountered anomalies and learned more about the ec,he reviewed his prior measurements.when a prior measurement seemed inaccurate,killiany would remeasure the area and reapply the operational definition,based on an increasing amount of information about measuring the structure on mri.when killiany remeasured a participant ec,he sent a separate file with the new measurement to hyde rather than overwriting his original measurements.this practice resulted in duplicate tracings of the same mri scan for some participants.in four instances,killiany remeasured scans that had been compared with gomez isla measurements in the reliability study.
based on killiany second set of measurements,the study concluded that the volume of a subject ec could predict with certainty whether a previously questionable participant with mild memory problems would become a converter and eventually develop alzheimer disease.this finding was presented in a article in the annals of neurology on which killiany,albert,and jones among others were listed as.that article also reported the reliability rating of.
in early,keith johnson from brigham women hospital,who led a separate project under the proposed ppg grant,first noticed the existence of two sets of ec measurements for some participants.johnson brought this discrepancy to jones attention by on february.jones investigated the matter and became concerned about the efficacy of killiany data.jones raised those concerns in a march meeting with albert and informed her that a statistically significant relationship between the volume of a participant ec and her clinical dementia rating only existed when killiany second set of measurements were used.by contrast,if killiany original measurements were substituted,the relationship disappeared.without killiany remeasurements,no statistically significant relationship was apparent from the data.given this discrepancy,jones requested that albert review the matter.
albert asked mark moss,a neuroanatomist,to review specific measurements about which jones had particular concerns.moss reviewed each of those scans and,with one exception,concluded that killiany second set of measurements more accurately outlined the ec for each participant.unsatisfied with moss conclusion,jones requested that the scans be remeasured by an independent evaluator.albert refused this request.
albert and mgh submitted the application to the nia on october.the application described the preliminary results of several of the alzheimer disease studies,including killiany study of the ec.it reported the study finding that the volume of the entorhinal cortex could predict with accuracy whether a questionable participant would go on to develop alzheimer disease.furthermore,in describing the methods undertaken to produce those results,the application stated that all operators were blinded to the groupings of the subjects,control,questionable,converter,and citing killiany article that the procedures in place for generating the manually drawn image maps have been demonstrated to have high reliability.the nih ultimately awarded mgh over million in federal funding for the period between and.
procedural background 
on june,jones filed this qui tam action naming several defendants,including brigham women,mgh,killiany,and albert.in the operative complaint,jones alleged that,in submitting the proposal to the nia,the defendants knowingly made false and fraudulent claims for federal funds.jones asserted that statements of false and fraudulent preliminary data infected the entire grant application,because the defendants relied upon killiany data with full knowledge of the false and fraudulent nature of those sic data and the significance of the information to the nih grant process.
the district court initially granted summary judgment for the defendants,but we vacated that order.jones i,at.although we recognized that expressions of opinion and scientific judgment can not constitute a false statement under the fca,we disagree d that the creation of the data in question was necessarily a matter of scientific judgment.id.at.even if killiany remeasurements fall within an accepted range of scientific accuracy,we concluded,a question remains as to whether the data was falsified by intentionally exaggerating the ec boundaries of normal subjects to achieve a desired result.id.at.as a result,we remanded the case for trial.
at trial,in addition to testifying himself,jones elicited testimony from all of the major actors in the study,including albert,killiany,gomez isla,and moss.jones testified to his discovery of the second set of data and his investigation into the statistical significance of that data.he also testified that,because the original scans of four of killiany remeasurements had been included in the reliability study,he had calculated a revised reliability measure.when killiany initial measurements were replaced with the remeasurements,jones asserted,the pearson coefficient dropped to a worthless correlation between the two raters.during the plaintiff case,killiany and albert resisted efforts to characterize their work as fraudulent.
the jury also heard testimony from three experts for jones norbert schuff,a scientist specializing in mri volumetric measurements of the brain,testified that killiany revised measurements deviated substantially from the protocol and that,in his opinion,there was no scientific justification to make those specific revisions to some but not other scans.richard goldstein,a statistical consultant,testified that,in his opinion,killiany remeasurements demonstrated that the interrater reliability protocol was not followed and that the concentration of killiany largest remeasurements among the normal group made it highly improbable that he remained blinded.finally,martha davila garcia,an associate professor of medicine who had experience as a peer reviewer advising the nih about dozens of grant proposals,testified that the purported reliability measure would be important to the nih review of the defendants application.
in their own case in chief,the defense recalled only two witnesses albert and killiany.the defense focused on more fully fleshing out its alternative rationale for killiany remeasurements namely that those measurements more accurately identified the ec.
at the close of evidence,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on all claims,and jones moved for a ruling on damages.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants,and jones subsequently filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b and incorporated an alternative request for a new trial under rule.among other grounds,jones contended that undisputed,substantial evidence existed as to each element of the fca claim.in that motion jones also attempted to renew his rule motion for summary judgment,conceding that he made no separate,formal written motion under rule a.the district court denied the motion and this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
jones maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law because no substantial evidence exists to support the verdict.in the alternative,jones argues that a new trial was warranted because the clear weight of the evidence supported his fca claim.finally,jones recites several alleged procedural,evidentiary,and instructional errors that he asserts also warrant a new trial.
judgment as a matter of law 
we review the district court denial of jones motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,examining the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,estate of berganzo colón ex rel.berganzo ambush,cir.this standard is demanding,and a party seeking to overturn a jury verdict faces an uphill battle.id.quoting marcano rivera turabo med.ctr,cir.ultimately,courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury determination when the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.marcano rivera,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
but a party must preserve this challenge for us to review it on appeal.rule a requires that a party first file a motion for judgment as a matter of law any time before the case is submitted to the jury.a.if the court does not grant that motion,following the verdict a party may file a motion under rule b to renew the claims.fed civ.b.we have held in no uncertain terms,however,that a failure to raise an issue prior to a rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law,without more,results in a waiver of that issue on appeal.muñoz sociedad española de auxilio mutuo y beneficiencia de,cir accord costa urena segarra,cir it is that arguments not made in a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule a can not then be advanced in a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b.indeed,the amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure were intended to solidify this requirement.see.advisory committee note,amendments because the rule b motion is only a renewal of the preverdict motion,it can be granted only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion.emphasis added.
in this case,jones plainly failed to preserve his rule b arguments.jones made no rule a motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict in favor of the defendants.rather,it is undisputed that jones made an oral motion regarding a singular issue of damages,alone,at the close of evidence.having reviewed the record,we find that this motion did not encompass or necessarily include an argument that jones was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
in an attempt to avoid this consequence,jones points to various other references in the record as establishing his objection to the sufficiency of the evidence.even were we to agree that a rigid invocation of the phrase rule a may not be necessary in all circumstances a proposition on which we express no opinion,jones effort to show that he raised the issue is unavailing.
first,jones invokes his pretrial summary judgment motion under rule as one such pertinent reference.he claims that motion preserved his challenge because every factual and legal issue presented in jones s motion and on this appeal was also presented in the previous rule motion.jones also asserts that n o rule precludes him from renewing his rule motion after trial,and no authority requires a rule a motion raising the same grounds raised in a motion for summary judgment.
the argument is misguided.as we have repeatedly emphasized,by the conclusion of trial a summary judgment motion has been overtaken by subsequent events,namely,a trial and an adverse jury verdict.granfield csx,cir quoting rivera torres ortiz vélez,cir.after trial,a party may not invoke any sufficiency challenges included only in a summary judgment motion.this rule is based on the procedural fact that the record fully develops between any proffered summary judgment motion and trial.mountain platform tennis,sherwin williams,cir.a denial of a motion for summary judgment is merely a judge determination that genuine issues of material fact exist.it is not a judgment,and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to reinvoke any sufficiency argument and preserve its challenge for appeal,a disappointed party must restate its objection in a motion for judgment as a matter of law.ji bose,cir.and nothing in our cases suggests that,when a party does file such a motion for judgment as a matter of law,it may ignore the unqualified requirement that a b motion may only restate those arguments raised by a prior a motion 
attempting to evade clear precedent,jones asserts that the supreme court decision in ortiz jordan,d,establishes that a party satisfies rule b by raising the same grounds in his pretrial motion for summary judgment under rule,and,consequently,n o separate rule a motion is required.ortiz does not support that proposition.in ortiz the defendants sought to appeal following a on the merits a district court order denying summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.there the defendants did,in fact,seek judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule a,although they acknowledged they did not renew that motion under rule b.ortiz.at.the court held,however,that the defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b left the appellate court without authority to reconsider the summary judgment motion and reject the district court verdict.id.at.
jones appears to invoke the court having referred only to rule b as establishing that a rule a motion is not required to raise arguments presented in a prior summary judgment motion.but this reference must be read in context.because the defendants in ortiz did,in fact,pursue a rule a motion,the hypothetical question of whether a party could reinvoke its summary judgment arguments through a rule b motion,alone,was not before the court.in the face of clear precedent in this circuit and the pertinent advisory committee commentary,we decline to make such a considerable inferential leap and read that holding into ortiz 
beyond his prior summary judgment motion,jones asserts in passing,and without further development,that several other pertinent references exist in the record to preserve his sufficiency argument.he invokes his previous appeal to this court,joint pretrial memorandum,proposed jury instructions,objections to jury instructions,and closing argument.citations omitted.his citation to the prior appeal to this court is simply another attempt to resuscitate his prior summary judgment motion.and the remaining identified filings and argument did nothing to put the district court or defendants on notice that jones would argue that,as a matter of law,the defendants had failed to put forth sufficient admissible evidence such that no reasonable jury could return a verdict in defendants favor,casillas díaz,at.
we thus conclude that jones has not preserved his argument that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.but he would fare no better even if he had preserved it.we briefly explain.
as we noted in jones i,to prove a violation of the fca under the provision in effect when jones filed his complaint,jones was required to show that the defendants knowingly present ed,or cause d to be presented to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,or knowingly ma de,use d,or cause d to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.jones i,at quoting a.in addition,any knowingly false or fraudulent claim must be material,meaning that it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing the nia decision to award the grant.id.at quoting united states ex rel.loughren unum,cir alteration in original.
jones argument appears premised on the conclusion that the jury was required to believe his theory of the case that killiany remeasurements constituted a knowing and purposeful manipulation of the data,and that albert turned a blind eye to that problem.jones case at trial was largely premised on three main indicators of fraud that killiany remeasurements had no justification,that killiany had become unblinded to participant categorization and only revised measurements of normal subjects,and that it was fraudulent to report the reliability results based on killiany first data set.u ndisputed evidence in the record established each element of his fca claim,jones asserts.
yet,on this record,the jury was entitled to believe the plausible explanation proffered by the defense that the ec is a difficult area of the brain to measure,and that killiany remeasurements simply reflect his increased understanding of the ec as he reviewed additional participants scans.indeed,except for jones himself,each witness involved in the study killiany,albert,moss,and gomez isla primarily supported the defendants explanation.gomez isla was unsurprised that killiany went back to remeasure some of the initial scans and testified that you could tell there was a learning curve and that one would get better the more scans you were going through and trying to draw.moss,who reviewed killiany scans after jones questioned them,similarly agreed that there was a learning curve and posited that as a researcher move s from naive to expert he hone s in on more consistency.albert and killiany also maintained that killiany remained blinded throughout the study.and sufficient evidence existed for the jury to conclude that albert and others either did not know that the reliability score was false,or that the underlying data was not fraudulent at all.
the jury resolution of such conflicting explanations of the defendants actions is within its province and is thus not fodder for a motion for judgment as a matter of law.the jury was entitled to and rationally could find persuasive the evidence at trial that undermined any conclusion that killiany remeasurements were fraudulent or that albert knew them to be so.
additionally,jones argues,essentially,that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the defendants did not call any of their own expert witnesses,leaving jones experts testimony uncontested.but contrary to these repeated assertions,testimony does not become uncontested simply because the defendants do not call their own expert witnesses at trial.the testimony of jones own witnesses could be and indeed,was considerably undermined such that the jury was entitled to question the import of that testimony.
for example,schuff testified that killiany original measurements were without major error according to the protocol,that killiany later changes deviated substantially from that initial protocol and that there was no scientific justification to make such revisions to some,but not other,scans.yet,the defense elicited a multitude of damaging concessions from schuff,including that he was not a neuroanatomist he had never attempted to employ killiany method to measure the ec he used a different protocol in his own lab which consistently produced a much larger volume in the ec and he had only measured the ec on an mri on fifty prior occasions and,when he did so,had consistently drawn the ec too short and too small.the jury could conclude that his testimony did nothing to counteract the defendants theory of the case.indeed,he conceded that he had no basis to determine whether killiany original or revised measurements were more or less accurate.
the jury could also conclude from the defense questioning of goldstein,the statistical expert,that his dramatic conclusions including his assertion that the statistical probability that killiany remained blinded while his six largest changes all involved subjects categorized as normal was out of million were unsound.goldstein hypothesized that he would have expected half of killiany remeasurements to increase from their original volume,and half to decrease,but agreed that he formed this opinion from a place of ignorance.indeed,although he found it particularly bothersome that killiany departed from the protocol,he conceded that he did not know what the protocol entailed or how killiany had explained his revised measurements.goldstein admitted he had no training in the anatomy of the brain or the ec specifically,and that,in arriving at his conclusions,he considered no evidence about why killiany remeasured the scans.finally,goldstein did not investigate whether killiany initial measurements were affected by systematic error which,he conceded,might explain killiany decision to remeasure.given these concessions,the jury would have been entitled to discount goldstein testimony altogether.
to a large extent,jones basic contention that undisputed evidence existed entitling him to judgment as a matter of law conflates the distinct inquiries that a court undertakes in resolving a summary judgment motion and a motion for judgment as a matter of law.our holding in jones i vacating the district court entry of summary judgment did no more than acknowledge that unresolved issues of material fact might support a verdict in this case for either party.but even if the defendants presented limited testimony expert or otherwise to rebut jones theory of the case,jones ignores that the jury may have found his witnesses and experts not credible or otherwise unreliable,or found believable killiany and albert alternative explanations for their actions.our review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict,crowe bolduc,cir,and here even if jones sufficiency argument had been preserved there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find in favor of the defendants.
motion for a new trial 
jones also argues that,for various reasons,the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.see.a a.a new trial may be warranted if the verdict is against the weight of the evidence or if the action is required in order to prevent injustice.jennings jones,cir quoting kearns keystone shipping,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court denial of a motion for a new trial.ambush,at.
weight of the evidence 
jones first contends that the district court inappropriately refused to the evidence and,had it done so,it would have determined that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence.in denying jones motion,the district court plainly concluded that the weight of the evidence supported the verdict.but jones suggests that,as a matter of law,the court was required to go further and independently the evidence,piece by piece,presumably engaging in its own credibility determinations and findings of fact,before denying the motion for a new trial.to be sure,when entertaining a motion for a new trial t he district court may independently weigh the evidence.cham station operators,cir quoting jennings,at emphasis added see macquarrie howard johnson,cir noting that the judge may consider the credibility of the witnesses who testified.but nothing in the text of rule or any of our cases suggests that the district court must do so accordingly,a district court does not categorically err whenever it declines to independently the evidence,so long as it concludes that the weight of the evidence supports the verdict 
jones then invites us to relax the standards of review under rule in the unique circumstances of this case and,essentially,weigh the evidence ourselves.but that proposal ignores both our precedent and common sense.our role is not to independently weigh the evidence w e reverse only if we find that the trial court has abused its discretion in making its assessment of the weight of the evidence.correia fenney,cir emphasis added.and this circumscribed review is sensible because c ircuit judges,reading the dry pages of the record,do not experience the tenor of the testimony at trial.jennings,at,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
simply put,we are unable to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying jones motion for a new trial for the same reasons already recited.there was ample evidence in the record for the jury to believe the defendants alternative explanation for killiany revised measurements and conclude that the defendants statements were either not false or that defendants lacked knowledge that they were false.
ii.reassignment 
jones also challenges the district judge decision to retain this case on remand rather than allow it to be reassigned to a different trial judge.district of massachusetts local rule k provides that upon remand the court must reassign the case to another district judge unless the terms of the remand require that further proceedings be conducted before the original judge or unless the judge determines that there will result a substantial saving in the time of the whole court and that there is no reason why,in the interest of justice,further proceedings should be conducted before another judge.to our knowledge,the district of massachusetts is the only district court in the country to apply such a presumption.see toby heytens,reassignment,stan.upon remand,the judge granted the defendants motion that the case remain before him.
we review the district court application of the local rule in this case for abuse of discretion.rodi new england sch.of law,cir.jones contends that the court failure to provide a written rationale for its order,alone,constitutes reversible error because he neglected to make the predicate findings that retaining the case would conserve judicial resources and not contravene the interest of justice.he does not point to any authority,however,requiring a written order.moreover,sound reasons supporting the court decision are apparent on this record.the defendants contended in their motion that in view of the court knowledge of the extensive record,its retention of the case would result in the conservation of judicial resources,and we can assume that the court endorsed this argument.given the intricate statistical and scientific evidence presented by this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reassign this case 
iii.evidentiary rulings 
jones also argues that the district court erroneously decided several evidentiary matters,necessitating a new trial.we review each ruling for abuse of discretion although any error is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.mcdonough city of quincy,cir.
a.the accuracy of killiany remeasurements 
jones first asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion in limine and permitting the defendants to offer testimony regarding the accuracy of killiany remeasurements.the district court resolved this motion orally,prior to opening statements,and questioned why the defense should not be permitted to assert that killiany was doing this for an appropriate reason.the court concluded that the explanation would not be precluded but invited jones to impeach it or suggest that accuracy is not the real reason he remeasured.as described above,the defense emphasized this explanation throughout the trial.
jones objection is essentially one of relevance.he relies on our statement in jones i that whether killiany measurements were more or less accurate than the initial measurements is not at issue,at,to suggest that such evidence likely misled the jury and prejudiced jones.but he takes our statement out of context.in jones i we merely rebutted the district court conclusion that jones claim presented a question of good faith,scientific disagreement not cognizable by the fca namely whether,in fact,killiany second measurements were more or less scientifically justifiable than his first.we did not indicate that evidence tending to show killiany remeasured his scans in an effort to make them more accurate was wholly irrelevant.nor could we have done so.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence in determining the action more or less probable,and t rial courts are afforded wide latitude in determining whether evidence crosses this low threshold,united states williams,cir.as established above,the defense alternative explanation for killiany second set of data was that he remeasured certain mri scans in order to more accurately reflect the volume of the ec in each subject.this explanation had obvious import in determining whether the data submitted to the nia was false and whether killiany and albert knew it to be false.it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to permit witnesses to testify about this alternative explanation,nor was such evidence unduly prejudicial,confusing,or misleading.see.
b.the appendix to schuff expert report 
jones argues that the court erred in excluding the full appendix to schuff expert report as inadmissible hearsay.during the course of the trial,a juror requested the appendix,which listed schuff assessment of the degree to which each of killiany remeasurements comported with the protocol that killiany developed with isla gomez.the district court did not abuse its discretion,however.the report was proffered as support for schuff conclusion that killiany second measurements conflicted with the protocol that is,for the truth of the matter.accordingly,the report is a quintessential example of hearsay.see.c.contrary to jones assertion,the fact that schuff testified at trial and was questioned regarding the bases for several of his conclusions regarding specific measurements does not automatically permit the entirety of his appendix to be admitted into evidence an expert testimony is not a vehicle by which evidence that is otherwise inadmissible may be introduced.presley commercial moving rigging.
testimony regarding jones signature 
jones next contends that the district court erred in allowing albert to verify jones signature on a form authorizing his inclusion as a on a article setting forth the results of killiany study.jones claims that the authenticity of his signature was a collateral issue.it is well established that a party may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a collateral matter.united states beauchamp,cir.to be collateral,a matter must be not relevant to establish a fact of consequence or,in other words,not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of the testimony of the witness.id.at quoting mccormack on evidence,at ed.
here,jones endorsement of killiany work by joining as a in that article was far from collateral.that article was written,and jones signature was allegedly inscribed,almost a year after jones first became concerned about killiany data.given jones central testimony at trial,whether jones continued to endorse the project after raising concerns goes to the heart of his credibility,and was certainly relevant to the jury determination of whether killiany remeasurements were fraudulent.
testimony regarding jones financial interests 
at various points during the trial the district court permitted the defendants to question jones regarding the share of any recovery he would receive as a relator under the fca.given that jones did not file his complaint until five years after he first raised concerns about killiany data and by which point the grant had been fully funded the defense sought to show that jones only made his claim once he was assured maximum recovery.the defense also elicited testimony from albert that jones compensation decreased when the project hired an additional statistician to address certain concerns of the nih regarding the project.
while in some cases it may prove inappropriate or unnecessary to delve into the financial incentives of a relator,in this case jones testimony and credibility were critical to the fca claim.b ias is fertile territory for,and because the jury must asess the credibility of witnesses to determine the accuracy of their testimony information as to bias can be of great assistance in making such determinations.udemba nicoli,cir.given the particular circumstances of this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting these lines of inquiry.it was neither unfairly prejudicial nor irrelevant for the defense to question jones continued support for the project until the funding from the nih ran dry 
iv.jury instructions 
finally,jones catalogs a multitude of instructional errors in laundry list fashion and,in most cases,with little to no analysis.we can make short work of all but one of his challenges.
we review a claim of instructional error de novo if the claimed error embodied an error of law,but only for abuse of discretion if the instructions purportedly inadequately explained the law or tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.united states jadlowe,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.error is established if the instruction is misleading,confusing,or incorrect as a matter of law,although we will only order a new trial if that error based on the entire record,was prejudicial.costa urena segarra,cir quoting romano u haul int l,cir.
first,the vast majority of the claimed instructional arguments are waived for lack of development.see united states zannino,cir.jones merely refers us to his proposed jury instructions in a perfunctory manner and unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation as to how the district court erred in excluding those instructions id.second,despite jones contention that his proposed instruction that whether killiany revised tracings were more or less accurate to the actual structure of the ec is not at issue in this case was not delivered by the district court,the court similarly instructed the jury that they were not asked to determine accuracy or to determine the borders of the entorhinal cortex.the court minor rewording was not an abuse of discretion.third,while jones objects to the court materiality instruction and argues that the court original instruction implied a but for causation requirement,any possible error was cured when the district court added,at the urging of jones and in line with our precedent,that a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to affect the thinking of the nih.see united states ex rel.loughren unum,cir.fourth,jones contests the district court decision not to provide an instruction that jones could prove knowledge by demonstrating that the defendants acted with deliberate ignorance.in fact,however,based on jones objection at the conference,the court instructed the jury that albert could be liable if she was deliberately blind to the alleged fraud.and jones counsel chose not to object to the instruction as to killiany,conceding that he understood the court ruling with respect to deliberate ignorance as it applies to killiany in the first question.
all that remains is jones objection to the district court decision to bifurcate questions of liability between the defendants on the jury verdict form.the court supplied the jury with a special verdict form that asked two questions first,whether killiany knowingly falsif ied scientific data by exaggerating certain of the ec to cause proof of a particular scientific hypothesis to emerge from the data,and,second,whether the statements made in the grant application about having used blinded,reliable methods to produce the measurements were both material and knowingly false.the court informed the jury that if you answer question no,but question yes,then killiany is not liable,but albert and the hospitals are.if you answer question yes,but question no,albert not liable but killiany and the hospitals are.
we confess that we do not see how this division of liability necessarily follows from the two questions on the verdict form.but despite our disagreement with the court charge,any error in the explanation of the verdict form was harmless.see allen chance,cir.the jury responded in the negative to both questions and that determination renders academic any error on the part of the district court that might otherwise necessitate a new trial.
iii.conclusion 
jones has had the opportunity to prese
