in this action under the all writs act,and the anti injunction act,we consider whether,following the approval of a federal class action settlement,the district court properly enjoined a state court action for legal malpractice directed at counsel for the plaintiff class for advocating the settlement.we hold that the in aid of jurisdiction exception to the anti injunction act can not form the basis for the district court injunction of the state court action,as the limited circumstances in which the injunction of an in personam action may be appropriate in aid of the court jurisdiction are not present in this case.on an issue of first impression,we consider whether the award of fair and reasonable attorneys fees precludes a subsequent malpractice action under the relitigation exception to the anti injunction act.we conclude that where,as here,the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the reasonableness of counsel representation,a subsequent malpractice action may be enjoined under the relitigation exception.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.the and class actions 
beginning in july,eleven putative class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york against computer associates international,computer associates or ca and certain of its and former officers and directors,alleging violations of the federal securities laws and generally accepted accounting principles gaap by order dated october,the district court consolidated those complaints into a single action,in re computer assocs.class action sec,cv tcp the class action,and appointed the law firms of milberg weiss llp and stull,stull brody as counsel for the class.the plaintiffs in the class action alleged that officers and directors of computer associates participated in a scheme to artificially inflate the price of ca stock,artificially inflate its reported revenues,and conceal the deterioration of its business.the class period in the class action spanned approximately six months,from january,through july.
between february and may,thirteen additional putative class action complaints were filed against computer associates and certain of its and former officers and directors,again alleging violations of the federal securities laws and gaap.by order dated july,the cases were consolidated into a single action,in re computer assocs.class action sec,cv tcp the class action,and milberg weiss llp and schiffrin barroway,llp were appointed counsel for the class the class period in the class action spanned approximately two years and nine months,from may,through february.in connection with the class action,class counsel decided not to conduct any discovery and instead elected to rely exclusively on the discovery conducted in the class action.
the government investigation 
in february,the united states attorney office for the eastern district of new york.and the securities exchange commission jointly,the government launched a joint investigation into ca accounting practices.in july,ca defense counsel in the government investigation,wachtell,lipton,rosen katz wlrk,informed the ca board of directors the ca board or the board that up to million of revenue was prematurely or improperly recognized in one quarter of fiscal year alone.wlrk further informed the board that anything less than an independent internal investigation would be viewed by the government as.as a result,the ca board authorized its special litigation committee slc to conduct an internal investigation.the slc then retained sullivan cromwell llp to assist in that investigation.
the class action settlement 
in early,with the trial of the class action approaching and at the direction of the district court,the parties entered into mediation.in august,following approximately seven months of mediation,the parties reached a global settlement of the and class actions by which the class members were to receive million shares of ca common stock,valued at approximately to million at the time of the settlement as its fee,class counsel would receive approximately million shares of ca common stock,valued at approximately to million.in return,ca and its officers and directors were to receive liability releases.
on december,the district court conducted a fairness hearing on the projected global settlement,as required by federal rule of civil procedure e.no class member objected to the settlement at the fairness hearing,class counsel stated that 
as we all are aware,there is a criminal investigation of ca that is ongoing,and i just wanted the court to understand,as we have stated in our papers,that we taken all of that into account in coming to the conclusions we did as to what would be a fair,reasonable and adequate settlement for the class members.
joint app x at.on december,the district court certified a single class encompassing the class action and the class action and approved the settlement.on december,the district court issued an amended order and final judgment the settlement order,which held that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate,awarded class counsel fees,which the court held to be fair and reasonable,and retained exclusive jurisdiction over the parties and the settlement class members for all matters relating to the se actions.
subsequent discoveries 
within months of the district court approval of the global settlement,several ca executives pleaded guilty to federal securities violations and obstruction of justice.on april,computer associates announced that it was restating more than billion in revenue.on september,ca general counsel,steven woghin,pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and obstruction of justice,and ca entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa in order to avoid criminal prosecution.in the dpa,ca admitted that many of its senior executives participated in a dollar accounting fraud and.
on september,the wall street journal reported that ca had improperly withheld boxes of documents the boxes during the class actions and the government investigation.see charles forelle joann lublin,in ca probe recovered,surprise cache of documents,the wall,at.although the boxes were not produced during discovery in the class actions,ca had turned over the boxes to sullivan cromwell in connection with the internal investigation in september prior to the approval of the global settlement.
the rule b motion 
in light of the foregoing developments,sam wyly and other members of the settlement class jointly,the wyly appellants contacted class counsel on october,and requested that they move to vacate the settlement order pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on november,class counsel declined.on december,the wyly appellants moved for relief from the settlement order under rule b.
nearly three years of discovery and motion practice followed.during that time,the district court ordered that the boxes be produced to counsel for the wyly appellants for their review.although the wyly appellants continue to attach great significance to the boxes on appeal,the attorney office and the slc stressed to the district court that the boxes rendered no additional evidence of fraud beyond that which the wyly appellants already had.joint app x slc report internal quotation marks omitted.
at a discovery conference on august,the district court dismissed the rule b motion sua sponte.the next day,the district court entered an order memorializing its ruling the rule b order,holding that the moving parties have failed to set forth cause to permit further discovery to be conducted in conjunction with the b motions.in re computer,wl,at.specifically,the district court concluded that in the three years since the filing of the original b motions in,the parties have failed to produce any new evidence of fraud upon th e court and have failed to establish that the contents of the boxes allegedly withheld during discovery warrant granting further discovery and reopening the settlement,wl at.the wyly appellants appealed,and on july,we affirmed the district court order on procedural grounds.see federman artzt,cir.
procedural history 
the wyly appellants filed an initial complaint in the supreme court of new york on november,and an amended complaint on december,alleging that class counsel placed its own financial interests before those of the class.the amended complaint,captioned wyly milberg weiss llp,asserted claims for,inter alia,breach of fiduciary duty,legal malpractice,unjust enrichment,and fraud.
on january,the melvyn weiss,milberg weiss llp,lee weiss,barry weprin,george bauer,iii,jules brody,schiffrin barroway topaz kessler llp,richard schiffrin,andrew barroway,stull,stull brody,and andrew barroway jointly,the appellees or class counsel moved in the district court for an order permanently enjoining the wyly appellants from prosecuting the state court action.the appellees argued that the district court holdings at the fairness hearing,its approval of the global settlement,and its dismissal of the rule b motion permitted the issuance of an injunction under the all writs act,barring the state court proceedings against class counsel.
on september,the district court granted the injunction and directed class counsel to submit a proposed order.the district court entered the proposed order on november,holding,inter alia,that this court determination of class counsel entitlement to fees necessarily determined the adequacy of their representation of the class members including wyly and collaterally estops claims of attorney malpractice or misconduct in connection with the settlement.barroway computer,cv tcp etb,doc.the district court further held that the state court action seeks to relitigate and nullify its findings as to the adequacy of class counsel representation of the plaintiff class,as reflected in the settlement order and the rule b order.id.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court injunction against the state court action was proper under the all writs act,and the anti injunction act.
the all writs act,authorizes federal courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.id.a.this grant of authority is limited by the anti injunction act,which bars a federal court from enjoining a proceeding in state court unless that action is expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.ret.of morgan chase,cir quoting.in interpreting the anti injunction act,the supreme court has directed that a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy.atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.
in this case,the district court held that a permanent injunction of the state court action was necessary in aid of its jurisdiction the in aid of jurisdiction exception and was needed to protect or effectuate its judgments the relitigation exception.we consider each of these holdings in turn.in doing so,we review the district court issuance of an injunction for abuse of discretion.ret.of,at.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its interpretation of the all writs act and the anti injunction act de novo.see also sims blot,cir explaining that the term of art abuse of discretion includes errors of law.
a.the in aid of jurisdiction exception 
under the anti injunction act,the in aid of jurisdiction exception applies where the effect of a state court proceeding would be to defeat or impair the jurisdiction of the federal court.kline burke constr.the exception is generally reserved for state court actions in rem,because the state court exercise of jurisdiction necessarily impairs,and may defeat,the federal court jurisdiction over the res.id.by contrast,an in personam action involves a controversy over liability rather than over possession of a thing.ret of,at.for that reason,an in personam action generally does not tend to impair or defeat the jurisdiction of the court in which a prior action for the same cause is pending.id.quoting kline,at.
the supreme court has never held that a district court may enjoin a parallel in personam action under the in aid of jurisdiction exception.id.citing vendo lektro vend,d we have never viewed parallel in personam actions as interfering with the jurisdiction of either court.we have recognized,however,that an in personam injunction may be appropriate under certain limited circumstances.id.in in re baldwin united,cir,we held that an injunction was appropriate where the district court had before it a class action proceeding so far advanced that it was the virtual equivalent of a res over which the district judge required full control.id.at italics added.but,as we have explained in detail,see ret.of,at,baldwin united involved a multidistrict federal securities class action on the verge of settlement.indeed,by the time the state of new york gave notice of its intent to file a state court action,eighteen of the defendants had already signed stipulations of settlement,which the district court had preliminarily approved.baldwin united,at.on those facts,we affirmed the district court grant of an in personam injunction,reasoning as follows 
the existence of multiple and harassing actions by the states could only serve to frustrate the district court efforts to craft a settlement in the multidistrict litigation before it.the success of any federal settlement was dependent on the parties ability to agree to the release of any and all related civil claims the plaintiffs had against the settling defendants based on the same facts.if states or others could derivatively assert the same claims on behalf of the same class or members of it,there could be no certainty about the finality of any federal settlement.any substantial risk of this prospect would threaten all of the settlement efforts by the district court and destroy the utility of the multidistrict forum otherwise ideally suited to resolving such broad claims.
id.at emphasis supplied.
we have since cautioned that c learly,our decision in baldwin united did not create a blanket rule or presumption that a federal court in any multidistrict action may enjoin parallel state proceedings.ret.of,at.rather,it was crucial to our analysis in baldwin united that most of the defendants had already settled,and that there was a substantially significant prospect that the other eight defendants would settle in the reasonably near future.id.at brackets omitted quoting baldwin united,at.we explicitly noted that if it should appear that prompt settlement was no longer likely,the situation would fall within the kline rule that in personam proceedings in state court can not be enjoined merely because they are duplicative of actions being heard in federal court.baldwin united,at.
in this case,the district court summarily invoked the in aid of jurisdiction exception but made no mention of the in personam nature of the injunction.on appeal,the wyly appellants argue that the in aid of jurisdiction exception does not apply,and that baldwin united is inapposite,because the state court action does not seek to frustrate,nullify or in any way undermine the settlement.appellants br.indeed,none of the claims in the state court action are duplicative of the claims in the federal class actions,and none of the defendants in the state court action were defendants in the federal class actions.the parties do not dispute that if the wyly appellants were to prevail in the state court action,none of the shares received in connection with the settlement would be returned,and none of the releases that the ca defendants received would be affected.the wyly appellants therefore assert that the claims in the state court action will have no effect on the settlement,and urge this court to vacate the injunction.
in response,the appellees argue that the in aid of jurisdiction exception applies because the federal class actions were complex,proceedings involving years of oversight by the district court,and the district court expressly retained exclusive jurisdiction over the parties and the settlement class members for all matters relating to the class action.joint app x both of these contentions are without merit.we have never held that a district court involvement in complex litigation justifies,without more,issuance of an injunction in aid of the court jurisdiction,and we decline to create such a rule here.moreover,in the retention of jurisdiction cases cited by the appellees,the injunctions were directed at state court actions where the terms or enforcement of the federal settlement were clearly at issue here,by contrast,there is no overlap between the federal and state court claims or defendants,so the case for applying the in aid of jurisdiction exception is much weaker 
on these facts,we hold that the limited circumstances in which the injunction of an in personam action may be appropriate in aid of the court jurisdiction are not present in this case.we therefore conclude that the in aid of jurisdiction exception can not form the basis for the district court injunction of the state court action.
b.the relitigation exception 
having determined that the in aid of jurisdiction exception is inapplicable,we now turn to the anti injunction act relitigation exception,which permits a federal court to enjoin a state court proceeding to protect or effectuate its judgments.the relitigation exception,which was designed to implement concepts of claim and issue preclusion,authorizes a federal court to enjoin state litigation of a claim or issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.smith bayer,d quoting chick kam choo exxon,d.in applying this exception,the supreme court has taken special care to keep it strict and narrow,id.quoting chick kam choo,at,because issuing an injunction under the relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery,id.at.indeed,a court does not usually get to dictate to other courts the preclusion consequences of its own judgment.deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court in this case,the new york state court.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.thus,the fact that an injunction may issue under the anti injunction act does not mean that it must issue.chick kam choo,at.see mitchum foster,d noting that the anti injunction act does not qualify in any way the principles of equity,comity,and federalism that must restrain a federal court when asked to enjoin a state court proceeding.
the preclusive effect of a federal court judgment issued pursuant to its jurisdiction is governed by the federal common law of preclusion.see marvel characters,simon,cir applying the federal common law of preclusion in a case see also taylor sturgell,d for judgments in cases federal courts participate in developing uniform federal rule s of res judicata,which this court has ultimate authority to determine and declare.quoting semtek int l lockheed martin,d wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure bayer.at.as the supreme court recently summarized 
the preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion,which are collectively referred to as res judicata.under the doctrine of claim preclusion,a final judgment forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim,whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.new hampshire maine,d.issue preclusion,in contrast,bars successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.id.at.by preclud ing parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate,these two doctrines protect against the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,conserv e judicial resources,and foste r reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.montana united states,d.
the appellees do not assert claim preclusion,first jersey,cir claim preclusion generally does not apply to a claim that arose after a suit was commenced,and instead focus their argument on issue preclusion,see appellees br.arguing that state court suit raises the same issue as previously decided.
the supreme court has listed the various requirements of issue preclusion on numerous occasions.without purporting to state a complete test,the court recently stated at least two conditions for a federal court decision to have preclusive effect first,the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.and second,the party to be bound must have been a party to the federal suit,or else must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.bayer.at internal citation omitted see taylor,at.the latter of these rules preserves the due process restraint against binding a litigant who has never had an opportunity to be heard.parklane hosiery shore,d.moreover,issue preclusion requires that the issue was actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment.taylor,at.quotation marks omitted.our summary of the four requirements for issue preclusion is in harmony with these various supreme court statements the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding the issue was actually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding the part ies had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue and the resolution of the issue was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits.marvel characters,at.
before applying the elements of issue preclusion to this case,we begin with a preliminary observation about the appellees argument.in the course of the federal class action litigation,the district court did not actually decide whether the appellees committed legal malpractice that claim was not presented,and therefore the court had no reason to address malpractice as such.the appellees argument is focused not on whether the district court previously adjudicated a malpractice claim,however,but on whether the court resolved one of the elements of a malpractice claim namely,counsel deficient performance.see ambase davis polk wardwell,a plaintiff alleging malpractice under new york law must show,inter alia,that the defendant attorney failed to exercise the ordinary reasonable skill and knowledge commonly possessed by a member of the legal profession emphasis supplied.if the appellees can show that issue preclusion prevents a future court from finding this element satisfied,then any malpractice claim that would require a finding that counsel performance was deficient is precluded under federal law.see parklane hosiery shore,d findings may bind the parties in a subsequent action at law.
we begin by examining the issue raised and decided in the federal class action proceedings elements one and two of our preclusion analysis.the settlement order held,inter alia,that the global settlement of the and class actions was fair,reasonable,and adequate,and that class counsel was entitled to an award of fees that the district court found to be fair and reasonable.whether an award of fair and reasonable attorneys fees necessarily decides the prong of a legal malpractice claim is an issue of first impression in this circuit we conclude that the prong of new york legal malpractice rule is identical to the issue that the district court decided as a necessary component of the settlement order.
even a cursory review of the allegations in the amended complaint belies the wyly appellants contention that the state court action does not seek to relitigate the district court determination that class counsel representation was reasonable.the amended complaint alleges,inter alia,that 
class counsel abandoned their fiduciary duties owed to the wyly appellants and the other class members by settling the class action prior to discovery.joint app x.
the class action was jettison ed to obtain a settlement that yielded pennies for the victimized public shareholders,but over million in attorneys fees for class counsel.joint app x.
