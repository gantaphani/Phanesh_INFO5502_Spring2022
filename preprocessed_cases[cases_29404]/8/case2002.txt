defendants county of nassau and nassau county sheriff department collectively the county appeal from an amended judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on march,judgment,denis hurley,judge,which ordered defendants to pay plaintiffs neville rangolan rangolan and shirley rangolan shirley collectively the rangolans a total of in damages,plus interest dating from october,on their claims for negligence resulting in injuries to rangolan while he was in the county custody,and a judgment dated october,judgment,arthur spatt,judge,which,inter alia,taxed costs of against defendants in favor of the united states marshals service marshals service or usms for the expense of transporting rangolan to and from,and guarding him during,his court appearances in the present action.on appeal,the county contends that the award to the rangolans is excessive and that the award of costs to the marshals service is unauthorized.the rangolans have from so much of the judgment as,in light of their acceptance of conditional remittiturs ordered in rangolan county of nassau,d,rangolan i,reduced to the jury award to them of.they contend that the jury award was not excessive and should not have been reduced.for the reasons that follow,we dismiss the we affirm the judgment awarding the rangolans plus interest and we vacate so much of the judgment as ordered the county to pay in costs to the marshals service,and we remand for further proceedings with respect to such costs.
background 
this case returns to us following a variety of proceedings,including a prior appeal,see rangolan county of nassau,cir rangolan ii the resolution by the new york court of appeals of a certified question of state law,see rangolan county of nassau,a remand to the district court for trial of a limited issue relating to the possible apportionment of plaintiffs damages,see rangolan county of nassau,cir.may,and entry of the judgment following the limited trial.
the events leading to the county liability to the rangolans are described in greater detail in the reported opinions cited above,familiarity with which is assumed.the events are described briefly below to the extent that they are relevant to the two issues remaining to be resolved here whether the damages awarded to the rangolans are excessive,and whether the district court had authority to require the county to pay usms the cost of transporting and guarding rangolan.
a.the damages awarded to the rangolans 
in march,rangolan was an inmate at the nassau county correctional center nccc.he had previously cooperated with law enforcement officials in the investigation of one steven king by participating in a controlled purchase of narcotics from king.after king was arrested,an official instruction was given and recorded in the nccc computer that king and rangolan should not be housed in the same dormitory.however,the prison official in charge of nccc housing assignments failed to notice that instruction,and on march,king was moved to the dormitory in which rangolan was housed.on march,king beat rangolan severely,inflicting head injuries that left rangolan in a coma for six days,necessitated surgery,and caused subsequent seizures and other ill effects.rangolan condition resulting from that assault is described in greater detail in part.below.
in june,rangolan brought suit against the county and others under and state law shirley asserted a claim for loss of consortium.at a jury trial in april,the claims were dismissed at the close of the evidence.the claims for negligence were submitted to the jury,which returned a verdict in favor of rangolan of for past pain and suffering and for future pain and suffering,and awarded shirley for loss of consortium.
the county moved for,inter alia,a new trial on the ground that the damages awards were excessive.the district court orally denied the motion to the extent that it challenged the award for rangolan past pain and suffering,and it reserved decision as to the other awards.in rangolan i,the court considered the jury awards of to rangolan for future pain and suffering and to shirley for loss of consortium in comparison to awards approved by new york courts for similar injuries,d at,and was persuaded that the jury awards deviate d materially from what would be reasonable compensation,id.quoting c mckinney.the court concluded that 
reasonable compensation for the residual fear of living with the possibility of having seizures,and the possibility of future seizures,coupled with headaches and depression,which latter symptom would be alleviated if the plaintiff were not in custody,is the sum of.
id.at.the court also concluded that the award to shirley for loss of consortium was excessive,and that an award of to her would be appropriate.see id.at.
in light of these conclusions,the court ruled that the county motion for a new trial would be granted with respect to the issues of damages a for rangolan future pain and suffering unless rangolan agreed to a remittitur of the jury verdict to,and b for shirley loss of consortium unless shirley agreed to a remittitur of the jury verdict to.see id.at.the rangolans agreed to accept the reduced awards.accordingly,the judgment was entered in the rangolans favor,awarding rangolan for past pain and suffering and for future pain and suffering,and awarding to shirley for loss of consortium.following proceedings leading to a determination that the county was not entitled to have the rangolans damages apportioned between itself and king,the judgment was entered,reflecting the damages awards made to the rangolans in the judgment.
b.the marshals service request for reimbursement 
in early,rangolan had completed his state sentence and,as an illegal alien,had been remanded to federal custody for deportation proceedings.thereafter,as discussed in greater detail in part.below,the district court in the present case issued writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum in order to have rangolan produced for trial and other court appearances.the marshals service brought rangolan to court for those proceedings and,while he was there,guarded him.
after the jury returned its verdicts against the county,usms submitted to the district court a request pursuant to and that the costs to be taxed against the county include to reimburse usms for transporting,guarding,and providing meals for rangolan in connection with his court appearances.see hearing transcript,august,at hearing transcript,september.hearing tr,at.the county objected,contending principally that there was no authorization for taxing as costs either the expenses incurred by usms or a party mileage or subsistence.the county urged the court to tax the usms costs against the rangolans because defendants were not responsible for rangolan detention.
the district court ruled that usms was entitled to be reimbursed by the county in the amount requested.the court stated that under,a judge or clerk of any court of the united states may tax as costs the following one,fees of the clerk,and marshal.hearing tr,and that under,marshals fees may include necessary travel in serving or endeavoring to serve any process,writ or order.hearing tr.the court also noted that regulations promulgated by the united states attorney general provide that usms shall routinely collect fees for process served or executed plus travel costs and any other out of pocket expenses,including the receipt,processing and transportation of prisoners held in the custody of a marshal or transported by the united states marshal s service under cooperative or intergovernmental agreements.hearing tr,and that there is an intergovernmental agreement id.the court rejected the county contention that usms reimbursement should come from the rangolans,stating that the prevailing party should pay costs,the tort feasor sic should pay costs and the defendant is the tort feasor sic.hearing tr.accordingly,the judgment ordered the county to pay the marshals service costs totaling.
ii.discussion 
on the present appeal,the county pursues its contentions that the awarded to the rangolans is excessive and that the district court lacked authority to tax costs against the county in favor of the marshals service.the rangolans have,contending that the district court order in rangolan i granting a new trial unless they agreed to reductions of the amounts awarded by the jury for future pain and suffering and loss of consortium constituted an abuse of discretion.
we dismiss the.when a plaintiff has agreed to a conditional remittitur order,he is not allowed to challenge it,seeking an increase of the reduced award,either by appealing,see,donovan penn shipping,d per curiam kennon gilmer,or by filing a,see,woodworth chesbrough.koenigsberger richmond silver mining.fiacco city of rensselaer,cir a line of decisions stretching back into the past century has established that when a plaintiff has agreed to a remittitur order,he can not challenge it either on an appeal or on a,cert.denied,d.the rangolans having accepted reductions of the jury awards rather than submit to a new trial,they can not challenge the reductions.
as to the county appeal,we conclude for the reasons that follow that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce the jury award for past pain and suffering or in deciding the extent to which the other damages awards should be reduced.however,the court lacked authority to award costs to usms except to reimburse it for a if usms served the writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum on immigration officials,its fees and mileage expense for serving the writs,and b so much of its expense in executing the writs,by transporting and guarding rangolan,as constituted overtime.
a.the reasonableness of the damages awards to the rangolans 
in an action brought to recover damages for personal injury under new york law,a monetary judgment is excessive if it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.c mckinney see f mckinney see generally gasperini center for humanities,d.a district court applying this standard reviews the evidence presented at trial in support of the challenged damage award and compares the award to other new york cases in which evidence of similar injuries was presented.presley united states postal service,cir see,gasperini,at.if the district court finds that the verdict,by this standard,is excessive,it has discretion to order a new trial without qualification,or conditioned on the verdict winner refusal to agree to a reduction remittitur.id.at.
where the basis for the remittitur order is the district court view that the award is intrinsically excessive,is greater than the amount a reasonable jury could have awarded but the excess is not attributable to a discernible error,see,kirsch fleet street,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the court should reduce the award only to the maximum amount that would be upheld by the district court as not excessive,earl bouchard transportation,cir,for one objective of a conditional remittitur is to minimize the extent of judicial interference with a matter that is otherwise within the jury domain,id.at see,johnston joyce,dep t mem.reducing award to maximum amount previously allowed for injuries of similar severity.r eduction only to the highest amount that the jury could properly have awarded is the only theory that has any reasonable claim of being consistent with the seventh amendment.wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed see earl bouchard transportation,at remittitur to the highest such amount is the most faithful to the jury verdict.
where the district court has decided whether to what extent the jury verdict was excessive,its decision is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.
within the federal system,practical reasons combine with seventh amendment constraints to lodge in the district court,not the court of appeals,primary responsibility for application of c deviates materially check.trial judges have the unique opportunity to consider the evidence in the living courtroom context,while appellate judges see only the cold paper record 
gasperini,at.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,appellate control of the trial court ruling is limited to review for abuse of discretion.id.at.
the damages awarded to rangolan for pain and suffering 
in the present case,the evidence at trial as to the injuries suffered by rangolan,which we view in the light most favorable to rangolan as the party in whose favor the jury found,included the following.as a result of king assault,rangolan was knocked unconscious,and emergency brain surgery was required.rangolan remained in a coma for six days.
rangolan testified that since undergoing surgery,he had suffered head pains and had heard voices,and that both of those conditions were continuing and had worsened over time.he was also suffering from depression.in addition,despite taking dilantin,an medication,he had suffered a number of seizures since the time of his assault.one of rangolan seizures caused a fall that injured his leg and back.in addition to taking dilantin to prevent seizures,rangolan was taking medications for depression and hearing voices,as well as for pain in his head,leg,and back.
jay rosenblum,a neurologist who examined rangolan shortly before trial,testified that the assault had caused a depressed fracture in the right temporal region of rangolan skull,an object had caused a bone in rangolan skull to break and be pushed into his brain.this caused cerebral hemorrhaging and necessitated emergency surgery.as a result of these injuries,rangolan suffered,inter alia,a cerebral concussion,syndrome,and cerebral encephalopathy,which can result in symptoms such as headaches,dizziness,irritability,change in personality,and change in habits,as well as brain damage.trial transcript trial tr,at.in addition,rangolan suffered from seizure disorder.rosenblum testified that,with such a disorder,you never know when you going to have a seizure.no matter what happens you can be in very embarrassing situations and get depressed there are social situations that become a problem.it has been thought that there are sexual difficulties that occur as a problem.trial tr.although not a psychiatrist,rosenblum opined that t his certainly is enough to make anyone depressed.id.
rosenblum testified that rangolan ailments will be permanent.the surgery had left rangolan with a scar that goes in a u shape over the ear and then ends in the temporal area just about the level of the eye on the right side,and the scar remained very tender at the time of trial,more than three years later.trial tr.rosenblum testified that t he likely scenario is that rangolan is not going to get any better.he is going to have these seizures.the frequency of the seizures is something that you can try to cut down.the brain damage is there that we see.the scar is there,so his prognosis is poor.trial tr.rosenblum testified that,despite regular medication,rangolan can have a seizure at any particular time.trial tr.even if a patient is seizure free for one,two,or three years,statistics say that he will have a percent chance of having another seizure even if he is perfectly seizure free for several years.id.and t he most devastating thing of all is that if you are going to have another seizure,you have no way of knowing when will it occur and where.id.
in light of the evidence,the district court concluded that the jury award of to rangolan for pain and suffering in the years between the assault and the trial did not deviate materially from what would be reasonable compensation.the county has not pointed us to any case in which a new york court reduced an award for past pain and suffering for injuries of severity similar to rangolan to less than.the county cites the new york judicial review of damages,which describes james state of new york,claim,see,as a case in which the new york court of claims awarded for past pain and suffering to a plaintiff who suffered significant depressed open skull fractures,causing cognitive impairment,hearing impairment on one side,facial nerve damage and weakness on one side,residual weakness in his limbs,and impaired balance and coordination.but that case reflects simply the amount that the trial court awarded it did not hold that was the maximum allowable under new york law.the county citation of cruz city of new york,dep t mem,in which the appellate division upheld a jury award,is similarly wide of the mark,for an affirmance of a verdict is not a holding that a larger verdict would have been impermissible.in short,the county has provided us no basis for a conclusion that the district court refusal to reduce the award for rangolan past pain and suffering below was an abuse of discretion.
with respect to future pain and suffering,the district court found that the jury award of deviated materially from what would be reasonable compensation but that rangolan ongoing injuries,primarily headaches and the risk of future seizures,warranted an award of.see rangolan i,d at.in reaching that conclusion,the district court reviewed several cases in which new york courts had found jury awards for future pain and suffering,resulting from injuries whose severity could be considered similar to the severity of those suffered by rangolan,to be excessive.in those cases,the awards allowed by the appellate courts ranged from to.see holland gaden,dep t mem.award of reduced to for fractured tibia,fibula,and glenoid martino triangle rubber,dep t mem.award of reduced to for concussion with resulting encephalopathy,contusion,damage to knee cartilage,chronic cervical lumbosacral sprain,and two herniated discs lauter village of great neck,dep t mem.lauter award of reduced to for serious arm and chest wounds,shattered jaw,facial lacerations,and nerve damage resulting in partial paralysis and disfigurement of face bartlett snappy car rental,dep t mem.award of reduced to for severe headaches and tremors that prevented the plaintiff from leading a normal and active life.
the county points out that in three of these four cases,the new york courts reduced damages awards to levels lower than the awarded by the district court here,and it complains that the district court awarded the highest amount allowed by the four decisions county brief on appeal at.that argument too misses the mark.as discussed above,the court should not reduce a jury verdict to less than the maximum previously held to be reasonable for injuries of similar severity.thus,if rangolan injuries causing him brain damage,continuing leg and back pains and headaches,a long scar on his head and face that remained sore more than three years later,depression,auditory hallucinations,potential sexual difficulties,and the permanent prospect of seizures that could occur at any time were not substantially less severe than those of the plaintiff in lauter serious arm and chest wounds,a shattered jaw,facial lacerations and nerve damage resulting in partial facial paralysis and disfigurement the district court could not,consistent with the seventh amendment,reduce the award to rangolan below the allowed in lauter.
perhaps in light of that principle,the county quarrels with the district court premise that rangolan has the potential for having other seizures,rangolan i,d at,and argues that if rangolan adheres to a prescribed schedule of medication,he need fear no seizures ever county reply brief on appeal at emphasis in original.the county hypothesis plainly does not take the evidentiary record in the light most favorable to rangolan.the testimony of rosenblum that even with regular medication rangolan can have a seizure at any given time trial tr.and that t he likely scenario is that rangolan is not going to get any better.he is going to have these seizures trial tr.supports the district court conclusion as to the probability that rangolan would suffer future seizures.given rosenblum testimony that the timing of such seizures is entirely unpredictable,rangolan condition plainly limits the feasibility of such activities as his driving a car,operating machinery,or even climbing a ladder.
we conclude that it was well within the district court discretion to find that rangolan future debilities were sufficiently comparable to those of the plaintiff in lauter to warrant reduction to no less than the award sanctioned in lauter.the award to rangolan of for future pain and suffering was within the district court discretion and thus may not be overturned.
the damages awarded to shirley for loss of consortium 
nor do we see any abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to reduce below the jury award to shirley for loss of consortium referred to at trial as loss of services,see generally millington southeastern elevator,the concept of consortium includes not only loss of support or services,it also embraces such elements as love,companionship,affection,society,sexual relations,solace and more.briggs julia butterfield memorial hospital,dep t mem.the essence of recovery for loss of services is to compensate for the loss of such elements as love,companionship,affection,society,sexual relations,solace and more millington southeastern elevator,at.
the cause of action for loss of consortium is designed to compensate for the injury to th e marital relationship and to the interest of the injured party spouse in the continuance of a healthy and happy marital life.millington southeastern elevator,at,at.an award for loss of consortium may include components for both the past and the future.see,patterson kummer development,dep t mem.geltzer leventhal,dep t mem.the fact that the spouses have lived apart during some of the period in question does not defeat the claim.see,rakich lawes,dep t.
in the present case,the complaint alleged,inter alia,that shirley ha d been deprived of the comfort,services,companionship and society of her husband.complaint.the trial record includes evidence that rangolan suffers from brain damage and depression rosenblum testified that rangolan injuries could result in irritability,personality change,and sexual difficulties.the district court concluded that,although the evidence of the actual impact on shirley was scant,some loss of companionship or society can be reasonably inferred from the state of marriage itself.rangolan i,d at.and the county,while seeking a remittitur of the jury award,conceded that clearly there is some loss here of society and companionship.hearing transcript,april,at.
the county has not called to our attention any case holding that a award of in circumstances such as these was excessive.indeed,in the district court,the county declined even to suggest any particular dollar amount to which it believed the award should be reduced,stating that the district judge was well acquainted with what would be appropriate compensation under the circumstances id.given the record as a whole,the county has provided no basis whatever on which we could conclude that the district court refusal to reduce the award to shirley below was an abuse of discretion.
b.the taxation of costs in favor of usms 
the county contends that the taxation of costs in favor of usms for expenses in transporting rangolan to and from court,and guarding him during those sojourns,was unauthorized by statute alternatively,it argues that if anyone should pay those expenses,it is rangolan,who was being detained through no fault of the county.the government,which,at the request of this court,has submitted a amicus that the award of costs to usms against the county should be affirmed it also argues that,if the county is not required to pay those costs,such costs should be taxed against rangolan.these contentions raise questions as to the types of usms services that may be reimbursed through the taxation of costs,the extent to which those services may be so taxed,and the persons against whom such costs may be taxed.
the services performed by usms in the present case 
habeas corpus ad testificandum is a writ,directed to the custodian of a prisoner,designed to have a prisoner brought to court from his place of detention testificandum writ.the text of the initial testificandum writ issued by the district court in the present case read as follows 
to united states department of 
immigration 
york county prison 
immigration department 
concord road 
you are hereby commanded to have the body of neville rangolan,inmate number detained in the york county prison under your custody,and that you deliver him to the custody of the united states marshal for this district at the united states courthouse,uniondale avenue,uniondale,new york,where he shall be held until he shall be delivered,under safe and secure conduct before judge arthur spatt of the eastern district court at this courthouse,by day of march,at in the above captioned civil action neville rangolan shall be kept under safe and secure custody by the united states marshal until the trial has concluded and as necessary,remanded to the custody of the warden,metropolitan detention center mdc,street,brooklyn,new york immediately upon the conclusion of the trial the united states marshal shall notify you and you shall return neville rangolan to york county prison in york,pennsylvania under safe and secure conduct.
writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum dated january,first writ italics added.in sum,the first writ ordered federal immigration officials immigration to deliver rangolan to usms for trial,indicated that until the trial ended rangolan overnight detention would be at the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn,and stated that usms would inform immigration when the trial was over and that immigration should then return rangolan to his place of detention.
in the interim between the issuance of the first writ and its return date,rangolan was apparently transferred to a federal immigration detention center in manhattan.the court second testificandum writ directed immigration to deliver rangolan from that center to the mdc on april,so that from there he could be turned over to usms on april to be brought to trial every day.see writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum dated march,second writ.
thereafter,the marshals service transported rangolan to the trial and related hearings on april,and i n accordance with the second writ,and again on august,in accordance with a third,posttrial,writ.letter brief of united states as amicus curiae on this appeal,dated february,united states amicus brief,at.the in usms expenses taxed as costs against the county was for time,mileage,and meals as follows 
for deputy hours at per hour 
in mileage,miles,at per mile 
for nine meals for rangolan at per meal 
statutory provision for taxation of costs in favor of usms 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides,in pertinent part,that 
e xcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the united states or in these rules,costs other than attorneys fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs 
d.although a district court refusal to tax particular expenses as costs against the losing party is reviewed only for abuse of discretion,see,japan airlines port authority,cir in re air crash disaster,cir see generally crawford fitting gibbons,d,the district court has no discretion to award costs not authorized by statute or contractual provision,united states merritt meridian construction,cir see,crawford fitting gibbons,at.
the term costs as used in rule d is defined in.crawford fitting gibbons,at.section expressly provides that costs may be awarded to the marshals service a judge of any court of the united states may tax as costs fees of the marshal.not all expenses of the marshal may be so taxed,however,for expressly lists what usms expenses may be taxed as costs.subsection a of that section provides as follows 
the united states marshals or deputy marshals shall routinely collect,and a court may tax as costs,fees for the following 
a serving a writ of possession,partition,execution,attachment in rem,or libel in admiralty,warrant,attachment,summons,complaints,or any other writ,order or process in any case or proceeding.
b serving a subpoena or summons for a witness or appraiser.
c forwarding any writ,order,or process to another judicial district for service.
d the preparation of any notice of sale,proclamation in admiralty,or other public notice or bill of sale.
e the keeping of attached property including boats,vessels,or other property attached or libeled,actual expenses incurred,such as storage,moving,boat hire,or other special transportation,watchmen or keepers fees,insurance,and an hourly rate,including overtime,for each deputy marshal required for special services,such as guarding,inventorying,and moving.
f copies of writs or other papers furnished at the request of any party.
g necessary travel in serving or endeavoring to serve any process,writ,or order,except in the district of columbia,with mileage to be computed from the place where service is returnable to the place of service or endeavor.
h overtime expenses incurred by deputy marshals in the course of serving or executing civil process.
a emphases added.
the government argues that the usms expenses for the hours,mileage,and meals were incurred for the transportation of rangolan to and from court i n accordance with the district court testificandum writs united states amicus brief at and thus were properly taxed as costs pursuant to a g see united states amicus brief at.subsection g,however,as shown above,authorizes the taxation of costs for travel expenses associated only with serving or attempting to serve a writ.and while this subsection may have some relevance to the present case,we reject the government contention that serving a writ either would ordinarily include,or was intended by congress to include,transporting a prisoner.
service of a writ refers to delivery of the writ to the person to whom it is addressed and to whom it gives an order or notice.see,united states mcmahon.construing service,as used in a predecessor of,as ordinarily impl ying something in the nature of an act or proceeding adverse to the party served,or of a notice to him.as a matter of normal usage,we do not interpret service of a writ to include performance i n accordance with united states amicus brief at its commands or goals.rather,we would describe conduct in accordance with a writ as compliance with or execution of the writ.service and execution plainly are not the same.compare black law dictionary ed defining service as t he formal delivery of a writ,summons,or other legal process,with id.at defining execution as t he act of carrying out or putting into effect as a court order.
further,the structure of a indicates that congress did not mean to conflate those two concepts.w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.duncan walker,d internal quotation marks omitted.further,a statute generally should not be construed so as to render a word or clause inoperative.bell reno,cir.subsections a,b,c,and g of a refer only to costs that may be taxed in connection with a writ serv ice there is no mention of execution.in contrast,subsection h,which will be discussed further below,refers to serving or executing emphasis added.we are constrained to infer that the omission of executing from subsections a,b,c,and g was intentional.and we must infer that the presence of that word in subsection h along with serving indicates that congress intended the term executing to mean something different from serving.
moreover,assuming that transporting a prisoner whose presence is sought by habeas corpus ad testificandum falls within the scope of executing that writ,our view that executing the writ is not the same as serving it is consistent with the ways in which congress has provided for marshals service fees and expenses to be taxed as costs in the past.prior to,the taxation of costs for services rendered by usms was provided for in part as follows the following fees shall be taxed and allowed to marshals f or service of any writ,for each person on whom service is made,first paragraph,plus f or travel to serve any writ,cents a mile,id.paragraph,and cents a mile per person f or transporting criminals,id.paragraph.plainly congress conceived of the service of writs and the transport of prisoners as different.the code not only placed the two tasks in different paragraphs,it provided that travel expenses for the two were to be compensated at differ
