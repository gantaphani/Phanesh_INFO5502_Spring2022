in this action brought pursuant to of the administrative procedure act,plaintiffs seek additional funding for fiscal years fys and from a grant program administered by the department of health and human services hhs pursuant to the ryan white treatment modernization act of.in a previous appeal relating to plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction,we held that they had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.on remand,defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs claims,arguing that hhs had awarded the funds at issue to other grant recipients.the district court verified that the pertinent congressional appropriations had,in fact,been exhausted,and held that plaintiffs claims are moot.
despite the seemingly harsh result,we agree with the district court.obliged,as we are,to avoid issuing advisory opinions,our authority is limited to live cases in which there remains a possibility that the court can grant some form of effectual relief.in an action such as this one,the scope of available relief is bookended by the government sovereign immunity,on the one hand,and the appropriations clause of the constitution,on the other.where,as here,the congressional appropriations relating to the funds sought by private litigants have been lawfully therefore a federal agency,courts lack authority to grant effectual relief in the context of an article iii case or controversy.under such circumstances,any decision on the ultimate merits of the dispute would be merely advisory,and the claims at issue are moot.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
congress passed the ryan white comprehensive aids resources emergency act of the ryan white act,or the act,stat,in order to make funding available for the development and administration of cost efficient systems for the delivery of essential services to individuals and families with hiv disease.part a of the act,titled emergency relief for areas with substantial need for services,directed hhs to award grants to localities that qualified as eligible metropolitan areas,or emas,pt.a,stat.at see also original definition of ema.hhs awarded grants to new york nassau and suffolk counties as a single ema in each year through fy.
fiscal year began on october.almost three months later,on december,congress amended the ryan white act by creating a second category of entities,referred to as transitional grant areas or tgas,which were to receive less funding than emas.ryan white treatment modernization act of,stat,see also.the amendments took effect in fy and contained a sunset provision that repealed the act effective october.see county of nassau,leavitt,cir 
hhs typically begins to notify recipients of grants under part a of the ryan white act on march of each fiscal year.with respect to fy,however,the agency informed on february,that it would be classified as a tga,rather than an ema,based on the amendments to the act.on february,a group of plaintiffs that included commenced this action to challenge hhs decision pursuant to of the administrative procedure act apa,plaintiffs argued that hhs had incorrectly classified as a tga,and sought declaratory and injunctive relief directing the agency to return the entity to the ema funding category.the district court denied plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction on march.county of nassau,leavitt,civ,wl,at.
following that decision,plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal with this court,see a,as well as a motion for an injunction pending appeal,see fed.we denied the motion for injunctive relief on may.almost a year later,however,we reversed the district court and held that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.see leavitt,at.
on remand,hhs conceded that was to be funded as an ema in fy,but defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs claims relating to fys and as moot.defendants argument was simple no relief was available because hhs had distributed the funds that were appropriated by congress for those fiscal years to other emas.the district court expressed concern about the extreme consequences of holding that plaintiffs claims for the and fiscal years are moot,and it denied the motion without prejudice in order to examine whether hhs had,in fact,exhausted the appropriations for fys and.
defendants then submitted an april,declaration from douglas morgan,the director of the hhs division that administers the grant program.the affidavit stated that,with respect to fys and,n o remaining funds appropriated by congress are available for obligation by hhs.based on that submission,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims as moot,reasoning that it lack ed authority to create special funding or their scheduled distributions for the upcoming years.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court conclusion that plaintiffs claims are moot.civil liberties union grandeau,cir.on appeal,plaintiffs mount a attack on the lower court decision.first,they argue that the absence of funding did not absolve the government of its statutory obligations under the ryan white act,and that the district court still had the authority and power to enter a judgment declaring defendants liable for the additional ryan white act funds that should have been awarded in fys and.second,plaintiffs contend that the district court also erred by holding that they could not seek compensation from the appropriation created by the judgment fund,a.at bottom,however,both of these arguments fail to account for the limitations on this action resulting from the federal government sovereign immunity and the appropriations clause.accordingly,for the reasons set forth below,we hold that plaintiffs claims are moot.
article iii of the constitution limits federal courts is,our subject matter disputes involving live cases and controversies.united states quattrone,cir.a number of justiciability doctrines govern the contours of this power pertinent here is mootness,which concerns when and whether a case is live.specifically,under the general rule of mootness,courts subject matter jurisdiction ceases when an event occurs during the course of the proceedings or on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party.id.quoting church of scientology united states,
an understanding of why plaintiffs claims are moot requires an understanding of the scope of the relief that was available to them in the first instance in this action against hhs and federal employees in their official capacities.absent an unequivocally expressed statutory waiver,the united states,its agencies,and its employees when functioning in their official capacities are immune from suit based on the principle of sovereign immunity.dep t of the army blue fox.this may leave some aggrieved parties without relief,but that is inherent in the doctrine of sovereign immunity.adeleke united states,cir.
in this case,plaintiffs escaped this bar by invoking of the apa,in which congress enacted a limited waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity for claims of legal wrong sustained because of agency action seeking relief other than money damages.id.the agency action plaintiffs challenge is hhs february decision to reclassify as a tga under the amendments to the ryan white act,and they argue that they are legally entitled to funding as an ema during fys and.and,as the district court understood,limited the scope of the available relief in such an action from its inception.plaintiffs therefore could only seek relief other than money damages.id.emphasis added 
in this regard,careful attention must be paid to the meaning of money damages in.the fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as money damages.bowen massachusetts,quoting.rather,in this context,the term money damages refers to compensatory relief that functions as a substitute for lost property.see id.at see also ward brown,cir.thus,sovereign immunity bars plaintiffs from seeking monetary compensation under.diaz united states,cir.as such,only functions as an effective waiver of the government sovereign immunity to the extent th
