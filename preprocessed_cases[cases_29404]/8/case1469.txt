this appeal was taken from a final judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,entered on february,in which the court awarded damages to michael fishoff based upon its finding that coty breached an options contract by retroactively valuing the company shares such that fishoff options were worth approximately half of what all other options exercised in november were worth.because nothing in the contract expressly authorized coty to arbitrarily and retroactively fishoff shares after he had exercised them,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
appellee michael fishoff was employed by appellant coty,a privately held corporation,which describes itself as a global beauty leader and the world largest fragrance company.fishoff served as coty chief financial officer from july until december,when the company severed its employment contract with fishoff.the facts of this lawsuit arise from efforts by the company,coinciding with the termination of fishoff employment,to reduce the value of his stock options.
when fishoff was hired in,coty provided him with an employment letter addressing his compensation package,including his eligibility to participate in the company incentive plan ltip or plan.in november,coty awarded fishoff a nonqualified stock option to purchase up to shares of coty stock at a purchase price of per share.approximately one year later,fishoff was awarded another nonqualified stock options at a purchase price of per share.in september,he received additional options with a purchase price of.and in september,fishoff received his final installment of options with a purchase price of per share.each of these awards was governed by the terms of coty ltip.
the ltip states,inter alia,that u nless otherwise expressly provided in the plan,coty board of directors,which operated as the committee charged with administering the ltip,retains discretion to interpret the terms of the ltip.pursuant to this discretion,the board may amend any terms of,or alter,suspend,discontinue,cancel or terminate existing awards consistent with the latest version of the plan as in effect from time to time.the plan further provides there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees,participants,or holders or beneficiaries of awards,and t he terms and conditions of awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.award is defined to include,inter alia,the types of stock options at issue in this case.
section of the ltip relates to the board discretion with respect to specific awards,providing,among other things,that the board determines who receives options and how many options each individual receives what,if any,restrictions there are on when those options can be exercised and how much the optionee will receive after cashing in,or exercising,the option.except in circumstances not relevant here,the ltip provides upon any valid exercise of an option or any portion thereof the respective participant shall be entitled to receive only a payment in cash equal to the excess,if any,of the fair market value,as of the exercise date,of the shares underlying the option or portion thereof so exercised over the aggregate exercise price of such option or portion thereof.the defined term,fair market value,means the cash value of the share underlying each option.pursuant to the terms of the plan,fair market value was to be determined by the board periodically the valuation date s,using a nationally recognized investment bank or other comparable valuation expert selected by the board.
in terms of the restrictions on the exercise of the options at issue in this case,the ltip provides that options may be exercised only on an exercise date,which is defined as the last day of any month,except the month prior to the month in which a valuation date falls.coty states that valuation dates were usually in march and september,but the ltip does not specify any particular date on which a valuation must take place.
the parties have not provided much color on fishoff relationship with coty,but it clearly reached a low point during his last months at the company.in september,the board determined that the fair market value of coty stock was per share.approximately two months later,fishoff decided to exercise all of his options and provided the company with notice of the transaction.because the november exercise date november,fell on a sunday,fishoff tendered his notice in person on monday,december,as he was entitled to do by new york general construction law section.the next day,coty confirmed that fishoff notice was effective for the month of november and they provided him with notice of the cash value for his redemption,which totaled.
three days later,coty changed course,and the board convened an official meeting on december to alter the established terms of the ltip.first,the board voided all options exercise notices that had been tendered in december,including fishoff,on the ground that the notices were late because they were not provided on or before sunday,november.second,the board decided there would be four valuation dates each year instead of two.third,the board redefined exercise date such that an optionee could only exercise options four times a year,on the fifteenth business day after each valuation.fourth,the board decided that january,would be the next valuation date,and if anyone wanted to exercise their options,they would have to wait until february.
four days later,on december,coty informed fishoff that his options exercise had been voided,because it was not submitted prior to the last day of the month.two days later,coty notified fishoff that his employment was being terminated.
fishoff consulted a lawyer about coty treatment of his options.that lawyer,apparently concluding that fishoff had a cause of action against the company,drafted a complaint on fishoff behalf,which fishoff forwarded to coty board.shortly thereafter,on january,the board convened again.
as the board actions during the january meeting suggest,coty developed a plan to avoid paying fishoff based on the fair market value of the shares.first,coty would agree to honor fishoff options exercise as a november exercise,though the company would not pay fishoff the per share he was entitled to as a november exerciser.rather,the board would authorize a special valuation limited exclusively to fishoff shares.thus,while everyone else who exercised options in november received per share,fishoff would receive some other payment amount.then,coty engaged a new bank,rothschild,to conduct a valuation that would set the value of fishoff shares as of november.on february,more than two months after he exercised his options,the board notified fishoff that rothschild had finally reached a dollar value for his options.fishoff was to receive per share for a total cash payment of approximately million,or million less than he would have gotten had he been treated the same as all of the other optionees who exercised options in november.
procedural history 
three days after the board decided to retroactively reduce the value of his options from to,fishoff commenced this lawsuit.his complaint alleged,among other things,violations of section b of the securities exchange act of,common law fraud,and breach of contract.shortly thereafter,coty filed a motion to dismiss the securities and common law fraud claims in fishoff complaint,which the district court granted because,inter alia,the ltip was not a security as that term is defined in the securities exchange act of,and fishoff failed to meet the heightened pleading standard required by federal rule of civil procedure b.
on july,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order applying new york general construction law section to hold that fishoff had timely exercised his options for november,even though he had not filed his notice of intent to exercise until monday,december.see fishoff coty,civ,wl july.new york general construction law section states that w here a contract by its terms authorizes or requires the payment of money or the performance of a condition on a sunday,unless the contract expres
