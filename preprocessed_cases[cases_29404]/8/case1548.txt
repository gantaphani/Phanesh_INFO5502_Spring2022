fredrik colting,windupbird publishing,nicotext,and abp,appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york deborah batts,judge granting salinger motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court judgment is vacated and remanded.
background 
salinger published the catcher in the rye hereinafter catcher in.catcher is a story about a disaffected boy,holden caulfield,who after being expelled from prep school wanders around new york city for several days before returning home.the story is told from holden perspective and in his own strange,wonderful,language.nash burger,books of the times,times,july.holden adventures highlight the contrast between his cynical portrait of a world full of phonies and crooks and his love of family,particularly his younger sister phoebe and his deceased younger brother allie,along with his developing romantic interest in a childhood friend,jane gallagher.while his affection for these individuals pushes him throughout the novel toward human contact,his disillusionment with humanity inclines him toward removing himself from society and living out his days as a recluse.he ultimately abandons his decision to live as recluse when phoebe insists on accompanying him on his exile.
catcher was an instant success.it was on the new york times list for over seven months and sold more than one million copies in its first ten years.polly morrice,descended from salinger,times,march.to date it has sold over million copies,westberg aff,influenced dozens of literary works,and been the subject of literally reams of criticism and comment,appellees br.literary critic louis menand has identified catcher rewrites as a literary genre all its own.holden at fifty the catcher in the rye and what it spawned,the new yorker.the holden character in particular has become a cultural icon of adolescent alienation and rebellion,appellants br,a moral genius who refuses to be socialized.menand,holden at fifty,supra.
inseparable from the catcher mystique is the lifestyle of its author,salinger shortly after publishing catcher,salinger did what holden did not do he removed himself from society.salinger has not published since and has never authorized any new narrative involving holden or any work derivative of catcher.westberg aff.other than a film adaptation of one of his early short stories,salinger has never permitted,and has explicitly instructed his lawyers not to allow,adaptations of his works.id.he has,however,remained in the public spotlight through a series of legal actions to protect his intellectual property.id.salinger has registered and duly renewed his copyright in catcher with the copyright office.
fredrik colting wrote years later coming through the rye hereinafter years later under the pen name john david california.colting published years later with his own publishing company,windupbird publishing,in england on may.copies were originally scheduled to be available in the united states on september.westberg aff.colting did not seek salinger permission to publish years later.id.
years later tells the story of a holden caulfield,referred to as c,in a world that includes c author,a fictionalized salinger.the novel premise is that salinger has been haunted by his creation and now wishes to bring him back to life in order to kill him.unsurprisingly,this task is easier said than done.as the story progresses,c becomes increasingly and able to act in ways contrary to the will of salinger.after a series of misadventures,c travels to cornish,new hampshire,where he meets salinger in his home.salinger finds he is unable to kill c and instead decides to set him free.the novel concludes with c reuniting with his younger sister,phoebe,and an estranged son,daniel.
in bringing this suit,salinger underscores the extensive similarities between years later and catcher.first,c is holden caulfield.c narrates like holden,references events that happened to holden,and shares many of holden notable eccentricities.appellees br.also,c adventures parallel those of holden.both characters leave an institution,wander around new york city for several days,reconnect with old friends,find happiness with phoebe,and ultimately return to a different institution.finally,within these broader structural similarities,the novels contain similar scenes,such as a climactic carousel scene.id.
salinger also cites defendants efforts to market years later as a sequel to catcher.the back cover of the united kingdom edition describes the novel as a marvelous sequel to one of our most beloved classics.westberg aff.in a interview in the guardian,colting describes years later as j ust like the first novel he still holden caulfield,and has a particular view on things.alison flood,catcher in the rye sequel published,but not by salinger,guardian,may.
colting responds that years later is not,and was never intended to be,a sequel to catcher.rather,colting claims that it is a critical examination of the character holden and the way he is portrayed in catcher,the relationship between salinger and his iconic creation,and the life of a particular author as he grows old but remains imprisoned by the literary character he created.appellants br.in support of this claim,colting first emphasizes that a main character in years himself,who narrates portions of the not appear in catcher.next,he explains how the c character evolves from a and absurd version of a holden into a real person with a rich life completely apart from catcher.finally,he relies upon the declarations of two literary experts.martha woodmansee,a professor of english and law at case western reserve university,described years later as a work of that pursues critical reflection on salinger and his masterpiece catcher just as do the articles that literary scholars conventionally write and publish in scholarly journals,but it casts its commentary in an innovative post modern form,specifically,that of a novel.woodmansee decl.robert spoo,a professor at the university of tulsa college of law,found years later to be a sustained commentary on and critique of catcher,revisiting and analyzing the attitudes and assumptions of the teenaged holden caulfield.in this respect,years later is similar to a work of literary criticism.spoo decl.
on july,the district court granted salinger motion for a preliminary injunction,barring defendants from manufacturing,publishing,distributing,shipping,advertising,promoting,selling,or otherwise disseminating any copy of years later,or any portion thereof,in or to the united states.salinger colting,d.in doing so,it found that salinger has a valid copyright in catcher and the holden caulfield character,absent a successful fair use defense,defendants have infringed salinger copyright in both catcher and the holden caulfield character,defendants fair use defense is likely to fail,and a preliminary injunction should issue.
the district court disposed of the first two issues in its decision introduction.defendants did not contest that salinger has a valid copyright in catcher.and regarding the holden character,the court stated that the character is sufficiently delineated so that a claim for infringement will lie.id.at.the court elaborated on this finding in a june,hearing 
holden caulfield is quite delineated by word.it is a portrait by words.it is something that is obviously seen to be of value since the effort is made by defendants to recall everything that the character in the book does it is difficult,in fact,to separate holden caulfield from the book.
special app.hr g tr.having found a valid copyright in both catcher and the holden character,the court concluded that there is substantial similarity between catcher and years later,as well as between the character holden caulfield from catcher,and the character c from years later,such that it was an unauthorized infringement of plaintiff copyright.salinger,d at.
the district court next concluded that defendants fair use defense is likely to fail and that therefore salinger has established a prima facie case of copyright infringement.in its consideration of the four statutory factors,the court found that not one supports defendants claim of fair use.id.at.
regarding the first factor,the purpose and character of the use,the court held that years later is not sufficiently transformative of catcher,the holden character,or salinger,id.at quoting campbell music.one recognized form of transformative value,the court noted,is parody,which requires a reasonably discernable rejoinder or specific criticism of any character or theme.id.at.the court found that years later does not parody catcher or the holden character,and although it might parody salinger,that is insufficient because according to the supreme court decision in campbell,at,parody must critique or comment on the work itself,salinger,d at.
the district court similarly concluded that years later does not have sufficient nonparodic transformative value.although years later comment on salinger himself has some transformative value,id.at,the court found that it is insufficient to render the work as a whole transformative for three reasons.first,according to colting public statements,his purpose for writing years later was not to comment on salinger but to write a catcher sequel.id.at second,salinger is a minor or supporting character in years later.id.at.and third,the ratio of borrowed to transformative elements in catcher is too high to render the entire work transformative.id.at.finally,the court observed that years later commercial nature further cuts against defendants on the purpose and character of the use factor.id.at.
addressing the second and third factors,see,the district court held with respect to the nature of the copyrighted work that catcher is a creative expression for public dissemination that falls within the core of the copyright protective purposes.id.at quoting campbell,at.it then found as to the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole that colting took well more from catcher,in both substance and style,than is necessary for the alleged transformative purpose of criticizing salinger and his attitudes and behavior.id.
the district court went on to conclude that the fourth factor,the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,weighs slightly in salinger favor,salinger,d at.the court acknowledged that years later is unlikely to impact the sales of catcher itself,but it found that an unauthorized sequel might undermine the potential market for an authorized catcher sequel,whether through loss of the novelty of a sequel or through confusion as to which of the sequels is the authorized one.although the court recognized that salinger has publicly disclaimed any intention of authorizing a sequel,the court noted that salinger has the right to change his mind and,even if he has no intention of changing his mind,there is value in the right not to authorize derivative works.id.
having made this determination,the district court turned to whether a preliminary injunction should issue.according to the court 
under rule,to obtain a preliminary injunction a party must demonstrate that it will be irreparably harmed if an injunction is not granted,and either a a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation,and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.
id.at quotation marks and alterations omitted.given its findings,the court deemed the only remaining question to be whether salinger had shown that he would be irreparably harmed if an injunction was not granted.because salinger had established a prima facie case of copyright infringement,and in light of how the district court,understandably,viewed this court precedents,the district court presumed irreparable harm without discussion.id.at citing abkco music,stellar records,cir.in a footnote,the court stated 
although defendants contend that ebay,mercexchange,undermines the validity of this presumption,that case dealt only with the presumption of irreparable harm in the patent law context,and thus is not controlling in the absence of second circuit precedent applying it in the copyright context.
discussion 
we hold that,although the district court applied our circuit longstanding standard for preliminary injunctions in copyright cases,our circuit standard is inconsistent with the test historically employed by courts of equity and has,therefore,been abrogated by ebay,mercexchange.
the copyright act of authorizes courts to grant temporary and final injunctions on such terms as they may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.a.and,as the district court stated,this court has long issued preliminary injunctions in copyright cases upon a finding of a irreparable harm and b either likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.see,nxivm ross,cir abkco music,stellar records,cir video trip lightning video,cir wainwright,wall transcript,cir 
thus,once a plaintiff establishes a likelihood of success on the merits,the only additional requirement is a showing that the plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if the preliminary injunction does not issue.and traditionally,this court has presumed that a plaintiff likely to prevail on the merits of a copyright claim is also likely to suffer irreparable harm if an injunction does not issue.see,richard feiner,turner entm t,cir abkco music,at hasbro bradley,sparkle toys,cir.
this court has applied this presumption in several ways.some decisions have interpreted the presumption to mean that a plaintiff likely to prevail on the merits does not need to make a detailed showing of irreparable harm.see,wainwright,at in copyright cases,if probable prima facie case of copyright be shown,the allegations of irreparable injury need not be very detailed,because such injury can normally be presumed when a copyright is infringed.robert stigwood group sperber,cir am.metro.enters.of warner.records,f d,cir rushton vitale,cir.other cases have discussed the presumption as though it applies automatically and is irrebuttable.see,rice am.program bureau,cir it is likewise well settled that when a prima facie case is made out a preliminary injunction should issue without the showing of irreparable injury bensinger,cir in cases of infringement of copyright,an injunction has always been recognized as a proper remedy,because of the inadequacy of the legal remedy.a few decisions,by contrast,have found the presumption rebuttable where the plaintiff delayed in bringing the action seeking an injunction.see richard feiner,at,toy,cir bourne tower records,cir.
under any of these articulations,however,this court has nearly always issued injunctions in copyright cases as a matter of course upon a finding of likelihood of success on the merits.mark lemley eugene volokh,freedom of speech and injunctions in intellectual property cases,duke,the ostensibly test collapses to a simple inquiry into likelihood of success on the merits.if that can be demonstrated,a preliminary injunction is the expected remedy.footnotes omitted.but see am.visuals holland,cir affirming denial of injunction because,among other reasons,plaintiff failed to show that money damages would be inadequate.
defendants do not claim that the district court failed to apply this circuit longstanding preliminary injunction standard.rather,they argue both that this standard is an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and that it is in conflict with the supreme court decision in ebay,mercexchange.we agree that ebay abrogated parts of this court preliminary injunction standard in copyright cases,and accordingly,this case must be remanded to the district court to reevaluate salinger preliminary injunction motion.in light of that holding,we need not decide whether the preliminary injunction issued by the district court constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.
ebay involved the propriety of a permanent injunction after a finding of patent infringement.the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia had ostensibly applied the traditional test for determining whether a permanent injunction should issue 
issuance of injunctive relief against the defendants is governed by traditional equitable principles,which require consideration of i whether the plaintiff would face irreparable injury if the injunction did not issue,ii whether the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law,iii whether granting the injunction is in the public interest,and iv whether the balance of the hardships tips in the plaintiff favor.
mercexchange,ebay,d,quotation marks omitted.in its application of this test,however,the district court appeared to adopt certain expansive principles suggesting that injunctive relief could not issue in a broad swath of cases.ebay,at.specifically,the district court found that the evidence of the plaintiff willingness to license its patents,its lack of commercial activity in practicing the patents,and its comments to the media as to its intent with respect to enforcement of its patent rights,are sufficient to rebut the presumption that it will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction does not issue.ebay,d at.the federal circuit reversed on appeal,applying a general rule that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged.mercexchange,ebay.the court cited for this rule richardson suzuki motor co,which equates the general rule with a rule that i n matters involving patent rights,irreparable harm has been presumed when a clear showing has been made of patent validity and infringement,quoting robertson united steel deck.
writing for a unanimous court,justice thomas held that neither the district court nor the federal circuit correctly applied the equitable factors 
according to principles of equity,a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a test before a court may grant such relief.a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has suffered an irreparable injury that remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury that,considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant,a remedy in equity is warranted and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.
ebay,at.although the courts below had articulated the correct standard,they had both,albeit in different ways,applied broad classifications that were inconsistent with traditional equitable principles.id.at.
this court has not directly addressed the scope of ebay and district courts in our circuit have split on ebay reach.compare,lennon premise media,d,holding that ebay only applies to permanent injunctions in patent cases,with microsoft aga solutions,d,applying ebay in a permanent injunction trademark case.two district court decisions have noted that the scope of ebay remains an open question in this circuit and have decided the cases before them without determining whether the ebay or standard applied.see gayle martz,sherpa pet group,d,warner.entm t rdr books,d.
we hold today that ebay applies with equal force a to preliminary injunctions b that are issued for alleged copyright infringement.first,nothing in the text or the logic of ebay suggests that its rule is limited to patent cases.on the contrary,ebay strongly indicates that the traditional principles of equity it employed are the presumptive standard for injunctions in any context significantly,after laying out the test quoted above,ebay cites two cases weinberger,which involved a permanent injunction after a finding that the defendant violated the federal water pollution control act,and amoco production village of gambell,which involved a preliminary injunction in which the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was violating of the alaska national interest lands conservation act,ebay,at.the court then looked to whether the logic of these cases should apply in the patent context.reasoning that a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied,id.at quoting weinberger,at,the court concluded that t hese familiar principles apply with equal force to disputes arising under the patent act,id.
moreover,the court expressly relied upon copyright cases in reaching its conclusion.in response to the federal circuit reasoning that the patent act right to exclude justifies the preference for injunctive relief,the court stated that the creation of a right is distinct from the provision of remedies for violations of that right.id.at.in support of this distinction,it noted that l ike a patent owner,a copyright holder possesses the right to exclude others from using his property.id.quotation marks omitted.it further noted that l ike the patent act,the copyright act provides that courts may grant injunctive relief on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of copyright.id.quoting a.because of these similarities,the court emphasized that it has consistently rejected invitations to replace traditional equitable considerations with a rule that an injunction automatically follows a determination that a copyright has been infringed.id.at citing times tasini,campbell,at,dun lumbermen credit ass.whatever the underlying issues and particular circumstances of the cases cited by the court in ebay,it seems clear that the supreme court did not view patent and copyright injunctions as different in kind,or as requiring different standards.
nor does ebay,as reinforced by the supreme court very recent decision in winter natural resources defense counsel,permit an easier grant of a preliminary than of a permanent injunction.first,as mentioned above,one of the two cases ebay relied upon in stating the traditional equitable test involved a preliminary injunction.see amoco,at see also id.at the standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success.second,in winter,the supreme court in fact applied ebay in a case involving a preliminary injunction.reversing the ninth circuit,which had preliminarily enjoined the navy use of sonar in training exercises based on a strong likelihood of success on the merits and a possibility of irreparable harm,the court stated issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.winter.at.and using broad,unqualified language,the court discussed the preliminary injunction standard as follows 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.in each case,courts must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.in exercising their sound discretion,courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.
id.at quotation marks and citations omitted citing munaf geren,amoco,at weinberger,at.
this court standard for when preliminary injunctions may issue in copyright cases is inconsistent with the principles of equity set forth in ebay.the supreme court decision in winter tells us that,at minimum,we must consider whether irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction,we must balance the competing claims of injury,and we must pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of.at quoting amoco,at weinberger,at.therefore,in light of winter and ebay,we hold that a district court must undertake the following inquiry in determining whether to grant a plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction in a copyright case.first,as in most other kinds of cases in our circuit,a court may issue a preliminary injunction in a copyright case only if the plaintiff has demonstrated either a a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff favor.nxivm,at see also,faiveley transp.malmo ab wabtec,cir.second,the court may issue the injunction only if the plaintiff has demonstrated that he is likely to suffer irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction.winter.at.the court must not adopt a categorical or general rule or presume that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm unless such a departure from the long tradition of equity practice was intended by congress.ebay,at.instead,the court must actually consider the injury the plaintiff will suffer if he or she loses on the preliminary injunction but ultimately prevails on the merits,paying particular attention to whether the remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury.ebay,at see also winter.at quoting wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure ed,for the proposition that an applicant for a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that in the absence of a preliminary injunction,the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.third,a court must consider the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant and issue the injunction only if the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff favor.winter.at ebay,at.finally,the court must ensure that the public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of a preliminary injunction.ebay,at accord winter.at.
the first consideration in the preliminary injunction analysis is the probability of success on the merits.in gauging this,we emphasize that courts should be particularly cognizant of the difficulty of predicting the merits of a copyright claim at a preliminary injunction hearing.see lemley volokh,supra,at when deciding whether to grant a tro or a preliminary injunction,the judge has limited time for contemplation.the parties have limited time for briefing.preparation for a typical copyright trial,even a bench trial,generally takes many months the arguments about why one work is substantially similar in its expression to another,or about why it a fair use of another,are often sophisticated and,and must be crafted with a good deal of thought and effort.this difficulty is compounded significantly when a defendant raises a colorable fair use defense.whether a taking will pass the fair use test is difficult to predict.it depends on widely varying perceptions held by different judges.pierre leval,toward a fair use standard,harv,see also campbell,at n noting that the fair use enquiry often requires close questions of judgment.
next,the court must consider whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction,and the court must assess the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant.those two items,both of which consider the harm to the parties,are related.the relevant harm is the harm that a occurs to the parties interests and b can not be remedied after a final adjudication,whether by damages or a permanent injunction.the plaintiff interest is,principally,a property interest in the copyrighted material.see wheaton peters,pet.but as the supreme court has suggested,a copyright holder might also have a first amendment interest in not speaking.see harper row publishers,nation.the defendant to a copyright suit likewise has a property interest in his or her work to the extent that work does not infringe the plaintiff copyright.and a defendant also has a core first amendment interest in the freedom to express him or herself,so long as that expression does not infringe the plaintiff copyright.
but the interests are relevant only to the extent that they are not remediable after a final adjudication.harm might be irremediable,or irreparable,for many reasons,including that a loss is difficult to replace or difficult to measure,or that it is a loss that one should not be expected to suffer.in the context of copyright infringement cases,the harm to the plaintiff property interest has often been characterized as irreparable in light of possible market confusion.see merkos chinuch,otsar sifrei lubavitch,cir.and courts have tended to issue injunctions in this context because to prove the loss of sales due to infringement is notoriously difficult.omega importing camera,cir friendly.additionally,t he loss of first amendment freedoms,and hence infringement of the right not to speak,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.elrod burns,
after ebay,however,courts must not simply presume irreparable harm.see ebay,at.rather,plaintiffs must show that,on the facts of their case,the failure to issue an injunction would actually cause irreparable harm.this is not to say that most copyright plaintiffs who have shown a likelihood of success on the merits would not be irreparably harmed absent preliminary injunctive relief.as an empirical matter,that may well be the case,and the historical tendency to issue preliminary injunctions readily in copyright cases may reflect just that.see tomás,what history teaches us about copyright injunctions and the requirement,cal,concluding,after a thorough historical analysis,that the historical record suggests that in copyright cases,legal remedies were deemed categorically inadequate.as chief justice roberts noted,concurring in ebay 
from at least the early century,courts have granted injunctive relief upon a finding of infringement in the vast majority of patent cases.this long tradition of equity practice is not surprising,given the difficulty of protecting a right to exclude through monetary remedies this historical practice,as the court holds,does not entitle a patentee to an injunction or justify a general rule that such injunctions should issue at the same time,there is a difference between exercising equitable discretion pursuant to the established test and writing on an entirely clean slate when it comes to discerning and applying those standards,in this area as others,a page of history is worth a volume of logic.
at quotation marks omitted.
but by anchoring the injunction standard to equitable principles,albeit with one eye on historical tendencies,courts are able to keep pace with innovation in this rapidly changing technological area.justice kennedy,responding to justice roberts,made this very point as to patent injunctions in his ebay concurrence.although the lesson of the historical practice is most helpful and instructive when the circumstances of a case bear substantial parallels to litigation the courts have confronted before,in many instances the nature of the patent being enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases.id.at.justice kennedy concluded that changes in the way parties use patents may now mean that legal damages are sufficient to compensate for the infringement.id.
finally,courts must consider the public interest.the object of copyright law is to promote the store of knowledge available to the public.but to the extent it accomplishes this end by providing individuals a financial incentive to contribute to the store of knowledge,the public interest may well be already accounted for by the plaintiff interest.
the public interest in free expression,however,is significant and is distinct from the parties speech interests.see pac.gas pub.utils.comm of.by protecting those who wish to enter the marketplace of ideas from government attack,the first amendment protects the public interest in receiving information.id.every injunction issued before a final adjudication on the merits risks enjoining speech protected by the first amendment.some uses,however,will so patently infringe another copyright,without giving rise to an even colorable fair use defense,that the likely first amendment value in the use is virtually nonexistent.
because the district court considered only the first of the four factors that,under ebay and our holding today,must be considered before issuing a preliminary injunction,we vacate and remand the case.but in the interest of judicial economy,we note that there is no reason to disturb the district court conclusion as to the facto
