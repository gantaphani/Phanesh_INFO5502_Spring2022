interdigital,along with two affiliated companies appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,denying its motion,made after a preliminary injunction was vacated by this court,to recover damages against an injunction bond posted by nokia corporation.interdigital main contentions are that the district court incorrectly concluded that the damages sought were not proximately caused by the injunction and that,in deciding this issue,the district court should have applied a presumption in favor of recovery against the bond.we conclude that both of these contentions have merit.however,we find that the district court did not resolve interdigital motion with sufficient clarity to permit meaningful appellate review.therefore,we vacate the order and remand for reconsideration and clarification.
background 
in september,in response to a complaint filed by interdigital alleging that nokia had infringed certain of its patents,the united states international trade commission itc initiated an investigation.months earlier,interdigital had filed a complaint with the itc against samsung electronics,and two of its affiliates,making similar allegations,also prompting an itc investigation.in october,in response to a motion by nokia,the itc consolidated its investigations involving nokia and samsung.in december,nokia moved to stay the consolidated investigation as to nokia on the ground that,pursuant to a agreement between nokia and interdigital,the two entities were required to arbitrate the dispute.in january,the itc denied nokia motion for a stay on the ground that its conduct in the itc proceedings,and in earlier related litigation,evidenced an intention to litigate rather than arbitrate the dispute in question.
the following month,nokia sued interdigital in the southern district of new york.specifically,nokia sought to compel interdigital to arbitrate the question of whether nokia had licenses to the patents in question to enjoin interdigital from participating in the itc proceedings against nokia pending arbitration and,in the alternative,to obtain a declaratory judgment that nokia held valid licenses to the patents.
in march,the district court granted nokia motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered interdigital to stay or terminate the itc proceedings against nokia,and to arbitrate the infringement claim with nokia.as a condition of obtaining the injunction,the court required nokia to post a bond.see.c the court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.
interdigital appealed the preliminary injunction to this court,and we vacated it.nokia interdigital,wl cir summary order.we concluded that nokia,through repeated,intentional resort to the judicial process to resolve questions about the scope of the patents and licenses in question,had waived its right to arbitrate those questions.we remanded the case to the district court,which dismissed nokia complaint in its entirety.nokia interdigital,civ,wl.
during the period when the preliminary injunction was in place,nokia and interdigital undertook to comply with it.nokia initiated arbitration proceedings with interdigital,and interdigital discontinued the itc proceeding against nokia and separately pursued its claims against samsung,which were ultimately resolved.interdigital alleges that it incurred substantial legal fees and expenses in connection with its effort to comply.consequently,after the district court dismissed nokia complaint,interdigital moved to recover against the injunction bond.
mainly,interdigital sought to recover attorneys fees and expenses incurred in moving to stay the itc proceedings,preparing to arbitrate with nokia,and deconsolidating the samsung and nokia itc proceedings.interdigital also sought to recover allegedly duplicative costs incurred as a result of litigating separate proceedings against nokia and samsung.the amount sought by interdigital exceeded the face amount of the bond.
in march,the district court denied interdigital motion in a order which stated,in its entirety 
on april,defendants moved to recover against the preliminary injunction bond filed by plaintiff.defendants argue that their attorneys fees are damages because they were caused by the issuance of the wrongful injunction.the court has reviewed the papers of the parties and finds that the defendants have failed to convert attorneys fees incurred because of the injunction into damages.c governs defendants right to recover upon a wrongful injunction,and the legal standard in the second circuit for rule c damages is the law of proximate cause.blumenthal merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir wrongfully enjoined parties are entitled to damages as may be shown to have been proximately caused by the injunction up to the amount of the bond.defendants have failed to show that their attorneys fees were proximately caused by the injunction.accordingly,defendants motion to recover against the preliminary injunction bond is denied.
on appeal,interdigital asserts that the district court erred in two respects.first,it erroneously shifted the burden of establishing entitlement to recovery against the bond to interdigital and instead should have applied a rebuttable presumption in favor of recovery.second,the district court incorrectly concluded that interdigital failed to establish the damages proximately caused by the injunction.
discussion 
presumption in favor of recovery 
we first consider the question of whether a wrongfully enjoined party is entitled to a presumption in favor of recovery against a bond posted pursuant to rule c,a question of first impression in this circuit.as a preliminary matter,we note that a district court decision to grant or deny recovery against an injunction bond is,generally stated,reviewed for abuse of discretion.however,because we hold that wrongfully enjoined parties are entitled to a presumption in favor of recovery against the bond for provable damages,the court discretion should be exercised in a manner consistent with this presumption.see coyne delany,capital dev.bd.of,cir.the resulting standard amounts to stricter review along the sliding scale of the abuse of discretion standard.global naps,verizon new,cir see also coyne delany,at when rules prescribe a course of action as the norm but allow the district court to deviate from it,the court discretion is more limited than it would be if the rules were nondirective.
we conclude that a presumption in favor of recovery is warranted for several reasons.rule c bond requirement serves a number of functions.it assures the enjoined party that it may readily collect damages from the funds posted in the event that it was wrongfully enjoined,and that it may do so without further litigation and without regard to the possible insolvency of the plaintiff.see continuum,incepts,cir.in addition,the bond provides the plaintiff with notice of the maximum extent of its potential liability.see see also alliance bond fund,grupo mexicano de desarrollo,cir t he applicant for the injunction consents to liability up to the amount of the bond,as the price for the injunction.quoting blumenthal merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir alterations omitted.as this court has previously explained 
th e injunction bond rule has its origin in early equity practice.the chancellor had limited authority to award damages directly,but had broad discretion to frame orders granting injunctions.the practice grew up of conditioning the grant of a preliminary injunction on a plaintiff agreement to post a bond to cover any damages that might result if it were later determined that plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction.
