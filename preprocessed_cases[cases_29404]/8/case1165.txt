background 
a the cheyne siv 
we view all disputed facts and inferences fairly drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to appellants.salamon v.our lady of victory,cir.
the present dispute arose out of the collapse of the cheyne siv,a structured investment vehicle siv that was managed by cheyne capital cheyne a defendant but not a party to this appeal and structured by appellee morgan stanley.cheyne siv was launched in and issued several classes of notes amounting to several billion dollars,before its demise in.the notes had different maturities,return rates,and risk profiles.because of the complexity of the siv,the notes could be purchased only by sophisticated institutional investors.three specific notes are at issue senior commercial paper notes,senior medium term notes,and mezzanine capital notes.all of them were given high ratings the senior notes received higher ratings by the ratings agencies named as defendants standard poor ratings services and the mcgraw hill companies,s p and moody investors service,and its subsidiary moody investors service.
morgan stanley included those ratings in selling documents distributed to potential investors.according to appellants,the ratings were unreliable because they were based on outdated models and data.the ratings agencies are alleged to have known of this unreliability.it is also alleged that the use of unreliable models was caused by morgan stanley demand for high ratings.thus,according to the complaint,the cheyne siv as a whole received a rating despite being loaded with very risky assets,including a significant profile of subprime residential securities.as is well known,the housing market collapsed in the summer of.the siv collapsed with it and declared bankruptcy in the fall of.
b procedural history 
following cheyne collapse,this lawsuit was filed as a putative class action by abu dhabi commercial bank adcb on august.adcb complaint alleged common law fraud under new york law and based federal subject matter jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship under a.two additional plaintiffs later joined.they eventually moved for class certification on the common law fraud claims seeking to represent a class of all investors in the cheyne siv who purchased notes during a class period from october to october.the district court denied that motion,holding that plaintiffs failed to establish numerosity and the predominance of common issues.interlocutory review was denied.plaintiffs counsel were then allowed to contact other investors,which led to the addition of twelve new plaintiffs,including commerzbank and psers.
in january,appellants filed the complaint operative for purposes of this appeal.appellees responded with motions to dismiss and for summary judgment on the claims shortly thereafter.in their motion for summary judgment,appellees raised,inter alia,the issues before us on appeal whether commerzbank had acquired from the original purchaser of some of the notes the purchaser fraud claim against morgan stanley,and whether morgan stanley had made actionable misrepresentations.
in responding to the motion for summary judgment,all fifteen plaintiffs,including appellants,were limited by the district court to a single reliance declaration necessary to establish the reliance of each plaintiff on the alleged misstatements as required to support a valid fraud claim under new york law.with regard to commerzbank claim,that declaration stated that commerzbank had acquired dresdner bank ag dresdner through a merger in,and that dresdner had earlier purchased cheyne siv notes from allianz dresdner daily asset fund daf,the original purchaser,at par face value after which daf was wound down.the declaration further stated that,under german law,all of dresdner assets,liabilities,rights and obligations passed automatically by operation of law to commerzbank.
on august,the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment in part.as relevant to this appeal,the court held that commerzbank had failed to establish standing to sue under new york law.it held that,for a subsequent holder of a note to have standing to sue entities involved in the issuance of the note for torts committed in the issuance,the prior holder of a note must assign its tort claims at the time of transfer,and that a simple transfer of the note did not assign those claims.the court determined that commerzbank statement in the reliance declaration had not shown that dresdner acquired daf tort claims through the transfer and merger.commerzbank claims were,therefore,dismissed.the court did not reach appellees argument that daf had not reasonably relied on the cheyne siv credit ratings.
the district court also dismissed claims against morgan stanley for fraud on the grounds that the only misstatements alleged were made by the ratings agencies themselves and that these were not attributable to morgan stanley.therefore,the court reasoned,morgan stanley could not be held liable for fraud based on misstatements under new york law.
commerzbank moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of its fraud claims.attached to the motion was a new declaration williams declaration that explained the transfer of rights from daf to dresdner to commerzbank.ten days later,commerzbank also filed a.a ratification of its claim and another declaration shlissel declaration.these documents were a far more thorough explanation of how daf was unable,and could not have intended,to retain any interest in the notes,including a right to sue.the court refused to consider the two documents because they were untimely and denied reconsideration.
in november,appellees discovered that psers had previously represented that it was an arm of the state of pennsylvania now conceded and not a citizen of that or any state,as required by a.see infra.appellees accordingly moved to dismiss either psers claims,or the entire action,because psers presence as a plaintiff destroyed complete diversity.the district court held that did not permit supplemental jurisdiction over a party claims where jurisdiction was based on diversity,even where that party was permissively joined,as psers was,under.the court therefore dismissed psers from the action to preserve its subject matter jurisdiction.
all plaintiffs other than appellants agreed to settle following mediation.the action was dismissed with prejudice,and the court entered a.b final judgment incorporating its previous dismissals of psers and commerzbank.this appeal followed.
discussion 
a dismissal of psers as a non diverse plaintiff 
there being no disputed facts,psers dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo.salamon,at.
subject matter jurisdiction is based on which requires complete diversity,all plaintiffs must be citizens of states diverse from those of all defendants.exxon mobil allapattah,d.the party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of proof.ditolla doral dental ipa of,cir.
as an arm of the state of pennsylvania,psers concedes that it is not a citizen of any state.therefore,it can not be diverse for purposes of section.moor cnty.of alameda,d the arm or alter ego of a state is not a citizen for diversity purposes quoting state hwy.comm of utah constr.
psers nonetheless claims that the district court had supplemental jurisdiction under,which permits the exercise of diversity jurisdiction over related claims,includ ing claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties,subject to relevant statutory exceptions.a.the issue is whether psers inclusion as a party is consistent with section b,an exception preventing the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over joined parties in diversity cases when their inclusion would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
in exxon,the supreme court considered the question of whether the section b exception prevented supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs who failed to meet the section requirement,and held that it did not.at.in its discussion,the supreme court articulated a contamination theory governing the interaction of sections and.in explaining the theory,the court noted that,while original jurisdiction may not literally be required over each individual plaintiff,the view that the inclusion of a party somehow contaminates every other claim in the complaint,depriving the court of original jurisdiction can make some sense in the special context of the complete diversity requirement because it eliminates the justification for providing a federal forum.id.at.
we elaborated on the contamination theory in merrill lynch allegheny energy,cir.our discussion there stated 
exxon makes clear that its expansive interpretation of does not extend to additional parties whose presence defeats diversity.the reason for the different treatment of these two requirements is found in their differing purposes.the purpose of the requirement,on one hand,is fulfilled by a single claim of sufficient importance to warrant a federal forum and is not negated by additional,smaller claims.a failure of diversity,on the other hand,contaminates the action,so to speak,and takes away any justification for providing a federal forum.
it follows that a defect of the latter sort eliminates every claim in the action,including any jurisdictionally proper action that might otherwise have anchored original jurisdiction,and removes the civil action from the purview of altogether.further,it is clear that a party joined after the action is underway may catalyze loss of jurisdiction.
id.all internal citations and quotations omitted.this discussion thus adopts the line hinted at in exxon,namely,that while the requirement is somewhat malleable,complete diversity of all parties is an absolute,prerequisite to federal subject matter jurisdiction.we follow this rationale and hold that psers dismissal was proper,because inclusion of its claim destroyed complete diversity and would have otherwise catalyze d loss of federal jurisdiction.id.
psers attempts to distinguish merrill lynch by noting that it,psers,was permissively joined as a plaintiff under,while merrill lynch involved compulsory joinder of a defendant under rule.it further seeks to explain away exxon discussion as dicta.we concede that psers argument for a distinction between parties permissibly and compulsorily joined is not without some appeal.moreover,on these particular facts,the contamination theory is less obviously applicable because psers is not but is simply not a citizen.and,because it is the arm of a state,there is an arguable need for a federal forum.
nonetheless,the discussions of complete diversity in exxon and merrill lynch follow a long line of cases holding that the jurisdictional requirements of diversity should track easily adjudicated bright lines following section a language of between citizens of different states.weighing the need in particular cases for a federal forum is not subject to bright lines at all and is in tension with the statutory language,which omits consideration of such a need.we,therefore,hold that federal subject matter jurisdiction under section a requires complete diversity of all parties,regardless of how they joined the action.we note that in addition to being sensible and workable,this rule tracks the statutory language,follows merrill lynch,and accords with a decision of the circuit,see in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust,holding that the circuit absolute,complete diversity requirement remained intact after exxon 
we thus affirm the dismissal of psers claim.
b denial of class certification 
district courts denials of motions for class certification are reviewed for abuse of discretion.teamsters local freight div.pension fund bombardier,cir.the party seeking certification must establish the.requirements by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.
under rule,a movant seeking certification of a class must establish i numerosity,ii commonality,iii typicality,and iv adequacy.a id.at.the district court analysis of the rule factors determined that appellants had failed to demonstrate either numerosity or the predominance of common issues.b.it did not abuse its discretion in doing so.
numerosity is presumed for classes larger than forty members.consol.rail town of hyde park,cir.appellants submitted evidence of the existence of over potential class members based on the number of investors who purchased the various siv notes.however,the numerosity inquiry is not strictly mathematical but must take into account the context of the particular case,in particular whether a class is superior to joinder based on other relevant factors including i judicial economy,ii geographic dispersion,iii the financial resources of class members,iv their ability to sue separately,and v requests for injunctive relief that would involve future class members.robidoux celani,cir.
the district court concluded that the robidoux factors weigh heavily in favor of concluding that joinder is not impracticable.specifically,the class was limited and identifiable,and composed of sophisticated siv investors,all of whom had millions of dollars at stake and were able to pursue their own claims.
appellants contend that this determination was error because the court failed to resolve a dispute over the class size,and because the class was simply too large not to be certified on that basis.although the purported class was large and relatively diverse geographically,the district court was within its discretion to conclude that the size,sophistication,and individual stakes of the parties counseled in favor of joinder.see id.at determination of practicability of joinder depends on all the circumstances surrounding a case,not on mere numbers.accord deen new sch,civ.kmw,wl,at,denying certification to a putative class of where plaintiffs provide d no evidence that joinder would be difficult to accomplish,or would be somehow less efficient than class certification ansari,denying certification despite geographic dispersion where the identity of the potential plaintiffs was known and the potential class members likely had the financial resources to individually bring suit.we would add that,given the different classes of notes,and their differences in maturity dates,rates of return,and,the efficiencies available through class certification are less than the number of potential class members would make them appear.
appellants argument regarding commonality is based on a relatively recently created theory,i,that but for the defendant fraud,no market for the notes would have existed at all.the district court rejected this theory and determined that the putative class members would face differing individual issues of reliance,loss causation,and damages.see amgen.ret.plans trust funds,d absence of theory would ordinarily preclude certification of a class action seeking money damages because individual reliance issues would overwhelm questions common to the class.
the theory is a matter of first impression for us but has been rejected or questioned by four other circuits.see nuveen mun.high income opportunity fund city of alameda,cir malack bdo seidman llp,cir ockerman may zima,cir eckstein balcor f
