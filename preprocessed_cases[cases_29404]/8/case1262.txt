t he taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.litigants,moreover,have a responsibility to monitor the docket for the entry of orders they may wish to appeal nevertheless,the federal rules provide some assistance to litigants in meeting the necessary deadlines.federal rule of civil procedure d requires the clerk to send notice of the entry of judgment to the parties,and federal rule of appellate procedure a permits a district court to reopen the time within which to file an appeal in circumstances in which the litigant does not receive or receives too late this notice but a district court latitude to relieve litigants of the consequences of failures to file timely notices of appeal is not boundless.
this case presents the question whether the united states district court for the southern district of new york properly granted relief under rule a to appellant communications network international,cni when it claimed that it never received the civil rule d notice and therefore failed to file a timely notice of appeal.we agree with the district court that cni met the express preconditions of rule a.nevertheless,we hold that relief under that rule is discretionary and its grant in this case was inappropriate.the failure to receive civil rule d notice was entirely and indefensibly the fault of cni counsel.granting relief in such circumstances was at odds with the purposes and structure of the procedural scheme.accordingly,we reverse the order granting the motion to reopen and dismiss cni appeal as untimely.
this litigation has had a long history,but it suffices here to summarize only the critical aspects.
bankruptcy court proceedings 
worldcom,filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy in.mci worldcom communications,mci,an affiliate,subsequently commenced an adversary proceeding against cni in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york,in essence to recover for allegedly unpaid telecommunications services.cni counterclaimed for fraud,intentional nondisclosure,breach of contract,and defamation and sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
on march,the bankruptcy court,insofar as is relevant here,granted mci motion for judgment on the pleadings to the extent that it dismissed cni counterclaims,but denied the motion to the extent that mci sought recovery on its claim for unpaid services.it granted cni motion to file responses to the unanswered portions of the complaint nunc pro tunc and denied cni cross motion for judgment on the pleadings on its counterclaims on july,the bankruptcy court granted mci motion for summary judgment to the extent of determining that cni had breached its contract,but denied it as to the quantum of damages some months later,it struck cni demand for a jury trial on damages and tried the damages issue,ultimately awarding mci damages,interest and attorney fees aggregating more than million cni appealed from a number of the bankruptcy court orders,and the appeals were consolidated by the district court.
district court proceedings 
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court rulings in a memorandum decision on september,judgment was entered on september,the rulings were entered on the electronic docket,and notice thereof automatically was emailed to cni sole counsel of record,mark mullineaux,at the email address which mullineaux previously had registered with the clerk office for the purpose of receiving such notifications on the southern district of new york case case filing or ecf system 
in september,mullineaux filed a motion to appear pro hac vice in this case which the district court granted in january both the motion and the district court order listed a new email address for mullineaux.but mullineaux did not revise his contact information or profile on the ecf system to reflect the new email address,and all notifications in the case prior to and including the notice of entry of judgment were sent to the registered address,wmmullineaux.com 
on november,days after the entry of the judgment and days after the entry of the memorandum decision and order,cni filed a notice of appeal from both.by then,the time within which to file such a notice of appeal had expired.while the time within which cni could have moved pursuant to rule a for extension of the time within which to file a notice of appeal had not run,cni did not make such a motion.on that date,district court records reflect,mullineaux updated his email address on the ecf system,and all subsequent filings in the case were sent to mmullineaux.com.
mci then moved in this court on december,to dismiss the appeal.on december,cni moved in the district court for an order,pursuant to rule a,reopening the time within which to file a notice of appeal.it argued such relief was appropriate because its counsel had not received notice of the filing of the memorandum decision or of the judgment at his current email address.
on january,the district court concluded that cni had not received timely notice of its affirmance of the bankruptcy court orders under civil rule d because the clerk office had sent electronic notifications to the registered but outdated email address,that mci had not demonstrated that service of that order had been effected,and that mci had shown no prejudice.on this basis,it granted the motion on february,mci filed a cross appeal from this ruling.in light of the pendency of the cross appeal,mci moved on february,to withdraw its motion to dismiss cni appeal,and this court granted the withdrawal on february.cni appeal and mci cross appeal were consolidated before this court.
under rule,notices of appeal in most civil cases must be filed within thirty days of the entry of judgment civil rule requires that the clerk,immediately after entering an order or judgment,serve notice of the entry,as provided in civil rule b,on each party who is not in default.but this notice is provided merely for the convenience of litigants.in particular,l ack of notice of the entry does not affect the time for appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed,except as allowed by federal rule of appellate procedure a.
rule a has two separate provisions in this regard rules a and a.rule a provides that the district court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal if the party moves no later than thirty days after the time to file prescribed by rule a expires and shows excusable neglect or good cause.the extension may not exceed thirty days after the prescribed time or fourteen days after the entry of the order granting the extension,whichever is later rule a was introduced in,derived from a predecessor rule introduced in 
in,the rules were amended to create a new form of relief in rule a.in its current form the rule provides that the court may reopen the time to file an appeal for fourteen days from the date that it orders reopening if all of the following conditions are satisfied 
a the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice under federal rule of civil procedure d of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within days after entry 
b the motion is filed within days after the judgment or order is entered or within days after the moving party receives notice under federal rule of civil procedure d of the entry,whichever is earlier and 
c the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.
as the advisory committee notes explain,rule a was introduced to permit district courts to ease strict sanctions imposed on appellants whose notices of appeal are filed late because of their failure to receive notice of entry of a judgment.after all,rule a would not aid a litigant who first learned of the entry of judgment more than days after the original appeal time ran out and i t was to the plight of this litigant that the amendment to rule was addressed.the advisory committee notes cite a number of cases documenting the strict sanctions to which such litigants had been subject in each of these cases,an appeal was dismissed after the clerk office did not send or the clerk office sent but the appellant did not receive notice of the entry of judgment within the time necessary to file a notice of appeal thus,notwithstanding the general obligation of litigants to monitor the docket sheet to inform themselves of the entry of orders they wish to appeal,the amendment provided a limited opportunity for relief in circumstances where the notice of entry of a judgment or order,required to be mailed by the clerk of the district court pursuant to rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure,is either not received by a party or is received so late as to impair the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal.
we consider first whether cni met the preconditions for relief enumerated in rule a,which in this case turns on what it means to receive notice under civil rule d.cni submitted below that it did not receive notice by virtue of the clerk office transmission of notice of the entry of judgment to mullineaux registered but outdated email address.the district court accepted this contention.on its cross appeal,however,mci contends that notice was properly served by the clerk office under civil rule d to cni because it was sent to the email address provided by mullineaux and effective service of notice under civil rule d is all that is required for a party to be deemed to have received notice for purposes of rule a.
the seventh circuit recently rejected the latter proposition in a case involving traditional mailing by post,khor chin lim courtcall as the court there noted,the basic issue is that rule a does not mesh perfectly with civil rules b and d.rule a talks of receipt of a document under rule d but rules d and b concern service rather than receipt.the court observed that although civil rule b c indicates that service is complete on mailing t his rule for what it means to serve a document does not tell us that service equals receipt and rule a could have used the word serve rather than receive if that is what was meant the court further stated that rule a was designed to allow a district judge to reopen the time for appeal if notice of the judgment does not arrive whether the fault lies with the clerk or the postal service and a holding that service equals receipt would prevent the rule from serving that function.the court finally noted that no court of appeals has accepted the conclusion that a document is received for the purpose of rule a the instant it is served under rules b and d.
although some district courts have reached a contrary conclusion the seventh circuit reasoning is persuasive.the drafters of rule a were concerned with situations in which notice either is not received by a party or is received so late as to impair the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal and cited not only cases in which notice was not mailed at all,but also cases in which notice was mailed but never actually received by the party moreover,the committee clearly contemplated a distinction between service and receipt when it said that w inning parties are encouraged to send their own notice in order to lessen the chance that a judge will accept a claim of in the face of evidence that notices were sent by both the clerk and the winning party.this reading specific to rule a does not render superfluous the language in civil rule b that service is complete upon mailing or upon transmission because civil rule b applies to numerous situations in which the operative question is indeed service and not receipt both this court and other courts of appeal have assumed that rule a refers to actual receipt,not simply effective service,and we expressly reach that conclusion today 
considering the case at hand,the record supports the district court determination that cni did not actually receive civil rule d notice by virtue of its having been sent to mullineaux old email address from his previous firm while there very well may be situations in which a party must be deemed to have received a properly served civil rule d notice even though counsel never actually read the notice this is not such a case.we therefore hold that cni satisfied the preconditions for relief required by rule a 
but,as several courts of appeal have recognized,satisfaction of the three conditions of rule a is not the end of the matter.by saying that the district court may grant relief,the rule does not require the district court to grant the relief,even if the requirements are met.if the district court here understood that it had such discretion,its decision gives no indication to that effect after analyzing the three conditions of rule a and finding them satisfied,the district court granted the motion without further discussion we thus address whether granting the relief was within the court discretion in the circumstances of this case,and conclude that it was not.
in considering the scope of a district court discretion under rule a an issue we have had little prior occasion to address we are guided by an appreciation of the purposes of rule a and its positioning in the overall procedural scheme as discussed above,the purpose of the rule was to ease strict sanctions on litigants who had failed to receive notice of the entry of judgment in order to file a timely notice of appeal,whether the fault lay with the clerk or other factors beyond the litigants control,such as the postal service there is nothing in the history of the rules,however,to suggest that the drafters sought to provide relief when the fault lies with the litigants themselves 
to be sure,rule a was meant to permit relief from fault of litigants in one very specific sense their failure to meet the obligation to monitor the docket sheet to inform themselves of the entry of orders they wish to appeal.as the advisory committee noted 
failure to receive notice may have increased in frequency with the growth in the caseload in the clerks offices.the present strict rule imposes a duty on counsel to maintain contact with the court while a case is under submission.such contact is more difficult to maintain if counsel is outside the district,as is increasingly common,and can be a burden to the court as well as counsel.
we recognized this point in avolio county of suffolk our one prior occasion to consider the scope of a district court discretion under rule a.the district court there had denied rule a relief to a litigant who otherwise had met the preconditions on the ground that appellants were obligated to find out when judgment was entered,and counsel failure to investigate when he did not receive notice of a judgment from the clerk,constitutes unexcusable neglect and does not warrant an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal.we vacated and remanded,observing that the district court interpretation would subvert the central purpose of subdivision of easing the sanctions on litigants in precisely appellants position we concluded that although w e need not determine to what extent discretion may lie in the district court under this rule,a denial of relief may not be based on the concept of inexcusable neglect for not having learned of the entry of judgment.that concept has no place in the application of subdivision.
in holding that the court should not deny relief for a litigant failure to learn independently of the judgment,we did not preclude district courts from considering the fault of a litigant that causes a failure of receipt.it would be curious,after all,not to consider indications that the litigant own negligence caused the very problem that rule a was meant to ameliorate.as the circuit has recognized,
rule a,unlike rule a,does not require that the party seeking to file an otherwise untimely notice of appeal show excusable neglect or good cause or any other facts in mitigation of his tardiness.that is because,by supposition,his tardiness is not his fault.if in a particular case the movant is at the movant negligently failed to notify the clerk of his change of address,for the district court may,in its discretion,deny relief under rule a.
the structure of the overall procedural scheme reinforces the point.rule a specifically permits the district court to grant extensions of time in cases of any neglect by the litigant is excusable.but the li
