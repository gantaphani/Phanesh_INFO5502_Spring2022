a jury trial was conducted in october.following trial,the jury found for bergerson,awarding her in compensatory damages,which amount was thereafter reduced by the district court to the federal statutory cap of.the parties then made numerous motions,several of which are at issue in this appeal.first,cnypc filed a motion to bar any award of backpay,which motion was granted by the court.without holding a separate inquest into backpay and without having submitted the issue to the jury,the court found that the magnitude of the jury award ensures that bergerson will be made whole for her injuries,including for any lost wages,and for any pain,suffering,or emotional distress.
bergerson moved,under federal rule of civil procedure b,to amend the court april decision granting summary judgment dismissing her state law claims as abandoned.by the motion,bergerson sought to remove any reference to her having abandoned her state law claims and instead asked the court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims.she also moved for attorneys fees,requesting an hourly rate of for her trial counsel.as to the former,the court denied the motion,finding that bergerson indeed abandoned her state law claims and,furthermore,that bergerson did not oppose the court dismissal until over six months later.as to bergerson application for attorneys fees,the court awarded fees for all hours claimed by bergerson counsel but found the prevailing hourly rate in the northern district to be and awarded fees to bergerson trial counsel at that rate.
on appeal,bergerson challenges the district court rulings on the motions regarding backpay,her state law claims,and the hourly rated applied to the award of attorney fees.in its,designated as protective,cnypc argues against the relief sought by plaintiff,contending that the district court acted within its discretion in both declining to amend its prior order dismissing bergerson state law claims and in awarding attorney fees at the rate of per hour and that remand is appropriate to enable the district court to clarify its rulings as to compensatory damages and backpay.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court judgment as to bergerson state law claims and attorney fees,but we vacate and remand to the district court on the issues of backpay and front pay.
background 
bergerson employment with the office of mental health 
the following background facts are derived from the evidence adduced on bergerson behalf and are not contested on appeal.bergerson was hired by the cnypc as a probationary security hospital treatment assistant on september.from the very beginning of her employment,her coworkers made ongoing derogatory sexual comments about females in general and about bergerson in particular.many employees expressed the opinion that the cnypc was not an appropriate place for females to work.jokes,and comments such as women should stay barefoot and pregnant were common.at least one poster was hung portraying bergerson in a lewd manner.computer screen savers inferring lewd conduct were also displayed on several occasions in work areas to which bergerson was exposed.
sexual comments were made about bergerson,who is caucasian,her alleged promiscuity,and her alleged attraction to african american men.one african american coworker was told that he should hook up with bergerson because she did the coworkers made comments about the type of undergarments that bergerson wore.rumors were spread about her dating and sex life,and she was blamed for the breakup of a coworker marriage.it was also rumored that bergerson was having sex with facility doctors in exchange for money.racial comments were also directed toward her,such as once you go black you do go back,and rumors were spread that she was dating an african american supervisor,keith richardson,although they were apparently just friends for most of bergerson employment 
bergerson made multiple unsuccessful complaints about her workplace environment to her supervisors.in one instance,a female supervisor responded to bergerson complaints by telling her that it was a man environment and that she should just deal with it.at one point,bergerson took advantage of counseling through cnypc employee assistance program.
because bergerson was hired as a probationary employee,the terms of her employment imposed a week probationary period.during the probationary period,a probationary employee is reviewed periodically and is evaluated in nine categories,if applicable quality of work work habits,work interest resourcefulness relationship with people reaction to supervisor attendance analytical and problem solving abilities written and oral presentation and ability to supervise.each evaluation results either in termination or in continuation of the employee probationary period.bergerson performance was evaluated on five occasions.
bergerson first evaluation,in december,reflected an average rating for all categories except relationship with people.the evaluator comment in rating her below average in that category indicated that she needed to work on acceptance by her peers.bergerson second evaluation took place on march.she was rated average in four categories.however,she was rated below average in the relationship with people category and unacceptable in the quality of work,work habits,work interest,and attendance categories.there were comments written in the additional information section indicating that bergerson should have more knowledge of policy and procedure,follow protocol,be able to keep track of her keys,and know the census and the whereabouts of her patients at all times.it was recommended that probation be continued.bergerson third evaluation,on june,reflected an average rating in all categories.it was again recommended that her probation should continue.her evaluator made an oral comment,however,that it was not in bergerson best interest to continue her alleged relationship with richardson.
bergerson fourth evaluation was completed on september.she was rated average in five categories,below average in the relationship with people and reaction to supervisor categories,and unacceptable in attendance.while her direct supervisor acknowledged that bergerson did not have any unscheduled absences and was always on time,the supervisor nonetheless noted that he was unable to give a proper evaluation of bergerson performance because she did so many that she rarely worked her scheduled time and shift.in order for the supervisor to evaluate bergerson properly in the future,she was thereafter restricted from doing mutuals.on september,the cnypc extended bergerson probationary period an additional six months and provided her with written notice of the extension.
bergerson fifth and final evaluation was completed on january,approximately two months before the end of her extended probationary period.the evaluator ranked bergerson average in written and oral presentation and below average in quality of work,work habits,work interest,attendance,and analytical and problem solving abilities.she was ranked unacceptable in resourcefulness,relationship with people,and reaction to supervisor.there were no additional comments.
following her final evaluation,on january,cnypc notified bergerson that her employment would be terminated effective january,and that she would be on administrative leave until that date.as a result,she requested an interview with her supervisor,which was granted and thereafter took place on january.on february,bergerson was informed by letter that no new information had surfaced at the interview that would overturn the termination decision.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
following her termination,bergerson commenced the title vii action on december,by filing a complaint alleging discrimination claims based on disparate treatment,hostile work environment,and retaliation.she claimed that she was terminated in part because of her gender and her relationship with richardson,an african american coworker.she also brought three parallel state law claims under the new york human rights law.see exec.law mckinney.
in june,cnypc moved for summary judgment.as to the state law claims,cnypc argued that bergerson claims were barred by the eleventh amendment.in response,bergerson conceded legal error and expressly withdr ew those claims.see pl.mem.of law in opp to summ.at plaintiff concedes that the eleventh amendment bars the claims and accordingly withdraws the second,fourth and sixth causes of action.on april,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order.in that decision,the court,based on bergerson concession regarding her state law claims,dismissed those claims as abandoned by plaintiff.
however,the district court denied cnypc summary judgment motion as to bergerson disparate treatment and hostile work environment claims,finding that bergerson ha d adduced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.with respect to bergerson disparate treatment claim,the court found that bergerson has set forth circumstantial evidence of disparate treatment based upon interracial associations as well as temporal proximity.the court noted that although it was unclear when bergerson started dating richardson,she adduced evidence that rumors abounded well before they actually started dating and that coworkers commented derogatorily about bergerson alleged attraction toward african american men.the court also found that,depending on which testimony a jury would credit,there was a temporal connection between the commencement of bergerson interracial relationship with richardson and her termination.as to bergerson hostile work environment claim,the court found that a lthough it is a close question in this case it is best left for the jury to decide whether the work environment is sufficiently hostile so as to constitute a change in the term,condition,or privilege of bergerson employment.
the case proceeded to a jury trial in october the jury was asked to determine liability and,if cnypc were found liable,to assess compensatory damages for pain,suffering,and emotional distress and harm to reputation.bergerson also sought backpay and reinstatement or front pay under title vii,but those issues were not submitted to the jury.instead,the court reserved decision on those applications and indicated that it would decide whether bergerson was entitled to such awards on submissions if the jury returned a verdict in her favor.following trial,the jury found for bergerson,awarding her compensatory damages in the amount of on her disparate treatment claims for pain,suffering,and emotional distress and for harm to reputation and on her hostile work environment claim for pain,suffering,and emotional distress and for harm to reputation.
on november,cnypc moved for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and,respectively.with respect to damages and backpay,cnypc sought to vacate the jury damages award as unsupported by the evidence or in the alternative,to reduce the award to,which is the maximum amount allowable under the statutory cap on awards of noneconomic damages under title vii imposed by u.b d and to preclude a further award of backpay if the court did not vacate the jury damages award.in response,on november,bergerson under federal rule of civil procedure b to amend the court summary judgment order to delete any reference to her having abandoned her state law claims.bergerson did so because she wished to her state law claims which are not subject to a statutory cap on damages in state court.
at a november,hearing,the district court granted cnypc motion in part.although the court declined to vacate the jury damages award finding it supported by the evidence the court reduced the damages award to as required by title vii statutory cap.the court also granted cnypc motion to preclude an additional award of backpay.as to bergerson motion,the court refrained from amending its summary judgment order to remove the reference to bergerson having abandoned her state law claims.the court noted that bergerson had in fact abandoned those claims by withdrawing them and by not opposing dismissal and,moreover,that she had waited until after trial over six months after the summary judgment order issued before seeking modification.
on december,bergerson moved for reconsideration of the court backpay ruling and also reaffirmed her demand for front pay reinstatement.upon reconsideration,the court again denied backpay by a february,decision and order.in the same decision and order,the court declined to rule on the issue of front pay reinstatement because it was not raised in the defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.the court acknowledged that a central purpose of title vii is to make a plaintiff whole for injuries that are a violation of the statute.although the jury did not consider bergerson lost wages,and although the court had denied cnypc motion to modify the jury award as excessive,the court nonetheless concluded that the jury substantial damages award satisfie d title vii policy.the court found that the magnitude of the jury award ensures that bergerson will be made whole for her injuries,including for any lost wages,and for any pain,suffering,or emotional distress.
bergerson also moved for attorney fees,requesting,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,an hourly rate of for the work of her trial counsel.in response,the court awarded fees for all hours and expenses claimed but reduced the hourly rate to,which the court found to be the prevailing hourly rate in the northern district for experienced attorneys in civil rights matters.final judgment was entered on february,awarding bergerson in compensatory damages and in attorney fees and costs.bergerson appeals from the final judgment and cnypc cross appeals.
on appeal,bergerson claims the district court erred in granting cnypc motion to preclude backpay awards and,rather,that she is entitled to both back and front pay reinstatement the district court abused its discretion in denying her b motion to amend the summary judgment with respect to her state law claims and the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys fees at.in,designated as protective,cnypc argues remand is appropriate to enable the district court to clarify its rulings as to compensatory damages and backpay and the district court acted within its discretion both in declining to amend its prior order dismissing bergerson state law claims and in awarding attorney fees at the rate of per hour.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of backpay under title vii,the denial of a rule b motion for amendment,and an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.see albemarle paper moody,denial of backpay official comm.of unsecured creditors of color tile,coopers lybrand,llp,cir rule b motion mcdaniel cnty.of schenectady,cir award of attorney fees.a district court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or render s a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.abuse of discretion takes on special significance when reviewing fee decisions because the district court,which is intimately familiar with the nuances of the case,is in a far better position to make such decisions than is an appellate court,which must work from a cold record.mcdaniel,at alterations and quotation marks omitted.with respect to backpay and front pay,we have stated that because t he award of front pay is discretionary,where the district court makes a nonerroneous specific finding that an award of back pay or front pay was sufficient to make a plaintiff whole,no abuse of discretion can be found.saulpaugh monroe cnty,f d,cir.
ii.bergerson title vii claims 
section a permits a title vii claimant and other claimants not at issue here to recover compensatory damages to redress future pecuniary losses,emotional pain,suffering,inconvenience,mental anguish,loss of enjoyment of life,and other nonpecuniary losses.b.these damages may be awarded in addition to economic damages consisting of backpay or any other type of relief authorized under b.id.b.
an award of backpay is the rule,not the exception.carrero new york city hous,cir.the decision to award backpay is measured against the purposes which inform title vii,albemarle,at,which include remov ing the stain discrimination leaves on equality in the workplace and mak ing victims of discrimination whole,carrero,at.the supreme court has explained that the primary objective of title vii is prophylactic in nature because the statutory scheme was intended to eliminate past obstacles to workplace equality.see albermarle,at.although a trial court has discretion whether to award backpay,its reasons must be explained in the event backpay is denied.see id.at carrero,at.its explanation must be sufficient so as to make review intelligible.carrero,f d at.front pay is awarded at the discretion of a district court where reinstatement is inappropriate and the plaintiff has been unable to find another job.saulpaugh,at.the purpose of front pay is to mak e victims of discrimination whole in cases where the factfinder can reasonably predict that the plaintiff has no reasonable prospect of obtaining comparable alternative employment.padilla metro north commuter,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
during the trial,the district court stated that it would hold a separate inquest to determine the amount of backpay and front pay due to bergerson only if cnypc were found by the jury to be liable under title vii.after finding cnypc liable,the jury was asked to award compensatory damages for only two categories of harm emotional distress,pain,and suffering and harm to bergerson reputation.the jury was not asked to consider bergerson lost wages and was presented with no evidence on this issue.
the district court determined that the jury damages award was supported by the evidence and accordingly denied cnypc motion to vacate or reduce the damages award except to the extent of reducing the award to the statutory maximum.however,at the same time and without holding a separate inquest,the court also denied bergerson an equitable award of backpay on the ground that the jury award was sufficient to make her whole,including for her claim of lost wages.in so finding,the court noted 
bergerson substantial damages award satisfied both of the objectives of title vii.instead of merely having to comply with an injunctive order prohibiting racial discrimination and hostility in the work environment,cnypc must pay bergerson in compensatory damages as a result of its unlawful employment practices additionally,the magnitude of the jury award ensures that bergerson will be made whole for her injuries,including any lost wages,pain,suffering,or emotional distress.
the court recognized that the jury had heard no evidence on backpay but nevertheless found that the award returned bergerson to the position she would have found herself in had the violations never occurred.
we are unable to adopt this view.while a primary purpose of backpay is indeed to return a victim of discrimination to the position she would have found herself in had the violations never occurred,we have never held that an award of backpay is encompassed within a jury award of compensatory damages.indeed,such a view has been foreclosed by.rather,an award of backpay includes what the employee himself would have earned had he not been discharged.kirsch fleet street,cir see also saulpaugh,at observing that,ordinarily,a plaintiff is entitled to losses suffered as a result of defendant discrimination,from the date of termination until the date of judgment.an award of backpay is a separate inquiry and requires a district court to make additional factual findings.see brock casey truck sales,cir these amounts of backpay were carefully arrived at by determining first each discharged employee hourly wage rate and the duration of his loss period.
because a backpay award requires a separate inquest,a district court may not deny an award of backpay because it believes that an award of compensatory damages is sufficient.either an award includes backpay or it does not.we also note that the district court never found the compensatory damages award to be excessive rather,upon cnypc motion to vacate the jury damages award as unsupported by the evidence,the court instead reduced the damages award to the statutory cap of.accordingly,on remand,the court is directed to hold a separate inquest as to backpay.of course,we are not requiring the district court to award backpay to bergerson however,if the court declines to award backpay,it must carefully articulate its reasons,albemarle,at,keeping in mind that a n award of backpay is the rule,not the exception,carrero,at.
bergerson also sought an award of front pay.front pay may be awarded pursuant to section g of the civil rights act of,which provides a court with authority to order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,including but not limited to reinstatement or hiring of employees,with or without back pay or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.g pollard du pont de nemours.an award of front pay is an alternative to reinstatement where reinstatement is inappropriate,reed lawrence,cir,such as where there is animosity between an employer and an employee or where there is no longer a position available at the time of judgment,whittlesey union carbide,cir describing reinstatement and front pay under the age discrimination in employment act.an award of front pay is discretionary,and if a district court makes a nonerroneous specific finding that a plaintiff has already been made whole,no abuse of discretion can be found in denying front pay.see saulpaugh,at.
because we hold that the district court abused its discretion in its specific finding that bergerson was not entitled to backpay,we can not assume,as cnypc would have us do,that front pay is likewise not warranted.the court thus should consider in the first instance on remand whether bergerson is entitled to reinstatement or,in the alternative,front pay,see thompson cnty.of franklin,cir holding that the preferred practice in this circuit is to remand the issue for the district court to consider in the first instance,keeping in mind that front pay is excluded from the statutory cap,pollard,at accord robinson metro north commuter,cir citing pollard and noting that front pay is an equitable remedy.in its consideration of this issue,the district court may conduct further proceedings as necessary to determine bergerson employment status,probationary or permanent.
iii.state law claims 
bergerson argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to modify its april,memorandum decision and order,which,inter alia,dismissed her state law claims as abandoned by plaintiff.she contends that the court instead should have withdr awn its abandonment reference,and decline d supplemental jurisdiction.had the court done so,bergerson contends that she would have been able to,pursuant to new york savings clause,her state law claims in state court in order to seek damages above and beyond the cap that exists in federal court.see exec law mckinney see also rahiym amir bellamy of corinth,cv,wl,at,unlike title vii,there is no limitation on an award of compensatory damages u
