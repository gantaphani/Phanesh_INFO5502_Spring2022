in this interpleader action,the parties assert competing claims to the dregs of a failed securitization of credit card debt.appellant,the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic,as well as appellees,first millennium,millennium partners,together,millennium and rmk advantage income fund rmk,seek distribution of the funds held by the interpleader plaintiff,the bank of new york bny,as trustee for the nextcard credit card master note trust the trust.the fdic argues that it is entitled to the funds as the receiver for nextbank,nextbank a bank,which established the trust in order to generate money to lend to credit card holders.millennium and rmk claim that they are entitled to the funds as owners of notes issued by the trust.
bny initiated this interpleader action in new york state court.the fdic removed it to the united states district court for the southern district of new york haight.in a series of rulings,the district court denied the fdic motion to transfer the action to the united states district court for the district of columbia,enjoined bny from making distributions from the interpleader funds,dismissed the fdic counterclaims against bny,and,lastly,denied the fdic motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to millennium and rmk.the district court then ordered bny to begin distributing the trust corpus,giving preference to satisfying the claims of millennium and rmk.the fdic now appeals the decisions of the district court.we affirm.
background 
i.the securitization transaction 
in,nextbank,an bank,began to issue consumer credit cards to borrowers who applied over the internet.the business grew,and by february,nextbank had million cardholders.rather than borrow money directly to lend to consumers,nextbank entered into a securitization transaction to generate funds.it established a trust at bny and sold its credit card rights to be paid interest and principal for purchases on the the trust,using the proceeds to finance cardholders purchases.bny then issued notes backed by the cash flows generated from the receivables to investors.this transaction generated approximately billion and provided funding for most of the credit cards issued by nextbank.
the trust issued two series of notes,the series and the series,which came due,respectively,in december and april.these notes were issued in four classes a,b,c and d,which paid different rates of interest and carried differing levels of risk.the class a notes were the least risky,since they carried the right to first repayment from the trust corpus.accordingly,the class a notes paid the lowest rate of interest.the class b notes both carried more their holders had rights to repayment subordinate to the class a noteholders and paid a slightly higher rate of interest.the classes c and d notes were successively both riskier and higher paying.however,as protection for the holders of these riskier c and d notes,certain money from their initial purchase of the notes was set aside in a spread account to be used to fund interest and principal payments on the notes should the money generated by the receivables prove insufficient.over the life of the trust,the amount of money in the spread account was adjusted on a regular basis according to a formula.
the securitization was executed through a set of documents that included a master indenture and various indenture supplements.as is customary,some terms of the noteholders investments were also laid out on the notes themselves.additionally,all potential purchasers of the notes received copies of offering memoranda that described the terms of the notes and the risks associated with investing in them.
under the transaction documents,the trust owned the credit card receivables.cardholders payments of fees and interest or,as they are described in the deal documents,finance charges were used to make interest payments on the notes.money not used to make interest payments was divided into two pots,labeled collateral and the transferor interest.the collateral was intended for the eventual repayment of the principal of the notes although during an initial revolving period it was used to fund new loans to credit card holders.the transferor interest,on the other hand,was intended to fund regular payments to nextbank as the creator of the trust.the trust documents provided that at the termination of the trust,any money left over after all the trust obligations had been satisfied in full was to be distributed to nextbank.
in the event that cardholders defaulted on their card payments,the defaulted amount was charged off against the assets in the trust labeled the invested amount,which was defined as the sum of the collateral and the spread account.in effect,if cardholders failed to repay their loans,the reduction was accounted for in the trust by reducing the funds labeled collateral rather than those labeled transferor interest.this accounting provision proved significant when large numbers of the borrowers with whom nextbank did business eventually defaulted.
ii.nextbank receivership 
in,the fdic determined that nextbank undercapitalization and practice of extending credit to subprime borrowers had endangered its ability to continue operating.in,after the comptroller of the currency discovered that nextbank accounting was improper,it appointed the fdic as the bank receiver.as receiver,the fdic succeeded to all nextbank rights,titles,powers,and privileges,d a i,while continuing to operate the bank.the fdic allowed the credit card accounts to remain open while it sought a buyer for nextbank assets.eventually,however,when no buyer materialized,the fdic closed the credit card accounts.the cardholders were then unable to make new charges on their cards,but remained responsible for paying off their balances.
funds from the trust were distributed to the classes a and b noteholders,who were fully repaid the principal and interest due on their notes.class c noteholders received partial repayment of the principal and interest owed to them.class d noteholders received some interest payments,but their investment principal was not repaid.the fdic continued to receive payments of transferor interest from the trust until such payments were stopped in connection with this interpleader action.
as things stand now,cardholders have defaulted on their loans in large number and have reduced the collateral in the trust to zero.furthermore,the funds in the spread account have now been distributed to the class c noteholders,by an order of the district court not challenged in this appeal,with the result that the entire trust corpus consists of funds labeled transferor interest.the present dispute concerns who is entitled to these funds as between the remaining unpaid noteholders and the fdic,which as receiver for the trust creator nextbank possesses both rights to regular payments of transferor interest and a residuary interest in any assets of the trust that remain after all the trust other obligations have been satisfied.
iii.the district of columbia litigation 
in june,bny filed suit against the fdic in the united states district court for the district of columbia on behalf of the c and d noteholders,bringing six claims for conversion.one of bny claims was dismissed by the court early in the litigation,see bank of new york fdic,d,nextbank i,aff,and four other claims were dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement that provided for the distribution of some trust assets to the fdic.
the district court granted summary judgment to the fdic on bny final claim,that the fdic had unlawfully converted funds to which the noteholders were entitled by refusing to honor the ipso facto clause of the master indenture.that term provided for accelerated repayment of principal to the noteholders in the event that nextbank was placed in receivership.the fdic the court it was entitled to disregard this provision under the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act firrea.e a see nextbank i at.
shortly thereafter,despite the district of columbia district court decision,certain noteholders demanded that bny distribute the trust assets to them,citing,among other grounds,the ipso facto clause of the master indenture.in response to this claim,bny ceased making regular distributions of the transferor interest to the fdic and initiated the current interpleader action in new york state court.the fdic removed the interpleader action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.it also asserted a number of counterclaims against bny,charging that bny was liable for violating the transaction documents,the court order in nextbank i,and the settlement agreement in that litigation,and for abuse of the judicial process.
the fdic then filed a new suit in the district court,seeking,among other remedies,that the court enjoin the interpleader action from proceeding.the fdic argued that the initiation of the interpleader violated the orders of the court in nextbank i,as well as the settlement agreements executed in that action,and that bny had converted its funds by ceasing distributions of transferor interest.see fdic bank of new york,d nextbank ii.the court ruled that,to the degree that the noteholders pursued remedies on the basis of the ipso facto provision of the trust master indenture,their action was collaterally estopped by nextbank i,since that decision had held that the clause was void and unenforceable.id.at.the district court therefore enjoined bny and the noteholders from relitigating the issue of the ipso facto clause in the interpleader action.it also ordered bny to continue to make distributions of transferor interest to the fdic in accordance with the schedule in the trust documents,as well as to make back payments for those distributions that had been missed since bny had suspended the payments.the court noted,however,that the noteholders appear to have raised an additional claim based on the maturity date of the notes,which they apparently claim is not dependent on the enforceability of the ipso facto clause to the extent that this alternative claim has been raised in the interpleader,it may present new issues and this court may not enjoin future litigation regarding this claim.id.at.
iv.the southern district of new york litigation 
after the district court issued its decision in nextbank ii,the district court in the southern district of new york lifted the stay on the interpleader action,which it had granted while that decision was pending,and issued an order clarifying that bny was not precluded from complying with the orders of the district court in nextbank ii.it then proceeded to deal with various motions made by the parties.
the court first ruled on the fdic motion to transfer venue for the interpleader action to the district of columbia.the fdic presented two separate arguments that venue was proper in rather than in the southern district of new york first,that firrea conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the dc district for claims against the fdic,citing d a,and second,that the action should be transferred in the interest of justice because it was closely related to the previous litigation in.the district court rejected both arguments.the court ruled that firrea did not govern the interpleader action,because it applied only to claims against the fdic,and the interpleader properly represented a claim by the fdic to the trust corpus.see bank of new york first millennium,civ.csh,wl may.the court also ruled that venue should not be transferred in the interest of justice,concluding that,since the issues involved in the interpleader action were distinct from the issues involving the ipso facto clause,fairness and convenience factors did not support the transfer.furthermore,the court determined that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over millennium and rmk,since those entities did not do business in the district of columbia,the new york and actions presented distinct not reasonably have anticipated being haled into court there simply by reason of their participation in the action.accordingly,the court denied the fdic motion to transfer.the court then issued an order precluding bny from making further distributions from the trust corpus without a further order from the court.
in its next opinion,the court addressed the noteholders motion for immediate distribution of the funds in the spread account.although the fdic did not oppose the distribution,it contended that in order to receive the funds,the noteholders were obligated to surrender their notes and to disclaim any additional recovery from the interpleader.the court construed the deal documents not to require that claimants surrender their notes in order to access the funds in the spread account,and ordered the immediate distribution of the spread account funds without imposing the condition.see bank of new york first millennium,d s.
shortly thereafter,the court issued an opinion dismissing the fdic counterclaims.see bank of new york first millennium,civ.csh,wl.the district court found that since bny faced competing claims to the trust assets from the noteholders and from the fdic,it acted properly in commencing the interpleader action.it could not therefore be found liable for abusing the judicial process simply by virtue of initiating the interpleader.since this was the sole basis for the fdic abuse of the judicial process counterclaim,the district court dismissed that claim.additionally,the court concluded that all of the fdic other claims were ultimately based on the commencement and maintenance of the interpleader action,and therefore similarly failed as a matter of law.
finally,the court issued an opinion resolving the rights to the remaining assets in the trust by disposing of for summary judgment filed by the fdic and by millennium and rmk.see bank of new york first millennium,d s.the noteholders argued that they were entitled to the remaining trust assets,since their notes had reached final maturity and were now due and payable,and since the unpaid principal on the notes was greater than the remaining assets in the trust.the fdic,on the other hand,made two separate arguments that it was entitled to the remaining trust assets.first,it argued that,according to the deal documents,the against the collateral made when cardholders had stopped repaying their loans had reduced to zero not only the collateral in the trust,but also the amount of unpaid principal due to the noteholders.accordingly,it contended,the noteholders had no valid claim to any of the trust assets.second,it argued that the issuer obligation to pay principal and interest on the notes was limited by recourse only to the collateral and the spread account.accordingly,it argued,since the funds in the spread account had been disbursed and the collateral had been reduced to zero,the trust had no obligation to distribute any assets to the noteholders.
the district court interpreted the deal documents as a contract under new york law.first,on the basis of what it determined to be the unambiguous language of the contract,it rejected the fdic claim that reduced the principal amount repayable to the noteholders upon the maturity of their notes.second,the court concluded that the deal documents were inconsistent as to whether the notes were full or limited recourse obligations.on the one hand,a provision of the master indenture indicated that the notes were limited recourse,and therefore that their holders were entitled to repayment only from trust assets considered collateral.on the other hand,another provision of the master indenture provided that notwithstanding any other provision,the trust obligation to pay interest and principal on the notes was absolute and unconditional.the court determined that this notwithstanding clause,which was similar to language on the c class notes themselves,trumped the limited recourse provision of the indenture.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment to millennium and rmk.
the court entered final judgment reflecting its earlier rulings.this appeal followed.
discussion 
in this appeal,the fdic argues primarily that the district court misconstrued the noteholders rights under the transaction documents,and therefore erred in granting summary judgment to millennium and rmk.the agency claims both that by the time of the interpleader,no amount was due and payable on the notes,and also that even if there were an amount due on the notes,the noteholders may not collect it from the trust remaining assets,which are labeled transferor interest in the deal documents,since the notes were limited in recourse only to trust assets labeled collateral or in the spread account.the fdic argues that since only funds labeled transferor interest are left in the trust,it should be able to terminate the trust and appropriate its remaining assets.
the fdic also asserts that the district court erred in three other respects.first,it argues that before bny initiated the interpleader action,the litigation had already conclusively determined that only the fdic had a valid claim on the trust assets.accordingly,it contends,all of the noteholders claims were barred by claim and issue preclusion and the district court should have dismissed the action.second,the agency argues that the district court erred in denying the fdic motion to transfer the action to the district of columbia,and that,since this decision was determinative of the outcome of the lawsuit,reversal of the district court final order is warranted.third,the fdic appeals the dismissal of its counterclaims against bny.
i.the summary judgment decision 
the fdic primary argument on appeal is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to millennium and rmk because it misconstrued the nature of the deal between the noteholders and the trust.the fdic argues that,according to the deal documents,the amount due on the notes was reduced to zero by when cardholders defaulted on their payments.the fdic additionally argues that the notes were defined in the master indenture as limited recourse that even if principal were payable on the notes,the noteholders would be entitled to repayment only from the trust funds set aside as collateral.since there is no collateral left,the fdic asserts,the agency is entitled to terminate the trust and claim its remaining assets.

the parties agree that the transaction documents constitute a contract governed by new york law.under new york law,the key inquiry at the initial stage of interpreting a contract is whether it is ambiguous with respect to the issue disputed by the parties.law debenture trust of maverick tube,cir.an ambiguity exists where the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.morgan stanley group new eng.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.summary judgment is generally inappropriate where the contested contractual language is ambiguous.palmieri allstate ins,cir.we review de novo both whether a contract is ambiguous,and,when the district court finds a contract unambiguous,its interpretation of the contract,reliastar life ins.of home depot,cir.
a.the amount due on the notes 
the class c and class d notes state the entire unpaid principal amount of this note shall be due and payable at the note maturity.despite this clear language,the fdic contends that the noteholders are due payment only of the invested amount,a term defined in the master indenture as the unpaid principal amount,minus on account of cardholders defaults.if the fdic interpretation of the contract were correct,there would be no amount due on the notes,since by the time the notes became due,this invested amount was zero.
the fdic,however,has adduced no evidence to support its contention that the amount due on the notes at their maturity is this invested amount rather than the unpaid principal amount.the fdic relies on language in the master indenture,providing that in the event of default the indenture trustee may cause the issuer to sell principal receivables in an amount equal to the invested amount.even read in isolation,this is not a clear statement that noteholders are entitled only to repayment of the invested amount in the event of default.but the fdic fails to mention that the issuer power to sell the receivables in the event of default under this provision is expressly made conditional either upon the noteholders consent or upon the trustee determination that any proceeds of such exercise distributable to the noteholders of the affected series are sufficient to discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon the notes for principal and interest.read in its context,this provision does not reinforce,but rather contradicts,the fdic assertion that the amount due on the notes is the invested amount rather than the entire unpaid principal 
in light of the fdic failure to identify any provision of the deal documents that supports its contention that the amount due on the notes is anything other than the unpaid principal amount,and in light of the clear language to the contrary on the notes themselves,the district court was right to conclude that the contract unambiguously provides for the full repayment of the entire unpaid principal amount at the notes maturity.
b.the recourse nature of the notes 
the fdic argument that the district court misconstrued the extent of trust assets subject to the noteholders claims for repayment has more traction,but ultimately must also be rejected.the fdic claims that the limited recourse provision of the master indenture limits the funds that the noteholders can pursue for repayment of their notes to those set aside as collateral.the fdic contends that all parties funds labeled collateral remain in the trust,the district court was wrong to conclude that the noteholders had any valid claim on the trust assets and therefore erred in granting them summary judgment.
the fdic relies on the limited recourse provision of the master indenture,a prefatory provision of the document which reads 
the obligation of the issuer to make payments of principal of,and interest on and other amounts with respect to,the notes is limited by recourse only to the collateral.
the fdic contends that this provision strictly limits the noteholders rights in the event of default to those assets accounted as collateral.
the limited recourse provision,however,is not the only provision of the transaction documents that concerns the recourse nature of the notes.two other provisions also govern the noteholders rights to repayment in the event of default.first,the trust indenture contains a provision the notwithstanding clause that reads 
notwithstanding any other provision in this indenture,each holder of a note shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal and interest in respect of such note as such principal and interest becomes due and payable and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment.
in addition,the class c notes although not the class d notes state 
no reference herein to the indenture and no provision of this class c note or of the indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the issuer,which is absolute and unconditional,to pay the principal of and interest on this class c note at the times,place,and rate,and in the coin or currency prescribed.
these two provisions provide to holders of the notes absolute and unconditional rights to repayment,rights which can not be limited to funds labeled collateral in the transaction documents.see hibbs brown,an order or promise to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional quoting the negotiable instruments law.
the district court concluded that the trust indenture is inconsistent in how it describes the recourse nature of the notes,and,relying on international multifoods commercial union insurance,cir,resolved this inconsistency by determining that the notwithstanding clause plain language trumped the conflicting limited recourse provision the fdic contends that the district court erred because there is no conflict between these absolute and unconditional rights to repayment and the limited recourse provision of the indenture.
the fdic presents two convoluted theories as to why the notwithstanding clause does not conflict with the limited recourse provision.the fdic first argument hinges on the phrasing of the notwithstanding clause,which says that the repayment right is in respect of such note as such principal and interest becomes due and payable.the fdic argues that because the amount due and payable is limited by the limited recourse provision to the amount of the collateral,no conflict exists between the notwithstanding clause and the limited recourse provision.
this argument is without merit.the class c and d notes plainly say that t he entire unpaid principal amount shall be due and payable at the notes maturities.the limited recourse provision does not purport to alter this,pertaining only to which assets noteholders can access for repayment,and the fdic fails to identify any other provision of the transaction documents that supports its contentions that the amount due on the notes is anything other than their entire unpaid principal.see supra,section i a.accordingly,the district court did not err in rejecting this argument.
the fdic also argues that the notwithstanding clause does not conflict with the limited recourse clause because it is boilerplate included in the transaction documents solely on account of the trust indenture act of the tia.the fdic observes that the language of the notwithstanding clause is similar to section b of the tia,b,a statutory provision requiring that bond indentures protect minority bondholders by prohibiting majority bondholders from collusively agreeing to modify the bond payment terms.since the language of the indenture provision is modeled on the provision of the tia,the fdic argues,this court should interpret both to have the same purpose.the fdic urges us,therefore,to view this provision of the indenture as included by the parties for the limited purpose of preventing oppression of minority noteholders at the hands of majority noteholders,and to find that it has no applicability to the current dispute.
we decline to disregard the plain language of the indenture provision on account of its similarity to a provision of the tia.absent a finding that the transaction documents are the fdic does not evidence concerning the purpose behind contract provisions is not admissible.innophos,rhodia.even if we were to consider the similarity between the notwithstanding clause and section b of the tia as evidence for why the parties included the clause in the indenture,that evidence would not compel us to limit the applicability of the clause to disputes.while complying with section b may have been one reason the drafters included the notwithstanding clause,it could not have been the only reason.nothing in section b,or the tia in general,requires that bondholders be afforded absolute and unconditional rights to payment,the precise term that the fdic seeks to have us disregard.the absolute and unconditional right to right that expressly conflicts with the limited recourse provision of the no obvious relation to the purpose of preventing the oppression of minority bondholders.we can not read that right out of the contract because it is embedded in a provision that arguably was included for another reason.
having rejected the fdic arguments that the notwithstanding clause and the limited recourse provision of the master indenture can be reconciled,our prior cases applying new york law provide clear direction on the proper way to resolve the inconsistency.this court has recognized many times that under new york law,clauses similar to the phrase n otwithstanding any other provision trump conflicting contract terms.see int l multifoods,at l b,blanchard,cir,trinity,cir.by its plain terms,the absolute and unconditional right to repayment granted to the noteholders by the indenture overrides the conflicting limited recourse provision,and allows the noteholders to seek repayment from all the assets of the trust.
we note,moreover,that the fdic does not seriously address the conflict between the limited recourse provision of the indenture and the absolute and unconditional right to payment on the reverse of the class c notes,saying only that since the notes say that they are subject to all the terms of the indenture,the limited recourse provision applies.of course,the class c notes explicitly state that the repayment right supercedes both the terms of the indenture and all other provisions of the note.furthermore,new york law is clear that where there is a conflict between the terms of the note and ancillary documents,the terms of the note control.cunningham pressed steel car,dep t,aff,a ny inconsistency between the bond and the indenture must be construed in favor of the bondholder.this language on the class c fully confronted by the fdic in its attempts to construe the transaction documents as consistently representing the notes as limited strengthens our conviction that the parties intended the notes to be full recourse obligations of the issuer.
accordingly,the district court did not err in determining that the class c notes were full recourse obligations of the issuer and granting summary judgment to the noteholders on that basis.
ii.issue and claim preclusion 
the fdic also contends that this interpleader action is an attempted end run around the judgment of district court,which it claims unequivocally awarded all the remaining trust assets to it as the receiver for nextbank.the fdic argues that nextbank i and nextbank ii determined that the fdic owned the transferor interest,and that this determination is binding under the doctrine of claim preclusion on millennium and rmk as parties in privity with bny.furthermore,it argues that the doctrine of issue preclusion bars the noteholders claims,because all of the issues raised in the interpleader action were actually litigated,fully and fairly,in the litigation.these contentions are unpersuasive.
the doctrine of claim preclusion holds that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.monahan city dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.otherwise known as res judicata,claim preclusion bars a subsequent either the same plaintiffs or parties in privity with those asserting claims that were,or could have been,raised in a prior action that resulted in an adjudication on the merits.allen mccurry.

we review the district court application of the principles of claim and issue preclusion de novo.chartier marlin,llc,cir.
nextbank i actually and necessarily determined that the early amortization clause of the master indenture was unenforceable against the fdic.issue preclusion,therefore,did bar one of millennium and rmk claims in the interpleader action their claim on the basis of the early amortization provision of the master indenture.for this reason,the noteholders claim on the basis of that particular clause was barred from relitigation by the doctrine of issue preclusion,as the district court opinion in nextbank ii recognized.nextbank ii,at.the district court below recognized the correctness of this ruling and did not reconsider that issue.
the fdic argument that the entire interpleader action is barred by issue preclusion on account of the litigation,however,is without merit.the ipso facto c
