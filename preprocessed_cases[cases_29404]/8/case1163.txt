this case arises from a reinsurer contractual undertakings to compensate a specialized underwriter.the underwriter,acumen re management corporation acumen,sued the reinsurer,general security national insurance company general security,for breach of contract,seeking contingent commissions alleged to be due.the united states district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge entered partial summary judgment for general security,ruling that four of acumen five theories were baseless and that,under all five theories,no more than nominal damages were available.the district court then certified the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,and,notwithstanding the remaining disputed theory,closed the case.
general security asserts that we lack jurisdiction to entertain acumen appeal,arguing that the district court certification under rule b was improper in that its partial judgment did not address separate claim s for relief.we agree,and conclude that we must dismiss the appeal.
we begin with some details of the dispute.in,acumen,an underwriter,entered into the acumen re reinsurance underwriting agency agreement the underwriting agreement with sorema north america reinsurance company sorema.pursuant to the underwriting agreement,sorema engaged acumen to underwrite reinsurance of certain workers compensation insurance,subject to detailed guidelines.the undertaking concerned facultative reinsurance,in which sorema,as a reinsurer,would assume on a basis certain portions of risks insured as an initial matter by other companies the ceding companies 
acumen role for sorema was primarily to underwrite that is,to identify,investigate,evaluate,and price risks of a type and range that were well defined by the underwriting agreement.for each qualifying risk identified by acumen and accepted by sorema,acumen would produce a certificate documenting the risk and related undertakings.
the underwriting agreement provided that acumen would receive,as compensation,an eight percent commission on net written premium received by sorema on certificates bound or written under the agreement.the underwriting agreement was supplemented at its inception by a contingency commission addendum addendum providing that acumen would be allowed a thirty percent contingent commission on sorema share of annual net profits,if any arising from certificates bound or written under the parties agreement,subject to further specified terms.the addendum set out a detailed schedule and method for calculating the contingent commissions,using as factors both the profitability of the underwritten policies and the size of certain of sorema reserves.together,these documents the initial agreement established the terms on which sorema would compensate acumen for its underwriting services.
seven years later,in,sorema was acquired and became general security.the following year,general security and acumen agreed to end their relationship,in the agreement terminating acumen re reinsurance underwriting agency agreement termination agreement.the termination agreement called for general security to make an immediate payment of million to acumen in,and,in early,to calculate and pay any contingent commissions due under the addendum for the prior underwriting years from the start of through april,the termination agreement also specified certain provisions of the initial agreement that would survive the termination.these included general security obligation to provide to acumen quarterly reports on any losses general security incurred on claims then outstanding.collectively,the initial agreement and the termination agreement will be referred to as the agreements.
after the termination in and before the final commission payment became due in,general security commuted certain of its reinsurance certificates,some of which had been underwritten by acumen the commutations which acumen alleged general security made without consulting acumen thereby breaching the underwriting agreement,according to acumen were entered into general security accounting system as paid losses.acumen alleges that general security accounted for those losses in its financial statements without distinguishing among losses associated with commuted certificates underwritten by acumen and those underwritten by other companies.general security also stopped providing quarterly reports to acumen after december.
in,when the time came for general security to calculate the contingent commissions owed to acumen,it concluded that none were due.rather,it determined that,in the end,the certificates acumen underwrote generated losses for general security in excess of million.
acumen disputed that conclusion,maintaining that it was owed contingent commissions by general security,and,later in,it sued.acumen complaint framed the claims in two counts,one for breach of contract and a second for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.as relief,it sought principally compensatory and punitive damages.not long after acumen filed an amended complaint,general security moved for partial summary judgment on the issues of liability and punitive damages,as well as on acumen claim for attorney fees.in an order dated february,the district court dismissed,as duplicative of its breach of contract claim,acumen claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but denied as premature general security motion on the breach of contract claim itself the case then proceeded on that breach claim.
in that claim,framed in the complaint simply as count i breach of contract,acumen alleged that general security committed multiple breaches of the agreements by failing to provide acumen with quarterly financial reports unilaterally commuting certificates underwritten by acumen failing to consult with acumen before determining the profit if any it realized on any of acumen certificates and failing through poor data management,inter alia to perform a valid calculation of and to pay acumen contingent commissions.it did not specify damages attributable to each individual alleged breach.nor did it specify a particular quantum of damages for the count as a whole,instead asserting generally that it should receive the contingent commissions allegedly owed under the agreements 
after the close of discovery,general security moved again for summary judgment on liability and damages,and acumen filed its own motion for summary judgment on liability.the district court granted partial summary judgment in general security favor.acumen re mgmt.sec.ins,cv gbd,wl.treating the complaint count i as alleging five separate claims for breach,the court concluded as a matter of law that acumen failed to produce evidence sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude that general security had breached the contract in four of the five ways that acumen alleged id.at.as to one theory,however the argument that general security relied on inaccurate data in calculating the contingent commissions the court determined that a genuine dispute of material fact precluded an award of summary judgment.id.at.finally,with respect to damages,the court observed that acumen failed to go beyond its conclusory,speculative assertions to set forth with reasonable certainty evidence of some demonstrable harm with respect to any of the breach theories.id.at.thus,the court held that,even if acumen established at trial that general security relied on inaccurate data and thereby breached its contractual obligations,it would be entitled to recover only nominal damages id.
acumen moved for reconsideration or,alternatively,for entry of a partial judgment under rule b as to the dismissed claims.because the bulk of its case had been dismissed,acumen explained as follows in support of its request 
if acumen loses on the appeal of the remainder of its claims,it is unlikely to ask for a trial limited to nominal damages.if acumen prevails,a far larger trial will be necessary.either way,the limited trial on one sliver of the claim,for nominal damages,would have been a waste of time for the court and all parties.

discussion 
our jurisdiction over this appeal is bounded by,which empowers us to hear only appeals from final decisions of the federal district courts.united states ex rel.polansky pfizer,wl,at cir,internal citation omitted.general security argues that we lack jurisdiction because the order appealed from is not final as to any single claim.acumen responds that the district court appropriately certified its rejection of four of acumen five theories of breach under rule b,thus rendering that ruling a final judgment for jurisdictional purposes.acumen maintains that the theories of breach currently on appeal implicate factual and legal issues that are independent of the unresolved breach theory,and the different theories are therefore distinct claims as required for certification under rule b see,schwartz eaton,cir noting that rule b is applicable by its terms only to separate and distinct claims.
general security challenge to our jurisdiction is well founded.for the reasons described below,we conclude that acumen five theories of breach are not separate and distinct but are based on a single aggregate of operative facts and thus form a single claim.accordingly,the district court ruling was not amenable to certification under rule b,and we lack jurisdiction over this appeal 
the parties do not dispute that the district court judgment was partial that is,that the issue survived its entry we therefore have jurisdiction over this appeal,if at all,only by operation of a proper rule b certification.that rule,in conception,is an application of,not an exception to,the statutory instruction that appeals generally must abide final decision.tolson united states.rule b authorizes entry of a partial final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties only when three requirements have been satisfied there are multiple claims or parties at least one claim or the rights and liabilities of at least one party has been finally determined and the court makes an express determin ation that there is no just reason for delay.b see grand river enters.six nations pryor,cir.
in this case,the third requirement for rule b certification appears to be satisfied,since the district court expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay.see acumen,wl,at.the parties dispute,however,whether the district court judgment satisfied the first two criteria for certification.that is to say,they disagree as to whether the issue that survived the judgment amounts to a claim under rule b that is adequately distinct from the issues before us on appeal,or rather is part of a single claim that the district court disposed of only in part.if acumen five theories of breach constitute a single claim,then neither the first nor the second of rule b requirements has been satisfied here the action would involve only one claim and one party rather than more than one claim for relief or multiple parties,and no single claim will have been finally determined.accordingly,only if the district court adjudicated a claim distinct from the theory remaining below do we have jurisdiction over this appeal.see info,dun bradstreet,cir a n order dismissing only a portion of a claim is a ruling and s uch a ruling may not be certified.
we therefore turn to the task of determining whether the different theories of recovery presented by acumen are distinct claims for the purposes of rule b a task as to which our scope of review is broad.hudson river sloop clearwater,dep t of navy,cir.as one prominent treatise observes,however,the line between deciding one of several claims and deciding only part of a single claim is sometimes very obscure.wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.
over the years,our court has articulated several standards to aid in determining whether claims are separate for rule b purposes.we have defined a claim as the aggregate of operative facts which give rise to a right enforceable in the courts.gottesman motors,cir quoting original ballet russe ballet theatre,cir.in other circumstances,we have explained that for rule b purposes whether multiple claims are present turns on whether the issues are separate and distinct.hudson river sloop,at.only w hen the certified claims are based upon factual and legal questions that are distinct from those questions remaining before the trial court may the certified claims be considered separate claims under rule b.id.we examine the relationships among a plaintiff theories of recovery to determine whether they lend themselves to review as single units,or whether they are so interrelated and dependent upon each other as to be one indivisible whole.id.
we have also suggested that the existence of multiple claims turns on whether the underlying factual bases for recovery state a number of different claims which could have been separately enforced.rieser baltimore ohio,cir.commentators have interpreted this test to mean that when a claimant presents a number of legal theories,but will be permitted to recover only on one of them,there exists only a single claim for relief.wright,miller kane,supra.
our past decisions provide guidance in applying these standards.in gottesman,we held that allegations of malfeasance involving the purchase of different products presented distinct claims.f d at.there,the plaintiff shareholders of general motors alleged in a derivative action that a defendant had unlawfully dominated and controlled general motors in the purchase of various products ranging from automotive fabrics to freon refrigerant.each asserted cause of action concerned unlawful domination and control with respect to a particular product.id.at.observing that e ach product involves separate markets and commercial considerations,and d ifferent exhibits,proof and witnesses will be necessary different sets of operative facts will determine the results,we concluded that the allegations of misconduct regarding different products presented distinct claims.id.at.
in hudson river sloop,this court similarly concluded that a suit aimed at preventing the united states navy from stationing ships at staten island presented multiple claims.at.the plaintiffs there alleged that the navy had violated two federal statutes by,among other things,failing adequately to consider the environmental impact of the construction necessary to station the ships,as well as the environmental impact of conventional weapons on board the ships and failing adequately to disclose or consider the impact of nuclear weapons that might have been on board the ships.the district court granted partial summary judgment on the claims involving nuclear weapons and certified those claims under rule b,holding that any inquiry into the presence of nuclear weapons on the ships which the navy refused to confirm was barred by the national security doctrine.id.at.our court upheld the rule b certification,emphasizing that none of the claims remaining before the district court involved the deployment of nuclear weapons or classified information.thus,although the claims on appeal stem med from the same general objection,those claims involved a unique factual scenario deployment of nuclear weapons and raise d legal issues wholly distinct from those that remain for trial.id.at.accordingly,the claims on appeal were separate and distinct from those remaining before
