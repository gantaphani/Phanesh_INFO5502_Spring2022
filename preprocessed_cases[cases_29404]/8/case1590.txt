in this putative class action,electronic trading group,llc etg,a short seller,sues certain financial institutions that serve as prime brokers in short sale transactions it is alleged that the prime brokers arbitrarily designated certain securities as and then fixed the price for borrowing them,in violation of section of the sherman act,the antitrust claim three state law claims are also pleaded breach of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,and unjust enrichment collectively,the state law claims 
etg appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,dismissing the antitrust claim with prejudice on the ground of implied preclusion of the antitrust law by the securities law,and dismissing the state law claims without prejudice to refiling in state court.we affirm.
the preclusion analysis turns on four considerations identified in credit suisse securities usa llc billing,d whether the area of conduct is squarely within the heartland of securities regulations whether the securities and exchange commission sec has clear and adequate authority to regulate whether there is active and ongoing agency regulation and whether a serious conflict arises between antitrust law and securities regulations.
much depends on the level of particularity or generality at which each billing consideration is evaluated.obviously,if the inquiry is whether the sec actively regulates the pricing of borrowed shares,the plaintiff wins the point.by the same token,if the inquiry is whether short selling is within the heartland of securities regulations,the defendants win the point.
for the reasons set forth in this opinion,the fourth of a serious evaluated at the level of the alleged anticompetitive conduct.each of the three remaining considerations is evaluated at the level most useful to the court in achieving the overarching goal of avoiding conflict between the securities and antitrust regimes.
background 
short selling 
a short sale transaction proceeds in the following sequence.the short seller identifies securities she believes will drop in market price,borrows these securities from a broker prime brokers have the greatest market share,sells the borrowed securities on the open market,purchases replacement securities on the open market,and returns them to the closing the short seller position.the short seller profit if any is the difference between the market price at which she sold the borrowed securities and the market price at which she purchased the replacement securities,less borrowing fees,brokerage fees,interest,and any other charges levied by the broker.
b.the role of the prime brokers 
in the context of short selling,a prime broker locates the short seller requested securities,lends those securities to the short seller for a fee,and delivers those securities to the short seller purchaser.
a short seller seeking to borrow securities contacts the broker securities loan desk.pursuant to sec regulations,the securities loan desk must locate the requested securities before it can accept the short seller order.see b i iii.the securities loan desk may locate the securities in its own proprietary accounts,or in the hands of other brokers or institutional investors with significant long positions.alternatively,the securities loan desk may locate the securities through a third party who assists the broker in exchange for a locate fee.
the broker charges the short seller a borrowing fee affected by supply and demand the harder the security is to find and borrow,the higher the fee.the broker may develop an list of securities that are in abundant supply and a list of securities that are scarce.see short sales,exchange act release,sec docket july.
a short seller who has sold the borrowed securities on the open market must deliver those securities to the purchaser within three days of the transaction date.if the short seller broker does not deliver in time,a ftd occurs.
c.the borrowing fees conspiracy 
it is alleged that from april,to the present,the prime brokers charged artificially inflated borrowing fees by agreeing on which securities to designate arbitrarily as,and setting minimum borrowing fees for these securities.there are other allegations,set out in the margin,which we do not reach 
procedural history 
on march,the prime brokers moved to dismiss the antitrust claim pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.on june,the united states supreme court decided billing.on december,the district court applied billing,granted the prime brokers motion to dismiss the antitrust claim under rule b,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims etg timely appealed the district court decision,arguing principally that the district court misapplied billing.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of a rule b motion de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff favor,and accepting as true all the factual allegations in the complaint.in re elevator antitrust,cir per curiam internal quotation marks,citations,and brackets omitted.
credit suisse securities usa llc billing,d,was an antitrust action against underwriting firms that marketed and distributed shares in initial public offerings ipo.the plaintiffs alleged that the underwriters unlawfully agreed with one another that they would not sell shares of a popular new issue to a buyer unless that buyer committed to buy additional shares of that security later at escalating prices a practice called laddering,to pay unusually high commissions on subsequent security purchases from the underwriters,or to purchase from the underwriters other less desirable securities a practice called tying.id.at.
the supreme court ruled that federal securities law implicitly precluded application of the antitrust law to the underwriters alleged anticompetitive conduct.the court articulated four considerations that bear upon whether the securities laws are clearly incompatible with the application of the antitrust laws in a particular context a location within the heartland of securities regulations b sec authority to regulate c ongoing sec regulation and d conflict between the two regimes.id.at.in selecting the level of particularity at which to address each consideration,we draw guidance from the specifics of the supreme court analysis in billing,without suggesting,however,that the level of particularity applied to each consideration in this case is prescriptive in every context.
to ascertain whether the possible conflict between securities law and antitrust law affects practices that lie squarely within an area of financial market activity that the securities law seeks to regulate,the supreme court looked to the broad underlying market activity.billing,at.in deciding that the antitrust allegations concern practices that lie at the very heart of the securities marketing enterprise,the court considered the activities in question,which were found to consist of the underwriters efforts jointly to promote and to sell newly issued securities.id.accordingly,the court focused on whether t he ipo process the underlying market activity in billing was within the heartland and ruled that it was it did not focus on the laddering and tying arrangements the alleged anticompetitive conduct in billing.id.this analysis suggests that the first consideration is properly evaluated at the level of the underlying market activity.
accordingly,in this case,we consider whether short selling is within the heartland of the securities business.the district court found that the liquidity and pricing benefits created by the short sales place these transactions within the heartland of federal securities regulation and are central to the proper functioning of capital markets.in re short sale antitrust,d,quoting billing,at.etg itself recognizes that short selling is market activity regulated by the securities law.appellant reply br.
short underlying market activity in this an area of conduct squarely within the heartland of securities regulations.billing,at.the first consideration thus weighs in favor of implied preclusion.
authority to regulate 
to ascertain the existence of regulatory authority under the securities law to supervise the activities in question in billing,at,the supreme court looked to the role of the underwriters in the ipo process as well as to the alleged laddering and tying arrangements,see id.at.the court determined that the law grants the sec authority to supervise all of the activities here in question.indeed,the sec possesses considerable power to forbid,permit,encourage,discourage,tolerate,limit,and otherwise regulate virtually every aspect of the practices in which underwriters engage.id.at.the court thus gauged regulation of activity that is more particular than the ipo process the underlying market activity and more general than the laddering and tying arrangements the alleged anticompetitive conduct.
in addition,the court cited regulations that grant the sec power to regulate communications between underwriting participants and their customers,including those that occur during road shows,which suggests that the court also gauged regulation of the specific alleged anticompetitive conduct.id.at.
accordingly,we consider the existence of sec authority to regulate i the role of the prime brokers in short selling,and ii the borrowing fees charged by prime brokers.we find such authority in section a,section,and c d and b.
section a of the securities exchange act of provides that it is unlawful t o effect a short sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange,in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.a.citing legislative history,etg argues that section a was intended only to regulate the manipulation of share price through short selling.see appellant br.however,nothing in the wording of section a so limits its reach and the sec has interpreted section a as a grant of plenary authority to regulate short sales of securities registered on a national securities exchange short sales,exchange act release.proposed.the sec thus has the authority to regulate the role of the prime brokers in short selling,as well as the borrowing fees charged by the prime brokers,pursuant to section a.
section of the securities exchange act of provides that the sec may permit a national securities exchange,by rule,to impose a schedule or fix rates of commissions,allowances,discounts,or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions if such fees are reasonable and do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate to further the purposes of the securities law.e b.etg characterizes section as a grant of limited authority to permit exchanges to deviate from the general prohibition on fixed commission rates.appellant br.even accepting this characterization,the sec thus has indirect authority to regulate the rates including the borrowing fees charged by the prime brokers in short selling.
in billing,the supreme court relied in part on c d and b as evidence of the sec broad power to define and prevent fraudulent,deceptive,and manipulative conduct by brokers and dealers.at.these provisions apply with equal force to the role of the prime brokers in short selling and the borrowing fees they charge.
this second billing as it is on whether the sec has authority to regulate the role of the prime brokers in short selling and the borrowing fees charged by the prime weighs in favor of implied preclusion,even though none of the provisions discussed above explicitly references the regulation of borrowing fees.
ongoing regulation 
to evaluate evidence that the responsible regulatory entities exercise their authority,billing,at,the supreme court looked to the role of the underwriters in the ipo process,see id.at.the court determined that the sec has continuously exercised its legal authority to regulate conduct of the general kind now at issue.it has defined in detail,for example,what underwriters may and may not do and say during their road shows.id.the court thus looked to activity more particular than the ipo process the underlying market activity and more general than the laddering and tying arrangements the alleged anticompetitive conduct.
in this case,we therefore consider whether there is ongoing sec regulation of the role of the prime brokers.ample evidence reveals that the sec exercises its authority to regulate the role of the prime brokers in short selling.a ctive and ongoing agency regulation is evidenced by regulation sho and a recent sec roundtable.id.at.
regulation sho,adopted by the sec in,imposes a locate requirement on brokers involved in short selling.see b i iii a broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order in an equity security from another person unless the broker or dealer has i b orrowed the security,or entered into a arrangement to borrow the security or ii r easonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due.regulation sho also imposes a delivery requirement on such brokers.see b with certain enumerated exceptions,i f a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for thirteen consecutive settlement days,the participant shall immediately thereafter close out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.regulation sho thus constitutes an exercise of the sec authority to supervise the role of the prime brokers in short selling.
on september,at the time of oral argument in this appeal,the sec hosted a roundtable regarding securities lending and short sales.securities lending and short sale roundtable,exchange act release,wl,at,announcing the roundtable.the roundtable intended to focus on a range of securities lending topics,such as current lending practices and participants,compensation arrangements and conflicts,the benefits and risks of securities lending,risks related to cash collateral reinvestment,improvements to transparency,and consideration of whether the securities lending regulatory regime can be improved for the benefit of investors.id.the roundtable also intended to focus on short sale disclosure topics and addressed the potential impact of imposing a or enhanced locate requirement on short sellers as a way to curtail abusive naked short selling.id.this roundtable indicates active sec monitoring of the role of the prime brokers in short selling.
etg complaint implicitly confirms active regulation.the complaint affirmatively alleges,presumably to flesh out claims of wrongdoing,that certain prime brokers have been fined for not borrowing securities or failing to enter into agreements to borrow securities that are sold in short sale transactions having reasonable grounds to believe that the securities could be borrowed so that they could be delivered on the delivery due date,compl,and that federal prosecutors and the new york stock exchange have launched a joint investigation into certain prime brokers alleged price gouging by artificially inflating borrowing fees and by charging fees for which no services were rendered,id.a fair inference from these allegations is that the sec and securities organizations actively exercise regulatory authority over the role of the prime brokers in short selling.
regulation sho and the recent roundtable do not focus on the regulation of borrowing fees the particular conduct alleged to be anticompetitive but it is enough for this purpose that the sec ongoing regulation is focused on the role of the prime brokers in short selling.the third consideration thus weighs in favor of implied preclusion.
to ascertain the risk that the securities and antitrust laws,if both applicable,would produce conflicting guidance,requirements,duties,privileges,or standards of conduct,billing,at,the supreme court considered whether allowing antitrust liability for the conduct alleged to have the anticompetitive effect would inhibit permissible and even beneficial market behavior.see id.at.and the threat of antitrust mistakes,results that stray outside the narrow bounds that plaintiffs seek to set,m
