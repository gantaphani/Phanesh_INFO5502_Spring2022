leon lewis and brookdale university hospital and medical center brookdale,appeal a million verdict in favor of plaintiff chanel armstrong chanel entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sterling johnson,judge.
three verdict sheet errors and the confusion they generated caused the jury in this tort action to render a verdict in favor of plaintiff on one a medical procedure without informed with its answers to specific interrogatories and to fail to reach another which interrogatory answers suggested it may have found in plaintiff favor.concluding that the verdict sheet errors deprived both defendant and plaintiff of a fair trial,we vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial on the uninformed consent and battery claims.because there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict against brookdale,we reverse that portion of the judgment and remand for entry of judgment in brookdale favor.
background 
on april,chanel,then eleven years old,looked out her bedroom window and saw something moving in a bag on a ledge of the building.chanel called her sister,tashawn,who climbed onto the roof and rescued an infant from the bag.tashawn then called and,following the operator directions,tied off the baby umbilical cord.shortly thereafter,emergency medical service personnel and police came to the apartment where chanel lived.they suggested that chanel was the baby mother and that she had thrown it out the window.when chanel mother,carol armstrong carol,arrived home,the officers repeated their accusations and insisted that carol bring chanel to a hospital for an examination,suggesting that the only alternative was chanel detention.
chanel and carol claimed that at brookdale,where the officers took them,lewis and hani takla,resident physicians,examined chanel without her consent and over the physical and verbal protests of both mother and daughter.the extent of the examinations is not entirely clear from the testimony,but both doctors admittedly touched chanel,and lewis admitted that he touched her vulva and separated her labia.the purpose of both examinations was to ensure that chanel had not recently given birth to a baby,and,together,they established that it was highly unlikely that chanel had given birth.
in february,chanel settled a lawsuit against new york city,its police department,the new york city housing authority,the new york city police department,and several police officers for.she then sued lewis takla mohammad rahman,a pediatric emergency room attending physician darryl coach,a brookdale social worker and brookdale.although chanel made many claims,including alleged violations of sections and,which provided the jurisdictional basis for her suit,the only claims that remain relevant are medical malpractice against takla,lewis,and rahman violation of new york public health law,which governs the circumstances under which a health provider can be held liable for its failure to obtain informed consent before performing a medical procedure,against lewis direct and vicarious hospital negligence and battery against takla and lewis.
in response to a verdict sheet,which is reproduced in pertinent part in appendix a,the jury found that none of the defendants had engaged in malpractice in treating chanel they were next asked,in question iii,whether takla,lewis,or rahman obtain ed plaintiff consent to perform his examination the jury answered,no for each defendant.the verdict sheet then instructed the jury to proceed to question iii proximate cause if it found no consent and to question iii if it found that carol or chanel consented to the examinations.questions iii through included factors relevant to whether new york public health law precluded an award of damages to chanel based on defendants failure to obtain informed consent prior to examining her.most obviously,a plaintiff can not recover damages for lack of informed consent if the doctor obtained her consent after giving her appropriate information.see pub.health.nor can the plaintiff recover for an uninformed consent if the procedure was simply diagnostic and did not involve invasion or disruption of the integrity of the body or the procedure was required because of an emergency.see id.finally,recovery is only possible if a reasonably prudent person in the patient position would not have undergone the treatment or diagnosis if he had been fully informed.id.
following the verdict sheet instructions,the jury moved to the proximate cause question and found that the doctors examinations were a substantial factor in causing chanel injuries.it awarded no damages against takla,against lewis,and against rahman.
the jury next answered yes to question iv,whether the hospital conduct was contrary to the standard of care for general hospitals.the following question,iv,asked whether the hospital deviation from the standard was a proximate cause of plaintiff injuries.it provided no space for an answer,but instructed that if the answer was yes,the jury should proceed to question iv.in response to question iv,the jury awarded chanel million for past and future pain and suffering.
the instructions for the battery question,vi,included an admonition that the jury could not find battery with respect to any defendant that it had found liable for any form of negligence.in compliance with those instructions,the jury answered none of the battery questions 
after the court finished reading the jury answers with respect to the informed consent cause of action,defense counsel said there are some questions that we skipped over in doing the verdict every question in each section has to be answered.the court read the remainder of the jury responses and then sent the jury back to the jury room while the attorneys conferred.
defense counsel then said your honor,i do think this is the verdict,because they have not finished all of the questions.there a lot of questions that were skipped over by the jury.he then pointed out that the jury had not answered the proximate cause question on the hospital malpractice claim.
after the court suggested that the section question had been answered completely,defense counsel said,a ctually,not completely.a law clerk in attendance then added,f ailed to answer question number,question number,question number,which are all predicate steps in getting to an ultimate decision.plaintiff counsel then noted that the jury had not answered the battery question.the court responded,did i say,in the instructions,if there is a decision with respect to negligence,you can not have battery.but they still have to answer it right plaintiff counsel agreed.however,defense counsel said,i do think they have to answer it,according to the court instruction to them.
the court then instructed the jury to answer parts through of question iii and the proximate cause question on the hospital negligence.the jury found that neither a procedure nor a diagnostic procedure involving invasion or disruption of bodily integrity had occurred none of the doctors,before obtaining plaintiff consent to the procedure,provide d appropriate information a reasonably prudent person in plaintiff position would not have given consent if she had been given appropriate information and the hospital negligence was the proximate cause of chanel injuries.
plaintiff counsel pointed out that there was an inconsistency between the jury finding that the procedure was neither a nor an invasive diagnostic procedure and its award of damages and said,i do know if the court can give them an instruction as to that.defense counsel responded your honor,it my position that what their answers are,that the verdict.plaintiff counsel argued that the jury intent was to award damages and they might be just confused by the question.
over objection from defense counsel,the court recalled the jury and said 
foreperson,i tell you what our confusion was.when you had the original verdict form,you came back,i think you answered number,and you had awarded damages against takla,lewis and rahman,and you had not answered,and.now with respect to question number,there is an inconsistency between and.if you have and award damages and whatever your decision is,then the no for number is inconsistent.do you understand what i talking about 
the foreman responded o kay,and the court said,w hatever you want to do,i want you to go back and talk about it,and then come back out.the foreman explained that the jury originally did not answer parts,and,of question iii because the verdict sheet instructed the jurors to go to part proximate cause if they found there was no consent in response to part.a clerk then said that the instruction to go to part was a typo.the court furnished the jury with a clean verdict sheet,which instructed the jurors to answer part of question whether they answered part yes or 
using the new verdict sheet,the jury again found that neither chanel nor carol consented to the examinations.the jury changed its answer to iii,finding this time that the examination was neither emergency treatment nor a diagnostic procedure not involving invasion or disruption of the body.by answering iii no for all three defendants,the jury again found that none of the defendants had given chanel or carol appropriate information about the examination.however,by changing its answer from no to yes in response to iii,the jury also found that a reasonably prudent person given appropriate information would have consented to the examinations.then,following the instruction after iii to proceed to question if it had answered yes to iii,the jury found that the procedure or examination was a substantial factor in causing injury to plaintiff.it awarded the same damages.the jury also answered all questions on the hospital malpractice favorably to the plaintiff and awarded damages as it had previously.it did not answer any of the battery questions.
the district court subsequently granted motions for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b as to the public health law verdict against rahman and for setoff of the plaintiff received in settlement of her lawsuit against the municipal defendants.the district court denied defendants remaining motions under federal rules of civil procedure b and.
defendants filed a timely appeal,and plaintiffs a timely.the was subsequently dismissed for failure to file required forms.defendants contend in relevant part that various inconsistencies in the verdict warrant reversal or remand for a new trial under new york law,plaintiff can not recover for emotional suffering on a negligence claim absent physical injury or exceptional circumstances and the evidence was legally insufficient to support the malpractice verdict against the hospital.defendants raise numerous other arguments that are mooted by our disposition of the listed issues.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court disposition of the motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.cobb pozzi,cir.an order denying a new trial,however,may be reversed only if the district court abused its discretion.tesser board of,cir.a motion for a new trial ordinarily should not be granted unless the trial court is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.id.
ii.consent in battery and informed claims.
to recover for medical malpractice,a plaintiff must ordinarily show that her doctor deviated from the standard of care practiced by reasonably prudent doctor s in her locality.nestorowich ricotta.however,even where the doctor adhered to the requisite standard of care in performing a procedure or conducting an examination,the patient may recover for injuries she suffered as a result of the procedure or examination if the doctor failed to obtain her informed consent and the claim is not barred by failure to demonstrate one of the several showings required by new york public health law.see suria shiffman.
for the convenience of the reader,we set forth the relevant portions of section.
limitation of medical,dental or podiatric malpractice action based on lack of informed consent 
lack of informed consent means the failure of the person providing the professional treatment or diagnosis to disclose to the patient such alternatives thereto and the reasonably foreseeable risks and benefits involved as a reasonable medical,dental,or podiatric practitioner under similar circumstances would have disclosed,in a manner permitting the patient to make a knowledgeable evaluation.
the right of action to recover for medical,dental or podiatric malpractice based on a lack of informed consent is limited to those cases involving either a treatment,procedure or surgery,or b a diagnostic procedure which involved invasion or disruption of the integrity of the body.
for a cause of action therefor it must also be established that a reasonably prudent person in the patient position would not have undergone the treatment or diagnosis if he had been fully informed and that the lack of informed consent is a proximate cause of the injury or condition for which recovery is sought.
pub.health law.
battery lies against a person who intentionally touches another person,without that person consent,and causes an offensive bodily contact the intent required for battery is intent to cause a bodily contact that a reasonable person would find offensive.jeffreys griffin,quoting new york pattern jury instructions.
thus,a completely unpermitted touching by a medical practitioner of a patient is a battery as distinct from a section claim.see,cross colen,dep t claim sounded in battery where plaintiff only claim is that she simply did not consent to the procedure,and indeed expressly rejected it laskowitz ciba vision,dep t a problem in informed consent arises when a physician or other therapist obtains a consent to treatment adequate to insulate him from prosecution for criminal assault and from liability in a civil assault or battery action,but when,nonetheless,the patient contends that consent would have been withheld if an adequate disclosure had been made concerning his condition as well as the potential dangers of and alternatives to the proposed procedure or therapy.based on these decisions,we conclude that battery applies in the medical context only where the patient or her guardian gives no consent and the doctor intends to cause a bodily contact that a reasonable person would find offensive.jeffreys,at.on the other hand,an informed consent violation occurs when the doctor obtains consent without giving the patient appropriate information concerning risks and alternatives.see pub.health law.
iii.the verdict sheets.
with this background in mind,we turn to the original verdict sheet treatment of the informed consent and battery claims.when the jury held that the doctors did not obtain carol consent in response to question iii,they were directed to determine whether this failure was a proximate cause of chanel injuries.their affirmative response led them to assess damages.this was error disadvantaging the defendants because,in order to find for the plaintiff on an informed consent theory,the jury must also find that the procedure was invasive,that it was not required by emergency conditions,that the doctors failed to give appropriate advice,and that a reasonable person given appropriate advice would have consented.
defense counsel pointed out the error to the jury,and the court rectified it in part,requiring the jury to answer parts,and of question iii.however,despite plaintiff request,the district court did not ask the jury to answer the battery questions,which they had not reached because they found negligence in response to question iii.
this the informed consent claim,but not the battery the jury was disadvantageous to the infant plaintiff.the jury initial finding that takla and lewis touched plaintiff without her consent suggests that it might have found for plaintiff on the battery claim had it not been advised that it could not find battery if it found a species of negligence including failing to give the plaintiff appropriate information.
when answers to special interrogatories are consistent with each other but inconsistent with the general verdict,the court may either enter judgment in a
