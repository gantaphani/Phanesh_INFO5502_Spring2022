are parties to an arbitration in new york.the arbitrators in that dispute issued a subpoena directing to produce documents and electronic data.petitioner chose to ignore the subpoena,and respondents filed a motion to compel compliance in the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer.the district court granted the motion to compel,over petitioner objection that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal.
we hold,as an initial matter,that where an order compelling compliance with an arbitrator subpoena disposes of the entire case,it is a final order for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction.in addition,we hold that the federal arbitration act does not authorize nationwide service of process and therefore the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over appellant.because we lack personal jurisdiction,we find it unnecessary to address whether the federal arbitration act authorizes the issuance of subpoenas to third parties.
background 
trammochem chartered a vessel from moller maersk gas carriers and igloo shipping,the vessel owners to transport cargo from houston,texas to antwerp,belgium.the charter party contained an arbitration clause,which required arbitration to take place in new york city.the vessel owners hired inert gas systems,to perform services on the vessel in houston in preparation for use by trammochem,and inert gas systems,engaged dynegy midstream services dms to provide certain facilities and supplies.after the cargo arrived in belgium,a dispute arose between trammochem and the vessel owners because the cargo had become contaminated,possibly while the vessel was in houston.pursuant to the charter party,this dispute was submitted to arbitration.
a report prepared by captain bert desmet,a member of the nautical commission to the commercial court at antwerp,concluded that the most likely cause of the contamination was dms system.on november,moller attempted to vouch dms into the arbitration,demanding that dms defend and indemnify it.dms refused to participate in the arbitration.dms contends this was because it did not have sufficient time to prepare to participate in the arbitration,and it decided it would be preferable strategically to attempt to limit the extent to which it would be bound by the arbitration.
on february,the arbitrators issued a subpoena requiring dms to produce documents related to dms system at an office in houston at on march.this subpoena was served on dms registered agent in houston on february.dms refused to comply,apparently again because of concern about the preclusive impact of any participation in the arbitration.respondents filed a motion to compel in the southern district of new york.it is undisputed that dms has no contacts with new york.dms argued that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over it.the district court disagreed,and ordered dms to comply with the subpoena.
discussion 
this case raises jurisdictional issues connected to the subpoena power of arbitrators under the federal arbitration act faa.section of the faa empowers arbitrators to summon in writing any person to attend before them or any of them as a witness and in a proper case to bring with him or them any book,record,document,or paper which may be deemed material as evidence in the case.such a summons must be served in the same manner as subpoenas to appear and testify before the court and may be enforced by the district court for the district in which such arbitrators,or a majority of them,are sitting.id.section of the faa provides for appeal from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.a.
appellate jurisdiction 
although neither party contests appellate jurisdiction in this case,we have an independent duty to determine whether such jurisdiction exists.see arnold lucks,cir e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction internal quotation marks omitted henrietta giuliani,cir noting obligation to raise issue of jurisdiction sua sponte where it is questionable.a recent decision of our court questioned,without deciding,whether an order compelling compliance with an arbitrator subpoena is a final order for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction.see sa celanese ag,cir.we hold that where,as here,an order compelling compliance disposes of all issues before the district court,it is a final order and immediately appealable.
because faa section allows appeal from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title,we must decide whether the district court order compelling compliance with the subpoena is a final decision within the meaning of this section.a.the supreme court has interpreted this section according to the and longstanding meaning of final decision.green tree fin.randolph,d.a final decision ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.quoting,inter alia,digital equip.desktop direct,d.
under traditional finality principles,a district court decision to compel compliance with a subpoena or to deny a motion to quash a subpoena is generally not a final decision and therefore is not immediately appealable,at.to obtain appellate review,the subpoenaed party must defy the district court enforcement order,be held in contempt,and then appeal the contempt order,which is regarded as final united states constr.prods.research,cir citing,inter alia,united states ryan,d.the same rule applies where the witness is a.dove atl.capital,cir citing alexander united states.the purpose of this rule is to prevent the temporary halt of the litigation process that would be required by an appeal from an order enforcing a subpoena.see constr.prods.research,at citing reich eng g contracting,cir.
although this rule applies in civil,criminal,and grand jury proceedings,a different rule applies to the enforcement of agency subpoenas,which may be appealed immediately without first performing the ritual of obtaining a contempt order,at quoting constr.prods.research,at.this is because at least from the district court perspective,the court enforcement of an agency subpoena arises out of a proceeding that may be deemed,so far as the judiciary is concerned t here is not any further judicial inquiry which would be halted were the offending subpoenaed party permitted to appeal.id.at internal quotations marks omitted.
in we noted certain interests that might favor requiring a party to be held in contempt before appealing.id.at.section of the faa permits a district court to punish failure to comply with an arbitrator subpoena for contempt in the same manner provided by law for securing the attendance of witnesses or their punishment for neglect or refusal to attend in the courts of the united states,potentially suggesting that the general rule for challenging court subpoenas would apply,at.in addition,courts have a interest in preventing arbitrations from being slowed down by,or burdened by the expense of,piecemeal appeals of every subpoena issued by an arbitration panel.id.citing encyclopaedia universalis encyclopaedia britannica,cir see also moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d congress clear intent,in the arbitration act,was to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.
however,the extent to which arbitration would be delayed by appeals of orders enforcing subpoenas is unclear.in this case,the parties agreed at oral argument that the arbitration between trammochem and the vessel owners has proceeded,despite dms refusal to participate,while this appeal has been pending.in addition,the reference to the district court contempt powers in section does not set up a proceeding,where the district court first enforces an arbitration panel subpoena and then has to issue a contempt order for.the language suggests,rather,that the district court has two simultaneous options instead of two sequential steps the district court may compel the attendance of such person or persons before said arbitrator or arbitrators,or punish said person or person
