an alien firm resettlement in a third country prior to arrival in the united states bars the alien from obtaining asylum here.see b a vi.on this petition for review of an order of removal,we are asked to consider whether the government prima facie showing of firm resettlement may be rebutted by an alien showing that his ties to the third country into which he fled before coming here were formed before his last flight from persecution.see a.we concluded that firm resettlement is determined from the totality of the circumstances,and that even ties formed in the third country prior to an alien last flight from persecution are relevant to that determination.accordingly,we deny this petition for review.
the following facts,derived from findings made by the immigration judge ij at the asylum hearing,are undisputed before this court.etienne tchitchui,a year old native and citizen of cameroon,is openly a member of the social democratic front sdf,the main opposition to the ruling party,the cameroon people democratic movement.in the late,tchitchui family members,who were concerned about his association with the sdf,encouraged him to leave cameroon.in,tchitchui accepted his uncle offer to finance his relocation and went to chile,where he resided for a year and a half while studying spanish.in,tchitchui traveled directly from chile to guatemala and opened an internet café.he remained in guatemala for approximately a year before returning to cameroon,so that he could support the sdf efforts in the upcoming elections.tchitchui arrived in cameroon in may,but within four months,his family convinced him to leave.in september,tchitchui returned to guatemala,where he continued to operate his small business.
tchitchui remained in guatemala for nearly three years.during this time,he sold his internet café for a profit,opened a restaurant,and obtained permanent resident status.sometime in,tchitchui visited his family in cameroon and attempted to convince them that he should move back to that country.as a result of the increasingly tense political climate in cameroon,however,he was unable to gain support for his plan.thus,tchitchui returned to guatemala and continued his life there.
in december,tchitchui returned to cameroon for three weeks.on january,he and his family were seized by the police.tchitchui was detained for four days,during which time he was repeatedly beaten by the officers,who indicated that their actions were a result of his affiliation with the sdf.upon his release,tchitchui returned to guatemala,where he remained for approximately eight weeks.during this time,he sold his restaurant business and applied to a culinary program in the united states.on march,tchitchui legally entered the united states as a visitor with authorization to remain for a temporary period of time.
tchitchui overstayed his visa,so that in may,the department of homeland security the government charged tchitchui with removability pursuant to the immigration and nationality act.tchitchui responded by applying for asylum and withholding of removal.upon consideration of his application,the ij denied tchitchui asylum,concluding that he was mandatorily barred as he had firmly resettled in guatemala prior to arriving in the united states,but granted him withholding of removal to cameroon.tchitchui appealed,but the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision.tchitchui now petitions for review.

discussion 
the immigration and nationality act provides that asylum may be granted to an alien who has applied for asylum if the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general determines that such alien is a refugee.b a see liao holder,cir.the act,however,also places a mandatory bar on the grant of asylum if an applicant was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the united states.b a vi c i b liao,at see salazar ashcroft,cir.the regulations provide a definition of firm resettlement,stating that a n alien is considered to be firmly resettled if,prior to arrival in the united states,he or she entered into another country with,or while in that country received,an offer of permanent resident status,citizenship,or some other type of permanent resettlement.
the government bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of firm resettlement by a totality of the circumstances.makadji gonzales,cir sall gonzales,cir per curiam see also mussie ins,cir.once the government has established a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the applicant to show that he or she qualifies for one of the two enumerated exceptions.makadji,at sall,at.the first such exception requires an applicant to establish t hat his or her entry into that country was a necessary consequence of his or her flight from persecution,that he or she remained in that country only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel,and that he or she did not establish significant ties in that country.a liao,at.to qualify for this exception,an applicant must satisfy each of these three prongs.salazar,at.the second exception,which is not at issue here,requires an applicant to establish t hat the conditions of his or her residence in that country were so substantially and consciously restricted by the authority of the country of refuge that he or she was not in fact resettled.b.
on the agency level,tchitchui application for asylum was denied because both the ij and the bia held that the government established a prima facie case of firm resettlement and that tchitchui did not establish his eligibility for either exception.specifically,the bia reasoned that tchitchui established significant ties in guatemala prior to arrival in the united states considering the totality of the circumstances see.tchitchui now challenges the legality of this determination,claiming that his ties to guatemala prior to his departure from cameroon on january,are irrelevant because he was not persecuted in cameroon until january.in essence,tchitchui argues that a limits the scope of the significant ties inquiry to his conduct this claim lacks merit.
it is well established that the ij and bia should apply a totality of the circumstances test to firm resettlement determinations under b a vi,the touchstone of which is whether the applicant has found an alternative place of refuge abroad.sall,at.as we observed in liao,this test embodies the purpose of the regulations,which is to provide refuge to desperate refugees who reach our shores with nowhere else to turn.at internal quotation marks omitted.the totality of tchitchui activities in guatemala including those in to december,therefore,are relevant to the question of whether his permanent residency in guatemala created a place to turn to seek refuge when he fled cameroon.
we agree with our sister circuits that the temporal reference,prior to arrival in the united states,in,which is borrowed almost directly from the statutory language in u.b a vi,applies to all subsequent language in the regulation,including the third prong of the exception at issue here.abdalla ins,cir considering longstanding and significant family ties in the uae sultani gonzales,cir considering petitioner application for refugee status,which was made before flight from persecution ali reno,cir considering denmark grant of refugee status,which was obtained by petitioner during her flight from persecution.tchitchui has not pointed us to any statutory or regulatory language or to any rule of construction that supports a narrower reading of the temporal reference.a plain reading of the statutory language,therefore,means that
