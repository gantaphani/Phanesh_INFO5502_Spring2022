this case calls upon us to determine whether federal admiralty jurisdiction extends to tort claims arising from a physical altercation among recreational visitors on and around a permanent dock surrounded by navigable water.we hold that federal admiralty jurisdiction does not reach the claims at issue here,because this type of incident does not have a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce.
petitioners appellants sapna tandon and robert doohan,iii,are the owners of the up and over,a fiberglass powerboat designed for recreational purposes.on may,visitors on the up and over were involved in a fistfight on a floating dock operated by claimant appellee captain cove marina of bridgeport,captain cove.at least one person was seriously injured in the fight.tandon and doohan subsequently filed a petition for limitation of in the united states district court for the district of connecticut hall,seeking to limit their tort liability for the incident.the district court dismissed their petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,holding that this case falls outside the general grant of admiralty jurisdiction in.we now affirm.
background 
factual background 
captain cove operates a marina in bridgeport,connecticut,on the waters of black rock harbor and cedar creek,which open onto long island sound.the marina facilities include a dockside restaurant,several docks extending from the dry land into the harbor,and a floating dock the south dock accessible only by water.a water taxi runs from the south dock to the restaurant and other facilities.
on may,tandon and doohan took several on the up and over on a social trip to captain cove.they docked the up and over by the marina restaurant,and proceeded inside for food and drinks.claimant appellee ryan ulbrick,who had also been invited along,arrived at captain cove by car and met the others there.
at about the same time,third party defendant appellee frank genna and two companions also made a social visit to captain cove.they arrived in a boat owned by one of genna companions,moored at the south dock,and then took a water taxi to the marina restaurant.genna and his companions were not previously acquainted with tandon,doohan,or their companions.
both parties left the restaurant at about the same time.as tandon,doohan,and their passengers were boarding the up and over,one of those passengers fell into the water and injured himself.genna and his companions laughed at the mishap,leading the passengers on the up and over to yell unspecified but presumably unfriendly comments in response.genna and his companions then boarded the water taxi to return to the south dock,and both the up and over and the water taxi left the main docks.
at that point,the parties accounts diverge somewhat.according to an affidavit filed by ulbrick,the water taxi headed slightly northeast,toward the north end of the south dock,while the up and over headed southwest down the channel toward long island sound.as the up and over was making its way down the channel,tandon noticed that the passenger who fell while boarding the up and over was bleeding from a scalp wound.she therefore asked doohan,who was piloting the boat,to pull over and moor so that she could examine the passenger injuries.according to the state court complaint filed by genna,on the other hand,the up and over followed in hot pursuit of the water taxi toward the south dock.meanwhile,its passengers yelled and screamed at genna and his companions,and at one point threw a beer bottle at them.
the parties agree that both the up and over and the water taxi docked at the south dock,where a fistfight broke out between genna party and the passengers of the up and over.during the fight,one passenger from the up and over hit genna,knocking him off of the south dock into the water.according to ulbrick,genna landed in the water and appeared unconscious according to genna,he was physically held underwater to the point of asphyxia.genna claims that he suffered severe injuries from the lack of oxygen,including cardiac arrest,respiratory failure,hypoxic encephalopathy resulting in permanent brain damage,and failure.
procedural background 
genna and his wife donna genna together,the gennas filed suit in connecticut state court against captain cove and several persons affiliated with it together,the captain cove defendants they alleged that the captain cove defendants were liable for genna injuries,and for donna genna resulting loss of consortium,under theories of negligent supervision,negligence,and reckless dispensing of liquor,and also under the connecticut dram shop act the captain cove defendants responded by filing a complaint against tandon,doohan,and their passengers on the up and over including ulbrick.in that complaint,the captain cove defendants sought contribution and indemnity for any damages they might be required to pay the gennas.the gennas then filed a second amended complaint adding tandon,doohan,and the passengers on the up and over as defendants,and asserting claims against them for negligence,recklessness,assault and battery,and conspiracy 
tandon and doohan proceeded to file a petition for limitation of liability in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,initiating the present case.that petition asked the district court to either exonerate tandon and doohan from liability for the incident at captain cove,or else limit their liability to the value of the up and over appraised at.in accordance with the normal rules governing limitation proceedings,the district court stayed the pending state court proceedings and ordered that notice be sent to all persons asserting claims with respect to the incident.the gennas,the captain cove defendants,and ulbrick all filed claims in the limitation proceeding two other passengers on the up and over,michael hermann and robert barbieri,also filed notices of potential claims.
ulbrick then moved to dismiss the petition under federal rule of civil procedure b,asserting that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the district court agreed.applying the jurisdictional analysis laid out in jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d,the district court held that the alleged torts at issue in this case failed both the location test and the connection test for federal admiralty jurisdiction.it held the location test was not met because the fight in which genna was injured took place primarily on the south dock,and this floating dock was properly considered an extension of land because it remained permanently in a fixed location.it also held that the connection test was not met because the type of incident involved which the district court characterized as a fight on a dock did not have a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce.the district court therefore dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
tandon and doohan then filed the present appeal.we have jurisdiction under,and now affirm.

standard of review 
when reviewing a district court determination of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.close new york,cir.in resolving a motion to dismiss under rule b,the district court must take all uncontroverted facts in the complaint or petition as true,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party asserting jurisdiction.see amidax trading grp.scrl,cir per curiam.but w here jurisdictional facts are placed in dispute,the court has the power and obligation to decide issues of fact by reference to evidence outside the pleadings,such as affidavits.apwu potter,cir quoting leblanc cleveland,cir.in that case,the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it exists.makarova united states,cir.
admiralty jurisdiction 
under our constitution,the federal judicial power extends to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.const.art.iii,cl.congress has codified that jurisdiction at,which gives federal district courts original jurisdiction over a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.see vasquez gmd shipyard,cir.the primary purpose of federal admiralty jurisdiction is to protect commercial shipping with uniform rules of conduct.mlc fishing,velez,cir per curiam quoting vasquez,at.
in this case,tandon and doohan invoked the district court admiralty jurisdiction by filing a petition for exoneration from or limitation of liability.that petition is a form of action peculiar to the admiralty and maritime context.it seeks the protection of the limitation of liability act,first enacted by congress in to encourage and to induce capitalists to invest money in this branch of industry.lewis lewis clark marine,d quoting norwich wright,wall.under the present version of this statute,the liability of the owner of a vessel for any claim,debt,or liability covered by the act shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight.a.it applies broadly,limiting the owner liability for any claims arising from embezzlement,loss,or destruction of any property,goods,or merchandise shipped or put on board the vessel,any loss,damage,or injury by collision,or any act,matter,or thing,loss,damage,or forfeiture,done,occasioned,or incurred,without the privity or knowledge of the owner.id.b.the act thus protects the owner of a vessel from unlimited vicarious liability for damages caused by the negligence of his captain or crew.see in re city of,cir.
to take advantage of this statute,t he owner of a vessel may bring a civil action in a district court of the united states for limitation of liability.a.the owner may also seek total exoneration from liability in the same action for instance,by asserting an affirmative defense that bars potential claims.see supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions supp.rule f.once the owner files a petition for limitation,all other claims and proceedings against the owner related to the matter in question shall cease.c.the district court then issue s a notice to all persons asserting claims with respect to which the petition seeks limitation,instructing such claimants to file their claims in the limitation proceeding before a specified deadline.supp.rule f.claimants may also file an answer challenging the petitioner right to exoneration from or limitation of liability.id.rule f.if the petition for limitation of liability is granted,the owner can be liable on the covered claims only up to the total value of his vessel and its pending freight that amount will then be distributed pro rata among the proven claims.id.rule f.
although the limitation of liability act provides a federal cause of action for a vessel owner seeking exoneration or limitation,it does not provide an independent foundation for federal admiralty jurisdiction.mlc fishing,at.that is,the fact that a vessel owner may file a petition for limitation does not mean the district court necessarily has jurisdiction to hear it.instead,the district court will only have admiralty jurisdiction to hear a petition for limitation if it already has admiralty jurisdiction over the underlying claims that the petition seeks to limit.see id.at.we therefore ask whether the underlying claims raise a civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction that the district court could hear under.
here,the petition seeks to limit liability on underlying claims that sound in tort.we therefore turn to examine the scope of federal admiralty jurisdiction over maritime tort claims.
legal standard 
the traditional test for admiralty tort jurisdiction asked only whether the tort occurred on navigable waters.if it did,admiralty jurisdiction followed if it did not,admiralty jurisdiction did not exist.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock.the location of the tort normally depended on where the plaintiff was harmed or to use a more lawyerly phrase,where the substance and consummation of the injury took place.the plymouth,wall.this could occasionally lead to odd results.for instance,the supreme court held on multiple occasions that when negligently piloted ships rammed structures on the land,the resulting claims were outside the law of admiralty,because the structures harmed were on the land and not in the water.see,martin west.collision between a steamship and the pier of a drawbridge cleveland terminal valley cleveland.collision involving multiple vessels and causing damage to a shore dock,bridge,protection piling,and pier johnson chi.pac.elevator.collision between a schooner and a warehouse,in which the jibboom of the schooner went through the wall of the warehouse and caused a large quantity of shelled corn to run out and be lost in the chicago river.
these collision cases were superseded in by the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act,which extended admiralty jurisdiction to all cases of injury or damage,to person or property,caused by a vessel on navigable waters,even though the injury or damage is done or consummated on land.a see grubart,at.but outside of cases covered by that act,the jurisdictional test continued to focus solely on whether the tort at issue occurred on navigable water.see,victory carriers,law,d reiterating the historic view that the maritime tort jurisdiction of the federal courts is determined by the locality of the accident,and finding no admiralty jurisdiction over an accident suffered by a longshoreman driving a forklift on a pier.
the supreme court first turned away from the traditional rule in executive jet aviation,city of cleveland,d.executive jet involved an airplane that took off from a cleveland,ohio airport bound for portland,maine.shortly after takeoff,the plane hit a flock of seagulls and crashed into the navigable waters of lake erie.id.at.the owners of the airplane alleged that the air traffic controller and other airport employees had been negligent in failing to keep the runway free of seagulls or to adequately warn the plane pilot about the birds.id.at.
the court declined to decide whether the alleged tort was consummated when the plane hit the birds over land or when it hit the water.id.at.instead,it held that the location of the tort alone was not enough to give rise to admiralty jurisdiction.at least in the aviation context,the court declared,admiralty jurisdiction also required that the underlying incident bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters.id.at.the court held that a flight between two airports in the continental united states had no such significant relationship to traditional maritime activity,and therefore found no admiralty jurisdiction over the case.id.at.
in foremost insurance richardson,d,the court clarified that the significant relationship or connection requirement announced in executive jet was a general rule of admiralty jurisdiction,not limited to the aviation context.id.at.foremost involved a collision between two noncommercial vessels pleasure boats in navigable water on the amite river in louisiana.id.at.the court found that the connection test was satisfied,even though neither boat was engaged in commercial maritime activity,because this type of incident had a significant potential effect on maritime commerce for example,if these two boats collided at the mouth of the lawrence seaway,there would be a substantial effect on maritime commerce,without regard to whether either boat was actively,or had been previously,engaged in commercial activity.id.at.the court determined that this potential effect on maritime commerce,when coupled with the traditional concern that admiralty law holds for navigation,demonstrated the significant relationship necessary to support admiralty jurisdiction.id.
the court next considered the scope of admiralty tort jurisdiction in sisson ruby,d.in that case,a vessel owner filed a petition for limitation of liability after a fire broke out on his pleasure yacht while it was docked at a marina on lake michigan.the fire destroyed the yacht and damaged several nearby vessels,but no commercial vessels were affected.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that this incident had a sufficiently significant relationship to traditional maritime activity to sustain admiralty jurisdiction.
the court applied a test in sisson to determine whether the case before it had a significant connection to maritime affairs.first,the court looked to whether the underlying incident had a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce.it described the underlying incident as a fire on a vessel docked at a marina on navigable waters,id.at,and held that such a fire has a potentially disruptive effect,because it can spread to nearby commercial vessels or make the marina inaccessible to such vessels,id.at.the court explained,moreover,that this potential effect does not depend on the particular facts of the incident in this case,but on the general features of the type of incident involved.id.at.the jurisdictional inquiry therefore turned on whether fires at marinas would generally disrupt maritime commerce,rather than on whether the particular fire at issue actually disrupted maritime commerce.
second,the sisson court looked to whether there was a substantial relationship between the activity giving rise to the incident and traditional maritime activity.id.at.again,the court emphasized that the relevant activity giving rise to the incident is defined by the general type of conduct from which the incident arose,not by the specific facts of the case.in executive jet,for example,the relevant activity was not a plane sinking in lake erie,but air travel generally.id.likewise,in sisson,the court described the relevant activity as the storage and maintenance of a vessel at a marina on navigable waters.id.at.the court found this conduct was substantially related to traditional maritime activity,id.at,and so concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was appropriate.
finally,the court restated and formalized the current test for admiralty tort jurisdiction in jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.that case involved a tort claim arising from construction work in the chicago river.a construction company had used a crane sitting on a barge in the river to drive wooden pilings into the riverbed it thereby allegedly cracked a freight tunnel running under the river,causing water to pour down into the tunnel and flood buildings in downtown chicago.the flood victims filed a number of tort actions in state court in response,the construction company filed a petition for limitation of liability in federal district court,invoking the court admiralty jurisdiction.id.at.
the supreme court held that this case fell within the scope of federal admiralty jurisdiction.it began by laying out its analytical framework 
a party seeking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to over a tort claim must satisfy conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity.a court applying the location test must determine whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.the connection test raises two issues.a court,first,must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce.second,a court must determine whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the court then proceeded to apply that analysis to the facts before it.it held that the location test was met because the alleged injury,though occurring on land,was proximately caused by a vessel on navigable water the location of the tort was therefore within the bounds of admiralty as defined by the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act.id.at see a.it also held that both parts of the connection test were met,that this type of incident had a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce,and that the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident showed a substantial relationship to maritime commerce.grubart,at.
in assessing whether this type of incident had a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,the court explained that the type of incident should be described at an intermediate level of possible generality,neither too general to distinguish different cases nor too specific to the unique facts of the particular case.id.at.it thus characterized the type of incident at issue in grubart as damage by a vessel in navigable water to an underwater structure.id.at.the court found this type of incident could easily have a disruptive effect on maritime commerce,by disrupting the course of the waterway itself or by restricting the use of the waterway during necessary repairs.id.
in applying the second part of the connection test,the court recognized that there was inevitably some play in the joints in selecting the right level of generality in describing the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident.id.at.but that inevitable imprecision,it warned,is not an excuse for whimsy.id.the court therefore rejected the idea that the relevant activity could be described as simply repair and maintenance or pile driving,since those descriptions would artificially eliminate the maritime character of the construction company activity.id.at.
instead,the court described the activity giving rise to the incident as repair or maintenance work on a navigable waterway performed from a vessel.id.at.it found that this activity did bear a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity,since barges and similar vessels have traditionally been used to engage in similar repair work.id.citing cases involving repair work carried out from barges.the court clarified that although other activities might have contributed to the ultimate injury for instance,the city of chicago alleged failure to maintain and operate the tunnel system the substantial relationship test requires only that one of the arguably proximate causes of the incident originate in the maritime activity of a tortfeasor.id.at.consequently,as the location test and both parts of the connection test were met,the court held that there was federal admiralty jurisdiction over the petition for limitation of liability arising from the incident.
the test established in grubart remains the current test for admiralty jurisdiction over claims sounding in tort.see mlc fishing,at vasquez,at.to restate first,we ask whether the alleged tort meets the location test that is,whether it occurred on navigable water or was caused by a vessel on navigable water.second,we ask whether the alleged tort meets both subparts of the connection test that is,whether the general type of incident involved has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,and whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident bears a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.see grubart,at.only if the location test and both subparts of the connection test are met will admiralty tort jurisdiction be proper under.
we begin our analysis with the location test,evaluating whether the underlying torts at issue in this case occurred on land or on navigable water.but the facts here present one of those perverse and casuistic borderline situations,executive jet,at,that have always bedeviled the traditional location test.the fistfight at issue took place on and around a floating dock surrounded by navigable water,and so one might think the tort occurred on navigable water.that dock,however,was connected by pilings to the harbor floor,making it technically land,through a connection at the bottom of the sea.the blackheath.it also remained permanently situated in its existing location,according to the district court factual findings,and so it can not be described as a vessel for admiralty purposes.see stewart dutra constr,d holding that a watercraft that has been permanently moored is no longer a vessel for admiralty purposes moreover,the fight occurred both on the floating dock and in the surrounding water.according to the facts recited in the district court opinion,genna was struck on the dock and knocked into the water.he was then held underwater to the point of asphyxiation.he consequently suffered injury both on the dock,where he was struck,and
