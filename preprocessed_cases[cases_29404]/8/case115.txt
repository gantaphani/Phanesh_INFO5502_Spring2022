jpmorgan chase bank,hereinafter,chase initiated this mandamus proceeding,asking the court to intervene in what essentially is a discovery dispute.before the district court,chase unsuccessfully argued that pages of chase records were shielded from production or use in the underlying putative class action per a provision of the bank secrecy act,g hereinafter,the act,and related regulations.as explained below,there are significant reasons to doubt that the act and related regulations apply at all to the unique facts of this case.moreover,even assuming that the act and regulations apply and that the protections emanating therefrom extend as far as chase suggests,the documents disputed here would not be shielded from discovery or use in litigation.accordingly,chase has not demonstrated a clear entitlement to the relief it seeks,and the petition for writ of mandamus will be denied.
an abbreviated version of the relevant facts will suffice for current purposes.through a convoluted course of events that need not be described here,counsel for the name plaintiffs in the underlying putative class action obtained a sizable collection of chase records from the receiver.counsel and the name plaintiffs wished to rely on the documents in order to pursue various claims sounding in fraud,deceit,and conversion against chase.the name plaintiffs alleged that a customer had used his accounts with chase and a predecessor bank acquired by chase to operate a ponzi scheme that the banks had failed to detect and stop.a dispute arose as to whether portions of the chase records were shielded from discovery and litigation use under the act and related regulations.the director of the litigation division for the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the financial crimes enforcement network fincen were notified of the dispute as required by k i.the occ declined to intervene in the matter and expressed support for the district court plan to conduct in camera review of the disputed documents.both agencies declined to review the specific documents disputed in this case.the occ eventually did file an amicus brief in the district court,offering a general overview of relevant legal principles but making clear that the documents at issue in this case had not been reviewed.
after much legal wrangling,a magistrate judge adjudicating the action by consent ultimately reviewed all the disputed documents in camera and concluded that the vast majority of the documents were not shielded by statute or regulation,leaving the name plaintiffs free to rely upon all but a small sliver of the chase records in counsel possession.the district court rejected chase request that the ruling be certified for review via interlocutory appeal.chase then initiated this mandamus proceeding,asking the court to intervene by declaring that the act and related regulations shield an additional pages of records from evidentiary or other use in the putative class action seizing upon language from prior cases,chase characterizes those pages as evaluative documents and claims that the documents are protected because they were prepared for purposes of determining chase obligations under the act and related regulations to report certain transactions to fincen.this court has conducted de novo review of those pages in camera.
mandamus standard 
a petitioner seeking mandamus must show both that there is a clear entitlement to the relief requested,and that irreparable harm will likely occur if the writ is withheld.in re cargill,cir.the alleged error to which a petitioner points must be palpable.in re cambridge literary,cir.i t is that an extraordinary writ,such as a writ of mandamus,may not be used as a substitute for an appeal and will not lie if an appeal is an available remedy.in re urohealth,cir.analogizing to mandamus petitions centered on claims of privilege,we assume without definitively deciding that there is no general bar to chase use of a mandamus petition to pursue the claim at bar.see mohawk,carpenter,d we expect that the combination of standard postjudgment appeals,b appeals,mandamus,and contempt appeals will continue to provide adequate protection to litigants ordered to disclose materials purportedly subject to the privilege.
relevant legal principles 
here,the clear entitlement prong of the mandamus standard requires careful consideration of the act,related regulations,the limited body of caselaw applying those authorities,and the guidance offered by fincen and the occ as the primary agencies charged with implementing the act and related regulations.a general overview is in order.the relevant portion of the act,g added in as part of the annunzio wylie act requires financial institutions to report any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation.annunzio wylie anti money laundering act,stat.key for current purposes,the act also imposes limits as to whom financial institutions,government officials,and others may notify when a suspicious transaction has been reported.id.g.no involved person,whether on the financial institution side or the government side,may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported.id.the statute also creates a safe harbor for reporting financial institutions,stating that reporting institutions and employees 
shall not be liable to any person under any law or regulation of the united states,any constitution,law,or regulation of any state or political subdivision of any state,or under any contract or other legally enforceable agreement including any arbitration agreement,for such disclosure or for any failure to provide notice of such disclosure to the person who is the subject of such disclosure or any other person identified in the disclosure.
several pertinent regulations have been promulgated under the act,including k from the occ,which refers to a suspicious activity report as a sar and dictates,inter alia,that a sar,and any information that would reveal the existence of a sar,are confidential,and shall not be disclosed except as authorized in this paragraph.the regulation further specifies 
no national bank,and no director,officer,employee,or agent of a national bank,shall disclose a sar or any information that would reveal the existence of a sar.any national bank,and any director,officer,employee,or agent of any national bank that is subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a sar,or any information that would reveal the existence of a sar,shall decline to produce the sar or such information,citing this section and u.g a i.
k i.in addition to other limitations not relevant for current purposes,the regulation specifies that p rovided that no person involved in any reported suspicious transaction is notified that the transaction has been reported,the regulation should not be construed as prohibiting t he disclosure of t he underlying facts,transactions,and documents upon which a sar is based.k ii a.
against this backdrop,a body of district court caselaw has emerged,examining the scope of the protections emanating from the act and related regulations.district courts have extrapolated from the statute and regulations an unqualified discovery and evidentiary privilege that can not be waived.see,whitney nat.bank karam,d,courts has been to define the universe of documents encompassed by this privilege.see id.at.the whitney court concluded that the universe of protected documents 
may consist of a sar itself communications pertaining to a sar or its contents communications preceding the filing of a sar and preparatory or preliminary to it communications that follow the filing of a sar and are explanations or discussions or oral communications o f suspected or possible violations that did not culminate in the filing of a sar.
id.other categories of documents are not shielded,including documents produced in the ordinary course of business pertaining to the defendants banking activities,transactions,and accounts that do not suggest the existence of a sar.id.at.
that position is consistent with the regulation quoted above,and other courts have drawn similar distinctions between sars and supporting documentation.see united states holihan,d,a ny supporting documentation which would not reveal either the fact that an sic sar was filed or its contents can not be shielded from otherwise appropriate discovery based solely on its connection to an sar.see also cotton privatebank trust,d,gregory bank one,d,weil long island sav.bank,d.
on the issue of scope,fincen has provided some guidance 
clearly,any document or other information that affirmatively states that a sar has been filed constitutes information that would reveal the existence of a sar and should be kept confidential.by extension,an institution also should afford confidentiality to any document stating that a sar has not been filed.were fincen to allow disclosure of information when a sar is not filed,institutions would implicitly reveal the existence of a sar any time they were unable to produce records because a sar was filed.
the more difficult situation is when a document or other information is silent as to whether a sar has or has not been filed.documents that may identify suspicious activity but that do not reveal whether a sar exists,a document memorializing a customer transaction,such as an account statement indicating a cash deposit or a record of a funds transfer,should be treated as falling within the underlying facts,transactions,and documents upon which a sar may be based,and should not be afforded confidentiality.this distinction is set forth in the final rule second rule of construction and reflects relevant case law.
however,the strong public policy that underlies the sar system as a,the creation of an environment that encourages financial institutions to report suspicious activity without fear of heavily in favor of applying sar confidentiality not only to a sar itself,but also in appropriate circumstances to material prepared by the financial institution as part of its process to detect and report suspicious activity,regardless of whether a sar ultimately was filed or not.this interpretation also reflects relevant case law.
confidentiality of suspicious activity reports,footnotes omitted 
the final paragraph of the fincen guidance,with its reference to material prepared as part of the financial institution process to detect and report suspicious activity,may seem ambiguous,but the cases cited in support of that paragraph are telling.see id.at.fincen cited,inter alia,the whitney and cotton decisions referenced above and characterized those cases as having to do with communications,draft sars,or other materials protected because they suggested the existence or of a sar.see id.citing whitney,d at cotton,d at.
decisions the fincen guidance have tended to focus on whether implicated documents were created in the ordinary course of business in monitoring unusual activity,as opposed to being documents of an evaluative nature intended to comply with federal reporting requirements.see wiand wells fargo bank,d.applying this dichotomy,the wiand court declared the following types of records to be outside the scope of the act and related regulations copies of transactional documents,list s or description s of certain transactions,and internal bank emails and reports not of an evaluative nature.see also in re whitley,wl at,a lthough a bank may undertake an internal investigation in anticipation of filing a sar,it is also a standard business practice for banks to investigate suspicious activity as a necessary and appropriate measure to protect the bank interests,and the internal bank reports or memorandum generated by the bank regarding such an investigation are not protected by sar privilege.freedman gersten,llp bank of,wl at,t he court finds good cause to permit the disclosure of supplemental discovery related to documents and facts pertaining to the suspicious activity at issue in this matter,which were created in the ordinary course of business.
application to this case 
as is likely clear by this point,the scope of the protections stemming from the act and related regulations is an evolving area of the law.however,two distinct issues lead us to question whether those authorities apply to this case to any extent at all,and that certainly does not bode well for chase in its quest to demonstrate a clear entitlement to mandamus relief,cargill,at,or a palpable error,cambridge literary,at.first,there is the question whether the act and related regulations prevent disclosure by third parties like the name plaintiffs.as set out above,the act itself expressly forbids disclosure only by reporting financial institutions and their officers and agents,and by government entities,officials,and agents on the receiving end of sars.see g.indeed,each of the cases cited and discussed above involved a financial institution relying upon the act to resist disclosure of a sar and related documentation none of the cases involved attempts to keep third parties from disclosing sars.also,the fincen guidance quoted above focuses on financial institutions and does not address in any way the issue of applicability.
it is true that the regulations fleshing out the act do begin with the broad proposition that sars and documents speaking to their existence are confidential,and shall not be disclosed except as authorized by regulation.k.however,the regulations proceed to enumerate a universe of individuals to whom the prohibition against disclosure applies that is functionally equivalent to that set out in the act,financial institutions and their officers and agents,and government entities and their officials and agents.see id.per the canon,the specific list of subject entities and individuals trumps any suggestion of a broader universe of individuals bound by the prohibition on disclosure.see radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank,d it is an old and familiar rule that,where there is,in the same statute,a particular enactment,and also a general one,which,in its most comprehensive sense,would include what is embraced in the former,the particular enactment must be operative,and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.quoting united states chase.thus,it would appear that neither the act nor the regulations restrict third parties that is,parties on neither the side nor the government side of a sar exchange from disclosing the existence or of a particular sar.
that reading also would comport with general agency principles.the specific manner in which the disclosure prohibition is set out in the act suggests an intent on the part of congress to limit only disclosure by specific entities and individuals for the specific purposes of encouraging reporting by financial institutions and preserving investigatory latitude.see maine ass of interdependent neighborhoods comm r,maine dep t of human,cir we first determine if congress has spoken to the precise question at issue at this stage we look to the statute language,history and purpose.if congressional intent is clear,we simply give effect to that intent.internal quotations and citation omitted see also ernst ernst hochfelder,d the rulemaking power granted to an administrative agency charged with the administration of a federal statute is not the power to make law.rather,it is the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of congress as expressed by the statute.internal quotations omitted.where congress has spoken with specificity,an agency may not promulgate regulations that are an attempted addition to the statute of something which is not there,even if the intent behind the attempted addition is consistent with the intent behind the authorizing statute.see united states calamaro,d holding that treasury regulation could not extend coverage of statute imposing occupational tax on those in the business of receiving wagers to men.in sum,while resolution of this case does not require us to specifically demarcate the universe of individuals encompassed by the disclosure limitations,we conclude that chase can not satisfy the demanding mandamus standard where there is such uncertainty as to the applicability of the disclosure limitations to partie
