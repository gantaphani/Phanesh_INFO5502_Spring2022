vaello carmona was an engineer who had worked in various positions for siemens since.siemens is one of the world largest providers of healthcare products and services.in january,vaello carmona was promoted to branch manager,the highest position available at siemens in puerto rico and the caribbean.in june,vaello carmona suffered a stroke,which required intensive medical treatment and significantly affected his speech and mobility.despite his disability,vaello carmona continued to work diligently for siemens.his sales from december to september exceeded the yearly averages in the market by percent and gave siemens its highest yearly volume of sales in puerto rico and the caribbean.
on october,vaello carmona was asked to meet with his supervisor charles wood,the regional vice president for sales,to conduct his performance evaluation for the fiscal year ending on september.before vaello carmona was able to enter the siemens office that morning,wood entered his vehicle in the parking lot and informed vaello carmona that he was fired,effective immediately.on october,vaello carmona received a letter from siemens confirming his dismissal.the letter stated that vaello carmona had been laid off due to a significant decline in the market.after his termination,vaello carmona physical and mental health deteriorated further,leaving him totally disabled at years old.on february,vaello carmona began receiving social security benefits.
on march,siemens notified vaello carmona that the company was going to start recruiting for a position similar to the one he had previously held.however,the new position required more travel to the caribbean islands and florida.on march,vaello carmona informed siemens that he could not compete for the new position because he had become totally disabled and was receiving social security benefits.notwithstanding,on april,vaello carmona received an offer from siemens to rehire him as the branch manager for puerto rico and the caribbean.vaello carmona declined this offer because he was totally disabled.
on july,vaello carmona filed a complaint against siemens,alleging disability discrimination in violation of law,law,and title i of the ada,and unlawful termination of employment in violation of law,laws ann.tit.vaello carmona claimed that siemens fired him because of his disability,entitling him to compensatory damages,back wages,lost wages,and punitive damages.vaello carmona died on august,about one month after filing his complaint.on january,appellants moved to substitute themselves in vaello carmona position in accordance with.a.
on july,the district court denied the motion and dismissed vaello carmona complaint.the court held that claims pursuant to law,law,and title i of the ada were not inheritable and dismissed those claims with prejudice.because the district court had disposed of the only federal claim in this case,it chose not to take supplemental jurisdiction over the law claim and dismissed it without prejudice appellants moved for reconsideration pursuant to.e.on february,the district court denied the motion.
we review de novo a rule b dismissal of the plaintiff claims.medina velázquez,at.we examine whether the complaint states a claim for which relief can be granted when we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accepting their truth and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.id.
the sole questions on appeal are whether employment discrimination claims under law,law,and title i of the ada survive vaello carmona death.
law and law 
the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the law and law claims.we apply puerto rico law to determine whether they are inheritable.see hoyos telecorp commc ns,cir.
law prohibits discrimination in employment.the statute provides monetary damages to employees if their employer discriminates against them on the basis of age,race,color,sex,social or national origin,social condition,political affiliation or political or religious ideology,or for being a victim or perceived as a victim of domestic violence,sexual aggression or stalking.laws ann.tit,see also rodriguez cruz padilla ayala,the legislative history of law shows that its main objective was to protect employees in the private sector from all types of discrimination emphasis omitted.law protects employees against discrimination on the basis of physical or mental limitations.the statute provides monetary damages to employees if their employers put into effect or use discriminatory employment procedures,methods,or practices against persons with any kind of physical,mental or sensory disability just for the sake of said handicap.laws ann.tit.as the district court stated,the only noticeable difference between laws and is that the latter is more specific as to which employees it protects.vaello carmona med.solutions usa,no.civ.jag,wl,at july,see also rivera flores cía abc,explaining how law incorporates the remedies,powers,and procedures established in law.
both statutes are silent on whether claims made by an individual employee against his employer under law and law survive the death of the employee.in sucesión álvarez secretario de justicia,the puerto rico supreme court provided guidance on whether a claim under puerto rico law is inheritable.the court held that the amount a deceased public official accrued in sick leave is transmissible to his heirs.id.at.in doing so,the puerto rico supreme court delineated which types of claims survive an individual death and which do not.
the court first recognized that the puerto rico civil code does not contain a uniform rule about the assets,rights and obligations that are transmissible by inheritance and those which,because they are very personal,conclude with the life of their owner.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.absent a uniform statutory rule,the court relied on a treatise by spanish commentator josé puig brutau when setting forth the general standard for survivorship claims under puerto rico law.see id.citing puig brutau,fundamentos de derecho civil ed.adopting puig brutau commentary,the court stated 
t here are transmissible by inheritance,among others the patrimonial rights the rights of a partner in capital partnerships the quality of partner in a partnership of persons the action to claim legitimate filiation the action to contest the juridical acts or businesses entered into by the deceased in fraud of the legitimate the different modalities of industrial property copyright obligations,except those of a very personal nature or when the same involve a consideration funeral property and the right of the deceased to obtain indemnification for the damages that were caused to him during his life.
id.at emphasis added.
law and law provide monetary compensation to an employee for damages that were caused to him during his life due to discrimination from his employer.id.at.therefore,according to sucesión álvarez,claims asserted pursuant to these antidiscrimination statutes are inheritable under puerto rico law.
the district court agreed that sucesión álvarez would seem to approve of the transmissibility of plaintiff claims in this case.vaello carmona,wl,at.however,the court found that law and law do not survive vaello carmona death because rights under these statutes are very personal rights.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.siemens agrees with the district court analysis and argues that the puerto rico supreme court decisions in santini rivera serv air,offic,wl,and cruz roche de jesús colón,support its position.
in santini rivera,the parents and girlfriend of an employee,ramón santini rivera santini,appeared as in santini lawsuit against his employer,serv air,wl.santini alleged that serv air,violated law by denying him positions in the company because of his national origin and subjecting him to harassment,persecution,hounding,and discrimination,which caused him mental anguish and forced him to quit his job.id.his parents and girlfriend attempted to bring their own cause of action under law against serv air,for the harm they experienced as a consequence of the discrimination suffered by santini at his workplace.id.they alleged that they had suffered serious mental anguish when they saw the depressive state that santini was in.id.naveira de rodón,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the puerto rico supreme court found that the relatives did not have standing to bring their own cause of action under law.id.the court stated that law has nothing to do with third persons or with other persons that are not employees.since the act does not apply to a worker relatives,it can not become a source of rights for said relatives.id.emphasis in original.
similarly,in cruz roche,the puerto rico supreme court held that the of an employee did not have standing to intervene in his former wife lawsuit asserting a law claim,which concerned conduct that allegedly took place while the couple was still married.at.the court stated that law is very personal in nature that is,it protects and benefits only the employee who is discriminated and not the progeny or the close relatives of the same.id.at see also id.at e ven though there is a conjugal amount in the lump sum granted as compensation pursuant to law,the cause of action continues to be very personal while there is no final and binding judgment that disposes of the action.
santini rivera and cruz roche are distinguishable from the present case.neither case holds that law claims assert very personal rights that are not inheritable under puerto rico law.they merely stand for the proposition that relatives of an aggrieved individual are not entitled to their own cause of action or to intervene on their own behalf under law because of the personal nature of law claims.in this case,appellants do not attempt to assert their own law claims.instead,they seek to substitute themselves as plaintiffs in order to assert vaello carmona claims against siemens.nothing in santini rivera or cruz roche forecloses their ability to do so.
it is true that sucesión álvarez states that rights that are not transmissible by inheritance include those that are very personal.at.because the puerto rico supreme court has described law as very personal in nature,cruz roche,at,siemens contends that law claims can not be inheritable.however,in widow of delgado bos.ins,the puerto rico supreme court detailed which very personal rights do not survive an individual death.offic.trans.these very personal rights include the right to usufruct,use,habitation,life annuities,patria potestas,support,tutorship,personal servitudes,certain labor and services contracts,the action to dispute legitimacy of child,and the action granted the donor for causes of ingratitude,and those rights and obligations which are extinguished by agreement upon the death of the contractor.id.the court concluded that a tort claim under laws ann.tit,is not in the list of very personal rights which die with the person.id.similarly,employment discrimination claims under law and law are not in the list of very personal rights that can not be inherited.to hold otherwise would be to contradict sucesión álvarez clear statement that the rights of the deceased to obtain indemnification for the damages that were caused to him during his life are inheritable.at.therefore,we hold that vaello carmona law and law claims survive his death,and the district court erred when it denied appellants motion to substitute themselves as plaintiffs in this case.
title i of the ada 
vaello carmona has also asserted an employment discrimination claim under title i of the ada.when a cause of action arises from a federal statute,we generally apply federal law to determine whether that claim survives the plaintiff death.see carlson green,d.the survival of claims under federal law depends in the first instance on whether there is an applicable federal survival statute however,t here is no general survival statute for cases,and the ada is silent as to whether a title i claim is inheritable.charles wright,arthur miller mary kane,federal practice and procedure ed.without statutory guidance,the lower courts are split as to whether to evaluate the survival of an ada claim under federal common law or the law of the state in which the court hears the claim we do not need to resolve this dispute because the parties agree that puerto rico law should apply to the ada claim.therefore,we assume,without deciding,that puerto rico law governs.see,ji bose,cir assuming,without deciding,that legal standard applies where both parties agree that the standard was correct.
title i of the ada protects employees with disabilities against discrimination.the statute allows for monetary damages to qualified employees with disabilities if they are discriminated against on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a see also rederford airways,cir citing stating that title i of the ada explicitly provides for the same remedies available for employment discrimination suits in title vii of the civil rights act of,which includes monetary damages.
just as with law and law,claims arising under title i of the ada provide monetary compensation to an employee for damages that were caused to him during his life due to discrimination from his employer.sucesión álvarez,at see also ruiz rivera pfizer pharmaceuticals,cir stating that law is the puerto rico analogue to the ada.therefore,applying puerto rico law,we hold that vaello carmona employment discrimination claim under title i of the ada is inheritable.
after dismissing the law,law,and title i of the ada claims,the district court dismissed vaello carmona pendent law claim without prejudice.because we conclude the district court erred with regard to the other claims,we also vacate the dismissal of the law claim.
for the reasons stated above,we vacate the district court dismissal of vaello carmona law,law,law,and title i of the ada claims,and remand for proceedings consistent with this decision.
