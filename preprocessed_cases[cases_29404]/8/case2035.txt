yossie hollander appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york berman,awarding breach of contract damages to plaintiff oscar gruss son,ogsi in the amount of,plus attorneys fees and interest,arising from hollander failure to deliver warrants pursuant to an engagement letter.hollander challenges the district court computation of damages and argues that under new york law the district court should have valued the warrants from the date of the breach.hollander further maintains that the district court improperly awarded attorneys fees to ogsi based on an erroneous interpretation of the indemnification clause in the engagement letter.
because the district court should have calculated ogsi damages from the date of the breach and because it improperly awarded attorneys fees to ogsi,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand with instructions to determine the date of breach and to recompute ogsi breach of contract damages accordingly.
background 
in yossie hollander founded fourth dimension software,a private israeli software corporation.he later renamed it new dimension software.in late,went public in an initial public offering the ipo.after the ipo,hollander owned about of stock,while roni einav and dalia together controlled another.the remaining of the stock was publicly traded on the nasdaq market.
following the ipo,hollander relationship with einav and soured.in late,hollander resigned from board of directors and was terminated as chief executive officer ceo.he kept his stock interest,however.
hollander wanted to reacquire control of.he began negotiating the terms of an engagement letter with oscar gruss son,ogsi,a small new york investment banking firm.on february,ogsi and hollander came to an agreement the engagement letter.
a.the engagement letter 
the engagement letter provided that hollander was hiring ogsi on an exclusive basis to render financial advisory services in connection with hollander attempt to acquire more shares of.the letter included ogsi obligations to provide advisory services,general business and financial analysis,transaction feasibility analysis and pricing to assist in negotiations and related strategy to act as in any tender offer to assist in corporate capital planning to provide a fairness opinion and to use its best efforts to raise between and million to reacquire stock.
ogsi had initially asked for a retainer,but hollander balked at so large an initial cash outlay.the engagement letter thus provided that hollander would pay ogsi a retainer of only in cash but would give ogsi warrants,which shall vest immediately upon signing this agreement,to acquire shares of common stock held by hollander.ogsi could not exercise the warrants before january,but could exercise them at a price of per share any time thereafter.
hollander would retain the right to buy back the warrants any time during the period commencing february,whenever the market price of stock exceeded twice the exercise price for the warrants,reached per share.the cost to hollander to buy back the warrants would be the current market price for common stock minus the exercise price.on january,common stock closed above.
in and ogsi conveyed most of its interest in the warrants to six present and former employees of ogsi.significantly,ogsi retained an interest in the warrants.
the engagement letter also provided that ogsi was entitled to reimbursement from hollander for ogsi reasonable expenses in connection with its to a maximum of.in,ogsi billed hollander for expenses,but was never paid.
the district court found that ogsi performed its obligation under the engagement letter.specifically,ogsi had introduced hollander to potential investors and sources of financing,had created and distributed an investor memorandum to potential investors,and had met with einav and.
hollander failure to deliver warrants 
hollander did pay ogsi the retainer fee in cash,but he never delivered the warrants to ogsi.in february,ogsi demanded delivery of the warrants.hollander responded that w hile you may believe that payment was not dependent upon the successful completion of the transaction for which i engaged the services of ogsi,it is undeniable that payment for such services was indeed dependent upon such services being rendered.emphasis added.in march,ogsi threatened litigation.
bmc tender offer 
ogsi was unsuccessful in its efforts to assist hollander in reacquiring control of.then,in,bmc software,bmc made a tender offer for shares.bmc was successful and acquired all the outstanding shares of common stock including hollander at a price of per share.
procedural history 
because of hollander refusal to deliver the warrants,ogsi sued for breach of contract in the united states district court for the southern district of new york berman.diversity jurisdiction was alleged.hollander disputed diversity,alleging that a necessary had not been joined.hollander also counterclaimed for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraudulent inducement,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty.
the district court determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction under a because the parties were diverse.hollander had argued that diversity jurisdiction was destroyed because one of the six former employees to whom ogsi assigned an interest in the warrants was,like hollander himself,a citizen of israel throughout the course of the litigation.rejecting hollander contention,the district court found that all six employees signed a letter agreement,dated july,letter agreement,vesting ogsi with authority to commence litigation and to make all decisions relating to enforcement of the engagement letter.diversity jurisdiction was therefore proper.
after discovery,plaintiff ogsi moved for summary judgment.defendant hollander opposed the motion and for partial summary judgment.the district court granted ogsi motion,finding that the engagement letter required hollander to deliver the warrants to ogsi shortly after the execution of the engagement letter.as a result of his failure to do so,the district court concluded that hollander unequivocally breached the engagement letter.
the district court also dismissed hollander counterclaims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.it reserved for trial the issue of damages and three of hollander counterclaims fraudulent inducement,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty.
a bench trial was then held to determine ogsi damages and to rule on hollander surviving counterclaims.based upon documentary evidence and witness testimony,the district court dismissed all of hollander counterclaims.
value of the warrants 
in valuing the warrants,the district court also made a determination as to how long ogsi would have held the warrants before exercising them.the court noted that since april,michael shaoul,ogsi chief operating officer,was primarily responsible for implementing ogsi warrants practices.shaoul testified that he closely followed stock from the day he was employed by ogsi until the bmc tender offer was consummated in april.shaoul also stated that ogsi would have held the warrants for at least fourteen months after the initial exercise date of january,about the time of the bmc tender offer.the district court credited shaoul conclusion that the warrants were a particularly suitable security to hold for long term appreciation.
based largely on the testimony of michael shaoul,the district court concluded that ogsi would have held the warrants for the longest term possible.the district court determined that april,was t he appropriate date to fix the value of ogsi share of the warrants because this date is the most likely date on which ogsi would have exercised the warrants.on april,the date of the bmc tender offer,the warrants were valued at.thus,the district court determined the value of ogsi interest to be.
as to the remaining interest in the warrants,the district court determined that there was little or no evidence as to when any of the individual assignees would have sought to exercise their warrants.the court set the date for determining the value of the remaining of the warrants at the reasonable intermediate date of january,first date on which the individuals would have been able to exercise the warrants.the market price on january,was,and the individual warrant value was.the value of of warrants was therefore.
the district court found that there was little or no evidence to support hollander assertion that he would have exercised the provision of the engagement letter before it expired on february.
interest and expenses 
the district court determined that ogsi was owed interest on the sum of from april.as to the individual warrant holders,the district court found they were entitled to interest on the sum of from january.
the district court also awarded ogsi expenses in the sum of and attorneys fees in the amount of.in support of its finding that ogsi had the right to attorneys fees,the district court cited the indemnification provision contained in the engagement letter.despite this,the district court directed the parties to appear before magistrate judge douglas eaton for final computation confirmation of expenses,legal fees and interest.
after further briefing by the parties,magistrate judge eaton issued a report and recommendation report suggesting that the district court deny prejudgment interest and compute interest on attorneys fees and expenses from july,the date the district court decision was filed and provide interest.the district court adopted the report,except as to the date for the accrual of interest on attorneys fees.the district court found that hollander obligation to pay attorneys fees arose from his failure to deliver the warrants to ogsi.the court stated that under new york cplr a,interest was due on attorneys fees actually paid by ogsi.accordingly,the court measured interest from the date ogsi first paid its attorneys june.
thereafter,the district court entered judgment against hollander for,plus interest of.ogsi was also awarded for reimbursable expenses under the engagement letter,plus interest of.the district court awarded ogsi in attorneys fees and expenses,plus interest of.the award to ogsi,including costs,totaled,with the accrual of interest commencing seven days from the date of judgment.hollander stipulated to the accuracy of all figures,reserving his right to appeal only a the valuation date of the warrants,and b ogsi right to attorneys fees and interest.
hollander filed a timely appeal.ogsi filed a contending that the warrants held by individual employees of ogsi should have been valued as of the tender offer,rather than on january.

subject matter 
hollander,an israeli citizen,renews his claim on appeal that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.he asserts that all six ogsi employees to whom of the warrants were assigned were real parties in interest and had to be joined in this litigation.he notes,however,that because one of the employees,eddy shalev,is a citizen of israel and held of the warrants,his joinder would destroy diversity of citizenship.we disagree.
failure of subject matter jurisdiction,of course,is not waivable and may be raised at any time by a party or by the court sua sponte.lyndonville sav.bank trust lussier,cir.if subject matter jurisdiction is lacking,the action must be dismissed.see id.at citing bender williamsport area sch,d.we review the district court factual findings regarding subject matter jurisdiction for clear error and its legal conclusion as to whether subject matter jurisdiction exists de novo.see id.at key mechanical bdc llc,cir filetech france telecom,cir.
federal courts have diversity jurisdiction over controversies between citizens of different states.a const.art.iii.it is firmly established that citizens for purposes of a federal court diversity jurisdiction must be real and substantial parties to the controversy.navarro sav.lee,d see also airlines reporting s and n travel,cir.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that e very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.a.this means that an action must be brought by the person who,according to the governing substantive law,is entitled to enforce the right.charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure,at ed.rule does not,however,affect jurisdiction and relates only to the determination of proper parties and the capacity to sue.james william moore,et,moore federal practice ed.
the supreme court has noted that although there exists a rough symmetry between the real party in interest standard of rule a and the rule that diversity jurisdiction depends upon the citizenship of real parties to the controversy the two rules serve different purposes and need not produce identical outcomes in all cases.navarro,at.thus,although under rule a ogsi is a real party in interest and,thus,the action may properly be maintained in its name,ogsi must also establish that it is a real and substantial party to the controversy for the purpose of determining diversity jurisdiction.
to establish whether a plaintiff is a real and substantial party to the controversy,a crucial distinction must be made between a plaintiff who sues solely in his capacity as an agent,on the one hand,and,on the other,a plaintiff who sues not only as an agent,but also as an individual who has his own stake in the litigation.hollander correctly notes that where a plaintiff brings a suit solely in his representative capacity,the citizenship of the represented party,and not that of the representative,controls.moore federal practice,supra b.
this distinction animates airlines reporting arc s n travel,cir,where we refused to consider arc corporate citizenship controlling when arc acted merely as an agent for the interests of others.we held that the citizenship of the represented individuals controlled for diversity purposes.id.at.we found it significant that arc did not seek to protect any corporate interests of its own,did not suffer any corporate damage or pecuniary loss itself,nor did it lay claim to any portion of the potential recovery.id.in sum,we concluded that arc was a mere conduit for a remedy owing to others,advancing no specific interests of its own.id.
here,ogsi retained an interest in the warrants.it suffered a pecuniary loss and is entitled to a portion of the damages award.as such,unlike arc,ogsi is not a mere conduit but possesses a valid stake in the litigation sufficient to be considered a real and substantial party for diversity purposes.
hollander reliance on squibb sons,accident and casualty insurance,cir squibb i,is misplaced.in squibb i,a suit against a syndicate of underwriters,we remanded to the district court to determine whether the citizenship of every underwriter in the syndicate was relevant for diversity purposes.id.at.in so doing,we observed that we regularly exercise diversity jurisdiction in cases where individuals or groups who are not direct parties to the litigation nevertheless have a crucial interest in its outcome.id.at.
following squibb i,the parties stipulated that the original defendant who was now dead had been an underwriter and a british subject,and had appeared in the action both in his individual capacity,and for administrative convenience,as a representative of all u nderwriters.squibb sons,accident and casualty insurance,cir squibb ii quoting squibb i,at internal quotation marks omitted.a new defendant,another underwriter and british subject,was substituted to replace the original defendant.on remand,the district court found subject matter jurisdiction.
in a renewed appeal squibb ii,we held that because the defendant lead underwriter had been sued solely in his individual capacity,only his citizenship,and not that of the individual underwriters in the syndicate,needed to be considered for diversity purposes.id.at.we found that each of the underwriters would be bound by the judgment against the individual defendant and that,given the unique structure of the syndicate,this was sufficient to protect the interests of all parties.id.
w here multiple parties all have a financial interest in a lawsuit,a strategic choice of parties in order to maintain diversity is not considered to be collusive so long as the party chosen to bring the suit is in fact the master of the litigation.transcontinental oil trenton prods,cir emphasis added.in transcontinental,the plaintiff operated a syndicate investment in stock on behalf of himself and eleven other investors.all members of the syndicate,except plaintiff,were citizens of new york.the plaintiff had an agreement with the eleven members of the syndicate under which the plaintiff retained a minimal interest in the total syndicate investment.
one of the defendants entered into an agreement with the plaintiff under which the syndicate was to receive shares of stock.upon defendant failure to deliver the stock,the plaintiff,a citizen of connecticut,brought a breach of contract action against the defendant,a new york citizen.plaintiff sued individually and as nominee of the syndicate.the defendant challenged the court diversity jurisdiction.we affirmed the district court conclusion that diversity existed because the plaintiff,rather than the eleven syndicate members,was master of the litigation.id.at citations omitted.specifically,the district court cited,among other things,that the plaintiff had negotiated and signed the agreement that was the subject of the action was most familiar with the matters in the suit and had a real and substantial financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.accordingly,the district court found that the plaintiff was no mere formal party.id.
here,the agreement entered into between ogsi and its former employees gave ogsi the express power to act on their behalf with regard to their rights in the warrants.the letter agreement vested ogsi with authority to take such action as it may deem to be necessary or appropriate,in the exercise of its discretion,including commencing litigation,in order to attempt to enforce its rights under the engagement letter,and provided that ogsi will make all decisions relating to the manner in which its rights under the engagement letter will be enforced and maintained and the attorneys who will act for it in connection therewith.under the terms of the letter agreement,ogsi was clearly intended to be the master of the litigation.therefore,shalev citizenship is of no consequence to subject matter jurisdiction.
ogsi is incorporated and has its principal place of business in new york.in its decision,the district court made an explicit finding of fact that at all relevant times hollander was a resident and domiciliary of israel.therefore,as between ogsi and hollander,the district court properly found the necessary diversity of citizenship.
ii.valuation of damages for the warrants 
the principal grist for this appeal is the scope and measure of damages awarded to ogsi for hollander breach of the engagement letter.
although the amount of recoverable damages is a question of fact,the measure of damages upon which the factual computation is based is a question of law.wolff munier,contracting,cir quoting united states ex rel.maltese sons,juno constr,cir.in other words,whether the district court correctly calculated damages is a question of law that we review de novo.lauder first unum life ins,cir see also lucente int l bus.machs,cir juliano health maint.org.of new jersey,cir.
ogsi warrants 
the district court calculated ogsi damages from the date of the bmc tender offer,rather than the date of hollander breach.the district court reasoned that the most reasonable date to fix for the value of ogsi percentage of the warrants is april,the date of consummation of the bmc tender offer at a price of in cash.
hollander contends that the district court erred in determining that ogsi would have held the warrants for the longest term possible and improperly computed ogsi breach of contract damages from the date of the bmc tender offer,rather than from the date of his breach.we agree that damages are properly measured from the date of the breach.
the contract provided that it would be governed by new york law.this is not disputed by either party.under new york law,damages for breach of contract should put the plaintiff in the same economic position he would have occupied had the breaching party performed the contract.see indu craft,bank of baroda,cir.new york courts are clear that breach of contract damages are measured from the date of the breach.see simon electrospace,see also lucente,at.we have consistently stated that new york rule for m easuring contract damages by the value of the item at the time of the breach is eminently sensible and actually takes expected lost future profits into account.lucente,at quoting sharma skaarup ship mgmt,cir.we have also noted that new york courts have rejected awards based on what the actual economic conditions and performance were in light of hindsight.sharma,at quoting aroneck atkin,dep t.
admittedly,we have allowed damages to be measured at a later date in cases of conversion.in such cases,damages may be measured by the highest intermediate value of the stock between the time of the conversion and a reasonable time after the owner has received notice of it to enable him to replace the stock.schultz commodity futures trading comm n,cir quoting gallagher jones.thus,the measure of damages in conversion of securities cases is either their value at the time of the conversion or their highest intermediate value between notice of the conversion and the time when reentry into the market would be both warranted and desired.see id.at.
ours,of course,is not a conversion case.in lucente international business machines,cir,we flatly rejected under new york law the use of the conversion measure of damages in a breach of contract case.in lucente,we examined the precedent set forth in this circuit by hermanowski acton,cir.in hermanowski,the district court had puzzled over whether damages in a breach of contract action involving stock options should be calculated as of the date of the breach or under the conversion method.it rejected the latter.hermanowski acton.it applied the traditional rule that damages for breach of contract are determined by the loss sustained or the gain prevented at the time and place of breach.id.at citing simon,at.we affirmed substantially for the reasons set forth in the decision of the district court and specifically agreed that damages should be determined as of the date of the breach.hermanowski,at.the third circuit reached the same result in scully wats,cir interpreting federal and new york law.
paragraph a of the engagement letter provided that,upon signing the engagement letter,hollander was to pay ogsi a retainer of in cash and deliver warrants that shall vest immediately upon signing of this agreement.this provision entitled ogsi to acquire shares of common stock.similar to a stock option,a warrant is defined as any certificate evidencing a right to subscribe to or otherwise acquire another security,issued or unissued.a.it is undisputed that hollander refused to deliver the warrants.this refusal was in breach of the engagement letter.
based on clear new york law,the proper valuation for the warrants was the date of the date hollander failed to deliver the warrants.see simon,at,the proper measure of damages for breach of contract is determined by the loss sustained or gain prevented at the time and place of breach t he rule is precisely the same when the breach of contract is nondeli
