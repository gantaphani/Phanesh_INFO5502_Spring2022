on december,the guild and hearst entered into a agreement the cba,which,by its terms,was effective from august,to august.section.of the cba,which sets forth a procedure for resolving grievances between the parties,states in relevant part any formal grievance involving the interpretation or application of this agreement may be submitted to final and binding arbitration.section,entitled dues checkoff,provides 
upon an employee voluntary written assignment,the company hearst shall deduct weekly from the salary account of such employee and pay to the guild on the fifteenth day of each month,but in no event later than the twentieth,all membership dues levied by the guild for the current month.such membership dues shall be deducted from the employee salary in accordance with a schedule furnished the company by the guild on the first day of each month an employee voluntary written assignment shall remain effective in accordance with the terms of such assignments.all such deductions shall be made in conformity with local,state or federal legislation.

in,the parties agreed to extend the terms of the cba pursuant to an interim agreement dated june,which was subject to termination by either party upon thirty days notice.
on march,hearst notified the guild by letter that it would terminate the cba effective april,pursuant to the interim agreement termination clause.hearst letter stated also that t his shall include termination of the arbitration provisions in section,and the dues checkoff provisions in section.id.at.on april,hearst stopped checking off,or deducting dues from employees paychecks and remitting them to the guild.
the following month,on may,the guild filed with hearst a formal grievance challenging hearst discontinuation of dues checkoff and seeking collection and remittance of all back dues with interest.the grievance stated that t he cancellation of the dues checkoff violates section,which compels the employer to remit dues checkoff in accordance with any unrevoked dues checkoff authorization.id.at.the grievance,however,went unresolved.by letter dated may,the guild stated its intention to invoke arbitration under the expired cba.hearst responded on may,that it would not agree to arbitrate the grievance.
on july,the guild brought this action to compel arbitration against hearst.the parties for summary judgment as to whether their dispute was subject to the cba arbitration clause and hearst was required to continue collecting and remitting dues to the guild after the cba had expired.
in a memorandum decision dated june,the district court granted the guild motion for summary judgment and denied hearst for summary judgment.see newspaper of albany hearst,cv,wl june.the court identified the legal question as whether the parties intentions,as manifested in the language of the cba,were for the dues checkoff obligation to survive the cba expiration.id.at.it determined 
i n light of the sweeping breadth of the arbitration clause,the nature of the dues checkoff clause,and hearst failure to identify a limitation on the continued viability of the dues checkoff entitlement,the court concludes that the cba contemplates postexpiration arbitration of the issue of whether the guild is entitled to continued collection and remittance of dues.accordingly,the cba evidences an intent to arbitrate issues relating to dues checkoff obligations even after expiration of the cba 
id.footnote omitted.the court therefore ordered the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration.id.at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,hearst argues that the district court erred in concluding that the parties dispute is subject to arbitration pursuant to the cba.it maintains that the cba does not contemplate that hearst obligation would survive the cba expiration and,therefore,hearst is not required to arbitrate this dispute.it argues also that hearst has no statutory obligation to continue remitting union dues to the guild.we review de novo the district court determination that the dispute is arbitrable.see ass of broad.emps.technicians am.broad,cir.
the duty to arbitrate is a creature of the agreement such that a party can not be compelled to arbitrate any matter in the absence of a contractual obligation to do so.nolde,local,bakery confectionary workers union,d.nevertheless,the supreme court has stated that a dherence to these principles does not require us to hold that termination of a agreement automatically extinguishes a party duty to arbitrate grievances arising under the contract.id.at.in nolde,the court identified a presumption that matters and disputes arising out of the relation governed by contract are subject to arbitration even after the contract expires.litton fin.printing div.nlrb,d discussing nolde,at.the court further explained in litton that a postexpiration grievance can be said to arise under the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration,where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement,or where,under normal principles of contract interpretation,the disputed contractual right survives expir
