samuel dubbin appeals from a march,memorandum and order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york edward korman,chief judge denying his request for attorney fees in connection with the settlement of the litigation styled as the holocaust victim assets litigation.see in re holocaust victim assets,d.dubbin principal claim to attorney fees rests on his purported contributions to an amendment to the settlement agreement that modified releases granted to swiss insurance companies.in a comprehensive published opinion,the district court analyzed,and ultimately rejected,dubbin fee request on the ground that his contributions were late,tangential,and ultimately irrelevant.id.at.we affirm.
background 
this appeal was consolidated with an appeal from the district court settlement allocation and distribution orders brought by,inter alia,holocaust survivors,hsf,an entity represented by dubbin.we adjudicate the hsf appeal in a separate opinion,in re holocaust victim assets,cir,which summarizes the claims underlying the holocaust victim assets litigation and its procedural history.we assume familiarity with that summary and highlight here only those background events directly relevant to this appeal.
the settlement agreement signed by the parties on january,would have had the effect of releasing swiss insurance companies with three specific exceptions from liability for certain claims.in re holocaust victim assets,d at.on may,the district court set an october,deadline for comments on the settlement agreement.in re holocaust victim assets,slip op.at may,scheduling order.only one of the timely submissions specifically addressed the insurance october,objection by washington state insurance commissioner deborah senn.commissioner senn principally argued that 
t he proposed settlement is unfair to insurance policyholders and beneficiaries.it releases all claims against all swiss insurers and reinsurers with three exceptions.there has been no public review of their records to determine their unpaid holocaust policies or their value.these companies may be released from many millions of dollars of wrongfully unpaid claims in exchange for relatively de minimis payments to policyholders or their heirs.class members are required to decide whether to opt out of the class without even being told whether they or a family member were covered by policies or the face amount of such policies,although this information may be in the possession of the settling companies.the proposed settlement undermines the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims icheic whose protocols provide for identification,valuation and payment of policies.
commissioner senn concerns were echoed in a november,letter by lawrence eagleburger,the chairman of the icheic and former secretary of state.
only on november,than a month after the deadline for objections,and well after the district court had received the submissions of commissioner senn and secretary thomas weiss,who was then represented by dubbin,send a letter to the court regarding the insurance company releases.this letter reads,in its entirety 
dear judge korman,
it was brought to my attention that the swiss bank settlement of billion releases the swiss insurance companies with three exceptions from any further liability.this is completely unacceptable,as many swiss insurance companies acted as cloaking agents for munich reinsurance of germany during wwii.military and documents from state this explicitly and charge munich reinsurance with criminal activity.additionally,this surreptitious inclusion of these companies is not known to the general survivor community.your assistance to remove this inappropriate blanket amnesty for the swiss insurance industry is vital.
the bergier report states that the amount that the swiss owe regarding stolen wwii gold may exceed six billion dollars.the documents further state that although the swiss banking industry stopped receiving gold at a point before the end of the war as a result of treasury secretary henry morganthau admonition that there will be a day of reckoning the swiss insurance industry continued receiving stolen gold up to the last days of the war.justice demands that the swiss insurance industry not escape its responsibility.
thomas weiss,md 
dubbin made substantially the same points in an oral statement during a november,fairness hearing before the district court.in the main,he cautioned the court against a blanket release of unnamed and unidentified companies,which we know from evidence in the archives may well have been beneficiaries of looted jewish assets through the access in nazi insurance trusts,without being even identified or held to account in any way,shape or form for what their responsibilities are.dubbin added 
i know that commissioner senn in the state of washington and chairman eagleburger have brought this question to the court attention.but particularly in light of some of the documents we have found,we felt on behalf of the florida survivor community and weiss in particular,we would urge i know the lead settlement counsel,professor burt neuborne said if we have any problems with the settlement,please bring them to his attention.
i do know what benefit accrues to survivors from what may be a big surprise at the end of the road,when we find out some of the companies not even identified today being released could well be as culpable as some of the ones who we been talking about all these years.thank you very much.
in a december,conference that followed the fairness hearings,the district court instructed the lead settlement counsel to renegotiate the releases of swiss insurance companies.in re holocaust victim assets,d at.
on january,approximately six weeks after the lead settlement counsel received this charge from the district court and three months after the deadline for comments on the original settlement agreement,dubbin filed a written objection to the settlement agreement.the objection principally criticized the broad inclusion of swiss insurers,and,thereby,claims for unpaid insurance policies under the umbrella of this litigation.
in may,the parties to the class action agreed to amend the settlement agreement in a manner that addressed the district court concerns regarding the insurance company releases.in re holocaust victim assets,d at.the amended settlement agreement designated an amount of up to up to million provided by the insurance the resolution of unpaid insurance claims.id.at.in a memorandum and order dated july,the district court approved the amended settlement agreement.in re holocaust victim assets,d.its final order approving the agreement was entered august.
dubbin subsequently informed the district court of his intention to appeal,on behalf of weiss,the approval of the amended settlement agreement.see in re holocaust victim assets,d at.the court met with dubbin and weiss to discuss their concerns,and it subsequently described what transpired 
after the discussion appeared to be going nowhere,weiss asked how much i would pay to prevent them from filing a notice of appeal.specifically,he wanted me to provide attorneys fees and funds for private research that would assist him in his litigation against the italian insurance firm generali.this was beyond the pale.i was not going to be blackmailed,particularly with funds that belong to holocaust survivors.
id.at.dubbin then filed a notice of appeal on weiss behalf,but eventually withdrew it without filing a brief.other parties,however,appealed from the district court order approving the amended settlement agreement.we affirmed.see in re holocaust victim assets,cir.
dubbin then submitted a fee application seeking a total of million million for himself and approximately million for weiss.see in re holocaust victim assets,d at quoting in re holocaust victim assets,d.this request was almost equal to the total amount of legal fees awarded to those counsel who were compensated for their role in obtaining the billion settlement with the swiss banks.id.emphasis added.of the total fees requested,million for dubbin and million for weiss was sought in connection with the
