litigation decisions made by parties have consequences.this case involves strategic decisions made by parties in an attempt to obtain a benefit from a particular ruling when the court issued a contrary order,those parties attempted to reverse course and get the district court to reach a different result under rule b.the district court was unsympathetic,and this appeal followed.arthur zang,and harold beck joined a number of other employees in filing state employment actions against six interrelated companies,including the paul revere variable annuity insurance company variable.variable,alone among the six companies,is a member of the national association of securities dealers nasd.based on that membership the companies sought to compel arbitration against seventeen of the former employees by virtue of those employees registration with nasd.fifteen of the seventeen former employees then voluntarily dismissed their claims against variable and continued their claims against the remaining five companies zang and beck remained steadfast and contested the motions to compel arbitration.
the district court dismissed the motions to compel arbitration as to the fifteen employees who no longer had claims against variable and,after further argument,entered an order compelling zang and beck to submit their claims against the six companies to arbitration,finding that they both had entered into enforceable arbitration agreements.faced with this court order,zang and beck reversed course and decided to dismiss their claims against variable.after doing so,they sought relief from the district court order under rule b,arguing that the remaining five companies lacked standing on their own to compel arbitration.the district court declined to grant relief from its order,and zang and beck now appeal both that denial and the initial order.we affirm both orders.
in march,provident companies,acquired the paul revere corporation.as a result,provident combined effective control of its own wholly owned subsidiary,provident life accident insurance company,with control of the paul revere variable annuity insurance company and the paul revere protective life insurance company,two wholly owned subsidiaries of the paul revere life insurance company,which,in turn,was a wholly owned subsidiary of the paul revere corporation.in october,a number of general managers for the paul revere family of companies,alleging that the termination of their employment was imminent with the completion of the acquisition,filed separate but substantially similar breach of contract actions in a massachusetts trial court against all six of these corporate entities.
as a condition of their employment,seventeen of the general managers,including zang and beck,had registered with nasd and allegedly thereby promised to abide by nasd rules and regulations as they were from time to time amended.at the time that the employment actions were filed,the nasd code mandated arbitration of certain disputes if requested by a nasd member or a person associated with a member.
based on variable membership in nasd,the six companies sought to compel arbitration of the dispute as to those seventeen managers.first,in january the petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration in the state court,invoking the nasd code,and asked the court to stay its hand or dismiss the case pending arbitration.fifteen of the managers then voluntarily dismissed their actions against variable ultimately with prejudice,removing the only petitioner from their cases who was a nasd member zang and beck retained their claims against variable.
faced with the employees objections to their motions,in july the companies went to federal district court seeking orders staying the state court actions and compelling arbitration by all seventeen former employees,invoking the federal arbitration act faa,et,and resting jurisdiction on diversity,see a.in september,the district court denied the petition to compel arbitration as to those fifteen managers who had dismissed variable on the ground that the remaining petitioners,absent variable as a defendant,lacked standing under nasd arbitration protocol.see paul revere variable annuity ins.thomas,d.this court upheld that denial.see paul revere variable annuity ins.kirschhofer,cir.
unlike the other fifteen managers,instead of dismissing variable,zang and beck opted to retain their claims against variable and contest the motion to compel arbitration on the merits.they did so,presumably,because their largest dollar value claims were against variable.specifically,zang and beck contested the existence of a binding agreement to arbitrate,contended that they lacked sufficient notice of the amendments to nasd regulations requiring mandatory arbitration to compel them to arbitrate their employment claims,and argued that,in any case,their claims fell outside the scope of the nasd arbitration provision,both because they did not sell securities and because the nasd code provided an exception from arbitration for insurance business.in october,after issuing its orders dismissing the petitions against the other managers,the district court held a status conference to determine the issues in dispute with regard to zang and beck.the court ordered further briefing and denied further discovery.on january,the court granted the petitions against zang and beck and ordered the parties to arbitrate.zang and beck filed a timely appeal.
on march,zang and beck dismissed their claims against variable with prejudice in the state court actions.they then moved the district court to amend its prior orders under.b,arguing that since they had dismissed the claims against variable,none of the remaining parties had standing under the nasd arbitration protocol to compel arbitration.on september,the district court summarily denied zang and beck rule b motions for relief from final judgment.again zang and beck filed an appeal,and this court consolidated the two appeals.
first,zang and beck seek relief from the final order of the district court compelling arbitration under rule b,in light of their subsequent dismissal with prejudice of their claims against variable.rule b affords district courts the equitable power to relieve a party from the force of a final order or judgment under certain conditions where necessary to serve the ends of justice zang and beck argue that now that variable is no longer a party to the ordered arbitration,the remaining parties lack standing to compel arbitration under the nasd arbitration protocol therefore they assert on appeal that rule b relief is warranted both under clause,because prospective application of the arbitration order is,they say,no longer equitable,and under clause,because the lack of standing of the remaining parties provides a reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
this effort faces two formidable hurdles.first,rule b relief is extraordinary relief reserved for exceptional circumstances,given the countervailing interest in the finality of such orders.see united states v.one urban lot,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the district court decision to deny relief under rule b is,in turn,reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.see ahmed rosenblatt,cir we will find an abuse of discretion under rule b only when we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the lower court committed a clear error of judgment,cert.denied,d.zang and beck fail to clear these considerable hurdles.
the first five subsections of rule b allow a court to relieve a party from a final judgment on several specified grounds,such as mistake or excusable neglect,newly discovered evidence,or fraud.see.b.rule b provides federal district courts with a residual reservoir of equitable power to grant discretionary relief from a final judgment for any other reason justifying relief see.b.this residual catchall provision allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment where such relief is appropriate to accomplish justice,but the reasons for that relief are not encompassed by the other provisions of the rule.zang and beck argue that the fact that the only petitioner with standing under the nasd code to compel arbitration variable is no longer party to the case justifies relief from the arbitration order issued by the district court.this is not necessarily so,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying such relief.
district courts should grant rule b motions only where exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary relief exist.ahmed,at,citing valley citizens for a safe environment aldridge,cir.district courts have broad discretion to determine whether such circumstances exist.valley citizens,at.the bar for such relief is set high because,as the supreme court noted in ackermann united states,t here must be an end to litigation someday,and therefore district courts must weigh the reasons advanced for reopening the judgment against the desire to achieve finality in litigation.lussier dugger,cir see also wright et,federal practice and procedure,at west.
the reasons for relief advanced by zang and beck are not so compelling as to require the district court to grant their rule b motion.the decision to persevere in their claims against variable upon the filing of the petitions to compel arbitration in federal court was a free,calculated,and deliberate choice.ackermann,at.the only relevant change in circumstance since the entry of the arbitration order is zang and beck also free,calculated,and deliberate choice to dismiss variable from their state court actions.ordinarily,the discretionary power granted by rule b is not for the purpose of relieving a party from such free,calculated,and deliberate choices made as part of a strategy of litigation.id.free,calculated,deliberate choices are not to be relieved from see also id.at.stating that by no stretch of the imagination can the voluntary,deliberate,free,untrammeled choice by the petitioner not to appeal compare with the exceptional circumstances found in other cases wright et,supra,at.the law presumes that parties will make choices to protect their legal interests,even though those choices may at times involve a calculated risk.where a party makes a considered choice,though it may involve some calculated risk,he can not be relieved of such a choice because hindsight seems to indicate to him that,as it turns out,his decision was probably wrong.ackermann,at.
zang and beck are correct that the facts of ackermann are case involved a decision not to pursue an appeal.but still,the policy embodied in ackermann applies with equal force in this case.zang and beck persisted in their claim against variable,cognizant of the risk that this would lead to mandatory arbitration.indeed,by the time of the october status conference,the september dismissals of the petitions against the other fifteen managers made clear that it was reasonably likely that this consequence could be avoided by dismissing variable.nonetheless zang and beck continued to litigate against the petitions to compel arbitration rather than dismissing variable,gambling that they could defeat those petitions on the merits.only upon the district court order compelling arbitration did zang and beck opt to dismiss variable,hoping thereby to evade the arbitration order.
zang and beck chose to retain their claim against variable,fully aware that this choice increased the likelihood that they would be compelled to arbitrate their claims.now that this likelihood has been borne out,they can not reverse the consequences of their decision after the fact by suddenly changing course and then asking the district court to correct for their earlier improvident choice.rather,the rule contemplates that a party will take the legal steps necessary to protect his own interests,and instead acts to relieve a party from extraordinary predicaments where,because of exceptional circumstances,the party would have been unable to do so.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief on the grounds here.
on appeal,zang and beck also argue that their rule b motion falls within the fifth clause of the rule,which allows a court to relieve parties from judgments with prospective effect where,inter alia,it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.b.petitioners contend that zang and beck failed to argue adequately before the district court that their case fell within the scope of this provision,and that therefore the argument is waived.zang and beck respond that they did raise the argument,and in any event they say that motions under rule b need not specifically reference a particular subsection.
we need not reach the waiver question because it is clear that zang and beck do not qualify for relief under rule b.as an initial matter,zang and beck claims fall far outside the cases with which the provision is particularly concerned,such as institutional reform litigation,where,because the decree involves the supervision of changing conduct or conditions,its prospective requirements may be rendered inappropriate by unforeseen changes in circumstance subsequent to the entry of the order.see,rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d suggesting a flexible standard is required for decrees that involve the supervision of changing conduct or conditions and thus of necessity are provisional and tentative.
even if we were to indulge in respondents favor the argument that the arbitration order falls within the scope of rule b,qualifying for relief under this provision requires a clear showing of inequity.historically,the standard for relief from a binding decree was quite high.united states swift.no doubt the defendants will be better off if the injunction is relaxed,but they are not suffering hardship so extreme and unexpected as to justify us in saying that they are the victims of oppression.nothing less than a clear showing of a grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed see also wright et,supra,at.it is true the supreme court has acknowledged that greater flexibility is required in considering requests to modify institutional reform consent decrees.see rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,at.nonetheless this court has since required a considerable showing to modify decrees in private contractual disputes that lack substantial bearing on the public interest.see alexis lichine cie sacha lichine estate selections,cir describing the continuum of cases in which rule b is invoked.in considering the equities of such a modification,a court should look to such factors as the circumstances leading to the decree,the level of hardship on the burdened party,and the extent to which the change in circumstances falls outside of those contemplated at the time the decree was issued.the order here resolved a contractual dispute between private parties with tenuous and tangential bearing at best on the public interest the hardship of mandated arbitration is limited and the change of circumstances lay fully within the control of and,indeed,was caused by the parties requesting relief.such facts fail to demonstrate the type of inequity to warrant rule b relief.
zang and beck argue that a change in facts justifying relief from the prospective effect of a final order under rule b need not be unforeseen and unforeseeable.this assertion is correct.see rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,at.from this assertion zang and beck reason by implication that rule b relief is appropriate here,where the circumstances at issue were within their control both before and after the issuance of the district court order.but there is considerable distance between facts that were completely unforeseen when an order was issued and those circumstances that were in both the control and contemplation of the parties,both before and at the time of the judgment the line was not extended so far in rufo.id.litigants are not required to anticipate every exigency that could conceivably arise during the life of a consent decree.ordinarily,however,modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree.rather,the policy underlying parties must live with the consequences of freely made,calculated decisions reached for strategic reasons i
