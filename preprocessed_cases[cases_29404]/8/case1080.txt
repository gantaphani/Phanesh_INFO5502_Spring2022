this appeal,raising difficult questions concerning the magistrates act,supp.ii,arises out of complex facts which we summarize at the outset.
national hair care centers,national operated a chain of beauty salons until when it sold its assets to regis corporation.on august,diane conetta began working as manager at a national salon in cranston,rhode island.eleven months later,on july,national fired conetta,saying that she had not taken proper inventories,coming up over short in one instance.in february,conetta filed charges against national with the rhode island commission for human rights the charges,amended in may,were with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.conetta alleged verbal sexual harassment and age discrimination by the supervisor of national salons in the new england area.
on august,a week after receiving a letter,conetta brought suit against national and the supervisor individually in federal district court in rhode island.in an amended complaint,she charged sexual harassment,age discrimination,and retaliatory discharge in violation of federal and state statutes as well as several common law torts,assault,negligent infliction of emotional distress.conetta husband filed a claim for loss of consortium.on december,the summons and complaint were served on ct corporation,national designated agent for service of process in rhode island the supervisor was apparently never served.national did not answer the complaint.on january,the conettas moved for entry of default and the court clerk entered a default against national on the same day.a.
on february,the conettas filed a motion for default judgment.b,which was referred by judge pettine to magistrate judge lovegreen.a district court may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court with a few explicit exceptions,district court review then being limited to orders clearly erroneous or contrary to law,b a or,a magistrate judge may be told to hear and submit proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition by the district judge as to motions excepted from subsection b a,id.b b,or on virtually any matter at all,id.b.the docket entry did not indicate which provision judge pettine sought to invoke.
on may,magistrate judge lovegreen held a hearing on the motion.both of the conettas testified,and they also presented the testimony of a psychiatrist and offered various records and depositions concerning diane conetta health and pay.the magistrate judge then granted the conettas motion for the entry of a default judgment,and on may,signed an order fixing the amount of damages at this reflected in compensatory damages and in punitive damages for diane conetta,and in compensatory damages for her husband loss of consortium claim.judgment was entered on june,and in january,the conettas brought a new suit to enforce the judgment.
thus prompted,national,on february,filed a motion to vacate or set aside the entry of default and default judgment in the original suit.c,b.in a supporting affidavit,wayne riffle,national president since june,and previously its chief financial officer,admitted that he had first learned of conetta complaints with the rhode island commission in may.he also admitted receiving a copy of the summons and complaint in the federal court action but did not recall receiving any other documents.he then said that as a layman he was under the impression that conetta was precluded from bringing a lawsuit relating to the matter until the state agency held a hearing,and that he believed that the agency proceeding was still pending when he received the summons and complaint 
chief judge lagueux,who took over the case from judge pettine,referred the new motions to magistrate judge lovegreen.magistrate judge lovegreen entered an order on april,granting national motion to set aside the default judgment and the entry of default,conditioned on national payment of to the conettas for their expenses incurred in obtaining the judgment.based on riffle affidavit,the magistrate judge found that national had demonstrated excusable neglect,as required by rule b to set aside a default judgment setting aside an entry of default requires good cause.c,which is a less demanding standard,coon grenier,cir.
the conettas then filed objections in the district court to the magistrate judge decision,asserting that the district court should review the matter de novo.national defended the magistrate judge order,urging that it be reviewed only for clear error or legal mistake.in conetta national hair care centers,conetta i,chief judge lagueux held that the magistrate judge order should be reviewed de novo and that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to decide whether national failure to respond to the original complaint was willful and therefore not excusable neglect.
on february,the district court held an evidentiary hearing,receiving testimony from riffle and from riffle lawyer,robert ross.riffle admitted that he had signed return receipts for conetta letter on august,and for her amended complaint on january,and that his wife had signed for receipt of the conettas motion for entry of default,also in january.however,riffle did nothing with the documents at the time except to file them with national other papers.
riffle said that in late april or early may,he turned these files over to ross,a partner in an arkansas law firm.ross stated that upon reviewing the papers,he realized that national was in default and assigned a recent law school graduate to draft a motion to vacate the default.the draft motion was apparently misplaced when the graduate left the firm to study for the bar and never filed in court.apparently,it was not until regis counsel received the complaint in the conettas subsequent suit to enforce their default judgment that national again focused on the matter.
prompted by an meeting with the district judge after the hearing,national then filed a motion to vacate the default judgment as void.b.on april,the district court granted the motion on the ground that the default judgment was a final judgment and that article iii does not allow a magistrate judge to order the entry of a final judgment.conetta national hair care centers,conetta ii.however,the district court refused to set aside the clerk entry of default,finding that riffle had failed to show good cause for not responding to the conettas summons and complaint.id.at.the conettas promptly moved for entry of a default judgment,but the district court rejected the motion in favor of holding a bench trial to determine damages.
after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment on december,awarding diane conetta for lost wages from the retaliatory discharge and for pain and suffering arising from her hostile work environment and retaliation claims.the court found her husband loss of consortium claim to be a phantom claim without evidentiary support and ordered nominal damages of.the district court also awarded prejudgment interest of six percent per annum from august,when the case was filed,to the date of ruling,for a total of approximately.
thereafter,the conettas moved to amend the judgment.e,urging,inter alia,that the court should apply the rhode island statutory prejudgment interest rate of twelve percent effective from the date of diane conetta discharge july.after a hearing,the district court agreed,and amended its judgment on january,arriving at a new figure of roughly.national promptly appealed,and the conettas.
the original judgment for in favor of the conettas based on the magistrate judge findings was entered by the court clerk on june.it was the decision of chief judge lagueux to set aside this judgment as void under article iii,conetta ii,at,that led in due course to the other events at issue on this appeal,namely,the refusal to remove the entry of default and the recalculation of damages.at the threshold,the conettas attack the district court decision to set aside the default judgment as void pursuant to rule b.
interestingly,the conettas do not directly quarrel with the district court statement that a magistrate judge has no power under article iii to enter a final judgment.the statement,albeit by precedent may be overbroad but this is of no consequence because we agree entirely that the magistrate judge had no statutory authority to make a final determination of the damages due to the conettas,see callier gray,cir.although the statutory provisions are less than lucid,partly because of their complicated history,see wright,miller marcus,federal practice and procedure,at ed,the outcome is clear.
subsection b is awkwardly phrased but a fair parsing makes plain that congress did not intend subparagraph a reference to pretrial matter to encompass a final determination of liability or damages in a civil action.this is evident from subparagraph a exclusion of the key dispositive motions,summary judgment from the juxtaposition of subparagraph b,which allows only a recommended decision on the excluded motions and from rule which,as a kind of gloss on the statute,makes the ability of the magistrate judge to determine a opposed to recommending a on whether it is or is not dispositive.see also,at,reprinted in.
the conettas accept this premise,arguing we think correctly that the magistrate judge could at most hear the evidence and prepare a recommended decision as to the amount of damages.callier,at.but they then argue that the damage findings became final when national failed to seek review within ten days,see.b,and that the district court clerk therefore had the authority to enter a final judgment for this sum under the authority of rule b,which permits default judgments to be entered by the clerk where the plaintiff claim is for a sum certain.the argument is clever but unpersuasive.
the conettas claims were not for a sum certain but,as is quite customary in tort cases,for amounts to be determined on the evidence.the judgment entered ministerially by the clerk reflected the magistrate judge final determination,which the latter had no statutory authority to make.even if the magistrate judge determination were treated merely as a recommendation which national failed properly to challenge,rule b still requires the district judge to adopt,reject,or modify the recommendation before there is any final judicial action.no such action was taken by either district judge as to the award.
it may seem odd that a court clerk can enter a default judgment for a sum certain claimed in a complaint while a magistrate judge,absent consent,can not order such an entry after a more reliable evidentiary hearing to determine an uncertain claim.but this seeming oddity disappears when one considers that one judgment rests on a defendant default,and the other assumes a judicial determination by a court.and once entering the judgment is deemed beyond the power of the magistrate judge,the conettas do not dispute that chief judge lagueux was entitled to set it aside,so we need not answer the question whether it should be called void or merely voidable.
having set aside the default judgment,chief judge lagueux refused to set aside the entry of default,finding on the evidence before him that national had failed to show good cause.conetta ii,at.broadly speaking,this meant that national could contest damages because they were not fixed by the entry of default,but not the facts alleged in the complaint to show liability because they were fixed.see goldman,antonetti,ferraiuoli,axtmayer hertell medfit int l,cir.national says that the district court erred in bypassing the magistrate judge decision to set aside the default and by creating a new record and that,in any event,the district court erred on the merits in its own determination that good cause was lacking.
the first of these two arguments rests on national successive claims that its rule c motion to set aside entry of default was a pretrial motion,the motion was assigned to the magistrate judge under subsection b a,the magistrate judge order could,by the terms of subparagraph a,be reviewed only for clear error or mistake of law,and therefore the district court erred in conducting a de novo assessment of the decision to set aside the default.
it is not clear whether the rule c motion to vacate the default could be regarded as a pretrial motion linguistic and policy arguments can be made either way,see generally wright,miller marcus,supra,at,and there is no case law in point but even if the motion to vacate the default itself could have been referred under subsection b a,the simultaneous rule b motion to vacate default judgment was not a pretrial motion and could only have been referred under subparagraph b or subsection b.legear thalacker,cir per curiam mcleod,alexander,powel apffel,quarles,cir.
accordingly,when the district court reviewed the magistrate judge order setting aside entry of default and default judgment,it was clearly entitled to take evidence and make a de novo assessment as to the latter.mcleod,alexander,powel apffel,at.yet the same evidence relevant to excusable neglect the standard for vacating default also be relevant to good cause the standard for setting aside entry of default.see coon,at.thus,even assuming that the motion to vacate the default were normally only reviewed for clear error on the magistrate judge record,it would be bizarre here to prevent the district court from considering the more complete evidence of what riffle knew and ross did as to both motions.
frankly,even if this special circumstance were not present,the district court might still have been entitled to hold an evidentiary hearing and decide the matter of the default itself de novo on a fuller record.true,the statute does not specifically provide for new evidence to be taken by the district court on motions referred under subsection b a,and this is not the usual course but it is not clearly forbidden either if there is good cause for revisiting the matter.here the district court had reason to think correctly as it proved that the record was incomplete as to the circumstances of the default.
the magistrates act does not set up a new and independent court system,rigidly separated from the district court rather,the statute enlarges powers previously exercised by magistrates and commissioners to assist district judges in their duties.the case itself belongs to the district judge throughout.see wright,miller marcus,supra,at.the limited review provision in subsection b a was to assure litigants a right to have a pretrial ruling reconsidered where it rests on clear error or a mistake of law it does not seem to have been intended to limit the power of the district judge,at.
no doubt,in ordinary cases,limited review on the existing record should be the rule after a reference under subparagraph a.but we are doubtful that the act ought to be read to hamstring a district judge who,after receiving the magistrate judge determination,finds no clear error or mistake of law on the existing record but reasonably concludes that further investigation is necessary.compare c power to vacate subsection c references.but see haines liggett group,cir.we need not definitely resolve the broader issue,since in this case the motion to vacate the default judgment permitted the district judge to take and consider new evidence.
national has a second and independent reason for contesting the district court refusal to set aside the default.it says that even on a new record the district court findings and conclusions are themselves faulty and that the record establishes the good cause needed to justify setting aside the entry of default.on an appeal from a good cause ruling,our own review is for clear error as to factual findings,de novo review of strictly legal issues,and deference as to judgment calls involved in balancing considerations.coon,at indep.oil chem.workers of quincy,procter gamble,cir.
the good cause standard under rule c is,but among the important familiar considerations are these the extent of the defendant fault,prejudice to the plaintiff,whether a meritorious defense exists to the lawsuit,the stakes,and the timing of the motion.mckinnon kwong wah,cir.at first blush,this might seem to put national in a strong position the prejudice to diane conetta could be offset by awarding her fees for the earlier damages he
