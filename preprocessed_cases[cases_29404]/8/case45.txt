in asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action,an alleged infringer must contend with of the patent act of act,under which a patent shall be presumed valid and t he burden of establishing invalidity shall rest on the party asserting it.since,the federal circuit has read to require a defendant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.
respondents collectively,hold the patent at issue,which claims an improved method for editing computer documents.after sued petitioner microsoft for willful infringement of that patent,microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the patent was invalid under b bar,which precludes patent protection for any invention that was on sale in this country more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application.the parties agreed that,more than a year before filing its patent application,had sold a software program known as in the united states,but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the invention claimed in patent.relying on the undisputed fact that the software was never presented to the patent and trademark office pto during its examination of the patent application,microsoft objected to proposed jury instruction that the invalidity defense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.the district court nevertheless gave that instruction,rejecting microsoft alternative instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence standard.the jury found that microsoft willfully infringed the patent and had failed to prove the patent invalidity.the federal circuit affirmed,relying on its settled interpretation of.
held section requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.
a the court rejects microsoft contention that a defendant need only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.where congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof,its choice generally controls.steadman sec.congress has made such a choice here.while includes no express articulation of the standard of proof,where congress uses a term in a statute,the court assumes the term comes with a common law meaning.safeco ins.of america burr.here,by stating that a patent is presumed valid,congress used a term with a settled meaning.radio of america radio engineering laboratories,rca,is authoritative.there,tracing nearly a century of case law,the court stated,inter alia,that there is a presumption of patent validity that is not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence,at.microsoft contention that the court precedents applied a standard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing,given the absence of those qualifications from the court cases.also unpersuasive is microsoft argument that the federal circuit interpretation must fail because it renders superfluous additional statement that t he burden of establishing invalidity shall rest on the party asserting it.the canon against superfluity assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.duncan walker.here,no interpretation of avoids excess language because,under either of microsoft alternative theories that the presumption only allocates the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of production and persuasion the presumption itself would be unnecessary in light of additional statement as to the challenger burden.
b also rejected is microsoft argument that a preponderance standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder was not before the pto during the examination process.it is true enough that,in these circumstances,the rationale underlying the presumption that the pto,in its expertise,has approved the claim seems much diminished,ksr int l teleflex,though other rationales may still animate the presumption.but the question remains whether congress has specified the applicable standard of proof.as established here today,congress did just that by codifying the presumption of patent validity and,implicitly,the heightened standard of proof attached to it.the court cases never adopted or endorsed microsoft fluctuating standard of proof.and they do not indicate,even in dicta,that anything less than a standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense.in fact,the court indicated to the contrary.see rca,at.finally,the court often applied the heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the relevant evidence had been before the pto examiner,in circumstances strongly suggesting it had not.see,smith hall.nothing in text suggests that congress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case.indeed,had congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where the evidence before the jury varied from that before the pto,it presumably would have said so expressly.those cases where various courts of appeals observed that the presumption is weakened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the pto should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the pto did not have all material facts before it,its considered judgment may lose significant force.ksr,at.consistent with that principle,a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially new,and if so,to consider that fact when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.
c this court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the parties policy arguments as to the wisdom of the standard that congress adopted.congress specified the applicable standard of proof in when it codified the presumption of patent validity.during the nearly years that the federal circuit has interpreted as the court does today,congress has often amended and other patent laws,but apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard of proof.indeed,congress has left the federal circuit interpretation in place despite ongoing criticism,both from within the federal government and without.accordingly,any recalibration of the standard of proof remains in congress hands.

under of the patent act of,a patent shall be presumed valid and t he burden of establishing of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.we consider whether requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.we hold that it does.
pursuant to its authority under the patent clause,art.i,cl,congress has charged the united states patent and trademark office pto with the task of examining patent applications,a,and issuing patents if it appears that the applicant is entitled to a patent under the law,congress has set forth the prerequisites for issuance of a patent,which the pto must evaluate in the examination process.to receive patent protection a claimed invention must,among other things,fall within one of the express categories of patentable subject matter,and be novel,and nonobvious.most relevant here,the bar of b precludes patent protection for any invention that was on sale in this country more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application.see generally pfaff wells electronics.in evaluating whether these and other statutory conditions have been met,pto examiners must make various factual determinations for instance,the state of the prior art in the field and the nature of the advancement embodied in the invention.see dickinson zurko.
once issued,a patent grants certain exclusive rights to its holder,including the exclusive right to use the invention during the patent duration.to enforce that right,a patentee can bring a civil action for infringement if another person without authority makes,uses,offers to sell,or sells any patented invention,within the united states.a see also.
among other defenses under of the patent act of act,an alleged infringer may assert the invalidity of the patent that is,he may attempt to prove that the patent never should have issued in the first place.see.a defendant may argue,for instance,that the claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus that one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.see see also.while the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law,graham john deere of kansas city,citing great atlantic pacific tea supermarket equipment,douglas,concurring see post,at breyer,concurring,the same factual questions underlying the pto original examination of a patent will also bear on an invalidity defense in an action.see,at describing the basic factual inquiries that form the background for evaluating obviousness pfaff,at same,as to the bar.
in asserting an invalidity defense,an alleged infringer must contend with the first paragraph of,which provides that a patent shall be presumed valid and t he burden of establishing invalidity rest s on the party asserting such invalidity.under the federal circuit reading of,a defendant seeking to overcome this presumption must persuade the factfinder of its defense by clear and convincing evidence.judge rich,a principal drafter of the act,articulated this view for the court in american hoist derrick sowa sons,ca fed.there,the federal circuit held that codified the existing presumption of validity of patents,at internal quotation marks omitted what,until that point,had been a presumption based on the basic proposition that a government agency such as the pto was presumed to do its job,ibid.relying on this court precedent as to the force of the presumption,ibid.citing radio of america radio engineering laboratories,rca,judge rich concluded

respondents limited partnership and infrastructures for information collectively,hold the patent at issue in this suit.the patent claims an improved method for editing computer documents,which stores a document content separately from the metacodes with the document structure.in,sued petitioner microsoft corporation for willful infringement,claiming that microsoft manufacture and sale of certain microsoft word products infringed patent.in addition to denying infringement,microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that patent was invalid and unenforceable.
specifically and as relevant here,microsoft claimed that the bar of b rendered the patent invalid,pointing to prior sale of a software program known as.the parties agreed that,more than one year prior to the filing of the patent application,had sold in the united states.they presented opposing arguments to the jury,however,as to whether that software embodied the invention claimed in patent.because the software source code had been destroyed years before the commencement of this litigation,the factual dispute turned largely on trial testimony by two inventors also the named inventors on the patent both of whom testified that did not practice the key invention disclosed in the patent.
relying on the undisputed fact that the software was never presented to the pto examiner,microsoft objected to proposed instruction that it was required to prove its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.instead,if an instruction on the clear and convincing burden were to be given,app,microsoft the following 
microsoft burden of proving invalidity and unenforceability is by clear and convincing evidence.however,microsoft burden of proof with regard to its defense of invalidity based on prior art that the did not review during the prosecution of the is by preponderance of the evidence.ibid.
rejecting the hybrid standard of proof that microsoft advocated,the district court instructed the jury that microsoft has the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.app.to pet.for cert.
the jury found that microsoft willfully infringed the patent and that microsoft failed to prove invalidity due to the bar or otherwise.denying microsoft motions,the district court rejected microsoft contention that the court improperly instructed the jury on the standard of proof.the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed.relying on its settled interpretation of,the court explained that it could discern no error in the jury instruction requiring microsoft to prove its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.ibid.we granted certiorari.
according to microsoft,a defendant in an infringement action need only persuade the jury of an invalidity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.in the alternative,microsoft insists that a preponderance standard must apply at least when an invalidity defense rests on evidence that was never considered by the pto in the examination process.we reject both contentions 
where congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof,its choice controls absent countervailing constitutional constraints.steadman sec.the question,then,is whether congress has made such a choice here.
as stated,the first paragraph of provides that a patent shall be presumed valid and t he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.thus,by its express terms,establishes a presumption of patent validity,and it provides that a challenger must overcome that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense.but,while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of proof,it includes no express articulation of the standard of proof 
our statutory inquiry,however,can not simply end there.we begin,of course,with the assumption that the ordinary meaning of the language chosen by congress accurately expresses the legislative purpose.engine mfrs.south coast air quality management,internal quotation marks omitted.but where congress uses a term in a statute,we assume the term comes with a common law meaning,absent anything pointing another way.safeco ins.of america burr,citing beck prupis.here,by stating that a patent is presumed valid,congress used a term with a settled meaning in the common law.
our decision in rca,is authoritative.there,tracing nearly a century of case law from this court and others,justice cardozo wrote for a unanimous court that there is a presumption of validity,a presumption not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.at.although the force of the presumption found varying expression in this court and elsewhere,at,justice cardozo explained,one common core of thought and truth unified the decisions 
o ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion,and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.if that is true where the assailant connects himself in some way with the title of the true inventor,it is so a fortiori where he is a stranger to the invention,without claim of title of his own.if it is true where the assailant launches his attack with evidence different,at least in form,from any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent,it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is even verbally the same.at internal citation omitted 
the presumption,in other words,reflected the universal understanding that a preponderance standard of proof was too dubious a basis to deem a patent invalid.see also,at a patent is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error 
thus,by the time congress enacted and declared that a patent is presumed valid,the presumption of patent validity had long been a fixture of the common law.according to its settled meaning,a defendant raising an invalidity defense bore a heavy burden of persuasion,requiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing evidence,at.that is,the presumption encompassed not only an allocation of the burden of proof but also an imposition of a heightened standard of proof.under the general rule that a term comes with its meaning,we can not conclude that congress intended to drop the heightened standard proof from the presumption simply because fails to reiterate it expressly.neder united states,see also,at where congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,we must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of those terms.quoting nationwide mut.ins.darden,standard oil of united sates,w here words are employed in a statute which had at the time a meaning at common law or in the law of this country they are presumed to have been used in that sense on the contrary,we must presume that congress intended to incorporate the heightened standard of proof,unless the statute otherwise dictates.neder,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we recognize that it may be unusual to treat a presumption as alone establishing the governing standard of proof.see,thayer,preliminary treatise on evidence at the common law hereinafter thayer when we read that the contrary of any particular presumption must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,it is to be recognized that we have something superadded to the rule of presumption,namely,another rule as to the amount of evidence which is needed to overcome the presumption but given how judges,including justice cardozo,repeatedly understood and explained the presumption of patent validity,we can not accept microsoft argument that congress used the words presumed valid to adopt only a procedural device for shifting the burden of production,or for shifting both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.brief for petitioner emphasis deleted.whatever the significance of a presumption in the abstract,basic principles of statutory construction require us to assume that congress meant to incorporate the cluster of ideas attached to the term it adopted.beck,at internal quotation marks omitted.and rca leaves no doubt that attached to the presumption of patent validity was an expression as to its force,at that is,the standard of proof required to overcome it 
resisting the conclusion that congress adopted the heightened standard of proof reflected in our cases,microsoft contends that those cases applied a standard of proof only in two limited circumstances,not in every case involving an invalidity defense.first,according to microsoft,the heightened standard of proof applied in cases involving oral testimony of prior invention,simply to account for the unreliability of such testimony.brief for petitioner.second,microsoft tells us,the heightened standard of proof applied to invalidity challenges based on priority of invention,where that issue had previously been litigated between the parties in pto proceedings,at.
squint as we may,we fail to see the qualifications that microsoft purports to identify in our cases.they certainly make no appearance in rca explanation of the presumption of patent validity.rca simply said,without qualification,that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion,and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.at see also,at a patent regularly issued,and even more obviously a patent issued after a hearing of all the rival claimants,is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error emphasis added.nor do they appear in any of our cases as express limitations on the application of the heightened standard of proof,smith hall,citing rca for the proposition that a heavy burden of persuasion rests upon one who seeks to negative novelty in a patent by showing prior use mumm jacob decker sons,not only is the burden to make good this defense upon the party setting it up,but his burden is a heavy one,as it has been held that every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him internal quotation marks omitted.in fact,microsoft itself admits that our cases could be read as announcing a heightened standard applicable to all invalidity assertions.brief for petitioner emphasis deleted.
furthermore,we can not agree that microsoft proposed limitations are inherent even if unexpressed in our cases.as early as we explained that the burden of proving prior inventorship rests upon the,and every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him,without tying that rule to the vagaries and manipulability of oral testimony.coffin ogden,wall.and,more than years later,we applied that rule where the evidence in support of a defense included documentary proof not just oral testimony in a case presenting no priority issues at all.see smith,at.thus,even if congress searched for some unstated limitations on the heightened standard of proof in our cases,it would have found none 
microsoft also argues that the federal circuit interpretation of statement that a patent shall be valid must fail because it renders superfluous the statute additional statement that t he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.we agree that if the presumption imposes a heightened standard of proof on the patent challenger,then it alone suffices to establish that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion.director,office of workers compensation programs greenwich collieries,a standard of proof can apply only to a burden of persuasion indeed,the federal circuit essentially recognized as much in american hoist.see,at.
but the canon against superfluity assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.duncan walker,quoting united states menasche,see bruesewitz wyeth llc,slip,at.here,no interpretation of including the two alternatives advanced by microsoft avoids excess language.that is,if the presumption only allocates the burden of production,brief for petitioner,or if it instead shift s both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion,at emphasis deleted,then it would be unnecessary in light of statement that the challenger bears the burden of establishing invalidity.see fed.practice,at t he same party who has the burden of persuasion also starts out with the burden of producing evidence there are times when congress enacts provisions that are superfluous,corley united states,alito,dissenting slip,at,and the kind of excess language that microsoft identifies in is hardly unusual in comparison to other statutes that set forth a presumption,a burden of persuasion,and a standard of proof,e 
reprising the more limited argument that it pressed below,microsoft argues in the alternative that a preponderance standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder was not before the pto during the examination process.in particular,it relies on ksr int l teleflex,where we that,in these circumstances,the rationale underlying the presumption that the pto,in its expertise,has approved the claim seems much diminished.at.
that statement is true enough,although other rationales may animate the presumption in such circumstances.see the barbed wire patent,explaining that because the patentee first published this device put it upon record made use of it for a practical purpose and gave it to the public.doubts concerning the actual inventor should be resolved in favor of the patentee brief for united states as amicus curiae arguing that even when the administrative rationale has no relevance,the heightened standard of proof serves to protect the patent holder reliance interests in disclosing an invention to the public in exchange for patent protection.the question remains,however,whether congress has specified the applicable standard of proof.as established,congress did just that by codifying the presumption of patent validity and,implicitly,the heightened standard of proof attached to it.
our cases never adopted or endorsed the kind of fluctuating standard of proof that microsoft envisions.and they do not indicate,even in dicta,that anything less than a standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense raised in an infringement action.to the contrary,the court spoke on this issue directly in rca,stating that because the heightened standard of proof applied where the evidence before the court was different from that considered by the pto,it applied even more clearly where the evidence was identical,at.likewise,the court statement that a dubious preponderance will never suffice to sustain an invalidity defense,admitted of no apparent exceptions.finally,this court often applied the heightened standard of proof without any mention of whether the relevant evidence had been before the pto examiner,in circumstances strongly suggesting it had not.see,smith,at,
nothing in text suggests that congress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case.indeed,had congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where the evidence before the jury varied from that before the pto and thus to take the unusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard of proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case,santosky kramer,we assume it would have said so expressly.
to be sure,numerous courts of appeals in the years preceding the act observed that the presumption of validity is weakened or dissipated in the circumstance that the evidence in an infringement action was never considered by the pto.see jacuzzi,berkeley pump,largely dissipated schindler saladino sons,weakened gillette safety razor cliff weil cigar,greatly weakened butler enterprise cleaning,weakened but we can not read these cases to hold or even to suggest that a preponderance standard would apply in such circumstances,and we decline to impute such a reading to congress.instead,we understand these cases to reflect the same commonsense principle that the federal circuit has recognized throughout its existence namely,that new evidence supporting an invalidity defense may carry more weight in an infringement action than evidence previously considered by the pto,american hoist,at.as judge rich explained 
when new evidence touching validity of the patent not considered by the pto is relied on,the tribunal considering it is not faced with having to disagree with the pto or with deferring to its judgment or with taking its expertise into account.the evidence may,therefore,carry more weight and go further toward sustaining the attacker unchanging burden.ibid.emphasis deleted

simply put,if the pto did not have all material facts before it,its considered judgment may lose significant force.ksr,at.and,concomitantly,the challenger burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to sustain.in this respect,although we have no occasion to endorse any particular formulation,we note that a jury instruction on the effect of new evidence can,and when requested,most often should be given.when warranted,the jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard evidence that the pto had no opportunity to evaluate before granting the patent.when it is disputed whether the evidence presented to the jury differs from that evaluated by the pto,the jury may be instructed to consider that question.in either case,the jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially new,and if so,to consider that fact when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear and convincing evidence,mendenhall cedarapids,ca fed.see also brief for international business machines as amicus curiae.although microsoft emphasized in its argument to the jury that was never considered by the pto,it failed to request an instruction along these lines from the district court.now,in its reply brief in this court,microsoft insists that an instruction of this kind was warranted.reply brief for petitioner.that argument,however,comes far too late,and we therefore refuse to consider it.see,west,jackson,slip,at fed.rule civ.proc.d b.
the parties and their amici have presented opposing views as to the wisdom of the standard that congress adopted.microsoft and its amici contend that the heightened standard of proof dampens innovation by unduly insulating bad patents from invalidity challenges.they point to the high invalidation rate as evidence that the pto grants patent protection to too many undeserving inventions.they claim that inter partes reexamination proceedings before the pto can not fix the problem,as some grounds for invalidation like the bar at issue here can not be raised in such proceedings.they question the deference that the pto expert determinations warrant,in light of the agency resources and procedures,which they deem inadequate.and,they insist that the heightened standard of proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in reviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.
for their part,and its amici,including the united states,contend that the heightened standard of proof properly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury overturns the considered judgment of an expert agency.they claim that the heightened standard of proof is an essential component of the patent bargain,see bonito boats,thunder craft boats,and the incentives for inventors to disclose their innovations to the public in exchange for patent protection.they disagree with the notion that the patent issuance rate is above the optimal level.they explain that limits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by congress as to the appropriate degree of interference with patentees reliance interests.finally,they maintain that juries that are properly instructed as to the application of the standard can,and often do,find an invalidity defense established.
we find ourselves in no position to judge the comparative force of these policy arguments.for nearly years,the federal circuit has interpreted as we do today.during this period,congress has often amended,see,pub,stat.pub,stat.not once,so far as we and microsoft are aware,has it even considered a proposal to lower the standard of proof,see tr.oral arg.moreover,congress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns about bad patents,including by expanding the reexamination process to provide for inter partes proceedings.see optional inter partes reexamination procedure act of,stat,codified at et.through it all,the evidentiary standard adopted in has gone untouched.indeed,congress has left the federal circuit interpretation of in place despite ongoing criticism,both from within the federal government and without 
congress specified the applicable standard of proof in when it codified the presumption of patent validity.since then,it has allowed the federal circuit correct interpretation of to stand.any of the standard of proof remains in its hands.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the federal circuit is 
the chief justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

justice breyer,with whom justice scalia and justice alito join,concurring.
i join the court opinion in full.i write separately,given the technical but important nature of the invalidity question,i believe it worth emphasizing that in this area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of proof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of law.see,addington texas.thus a factfinder must use the clear and convincing standard where there are disputes about,say,when a product was first sold or whether a prior art reference had been published.
many claims of invalidity rest,however,not upon factual disputes,but
