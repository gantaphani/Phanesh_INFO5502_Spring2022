background 
ronald nunn and donald vaden are former national basketball association nba referees.in september,plaintiffs participated in a referee training camp in new jersey and attended a union meeting hosted by the national basketball referees association the nbra.at the meeting,steven lucas,a sales representative for sun life of canada,the company mcic had designated as its administrator for disability income products,gave a presentation about supplemental disability insurance offered by mcic.sun life authorized lucas to solicit applications for mcic insurance policies.he was introduced as a disability expert with seventeen years experience.during the presentation,lucas described a supplemental disability policy he had implemented for umpires with major league baseball.lucas also explained to plaintiffs that their current insurance coverage might be insufficient if they became unable to work,but that he could offer supplemental disability insurance that changes the taxable benefit to a tax free benefit.it changes the benefit period from years to age.it covers you in your own occupation.if you ca do your job you disabled.transcript of fall nbra presentation at.lucas detailed how the supplemental insurance worked,specifically describing the own occupation aspect of the arrangement 
this program is a function of you being covered in your occupation at the time disability starts.if you ca be an official but you can work in a store some place you go ahead and work there.i mean,you are totally disabled from being an nba official that is what the disability is based on.
id.at emphasis added.he stressed repeatedly that one of the supplemental insurance key advantages was that it covered unable to perform their own occupation here,nba referee until they were years old,regardless of the extent of disability.lucas reiterated this point numerous times and further explained that while their current disability policy only paid benefits for ten years after disability,his company policy would make monthly payments to age no matter when the insured became disabled.id.at.again and again he counseled the gathered referees that t hey are all still going to collect the monthly payments through the age of the fact that it is issued to age it guarantees you that the supplement is truly that because it is tax free t he program covers you to as i mentioned before and t he policy is guaranteed to you to age.id.at,and.
within weeks of his presentation,lucas sent each plaintiff an application for supplemental coverage.each completed the application with lucas assistance over the phone.within a few days of each other,plaintiffs submitted applications through lucas for the supplemental disability insurance policy he had described.lucas signed both.neither plaintiff read the description of coverage prior to submitting their respective application.plaintiffs received their copies of mcic supplemental disability insurance policy,but again neither read the policy had they examined their policies,plaintiffs would have discovered that the policies definition of total disability was at odds with lucas description.though the definition for total disability in the policies began as lucas had promised providing coverage when the insured could not work in his or her occupation that definition changed after months of paid benefits.the policy states that after months,total disability shall then mean the insured substantial inability to perform the material duties of any gainful occupation for which is suited nunn and vaden dis.policy at emphasis added.
during his deposition,lucas agreed that the terms of the policy as he described them were not consistent with the terms of the policies that were sold to the nba referees.lucas dep.at.he admitted that the policies period of the definition of disability was inconsistent with the terms described in his presentation.id.at.he did not tell the nbra members that the policy he described was not actually available to them.id.at.
in,nunn suffered a knee injury that ended his career as an nba referee.the next year,vaden also suffered a career ending injury.each began receiving monthly payments pursuant to their supplemental insurance policies but after sixty months nunn was and vaden the payments stopped.because both plaintiffs were able to work at other jobs in fact,both continued working for the nba in other capacities mcic ceased payment.
both plaintiffs claim that based on lucas presentation,they expected to receive payments until age.vaden explained that he did not read the policy because he really went by what lucas told him because he trusted lucas.vaden dep.at.lucas was convincing,and then the union as a whole was excited about it,so i trusted him.id.at.nunn similarly explained that he did feel there was a need to read the policy.it was pretty clear how he understood lucas presentation.nunn dep.at.
in august,plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alleging breach of contract seeking reformation with respect to each policy.mcic moved for summary judgment,asserting that plaintiffs claims were barred by connecticut statute of limitations,and that the insurance policies contained unambiguous language limiting plaintiffs to sixty months of supplemental disability insurance payments if they were able to perform any gainful occupation thereafter the district court arterton,granted mcic motion for summary judgment.
the court concluded that plaintiffs were not entitled to reformation.in reaching this decision,the district court found that pennsylvania law governed the substance of the contract.the court explained that under pennsylvania law,courts generally give effect to the plain language of a contract,but if the insurer either unreasonably obscure d the terms or outright deceive d the insured,pennsylvania law requires courts to interpret contracts based on the reasonable expectations of the insured.nunn massachusetts cas.ins,jba,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted.because plaintiffs had alleged neither fraud nor misrepresentation which the court understood as prerequisites to the reasonable expectations doctrine the court concluded that it must apply pennsylvania general rule and look to the contract plain meaning without regard for plaintiffs reasonable expectations 
the court also determined,and the parties do not dispute,that connecticut law supplies the statute of limitations period for plaintiffs breach of contract claims.based on connecticut period,the court concluded the claims were because the breach occurred in,the date the policies were issued not in or,when mcic ceased making payments and plaintiffs became aware of the limits of their policies.
while connecticut is the forum state,both parties agree that pennsylvania is the contract state,and thus pennsylvania law applies to matters of substance.in ascertaining the substantive law of the forum,federal courts will look to the decisional law of the forum state,as well as to the state constitution and statutes.erie tompkins.
pennsylvania law is somewhat unique in that it employs the reasonable expectations of the insured in some situations to govern contract interpretation.gilderman state farm ins.as in other jurisdictions,the default rule in pennsylvania is to a
