this appeal caps an elongated,unhappy saga leading up to and including the termination of appellant employment by the navy in vieques,puerto rico.appellant,a civilian navy firefighter,brought suit in federal court against the secretary of the navy,and his former superiors at roosevelt roads naval station in ceiba,puerto rico,and on the nearby island of vieques after a history of injuries sustained by appellant and various efforts to accommodate him in a more restricted capacity,the navy finally terminated his employment.
appellant alleged,as the district court interpreted the complaint,violations of the rehabilitation act,a,the age discrimination in employment act adea,c,title vii of the civil rights act of,c,and due process rights.also included were invocations of the federal constitution and certain labor laws of puerto rico.the gravamen of the claims involved discriminatory action based on disability,age,and retaliation.
the district court granted summary judgment for defendants on all claims.we conclude that all but one of its rulings were solidly based in fact and in law one claim based on appellants final termination,alleging discrimination because of his disability,merits further exploration.
factual background 
despite an appendix of nearly a thousand pages,the essential facts may be briefly stated,leaving further details to the discussion of the several issues.appellant,a man who worked for the navy since,was a firefighter at the navy air facility on vieques since.in,he suffered an injury to his left knee and,after surgery,was assigned to temporary light duty as a fire communications operator.in,appellant sustained further injury to his knee.upon evaluation,he was found to be unable to perform a firefighter duties and was offered a job as a tools and parts attendant at his previous pay level.while considering this offer,he had a third accident involving the same knee.appellant subsequently refused the offer,saying that the tools and parts attendant job called for physical activities,such as climbing,lifting,and kneeling,that exceeded conditions prescribed by his doctor.
appellant was removed from his job on june,and appealed this action to the merit systems protection board mspb.although unlawful discrimination was not explicitly raised,he did say that he was fired as a result of his injury.on january,the mspb dismissed his appeal as untimely.although advised of his rights,appellant did not appeal this action to the court of appeals for the federal circuit,which has exclusive jurisdiction to hear such appeals from the mspb.see b.
shortly thereafter,on april,the navy offered appellant a permanent job as a fire communications operator on vieques,which he accepted.according to the department of labor,which was paying him benefits under the federal employees compensation act feca,appellant had no choice but to take the job or risk losing his right to further compensation.see c a partially disabled employee who refuses or neglects to work after suitable work is offered to,procured by,or secured for him is not entitled to compensation.
what happened next is not clear.we do know that a meeting,involving appellant,his counsel,and navy personnel,occurred on may at which the particulars of the new position were discussed.we also know that appellant reported for work a week later,on may,but was told to leave a few hours later.following his termination,appellant brought the instant action in january.because the record is not clear on precisely what happened preceding his termination,we must remand for further factual development.
we divide our analysis into two sections.in the first,we discuss briefly a number of issues as to which we are in agreement with the district courts analysis and conclusions.in the second,we address in some detail the issue that can not be resolved without further proceedings.
secondary issues 
rulings on discovery and conversion of motion to dismiss 
appellant assigns as error the court conversion of a motion to dismiss,filed by defendants,into a motion for summary judgment.he buttresses his argument by asserting that he was denied discovery of documents vital to his case.
defendants filed their motion to dismiss,memorandum of law,and attachments in a document occupying pages.filed his opposition,memorandum of law,which included a section entitled standard applicable to motion for summary judgment,and some documents in a submission.noting that matters outside the pleadings were submitted by both sides,the district court properly converted defendants motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to.b.see,garita hotel.partnership ponce fed.bank,cir.
appellant own submission to the court,in a rule b motion,undermines his contention that he was prejudiced by the inability to continue discovery.he sought relief from judgment based on an item in an allegedly newly discovered naval inspection file,which concerned thirteen asserted occasions of harassment against him.a navy inspector had found twelve of the harassment allegations to be unsubstantiated.appellant claimed prejudice from being deprived of the thirteenth finding that,although plaintiff doctor had indicated that plaintiff was not to work from september,to october,he was improperly ordered back to work on october.it should not be necessary to say that this claim is transparently thin.
b.the june termination 
the district court properly ruled that any claim of a civil service nature resulting from appellant termination from the firefighter position had been forfeited by his failure to appeal the mspb decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit.see b.it was also correct in holding that,even if appellant claim was not solely of a civil service nature,but included a discrimination claim,then administrative remedies had not been exhausted,since there had been no contact with an equal employment opportunity commission eeoc counselor within days,as required by a.see,runyon,cir holding that a federal employee failure to contact an eeoc counselor within the limitations period causes him to lose his right to pursue a later de novo action in court.
appellant attempts to revive his unexhausted discrimination claim by alleging a continuous pattern of discrimination prior to his termination,arguing that the limitation period is therefore extended.as the district court correctly noted,however,even where such continuing violations are of the type we have recognized as tolling the limitations period,that would excuse only an untimely filing,not the failure to exhaust an administrative requirement.in any event,the alleged pattern was not the type of serial or systemic violation that we have recognized as amounting to a continuing violation.see,andreu megwinoff banco bilbao vizcaya,lst cir.the district court found that the alleged continuing pattern,which included false accusations and assigning extraneous duties,such as washing and waxing vehicles,was nothing more than discrete instances of harassment that did not relieve appellant of the duty to file within the prescribed period.we therefore affirm the court rejection of the applicability of the continuing violation theory.
c.the may termination 
appellant also pressed several claims attendant to his second termination on may,from the fire communications operator position.we uphold the district court dismissal of these claims,with the exception of the disability claim discussed in part ii infra.
age discrimination claim.appellant initiated an administrative adea claim on may,by filing with the navy eeoc counselor a letter that alleged discrimination only on account of his physical handicap.on july,he filed a formal complaint,checking both age and physical handicap on the preprinted government form.in the four page letter accompanying the form,however,there is no mention of any conduct or statement.in a later report,the eeoc counselor confirmed that d uring the informal counseling stage complainant did not define age as a basis for discrimination.by not bringing his age discrimination claim to the attention of the eeoc,he foreclosed the administrative investigation and ameliorative action contemplated
