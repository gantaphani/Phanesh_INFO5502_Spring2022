this qui tam action makes its second appearance before us.last year,we held that the district court should have evaluated jeffrey request for leave to file his fourth amended complaint under the standard set forth in federal rule of civil procedure a.united states ex rel,i,cir.on remand,the district court found that desired amendment failed under that standard because,even as proposed to be amended,the complaint did not allege claims upon which the court could grant relief.united states ex rel,supp.for the following reasons,we agree.
background 
factual allegations 
defendant,discovers,develops,manufactures,and markets medical devices.defendant micro therapeutics,mti,subsidiary since,likewise manufactures and markets medical devices.original and proposed complaints against these companies focus on two devices,the onyx liquid embolic system onyx and the axium detachable coil system axium.we recite the relevant facts concerning each device as they are alleged by in his proposed complaint,assuming them to be true unless they are merely conclusory.see ashcroft iqbal.
onyx is an artificial liquid material developed by mti to treat malformed blood vessels in the brain.in plain terms,it is injected into blood vessels near the brain,and then forms a mass blocking the flow of blood to facilitate subsequent surgery.in the early,mti licensed the onyx molecule to a company named enteric.enteric used the molecule to develop another medical device,enteryx,which went to market first,after gaining food and drug administration fda approval in april for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.a series of adverse events involving enteryx followed,prompting a patient safety alert in october,and culminating in a complete recall of the device in september.
it was during this timeframe between enteryx approval and recall that mti sought approval for onyx.the fda regulations require a premarket approval pma process for medical devices like onyx.see c.during that process,the device manufacturer supplies the fda with extensive information regarding the device including its design,manufacturing,packing,labeling,and testing to satisfy the agency that the device is safe and effective.id.a sufficiently complete application proceeds to substantive review.id.a.that review is performed by fda personnel and,at the fda election as in this instance,by an advisory panel of outside experts.id.a.the panel holds a public meeting to review the pma before making a recommendation to the fda.id.b.the fda then considers the pma application,together with any advisory panel report and recommendation,before issuing a decision on approval.id.c.
mti pma application identified a narrow indication for onyx use in the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations bavm,when embolization is indicated to minimize blood loss to reduce the bavm size prior to surgery.while seeking approval,mti emphasized the narrow scope of the indication as well as the rigorous nature of the training program required for physicians using onyx.according to the testimony of mti vice president before the fda advisory panel,that training program would include an instructional session,a workshop,a case review,and observations.according to another mti witness,any physician who completed this training would receive the assistance of an experienced proctor the first time he or she used onyx.the advisory panel members placed great weight on these training requirements,describing them as critically important and a very big component of getting onyx into safe use.
the panel ultimately recommended approval of onyx.however,several of its members explained that it was a cautious approval,and others warned that they would advise the fda to rescind approval if mti disregarded their suggestions for carefully monitoring onyx cases.
the fda adopted the panel recommendation,granting approval to onyx in july.the onyx label authorized by the fda restricted the device use to physicians with neurointerventional training and a thorough knowledge of the pathology to be treated,angiographic techniques,and embolization.it stated,contact your micro therapeutics sales representative for information on training courses.
enter,a sales representative who worked at from january until his termination in january.after acquired mti in,became familiar with the manner in which the defendants promoted and sold onyx.he says that he observed physician trainings that lasted as little as four hours and proctored surgeries that involved procedures.he also alleges that the defendants instituted a site certification process whereby they certified and sold onyx to any site where a single neurosurgeon who had completed their training enjoyed privileges.as a result,he says that onyx fell into the hands of physicians at those sites with inadequate training or no training at all.additionally,the defendants encouraged marketing by setting sales quotas for their representatives that anticipated such sales,educating their sales force on peripheral applications,and providing training to physicians during retreats.all in all,it became clear,alleges,that the defendants never intended to honor the commitments that mti had made to the fda.
because clinical trials involving onyx in the treatment of aneurysms evinced numerous complications,the defendants in launched a new medical device,axium put simply,axium provides another means of generating an embolism to facilitate the surgical treatment of anomalies in blood vessels in the brain.surgeons use the device to place a small,detachable coil at a desired spot to generate a blockage of blood flow to an abnormality such as an aneurysm.following the initial launch in,the defendants redesigned the device several times in response to reports that it malfunctioned during procedures.they did not,however,recall earlier generations or relabel any devices.problems persisted,notwithstanding frequent modifications.on top of these design challenges,irregularities during manufacturing resulted in defective lots of the devices that the defendants nonetheless sold,who also promoted axium,attended a february meeting where top brass admonished the sales force to keep quiet about defects in hopes of dodging fda scrutiny.
qui tam action 
approximately one year later,the defendants terminated employment.in october,he brought this qui tam action as a relator on behalf of the united states under the false claims act fca,and on behalf of numerous states under similar state statutes.the relevant provisions of the fca are those imposing liability on anyone who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,id.a a,or knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim,id.a b.proposed complaint accuses and mti of violating those provisions in selling onyx and axium to hospitals that seek reimbursement from the federal government through,for example,the center for medicare and medicaid services cms.
procedural history 
our opinion in i provides a full recitation of the suit early procedural history,at,which we repeat only briefly here.filed his original complaint under seal in october and amended the complaint as a matter of course in february.through two subsequent amendments,both with permission of the court,added several defendants and retooled his claims.in october,the united states declined to intervene,and the court lifted the seal and authorized service.the parties then submitted a joint briefing schedule to the court for the defendants motion to dismiss.the court endorsed the schedule and the defendants timely filed their motion.
a few days before his opposition was due,filed a fourth amended complaint,his fifth version of the complaint.the defendants immediately moved to strike,insisting that had used up his right to amend as a matter of course back in february.the court agreed but construed filing as a request for leave to amend.it applied to that request the good cause standard from rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and struck the amended complaint for want of good cause.his fourth amended complaint rejected,opposed the motion to dismiss his third amended complaint.the district court sided with the defendants,ruling that certain claims were subject to the fca public disclosure bar,e,and that the remaining claims failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of rules b and b.see united states ex rel,wl,at.
in the appeal that followed,we held that the district court erred by applying rule b standard rather than rule a more lenient standard.i,at.we therefore remanded the case to the district court to evaluate under rule a request to file a fourth amended complaint.id.at.after briefing and argument on the proposed amendment,the district court once again denied request to file a fourth amended complaint.see,supp.at.as before,the district court determined that certain claims were subject to the fca public disclosure bar.id.at.others,it found,lacked particularity per rule b,id.at,or otherwise failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted per rule b,id.at.it therefore deemed the motion to amend futile.
in addition to finding the proposed amendment futile,the district court expressed the tentative view that permitting a further amendment would substantially prejudice the individual defendants,id.at,but decided it was not necessary for the court to definitively resolve the issue,id.at.the court finally noted that it was inclined to agree with undue delay arguments advanced by the defendants,which faulted for labeling as new evidence information that he could have obtained through reasonable diligence before filing the third amended complaint.id.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
a district court ruling under rule a that amendment would be futile means that the complaint,as amended,would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.glassman computervision,cir.citing moore federal practice,at ed.while we review rule a rulings for abuse of discretion,see,nikitine wilmington trust,cir,a material error of law constitutes such an abuse,and the question whether a motion to amend is futile because the amended complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a question of law,see ouch fed.mortg.ass n,cir.hence,our review in this case is actually de novo.
in performing this review,we,like the district court,confront a proposed complaint that covers pages and features extensive excerpts.devotes most of his pleading to establishing in excessive detail that the defendants said and did things that they knew were false or improper,and to critiquing the onyx and axium devices.at the same time,the pleading offers hints of numerous theories for tying the alleged improprieties and defects to false claims.briefs on appeal call for us to consider two of those theories for his claims concerning onyx,and two for his claims concerning axium.
onyx fraudulent inducement claims 
principal claim relating to the government payment for the use of mti onyx device rests on an allegation that mti made three fraudulent representations to the fda in seeking approval to market onyx.specifically,the defendants disclaimed uses for the device they later pursued,overstated the training they later provided,and omitted critical safety information about the molecule,including its failure in the enteryx device.the fda,however,made none of the payments at issue in this lawsuit.rather,cms made the payments by reimbursing physicians who performed procedures using onyx and hospitals where such procedures took place.fca liability attaches to a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval or to a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.united states ex rel.kelly novartis pharm,cir.quoting a a b.to link those cms payments to the fraudulent representations allegedly made to the fda,notes that fda approval is a precondition to cms reimbursement for use of a medical device,and argues that the fraudulent representations allegedly made by mti to the fda could have influenced the fda to grant that approval.
we reject this argument because alleging that the fraudulent representations could have influenced the fda to approve onyx falls short of pleading a causal link between the representations made to the fda and the payments made by cms.if the representations did not actually cause the fda to grant approval it otherwise would not have granted,cms would still have paid the claims.in this respect,fraudulent inducement theory is like a kick shot in billiards where the cue ball could have but did not in fact bounce off the rail,much less hit the targeted ball.
tries to rebut this conclusion by relying on the fca materiality standard.under that standard,a representation made to secure a payment is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the payment or receipt of money or property.b.he reasons that as long as mti representations at issue could have influenced the fda to grant approval,the representations were material.
this argument may well misconstrue the fca materiality standard.it is a demanding standard.universal health,united states.moreover,the fca requires that the fraudulent representation be material to the government payment decision itself.id.at.the fact that cms has not denied reimbursement for onyx in the wake of allegations casts serious doubt on the materiality of the fraudulent representations that alleges.id.at i f the government regularly pays a particular type of claim in full despite actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated,and has signaled no change in position,that is strong evidence that the requirements are not material.
in any event,even if the alleged fraudulent representations were material as defined by the fca,the elements of fraudulent inducement claims include not just materiality but also causation the defendant conduct must cause the government to make a payment or to forfeit money owed.see united states ex rel.westrick second chance body armor,supp,holding that a plaintiff asserting fraudulent inducement claims must demonstrate not only that the omitted information was material but also that the government was induced by,or relied on,the fraudulent statement or omission quoting united states ex rel.thomas siemens ag,supp,reconsideration granted in part on other grounds sub nom.united states second chance body armor,wl,see also,united states ex rel.main oakland city,cir.the fca requires a causal rather than a temporal connection between fraud and payment.see generally john boese,civil false claims and qui tam actions a,ed.if the fda would have approved onyx notwithstanding the alleged fraudulent representations,then the connection between those representations to the fda and a payment by cms relying on fda approval disappears.
the defect in claim is not a mere flaw in the complaint choice of words.in the six years since surfaced the alleged fraud,the fda has apparently demanded neither recall nor relabeling of onyx this notwithstanding the agency option to impose postapproval requirements,a,its clear prerogative to suspend approval temporarily,id.a,and its broad authority to withdraw approval,id.a.in particular,when the fda concludes that it has been misled because an application contained or was accompanied by an untrue statement of a material fact,it can commence an informal hearing and withdraw its approval allowing the marketing of a device.see e.in such an instance,it acts with the benefit,where appropriate,of advice on scientific matters from a panel or panels of experts under section.id.
the fda failure actually to withdraw its approval of onyx in the face of allegations precludes from resting his claims on a contention that the fda approval was fraudulently obtained.to rule otherwise would be to turn the fca into a tool with which a jury of six people could retroactively eliminate the value of fda approval and effectively require that a product largely be withdrawn from the market even when the fda itself sees no reason to do so.the fca exists to protect the government from paying fraudulent claims,not to agencies judgments about whether to rescind regulatory rulings.see,supp.at surely,where the fda was authorized to render the expert
