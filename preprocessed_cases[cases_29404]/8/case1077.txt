in maria virginia was first employed as a teacher in the ana mendez university system,a group of private institutions of higher learning in puerto rico.in,after receiving her in education,she became an instructor at universidad metropolitana,one of the units in the system.she was promoted to auxiliary professor in and associate professor in.however,in february,a academic committee declined to recommend for promotion to full professor.in february she brought the present action in the federal district court in puerto rico based on diversity jurisdiction,by then having moved to virginia to live with her husband.
in the first of two counts,the complaint charged that the denial of promotion constituted a denial of due process for a number of reasons,because the committee members were not competent in field of applied linguistics.the second count charged sexual harassment it said that the head of the.luis harassed her and that her denial of promotion occurred because she refused to date him.the named defendants were universidad metropolitana,its chancellor rene labarca,all five members of the committee that had refused to recommend promotion,and the university system of which universidad metropolitana is a part.
after a good deal of discovery including the deposition of,the defendants moved for summary judgment.in opposition,offered an affidavit expanding on her deposition testimony.on august,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.hernandez loring universidad metropolitana,d.the court reasoning,discussed below,was different as to each of the three due process claim count i and what the court took to be distinct claims for quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment count ii has now appealed to this court.
in general,the grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,reasonable doubts and issues of credibility being resolved in favor of the party.banco popular de puerto rico,cir.at the threshold,argues that the district court should be reversed because the summary judgment motion was filed after the original deadline fixed by the court scheduling order.however,such an order may be modified for good cause.b,and the district court finding of good cause,based on own discovery delays,was not an abuse of discretion.
turning to the grant of summary judgment on count i,we readily affirm the district court.in making academic appointments or promotions,a private university is not directly governed by the due process requirements of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.see american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d.still,puerto rico law apparently regards tenure decisions as subject to an implicit contractual constraint that the university will follow its own regulations.this is the holding of selosse fundacion educativa ana mendez,a case that resulted from a suit by a different teacher for denial of tenure by the same university system involved in the present case.
does not allege a violation of any specific university promotion regulation.instead,she criticizes inter alia the failure to include on the committee persons who shared her own specialty,the scoring system used she placed fourth out of four candidates for one promotion,the vagueness of the standards employed in the promotion process,the disregard of her published work insofar as it was for pay,the inadequacy of the appeals process,and the choice as head of the committee of a man whose promotion to the university administration professor had previously opposed.
academic promotion disputes,as the district court noted,often pit concerns about fair procedure against the autonomy of universities but in this case there is no balancing to be done nor any basis for considering whether the processes employed were fair.there is no constitutional claim asserted,no contract claim beyond the right to have regulations followed,and no asserted violation of any specific regulation.nothing in argument indicates that something else is required by puerto rico law.perhaps puerto rico law offers more and,if so,future litigants are welcome to make that showing.
the second of quid pro quo far more difficult to assess.the district court assumed perhaps wrongly that was invoking title vii,a on appeal,has cited only puerto rico statutory law,including the ban on sexual harassment.laws ann.nevertheless,the substantive law of puerto rico on sexual harassment appears to be aligned,so far as pertinent here,with title vii law,and title vii precedents are used freely in construing commonwealth law,cir.
under title vii,quid pro quo sexual harassment can be shown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.wills brown,cir lipsett university of puerto rico,cir.the gist of quid pro quo claim here is that made advances to her,was rebuffed,and then used his position as head of the committee to revenge himself by blocking her promotion.the district court assumed that such a claim would be legally viable but ruled that had not offered credible evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment against her.
during her deposition,offered general allegations,but when pressed for specifics,became vague,said she did not recollect,or simply repeated her general assertions.later,in her affidavit prepared in response to defendants summary judgment motion,she furnished details,quotations,and in one case a wholly new incident that had not been offered in her deposition.the district court declined to consider these eleventh hour recollections.hernandez loring,d at.we will have more to say about this issue but think it clearer to explain first what appeared in the deposition pertinent to the quid pro quo claim and what was added thereafter.
in the deposition,said that had repeatedly used foul and salacious language in the classroom,that she had complained to the university chancellor or others on a number of occasions,that had interrupted her own classes to request dates with her and pressed his requests on other occasions,that he had greeted her in the hallways with the phrase,listen,you have greeted me today,did i sleep with you last night,that although married he had carried on with students,and that at a faculty workshop in august after she had been denied promotion,the following occurred 
q.what did diaz remark consist of 
diaz told me that if i had done other things the results of my evaluation would have been different.
q.what other words did he use 
that if you had gone out with me you would have something like going to bed with me,we would have had another another result.
when filed her affidavit,she was far more explicit about specific coarse and sexually explicit and suggestive language used by toward his students and to herself.further,in describing what allegedly said to her at the faculty workshop in august,affidavit discarded paraphrase,according to the affidavit,said maria virginia,this happened to you for being such a bitch and for not being willing to go out with me.finally,alleged for the first time that in july she had been pawed,and lasciviously addressed,by the chancellor labarca,at a faculty lunch while the latter was inebriated.
in rejecting the quid pro quo claim,the district court gave two different reasons for granting summary judgment.first,the court ruled that the affidavit should not be considered because it did not square with earlier deposition testimony.and,second,the court said that even if it accepted the affidavit more detailed description of conduct,plaintiff must still establish a colorable claim that her denial of tenure by the review committee was directly linked to retaliation by,but that she had failed to establish any link between her denial of tenure and discriminatory animus toward her.hernandez loring,d at.even if vote was tainted,the court said that it was unable to discern any causal link between his animus and the objective performance rendered by at least of the committee members.id.
on appeal,says that the court erred in refusing to consider the affidavit,but as to the quid pro quo claim,the affidavit is largely beside the point.deposition testimony already said that pe
