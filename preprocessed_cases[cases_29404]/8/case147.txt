cvs pharmacy,takes this interlocutory appeal from an order granting the plaintiffs motion to remand a putative class action for wage and hour violations.in this case of first impression in this circuit,we clarify the removal time periods and mechanisms under the class action fairness act of cafa.
under cafa,federal courts have jurisdiction over a class action if,among other requirements,the amount in controversy exceeds million.standard fire ins.knowles,d citing d,d.section b specifies two time periods within which a defendant must remove a class action that satisfies cafa jurisdictional requirements from state court to federal court.see b applying section b and b to class actions.if the case as stated by the initial pleading is removable,section b requires the defendant to remove within thirty days of its receipt.see id.b.section b requires the defendant to remove within thirty days of receiving a subsequent paper from which it may first be ascertained that the class action is or has become removable.see id.b.
the district court granted the plaintiffs motion to remand for several reasons.romulus cvs pharmacy,rwz,wl,hereinafter romulus ii.it held that cvs notice of removal came too late to meet the deadline in section b,and that the second deadline in section b did not apply.id.at.it then held that cvs had not met its burden to establish the substantive amount in controversy requirement.id.at.we reverse.we hold that cvs second notice of removal was timely under section b,and that cvs sufficiently demonstrated that the amount in controversy exceeds million.removal was appropriate remand was not 
we resolve the previously unanswered question in this circuit as to when the two time limits in section b mandate removal within thirty days.in line with the other circuits that have adopted a approach,we hold that the time limits in section b apply when the plaintiffs pleadings or the plaintiffs other papers provide the defendant with a clear statement of the damages sought or with sufficient facts from which damages can be readily calculated.we also clarify the meaning of the statutory term other paper.b.on the merits,we hold that cvs has adequately met its burden to show removal.
procedural history 
named plaintiffs david romulus,cassandra beale,nicholas harris,ashley hilario,and robert bourassa,all shift supervisors at cvs stores in massachusetts,filed a first amended class action complaint against cvs in massachusetts superior court on august,the plaintiffs allege that cvs has a policy under which shift supervisors must remain on store premises when taking rest or meal breaks when there are no other managerial employees on duty or when there is only one other employee on duty.despite requiring shift supervisors to stay on store premises,the plaintiffs allege that cvs does not pay them for these breaks in violation of the massachusetts wage act.laws ch,and the massachusetts overtime statute.laws ch.
the plaintiffs allege that cvs has employed many hundreds,if not thousands,of shift supervisors in massachusetts since july.they seek unpaid wages including overtime wages,treble damages,interest,attorneys fees,and costs for those breaks in the class period during which they were required to stay on store premises.the plaintiffs did not provide information on the number of breaks at issue,or the total amount of damages sought in the first amended complaint.
cvs,perhaps in an abundance of caution,nevertheless sought to remove within thirty days of service,on september.to calculate the plaintiffs damages,cvs relied on a series of estimates.assuming that the class members lost each meal break during the class period,cvs calculated total damages of,
the district court rejected cvs calculation and granted the plaintiffs motion to remand the case to massachusetts state court.romulus cvs pharmacy,rwz,wl,hereinafter romulus i.the court noted that t he difficulty with defendant calculation is that it assumes all shift supervisors lost their break each day of their employment during the class period while the complaint clearly states that the circumstances leading to such loss occurred sometimes.id.at.because defendant assumptions are in no way rooted in the allegations of the complaint,defendant fails to meet its burden of proving the requisite jurisdictional amount.id.the propriety of the district court first remand order is not before us.
the parties conducted preliminary discovery upon their return to state court.cvs provided the plaintiffs with electronic time and attendance data relating to massachusetts shift supervisors from august through june.analyzing this data,the plaintiffs found meal breaks during this period when no other shift supervisor was working.they informed cvs of this number,a very important component of this damages calculation,by email on january.
within thirty days of receipt of this email,cvs filed its second notice of removal on february.cvs extrapolated the plaintiffs number of violations over the entire class period,and argued that there was a reasonable probability that the amount in controversy exceeds.cvs argued that this second notice of removal was timely under b because it was filed within days of the date that cvs ascertained that this case became removable based on the email provided by the plaintiffs.
on march,the district court again granted the plaintiffs motion to remand,finding that cvs notice of removal was untimely and concluding on the merits that cvs had failed to show a reasonable probability that more than million is at stake in this case.romulus ii,wl,at citing amoche guar.trust life ins,cir.
on the question of timeliness,the district court concluded that cvs must rely on section b since f ar more than thirty days have elapsed since service of plaintiffs amended complaint.id.at.without the guidance of circuit precedent,the district court held that the defendant had failed to identify any paper providing information from which it later ascertained removability for the first time.id.even if the january,email qualified as an other paper for the purposes of section b,it provide d no new information regarding removability that could not have been previously ascertained by defendant in light of the allegations in the amended complaint and its own knowledge and information.id.at.the district court highlighted that the estimate contained in the january,email came from data that cvs had possessed from the beginning of litigation and had provided to the plaintiffs.id.at.the district court found that cvs had violated a duty to make a reasonable inquiry into its own records at the time of the complaint.id.citing sok fid.guar,wl,at.
on the substantive question of the amount in controversy,the district court noted the plaintiffs objections to defendant calculations of the amount in controversy.id.at.the district court,without further explanation,then stated that the plaintiffs arguments on these points are persuasive,and i find that defendant,despite having better access to the relevant information,has failed to show a reasonable probability that more than million is at stake in this case.id.quoting amoche,at.
cvs sought leave to appeal the district court order on an interlocutory basis under c.this court asked the district court to clarify whether,in its view,the removal was untimely with respect to a particular day period in b and if so,whether the days ran from a particular date.the district court explained in response 
the only possibly qualifying document under b defendant received was the january.i deemed it inadequate to serve as an other paper because it was based entirely on information provided by defendant.because the information was readily available to defendant from the start,it provided no new information regarding removability that would allow use of the date of the as the starting date for determining timeliness.accordingly,i deemed the proper date for calculating timeliness to be the date of the return of service,september,which necessarily followed receipt by defendant of the first amended complaint.
romulus cvs pharmacy,rwz,wl,at.may,hereinafter romulus iii.
this court granted the petition for review on september,and asked the parties to address a series of questions the parties submitted supplemental briefing on these issues.
we now hold that section b clocks are triggered only when the plaintiffs complaint or plaintiffs subsequent paper provides the defendant with sufficient information to easily determine that the matter is removable.the district court erred in imposing too great a duty of inquiry on the defendant.in this case,the plaintiffs january,email triggered section b deadline by providing sufficient information from which to easily ascertain the amount in controversy for the first time.the plaintiffs email was not disqualified from being an other paper by the fact that it was based on information provided by the defendant.cvs second notice of removal on february,was therefore timely.
in addition,we hold that cvs carried its substantive burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that the amount in controversy exceeds million,as required for federal jurisdiction under cafa.we do not,as a consequence,reach the difficult questions related to the availability and mechanics of removal outside of the two windows in section b.
ii.appellate justiciability 
the plaintiffs mistakenly argue that this interlocutory appeal is untimely,and that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.under cafa,i f the court of appeals accepts an appeal under paragraph,the court shall complete all action on such appeal,including rendering judgment,not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed,unless an extension is granted under paragraph.c.the plaintiffs claim that cvs filed its appeal on april,and that an appellate decision was due by may.
the april,filing was not an appeal,but a petition for permission to appeal.under cafa,the appellate court had discretion to grant cvs permission to appeal,and no appeal existed until we did so.see id.as the fifth circuit has persuasively reasoned 
when a party files a notice of appeal,there is,at that very point in time,an appeal,albeit one that may later be subject to dismissal for jurisdictional or procedural insufficiency.where,however,a party applies for leave to appeal,or seeks permission to do so,there is logically no appeal until the court vested with the authority to grant or deny leave has done so.

the deadline for appellate consideration begins to accrue from the date on which the court of appeals grants permission to appeal.coll.of dental surgeons of.life ins,cir.we granted cvs permission to appeal on september,and have days from that date to render judgment,unless an extension is granted.see c.
iii.analysis 
the district court jurisdictional determination on removal is subject to de novo review.amoche,at.issues of statutory interpretation are also subject to de novo review.hannon city of newton,cir.however,where the district court assessment of a jurisdictional issue turns on findings of fact,we accept those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.cooper charter commc ns entm ts i,llc,cir.findings of fact were not made here.
timeliness of removal under section b 
statutory time limits 
section b sets forth two windows for removal based on pleadings,or other papers,provided by the plaintiff.first,section b states 
the notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based 
b.second,section b states 
except as provided in subsection c,if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.
id.b.the district court first remand order,issued after cvs removed the case within thirty days of the initial pleading,is not before us.the question is whether cvs second notice of removal was timely under section b.
the district court implicitly held that the section b clock runs in every case from the date of service,regardless of the contents of the complaint.see romulus iii,wl,at.having missed the first period,the district court held that cvs must rely on section b to sustain its second attempt to remove.romulus ii,wl,at.the district court concluded that section b did not apply in this case since cvs had identified no other paper that set forth new information supporting federal jurisdiction over this case.id.the district court reasoned that information on damages is not new if the defendant could have discovered it earlier through its own investigation.see id.this is not how the statute reads and would produce a test.
the plaintiffs do argue that the text of the statute supports the district court reading of section b.first,section b includes the mandatory language that t he notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading.b emphasis added.the plaintiffs argue that section b,by its terms,requires removal within thirty days of service in every case,regardless of whether the complaint evidences removability or not.section b then operates as an exception to allow a defendant to remove outside of this initial window if the defendant first ascertain s that the case is removable from a subsequent paper.id.b.according to the plaintiffs,section b can not be invoked if the defendant could have ascertained,through some sort of investigative action by the defendant that the case was removable at some point prior to the receipt of the plaintiffs paper.
to the contrary,the text of the statute focuses solely on when the plaintiffs papers reveal removability section b must be understood in conjunction with section b,which applies instead of section b if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable.b emphasis added.the language of section b makes clear that removability in section b is to be judged by the case as stated on the face of the complaint.
when removability is not clear from the initial pleading,section b then looks to the plaintiffs subsequent papers.specifically,section b applies when the defendant receives a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.id.emphases added.even if the case was previously removable,section b does not apply until removability can first be ascertained from the plaintiffs own papers.
based on the text of the statute,we hold that the defendant looks to the papers provided by the plaintiffs to determine whether section b removal clocks have been triggered.every circuit to have addressed this issue has likewise adopted some form of a rule that limits the court inquiry to the pleading or other paper in order to determine removability.walker trailer transit,cir collecting cases see also cutrone mortg.registration,cir.
the test varies in severity among the circuits.the seventh circuit,for example,has explained that the question is whether the pleading or other paper,on its face or in combination with pleadings,provides specific and unambiguous notice that the case satisfies federal jurisdictional requirements and therefore is removable.walker,at.the seventh circuit highlighted that this rule requires the plaintiff to specifically disclose the amount of monetary damages sought in order to trigger section b deadlines.id.at.the seventh circuit,though,has not addressed whether section b can be triggered by a simple calculation on the part of the defendant from data revealed by the plaintiff papers in the absence of a specific damages estimate from the plaintiff.
the second circuit has also limited the inquiry to the contents of the complaint or later paper,but has allowed the plaintiff to trigger the removal deadlines either by explicitly specif ying the amount of monetary damages sought or by set ting forth facts from which an amount in controversy in excess of can be ascertained.cutrone,at emphasis added.the second circuit explained that,even under a rule,defendants must still apply a reasonable amount of intelligence in ascertaining removability.id.at quoting whitaker am.telecasting,cir.although defendants must apply a reasonable amount of intelligence,they have no independent duty to investigate whether a case is removable.id.
citing the same language,the ninth circuit has stated that the defendant must apply a reasonable amount of intelligence in ascertaining removability.kuxhausen bmw fin.servs.na llc,cir quoting whitaker,at.for example,m ultiplying figures clearly stated in a complaint is an aspect of that duty.id.
we agree with the second circuit that a plaintiff pleading or later paper will trigger the deadlines in section b if the plaintiff paper includes a clear statement of the damages sought or if the plaintiff paper sets forth sufficient facts from which the amount in controversy can easily be ascertained by the defendant by simple calculation.the defendant has no duty,however,to investigate or to supply facts outside of those provided by the plaintiff.
as a policy matter,the plaintiffs argue that a defendant should have a duty to investigate removal early in litigation in order to avoid gamesmanship and to resolve removal as efficiently as possible.the plaintiffs explain 
if there were no deadline by which a defendant must disclose information in its possession that supports removal,a defendant could strategically litigate a case in state court until it could assess how it was faring there,or decide whether to remove based on its assessment of how much disruption a change of forum would cause the plaintiff.it would also enable a defendant to use delay as cvs seems to have tried to do here as a weapon with the hope of exhausting the plaintiff patience or resources.
the plaintiffs note that cvs second attempt at removal was based on data calculated from information cvs possessed from the beginning of this litigation,but the second notice of removal was not filed until seventeen months after the case was initially brought.imposing an obligation on a defendant to investigate and remove early and quickly,they say,would ensure the efficient resolution of removal questions.they argue,moreover,that this burden would not weigh too heavily on a defendant since the defendant need only establish the amount in controversy by a reasonable probability.
there are contrary policy arguments that congress could have considered.in the absence of something like a approach,plaintiffs would have no incentive to specify estimated damages early in litigation.defendants would protectively remove when faced with an indeterminate complaint in order to avoid missing the mandatory window for removal under section b.this would be particularly problematic in cafa cases,since the large number of class members and the high requirement for the amount in controversy often will be difficult to ascertain immediately.see cutrone,at.if a defendant sought to later remove under section b,the district court would face the unenviable task of determining whether the defendant should have previously discovered that the case was removable.determining what the defendant should have investigated,or what the defendant should have discovered through that investigation,rather than analyzing what was apparent on or easily ascertainable from the face of the plaintiff pleadings,will not be efficient,but will result in.
the plaintiffs are also in a position to protect themselves from the gamesmanship of which they warn.roth cha hollywood med,cir.the ninth circuit explained,i f plaintiffs think that their action may be removable and think,further,that the defendant might delay filing a notice of removal until a strategically advantageous moment,they need only provide to the defendant a document from which removability may be ascertained.id.by filing a complaint or subsequent paper that meets the rule,the plaintiffs will trigger one of the clocks in section b,and will force the defendant to remove immediately or lose the opportunity to do so later.id.
we follow,as we must,the congressional policy choice inherent in the statutory text.as we have previously explained,the obvious purpose of starting the day clock only after the defendant receipt of a paper revealing the case removability is to ensure that the party seeking removal has notice that the case is removable before the limitations period begins to run against it.woburn five cents sav.bank robert hicks,cir.to determine whether the section b clocks have begun to run,therefore,we focus exclusively on the pleadings and other papers provided by the plaintiffs.the defendant must remove within thirty days of a paper,filed by the plaintiffs,that explicitly specifies the amount of monetary damages sought or sets forth facts from which an amount in controversy in excess of million can be readily ascertained.see cutrone,at.
plaintiffs complaint 
the plaintiffs argue that cvs second notice of removal is late because the amended complaint should have satisfied even a approach since it set forth a clear damages theory which cvs clearly understood.to establish the amount in controversy,according to the plaintiffs,all cvs had to do was determine how many times shift supervisors took meal breaks when no other shift supervisor,assistant manager or manager was present,and multiply the total time of such breaks by the shift supervisors average hourly wage to obtain a reliable estimate of the amount of unpaid wages owed to the class.
essential facts are missing from the complaint.as the plaintiffs concede,cvs would have needed to investigate and supply the number of meal breaks at issue and the average hourly wage to have determined the amount in controversy.the complaint neither states the aggregate amount in controversy nor alleges sufficient information from which cvs could have easily ascertained removability.
other paper plaintiffs email 
i f the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within days after receipt by the defendant of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.b the district court determined that t he only possibly qualifying document was an email sent to cvs by plaintiffs counsel on january,which estimated the number of meal breaks without shift supervisor coverage over an almost period.romulus iii,wl,at.the district court held that this email was inadequate to serve as an other paper because it was based entirely on information provided by defendant.id.
the interpretation of the phrase other paper in section b is another issue of first impression for this circuit there are cogent arguments for both an expansive and limited construction of this phrase.given the ambiguity present in the text,we rely on the clear congressional intent to interpret other paper broadly.
section b lists the documents that can trigger the second removal window a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper.b.the doctrine of ejusdem generis would suggest that the term other paper should be limited to documents similar to a pleading,motion,or order.see circuit city stores,adams,d t he general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.relying on this canon of statutory interpretation,the district court in mill bern associates,concluded that other paper must be limited to documents that are formally filed served on the parties,like a filed affidavit.d at.
another part of the statute could support a broader textual interpretation.specifically,section c a states 
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable solely because the amount in controversy does not exceed the amount specified in section a,information relating to the amount in controversy in the record of the state proceeding,or in responses to discovery,shall be treated as an other paper under subsection b.
c a emphasis added.it is nevertheless unclear,from the text alone,whether this provision applies to cafa cases.on the one hand,congress chose to specifically mention only cases,removed under diversity jurisdiction pursuant to a,when statutorily broadening the scope of the term other paper.on the other hand,congress drafted cafa to incorporate all of section,except for the limitation on removal under section c.see id.b.moreover,there is a general presumption that the same term has the same meaning when it occurs here and there in a single statute.envtl.def.duke energy,d.
in general,t he federal courts have given the reference to other paper an expansive construction and have included a wide array of documents within its scope.wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.as such,
v arious discovery documents such as deposition transcripts,answers to interrogatories and requests for admissions,as well as amendments to ad damnum clauses of complaints,and correspondence between the parties and their attorneys or between the attorneys usually are accepted as other papers,receipt of which can initiate a day period of removability.
id.citations omitted.
two courts of appeals have held that informal correspondence from the plaintiff to the defendant constituted an other paper under section b.in addo globe life accident insurance,the fifth circuit held that a postcomplaint demand letter,which offered to settle for above the amount in controversy,triggered section b as an other paper,cir.likewise,the ninth circuit held that a letter from the plaintiffs,sent in preparation for mediation,which estimated damages to exceed million put the defendant on notice as to the amount in controversy.babasa lenscrafters,cir.the letter qualified as an other paper,and necessitated removal within thirty days.see id.
the senate report accompanying the passage of cafa supports the broad interpretation of the phrase other paper and resolves for us any uncertainty arising from the text of the statute.the committee on the judiciary explicitly stated that it favor ed the broad interpretation of other paper adopted by some courts to include deposition transcripts,discovery responses,settlement offers and other documents or occurrences that reveal the removability of a case,at,reprinted in.on balance,this clear congressional intent outweighs the usual application of ejusdem generis and resolves the lack of clarity in section c a.
we hold that correspondence from the plaintiff to the defendant concerning damages can constitute an other paper for purposes of section b.under section b,the correspondence triggers the clock if it is the first document in which the plaintiff puts the defendant on notice that the criteria for removal are met.
in this case,cvs had provided the plaintiffs with time punch data for shift supervisors in the course of settlement negotiations.by analyzing the data,experts from both sides were able to estimate the number of meal breaks during which a shift supervisor was working without another shift supervisor.in a telephone conversation,both parties orally exchanged their calculations.cvs asked the plaintiffs to provide their estimate in written form,which the plaintiffs did by email on the same day.the email estimated meal breaks without shift supervisor coverage from august through june.
in theory,one more bit of information would be helpful for precision.two other types of managerial employees,store managers and assistant store managers,could be working during some portion of these meal breaks without shift supervisor coverage.the plaintiffs argue that their estimate in the january,email could not by itself establish class damages because it did not account for whether managers or assistant managers were present during those breaks,which would have allowed the shift supervisors to leave the premises and thus not result in a wage law violation.the plaintiffs state that they had not communicated to cvs the precise number of potential wage and hour violations for which they seek redress because they still lacked the information regarding managers and assistant managers needed to make such a calculation.
whether data even exists on the presence of store managers and assistant store managers,to reduce any damages estimate,has been of constant dispute in this litigation.going back to at least the first remand proceeding,the plaintiffs have asserted in their district court filings that cvs has a statutory obligation to maintain records of the time actually worked by all its employees,including managers and assistant managers,and that cvs can not hide behind the fact that it failed to do so.the fair implication of the plaintiffs position is that cvs will ultimately be liable for breaks for which such managerial coverage can not be reliably established.to us,that aspect of plaintiffs own theory is substantial enough to place all breaks without shift supervisor coverage in controversy the plaintiffs provided cvs with this number in the email on january.
with the estimate in the plaintiffs email,cvs had all of the information necessary to readily ascertain the matter removability from the plaintiffs own papers.as the plaintiffs had themselves said,all cvs had to do to determine an estimate of damages was multiply the estimate of the number of meal breaks at issue by the average hourly wage.the record from the first removal proceeding included the uncontested average hourly wage,with the email,the plaintiffs then provided the number of breaks at issue.cvs was able easily to calculate a total of damages at issue 
the district court observed that the information contained in the plaintiffs email was based on cvs own data and that cvs could have performed its own analysis to reach the same estimate earlier in litigation see romulus ii,wl,at.but it erred in concluding that this fact made cvs second notice of removal untimely.the timeliness inquiry is limited to the information in the plaintiffs papers,regardless of whether its original source is the defendant.the defendant has no duty to perform significant investigation of its own data to ascertain removability.the test is not whether the information is new,but when the plaintiffs papers first enable the defendant to make the requisite merits showing to the district court.see b.
the email qualifies as an other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is removable,and required the defendant to remove within thirty days.id.cvs second notice of removal,filed within thirty days of the email,was timely 
b.the substantive removal question amount in controversy under section 
although cvs notice of removal was timely,it still must show that the cafa jurisdictional prerequisites for federal jurisdiction are met.the only element at issue in this removal is whether the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs.d.as we have stressed,the pertinent question is what is in controversy in the case,not how much the plaintiffs are ultimately likely to recover.amoche,at.
the removing defendant bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction under cafa.id.at.we have previously held that a defendant must show a reasonable probability that more than million is at stake in this case.id.at 
cvs second notice of removal calculated the amount in controversy to be at least in doing so,cvs was merely meeting its obligation to apply a reasonable amount of intelligence to the plaintiffs papers.see cutrone,at.
cvs updated its damages estimate in its opposition to the plaintiffs motion to remand.in the plaintiffs favor,cvs discounted the number of meal breaks when there was no other shift supervisor working by percent in an attempt to estimate the number of meal breaks at which no managerial employees were present.then,cvs extended the class period,updated the average hourly wage,included rates,and added a reasonable estimate of attorneys fees cvs provided the information for its calculations,as set forth in appendix a,showing damages of.
the plaintiffs raised objections to cvs revised calculation.first,the plaintiffs take issue with cvs cherrypicked assumption.second,the plaintiffs argue that
