in,tilcon capaldi,tilcon,a rhode island general contractor,sued to enforce a mechanics lien against commercial associates ca,a massachusetts partnership for whom tilcon had done site work required for construction of a shopping center.after extended and ramifying litigation in both state and federal court,tilcon obtained a judgment in in the federal district court in rhode island for over million in contract damages and ever mounting interest the judgment identified both ca and its general partners as liable,without specifying whether the parties were jointly or severally liable or whether they were liable in their individual or partnership capacity.
eventually,tilcon registered the judgment with the federal district court in massachusetts.supp.ii.in april,that court issued a writ of execution,mounting interest bringing the sum due to almost million.unlike the rhode island district court judgment,this initial massachusetts judgment specified that ca and the general partners were jointly and severally liable for the judgment.once again,the judgment did not state the capacity in which the partners were liable.jerald feldman was one of ca general partners named in the judgment.
in may,tilcon brought the present action in federal district court in massachusetts to reach and apply assets of jerald feldman to satisfy the judgment.laws ch.of importance for this appeal,tilcon sought to reach and other feldman interests in three nominee trusts apparently created by feldman and his beneficial interest in kelstock realty trust kelstock,his beneficial interest in marlborough realty trust marlborough,and his interest in commercial properties trust comprops.
a bench trial was held in this reach and apply action.feldman did not dispute that he held interests in the three trusts,but he claimed that his interests could not be reached because joint venture agreements,entered into after the trusts were formed,made the interests unassignable in addition,feldman argued that under principles of partnership law,he was not liable for the judgment or,in the alternative,that he was only liable for his aliquot share of the judgment.
in a decision rendered on january,the district judge agreed with feldman that his interests could not be reached by tilcon because the joint venture agreements made feldman interests unassignable.the court also found that because tilcon judgment against feldman rested on a contract claim,he was only jointly liable and was therefore liable only for his aliquot share.finally,the court concluded that tilcon earlier settlements with two of ca other general partners had not released feldman from any liability,and that tilcon could recover from feldman assets apart from the trust interests despite feldman claim that tilcon had not exhausted all efforts to satisfy the judgment from ca partnership assets.
both parties now appeal from the district court judgment.tilcon seeks to reach feldman trust interests and to hold him liable for the full judgment feldman disclaims any liability because of tilcon releases to other partners and alleged failure to exhaust partnership assets.we address these contentions in turn,applying de novo review to rulings of law.united states howard in re howard,cir.
the most difficult issue is whether feldman interests in the trusts,now themselves embedded in joint ventures,can be reached and applied to satisfy the judgment against him.the basic tenets of massachusetts law are clear a creditor may reach and apply a debtor interest in intangible property that can not otherwise be executed against in an action at law.laws ch,including a debtor beneficial interest in trusts,new eng.merchs.bank of boston hoss.however,trusts aside,a creditor may not reach and apply a debtor interest if the trust includes a spendthrift clause by which the creator of the trust the settlor forbids creditor attachments.hale bowler.
however,special rules apply when a settlor creates a trust for his own benefit and also attempts to immunize the trust from creditor claims.in such cases,massachusetts has adopted the restatement rule 
where a person creates for his own benefit a trust for support or a discretionary trust,his creditors can reach the maximum amount which the trustee under the terms of the trust could pay to him or apply for his benefit.
ware gulda,internal quotation marks omitted accord restatement second of trusts hereinafter restatement.thus,even if the trustee chooses not to make any payments to the beneficiary,a creditor may still reach the maximum amount the trustee could pay.scott fratcher,the law of trusts,at summarizing the holding in ware.
this rule keeps a debtor from protecting his property in such a way that he can still enjoy it but can prevent his creditors from reaching it.scott fratcher,supra,at.it is not necessary to the rule adopted by ware that the transferor intend to defraud his creditors.restatement cmt.a.the ware rule also applies even if the trust includes an explicit spendthrift provision.state bank trust reiser,citing cases accord restatement.it has special force in the case of nominee trusts,where the beneficiary can control the trustee actions,sylvia johnson,but it applies even where the trustee has sole discretion,ware,at.
if we were only looking at feldman interests in the three trusts before they became subject to the joint venture agreements,tilcon would have a straightforward claim to reach and apply feldman interest in the trusts.in each case,feldman had a beneficial interest and,as ware teaches,a spendthrift limitation would not be effective to block tilcon claim.however,the comprops beneficiaries entered into a joint venture agreement in january,and the kelstock and marlborough trust beneficiaries did so in august.hence,by the time tilcon attempted to reach and apply feldman interests in the trusts in,they were subject to a new set of restrictions on transfers.
the kelstock,marlborough,and relevant comprops joint venture agreements provide that the joint venturers may not sell,transfer,convey,mortgage,encumber or otherwise dispose of all or any part of their interest or rights in the venture,except by transfer to other original venturers or their family members,and except in response to a bona fide written offer to which the other venturers agree after exercising rights of first refusal.in addition,each agreement contains a spendthrift provision which purports to protect all the income and corpus of the venture from attachment by creditors.both sides have assumed that feldman joint venture interest subsumes his trust interest.
in the decision now before us,the district judge relied on the clauses in the joint venture agreements to debar tilcon from reaching feldman trust interests.of course,feldman was not seeking to assign either his trust or joint venture interests.but based on his reading of massachusetts case law,the district judge a general the reach and apply statute in massachusetts applies only to interests that are capable of being assigned.the district court ruled that the clauses took away this capability and therefore blocked tilcon 
we disagree.the reach and apply statute in massachusetts is very broadly written and contains no express reservation for cases in which an clause exists.laws ch,see also kilbourne standard stamp affixer.indeed,the statute extends explicitly to a defendant interest in partnership property where one would expect that there would commonly be contractual limits on assignment.laws ch.it is hard to see why the massachusetts supreme judicial court,which decided ware,would not read the statute to override clauses as readily as clauses barring creditor attachment.indeed,ware itself involved a trust in which both clauses were present.at.
the district court contrary view rests primarily on one massachusetts decision stating that certain personal tort causes of action were unassignable and could not be reached under the reach and apply statute.bethlehem fabricators,watts.but such claims are unassignable for policy reasons that do not apply here.see id.at.we do not read bethlehem,or another case where state law barred a transfer of an interest without legislative consen
