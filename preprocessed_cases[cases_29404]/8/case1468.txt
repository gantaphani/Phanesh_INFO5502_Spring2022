for nearly seventeen years,in litigation spanning two continents and numerous courtrooms,a group of ecuadorian citizens plaintiffs have sought relief for environmental devastation allegedly caused by texaco petroleum company texpet oil exploration and drilling operations in the ecuadorian rainforest.in,the district court jed rakoff,judge dismissed plaintiffs initial action on chevron forum non conveniens motion,and plaintiffs refiled their claims in lago agrio,ecuador,where they are currently being litigated.
recently,chevron and texpet collectively,chevron invoked the arbitration clause in ecuador bilateral investment treaty bit with the united states,and initiated arbitration against ecuador.see treaty between the united states of america and the republic of ecuador concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments,treaty doc.hereinafter bilateral investment treaty.chevron notice of arbitration asserted that ecuador had improperly interfered in the lago agrio litigation and requested,among other things,a declaration that chevron has no liability for environmental damage arising out of texpet drilling operations in ecuador.
plaintiffs,who are not parties to the arbitration,responded by commencing this proceeding in the district court for a stay of the bit arbitration,arguing that chevron initiation of arbitration against ecuador breached the promises that texaco made to the district court in order to secure dismissal of plaintiffs original action.shortly thereafter,ecuador also moved for a stay.the district court leonard sand,judge assumed,without deciding,that it had the power to stay bit arbitration,but declined to exercise that authority in this case.see republic of ecuador chevron,civ,civ,wl.ecuador and plaintiffs appealed.we conclude that the initiation of bit arbitration did not breach chevron promises to the district court and that the bit arbitration and the lago agrio litigation can coexist without undermining the district court forum non conveniens dismissal.we therefore affirm the district court refusal to stay the arbitration.
background 
prior decisions of both this court and the district court have thoroughly detailed the factual background and procedural history of this case.see aguinda texaco,cir jota texaco,cir republic of ecuador chevrontexaco,d aguinda texaco,d aguinda texaco.we repeat only those facts necessary to resolve the narrow issue raised in this appeal 
in,residents of ecuador oriente region sued texaco in the southern district of new york seeking extensive relief for vast devastation to that region caused by decades of oil exploration and extraction activities.aguinda.at.plaintiffs alleged that texpet improperly dumped toxic of the drilling process into the local rivers and constructed a pipeline that leaked large quantities of petroleum into the environment,causing both personal injuries and catastrophic environmental damage.jota,at.at the time,both texaco and the ecuadorian government vigorously opposed having plaintiffs claims litigated in the united states,and texaco moved for dismissal on forum non conveniens and international comity grounds.id.at.the district court jed rakoff,judge granted texaco motion and dismissed plaintiffs action.aguinda.at.
shortly after that dismissal order,a new government came to power in ecuador.political change brought with it a shift in ecuador view of this litigation,and the ecuadorian government attempted to intervene in the lawsuit on plaintiffs behalf.however,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and ecuador motion to intervene.jota,at.on appeal,we held that the district court erred by dismissing plaintiffs complaint without first securing a commitment by texaco to submit to the jurisdiction of the ecuadoran courts and remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
on remand,texaco provided that commitment by unambiguously agree ing in writing to be sued in ecuador,to accept service of process in ecuador,and to waive any statute of defenses that may have matured since the filing of the complaint.aguinda,d at.texaco also offered to satisfy any judgments in plaintiffs favor,reserving its right to contest their validity only in the limited circumstances permitted by new york recognition of foreign country money judgments act see et.with those concessions in mind the district court again dismissed plaintiffs complaint.aguinda,d at.on august,we affirmed.aguinda,at.plaintiffs responded by refiling their claims in lago agrio,ecuador,and the resulting ecuadorian litigation continues to this day 
in september,chevron initiated bit arbitration against ecuador.chevron notice of arbitration asserted two claims related to the lago agrio litigation.first,chevron argued that any judgment issued against it would violate the terms of texpet previous settlement agreement with ecuador under which texpet funded certain environmental remediation projects in exchange for what chevron now characterizes as a release from liability for environmental impact falling outside the scope of that settlement.second,chevron argued that the ecuadorian government improperly interfered with the lago agrio proceedings.in particular,chevron claimed that ecuador executive branch has publicly announced its support for the plaintiffs,and it has sought to interfere with chevron defense,and that ecuador judicial branch has conducted the lago agrio litigation in total disregard of ecuadorian law,international standards of fairness,and chevron basic due process and natural justice rights 
in the bit arbitration,chevron corporation and texpet seek a declaration that they have no liability or responsibility for environmental impact or for performing further environmental remediation a declaration that ecuador has breached both the bit and the terms of its release agreement with texpet an order requiring ecuador to inform the lago agrio court that chevron has been released from all environmental impact and that ecuador and petroecuador ecuador oil company are responsible for any remaining and future remediation work a declaration that ecuador or petroecuador is exclusively liable for any judgment that may be issued in the lago agrio litigation an order requiring ecuador to indemnify,protect and defend chevron in connection with the lago agrio litigation,including payment of all damages that may be awarded against chevron and attorneys fees,litigation costs,arbitration costs,moral damages,and interest.
in december,ecuador petitioned the district court to stay the bit arbitration,arguing that chevron initiation of arbitration and pursuit of such broad relief violated the promises that texaco previously made in order to secure a forum non conveniens dismissal of plaintiffs action in the united states courts.shortly thereafter,plaintiffs moved to stay the arbitration to the extent it would seek dismissal,nullification or avoidance of any judgment in the lago agrio litigation.the district court leonard sand,judge refused to stay the arbitration and granted chevron motion to dismiss both actions.republic of ecuador,wl,at.ecuador and plaintiffs appealed.
during the pendency of this appeal,the parties called our attention to two events that occurred after this case was briefed.first,the arbitral panel issued an interim order directing ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement of any judgment against chevron corporation in the lago agrio case.chevron corporation v.the republic of ecuador,pca case.a few days later,the lago agrio court entered an billion judgment against chevron,from which both parties intend to appeal.while we recognize the potential importance of those events,they do not alter the basic question on appeal whether the district court erred by refusing to stay the bit arbitration based on the record before it.

given that strong policy in favor of arbitration,and the lack of express authorization to stay arbitrations under the new york convention,the faa,or the bit,chevron asserts that courts lack the power to stay bit arbitration.that is an open question in our circuit.see westmoreland capital findlay,cir because we find that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking,we do not need to decide whether the faa gives federal courts the power to stay arbitration proceedings,abrogated on other grounds,vaden.because we conclude that a stay is unnecessary in this case,we need not resolve the question of whether federal courts have the power to stay arbitration under the faa or any other authority in an appropriate case.
ii.analysis 
ecuador waiver and estoppel claims 
ecuador argues that chevron,having previously agreed to litigate against plaintiffs in lago agrio,is now estopped from accepting,ha s waived its right to accept,or ha s otherwise rejected its right to arbitration under the bit.if ecuador is correct,then chevron initiation of arbitration was invalid and the arbitral panel lacks jurisdiction over the claims now before it.chevron,in addition to challenging the merits of ecuador waiver and estoppel claims,argues that those claims should be decided by the arbitral panel.because the parties have agreed to arbitrate threshold issues like estoppel and waiver,our precedent prevents us from addressing the merits of ecuador claims instead,we leave them to the arbitral panel in the first instance.
ecuador moved to stay the bit arbitration under the faa.section two of the faa states that an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.that provision constitutes a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements the effect is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr.the application of state law,especially in a case like this where there is little connection to the forum,would introduce a degree of parochialism and uncertainty into international arbitration that would subvert the goal of simplifying and unifying international arbitration law.cogeneration,at.we therefore apply federal law to determine the arbitrability of ecuador waiver and estoppel claims.
under federal law,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,commc ns workers of,internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we must first resolve the question of the very existence of the contract embodying the arbitration clause.specht netscape commc ns,cir internal quotation marks omitted.only after ensuring that a valid arbitration agreement exists may we proceed to determine whether that agreement requires the arbitration of ecuador claims.
at the outset,we note that chevron is not a party to the bit.unlike the more typical scenario where the agreement to arbitrate is contained in an agreement between the parties to the arbitration,here the bit merely creates a framework through which foreign investors,such as chevron,can initiate arbitration against parties to the treaty.in the end,however,this proves to be a distinction without a difference,since ecuador,by signing the bit,and chevron,by consenting to arbitration,have created a separate binding agreement to arbitrate.
the bit provides that an agreement in writing for purposes of article ii of the new york convention is created when a foreign company gives notice in writing to a bit signatory and submits an investment dispute between the parties to binding arbitration in accordance with article vi of the treaty.see bilateral investment treaty,art.vi b.all that is necessary to form an agreement to arbitrate is for one party to be a bit signatory and the other to consent to arbitration of an investment dispute in accordance with the treaty terms.in effect,ecuador accession to the treaty constitutes a standing offer to arbitrate disputes covered by the treaty a foreign investor written demand for arbitration completes the agreement in writing to submit the dispute to arbitration.
here,chevron complied with the requirements of article vi by notifying ecuador in writing and submitting the dispute to an arbitral panel in accordance with the arbitration rules of the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral.id.art.vi a iii.therefore,the parties formed an agreement in writing within the meaning of the new york convention.article ii of the new york convention,enforced in the united states through,requires the recognition of an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them.convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards art.ii,june.applying that provision to this case requires us to enforce the parties agreement according to its terms.
with the existence of a valid arbitration agreement established,we turn to the arbitrability of ecuador waiver and estoppel claims.we must determine whether the parties intended for the arbitral panel or the courts to resolve those threshold issues.we will reach the merits of ecuador claims only if they are fit for judicial determination.
we address the arbitrability of ecuador waiver and estoppel claims with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone,at.that policy is even stronger in the context of international business transactions where arbitral agreements promote the smooth flow of international transactions by removing the threats and uncertainty of and expensive litigation.david threlkeld metallgesellschaft,cir see also mitsubishi motors soler,federal policy favoring arbitration applies with special force in the field of international commerce.as a result,we resolve any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone,at.
the supreme court has distinguished between questions of arbitrability,which are to be resolved by the courts unless the parties have clearly agreed otherwise,and other gateway matters,which are presumptively reserved for the arbitrator resolution.mulvaney,sheet metal workers int l ass n,local,cir,quoting howsam dean witter reynolds.questions of arbitrability is a term of art covering dispute s about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause as well as disagreement s about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.howsam,at.those issues should be decided by the courts unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence from the arbitration agreement that the parties intended that they be decided by the arbitrator.bell cendant,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,the phrase question of arbitrability is not applicable where parties would likely expect that an arbitrator would decide the gateway matter.thus procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.howsam,at internal quotation marks omitted.
both waiver and estoppel generally fall into that latter group of issues presumptively for the arbitrator.the supreme court has stated,in dicta,that the presumption is that the arbitrator should decide allegation s of waiver.id.at,quoting moses cone,at.similarly,howsam favorably quoted the comments to the revised uniform arbitration act of for the proposition that,in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,prerequisites such as estoppel and other conditions precedent to an obligation to arbitrate are for the arbitrators to decide.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,we have noted that defenses to arbitrability such as waiver,estoppel,or delay are questions properly decided by arbitrators.see mulvaney,at.
in this case,however,ecuador characterizes its waiver and estoppel arguments as undermining the agreement itself,not merely as preventing chevron from taking advantage of an admittedly binding arbitration clause.ecuador claims that,under such circumstances,waiver and estoppel are presumptively for the courts.we need not reach that issue here because,even assuming ecuador waiver and estoppel claims go to chevron ability to initiate arbitration,and thus are fairly characterized as questions of arbitrability,there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended these issues to be decided by the arbitral panel in the first instance.bell,at emphasis removed.
by signing the bit,ecuador agreed to resolve investment disputes through arbitration under the uncitral rules.article of those rules states that the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.uncitral arbitration rules,para,res,doc,therefore,ecuador consented to sending challenges to the validity of the arbitration agreement to the arbitral panel.in this case,ecuador estoppel and waiver claims challenge the validity of the arbitration agreement because ecuador argues that chevron either waived its right to or is estopped from entering into a binding agreement to arbitrate.because ecuador waiver and estoppel claims go to the validity of the arbitration agreement,article requires that they be decided by the arbitral panel in the first instance.
that conclusion is supported by this court interpretation of similar language in other arbitration agreements.our decision in contec remote solution,cir,provides an example.there,contec corporation initiated arbitration against remote solution.remote solution insisted that it had never entered into a binding arbitration agreement with contec corporation instead,it claimed to have contracted only with contec,contec corporation predecessor.id.at.although remote solution claim went to the validity of the arbitration agreement,we looked to that agreement for evidence that the parties intended for the arbitrator to decide questions of arbitrability.such evidence came from the agreement incorporation of rule of the american arbitration association aaa,which states that t he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded that rule language empower ed an arbitrator to decide issues of arbitrability,such as the validity of the arbitration agreement itself,and serve d as clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent to delegate such issues to an arbitrator.id.
we then determined that the parties had a sufficient relationship to each other and to the rights created under the agreement to permit contec corporation to compel arbitration even if,in the end,an arbitrator were to determine that the dispute itself was not arbitrable because contec corporation could not claim rights under the agreement.id.at.importantly,remote solution,the party seeking to avoid arbitration,had signed the agreement,which broadly covered the business relationship at issue and delegated questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.id.at.that indicator of remote solution expectation and intent enabled us to conclude that as a signatory to a contract containing an arbitration clause and incorporating by reference the aaa rules,remote solution could not disown its obligation to arbitrate all disputes,including the question of arbitrability.id.at.
ecuador is now in the same situation.as a signatory to the bit,ecuador has consented to arbitrating disputes arising out of investment projects like texpet drilling operations in ecuador.that agreement also incorporated by reference the uncitral rule delegating questions of arbitrability to the arbitral panel through language nearly identical to the aaa provision at issue in contec.therefore,ecuador can not now disown its obligation to arbitrate the question s of arbitrability it has raised as defenses to arbitration in this court.id.
chevron,too,has consented to sending those threshold issues to the arbitrator.it invoked the uncitral rules when filing its notice of arbitration and has argued that questions of arbitrability are for the arbitral panel.because both parties have consented to having questions of arbitrability,including ecuador waiver and estoppel claims,determined by the arbitral panel in the first instance,we do not reach their merits here.nor can we stay arbitration on those grounds.
enforcing previous judgments 
plaintiffs argue that chevron is using bit arbitration to undermine the lago agrio litigation and deprive them of a forum capable of resolving those claims previously dismissed by the district court on forum non conveniens grounds.according to plaintiffs,chevron has breached the promises that texaco made in order to secure that dismissal by pursuing bit arbitration,and a stay of the arbitral proceedings is necessary in order to hold chevron accountable to those promises.
plaintiffs moved to stay the bit arbitration on judicial estoppel,equitable estoppel,and collateral estoppel grounds.although those doctrines have somewhat different purposes and applications,in each case the party who is to be estopped must have asserted a fact or claim,or made a promise,that another party relied on,that a court relied on,or that a court adjudicated and then later attempted to take a contradictory stance in that or another proceeding.maitland of,cir.bank of first millennium,cir kosakow new rochelle radiology,cir maharaj bankamerica,cir.generally speaking,we employ estoppel to ensure the integrity of the judicial process,new hampshire maine,u,and to hold litigants accountable for statements upon which courts and other parties reasonably rely,osrecovery,v.one groupe int l,cir.
plaintiffs estoppel claims rest on four statements that texaco made to the district court in order to secure dismissal of plaintiffs action.the first three statements concern texaco submission to ecuadorian jurisdiction.in jota,we made clear that a forum non conveniens dismissal would be appropriate only if texaco were to submit to the jurisdiction of the ecuadoran courts.at.to comply with that ruling,texaco agreed to be sued in ecuador,to accept service of process in ecuador,and to waive any statute of defenses that may have matured since the filing of plaintiffs complaint.aguinda,d at.those three promises were embodied in the district court stipulation and order,which both parties signed.see aguinda texaco,civ,civ.june.texaco also promised that,if plaintiffs claims were dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds,it would satisfy judgments that might be entered in plaintiffs favor by the ecuadorian courts,subject to its rights under new york recognition of foreign country money judgments act.texaco mem.of law in supp.of its renewed mot.to dismiss based on forum non conveniens and international comity.the basic question now before us is whether chevron actions in pursuing bit arbitration constitute a breach of those four promises.
initially,we note that there is no inherent conflict between bit arbitration and the lago agrio litigation.those two proceedings involve different parties and distinct claims.bit arbitration is designed to settle investment disputes between foreign investors and the host government.see bilateral investment treaty,art.vi.it is limited to the resolution of disputes between a party to the bit and a national or company of the other party arising out of or relating to an investment agreement between that party and such national or company or an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by the bit with respect to an investment.id.chevron claims are now pending in bit arbitration precisely because they deal with allegations of ecuador improper behavior with respect to texaco investment in the region.however,plaintiffs are not parties to the bit,and that treaty has no application to their claims their dispute with chevron therefore can not be settled through bit arbitration.instead plaintiffs have exercised their right under the forum non conveniens dismissal to litigate their claims against chevron in lago agrio.that litigation continues to this day.the existence of those parallel in which chevron asserts wrongdoing on the part of ecuador and another in which plaintiffs assert wrongdoing on the part of clear that the lago agrio litigation can coexist with bit arbitration.
there is also no conflict between texaco promises to the district court and chevron initiation of a contemporaneous challenge to ecuador conduct with respect to the lago agrio litigation.texaco expressly conditioned its promises on a reservation of its rights under new york recognition of foreign country money judgments act.see chevron has thus reserved its right to challenge any judgment issued in lago agrio on the grounds that the ecuadorian judicial system does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law,that the judgment itself was obtained by fraud,or that the proceeding in lago agrio was contrary to an agreement between the parties.id.nothing in that reservation of rights purports to restrict the kind of forum or type of proceeding in which chevron can raise those defenses.nor did texaco promise to wait until after a judgment was issued to challenge the fairness of the lago agrio litigation.having reserved the rights conferred by,chevron remains free to enforce them whenever and wherever it chooses,limited only by the scope of the statute and the availability of a forum prepared to address its claims.it is against that backdrop that we consider plaintiffs estoppel claims.
judicial estoppel 
the purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.new hampshire,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.it prevents a party from asserting a factual position clearly inconsistent with a position previously advanced by that party and adopted by the court in some manner.maharaj,at.because the doctrine is primarily concerned with protecting the judicial process,relief is granted only when the risk of inconsistent results with its impact on judicial integrity is certain.simon safelite glass,cir accord derosa envelope,cir uzdavines weeks marine,cir.
chevron notice of arbitration raised two claims that plaintiffs assert are contrary to the positions that texaco took in order to secure the dismissal of plaintiffs action on forum non conveniens grounds.chevron first claim is that ecuador has engaged in a pattern of improper and fundamentally unfair conduct with respect to the lago agrio litigation that has undermined the impartiality of the ecuadorian courts.plaintiffs properly characterize that claim as an assertion that chevron due process rights have been violated in ecuador.texaco,however,reserved its right to challenge any judgment as rendered under a system which does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law.a.therefore,chevron can raise its due process claims in bit arbitration without contravening texaco prior positions in the district court.
chevron second claim is that a prior agreement between texpet and ecuador releases it from any further liability for environmental impact.according to chevron,ecuador has violated that agreement by refusing to indemnify,protect and defend chevron rights in connection with the lago agrio litigation and by failing to accept responsibility for the environmental impact of texpet drilling operations.on that basis,chevron has requested that the arbitral panel issue an order and award requiring ecuador to inform the court in the lago agrio litigation that chevron ha s been released from all environmental impact and a declaration that ecuador is exclusively liable for any judgment that may be issued in that litigation.
we conclude that chevron may also raise its release claim in bit arbitration.as we have previously explained,there is a binding agreement between chevron and ecuador to arbitrate investment disputes arising out of texpet drilling operations,and chevron release claim is related to that activity.if chevron believes that the terms of the release agreement obligate ecuador to take certain actions with respect to the lago agrio litigation,nothing in texaco promises to the district court prevents chevron from using bit arbitration to attempt to hold ecuador accountable to those alleged obligations the very purpose of bit arbitration is to provide an impartial venue for the resolution of investment disputes like chevron release claim.
a promise to submit to the jurisdiction of the ecuadorian courts and to pay a resulting judgment is not incompatible with a request for an arbitral order requiring ecuador to intervene in the lago agrio litigation.in dismissing plaintiffs action on forum non conveniens grounds,the district court placed no conditions on ecuador right to participate in any litigation instituted by plaintiffs in ecuador.nor could it have,since ecuador refused to waive its sovereign immunity in the district court and was not a party to plaintiffs original action against chevron.see aguinda,d at.as a result,nothing that occurred in the united states action limits ecuador freedom to take a position in the lago agrio litigation in support of either party.whether that intervention is wholly voluntary or the result of an arbitral order enforcing an alleged prior promise by ecuador to chevron to take a particular position in that litigation makes no difference.if such an order is issued,and ecuador enters the lago agrio litigation in support of chevron,it will still be for the ecuadorian courts to determine the effect if any of such developments on the case pending before them.
similarly,nothing in texaco promises to submit to ecuadorian jurisdiction and satisfy any ecuadorian judgment prevents the arbitral panel from issuing a declaration regarding chevron liability for texpet drilling operations if the arbitral panel issues such a declaration before any ecuadorian judgment becomes final,then the ecuadorian courts,applying ecuadorian law,will determine what impact that declaration has on plaintiffs case.if the pending lago agrio judgment is overturned on as a result of ecuador intervention or for any other will have complied with its obligation to litigate the matter in ecuador and to pay any resulting judgment in that case,it would simply have won in the ecuadorian courts,and there will be no judgment to pay.
a conflict may arise if the ecuadorian courts do issue a final judgment,and the arbitrators subsequently enter an award that is inconsistent with that judgment.any such conflict,should it arise,could be resolved in any resulting proceedings to enforce the judgment.in such a proceeding,plaintiffs would be free to argue that chevron is estopped from refusing to pay that judgment based solely on the force of its release claim.new york recognition of foreign country money judgments act,which is the sole reserved route for chevron to challenge any final judgment resulting from the lago agrio litigation,provides only limited ways to attack a judgment based on a prior agreement.under that act,a judgment need not be recognized if the proceeding in the foreign court was contrary to an agreement between the parties under which the dispute in question was to be settled
