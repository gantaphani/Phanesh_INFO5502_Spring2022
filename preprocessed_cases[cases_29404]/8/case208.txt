this insurance coverage dispute arises from charges of sexual harassment brought by a employee against appellant luciano manganella,the former president of jasmine company.manganella sought a defense to and indemnity for the harassment claims from appellee evanston insurance,jasmine liability insurance provider.the district court ruled that manganella was not entitled to coverage from evanston because,under the doctrine of issue preclusion,a prior arbitration between manganella and the purchaser of his business conclusively established that manganella conduct fell within an exclusion to evanston insurance policy.after careful consideration,we affirm.
facts background 
before the events giving rise to this action,manganella was the president and sole shareholder of jasmine,a clothing retailer that he founded in the.donna burgess,whose sexual harassment allegations against manganella form the underlying claims here,was jasmine human resources manager from to.
in,a former jasmine employee,sonia bawa,filed claims of sexual harassment against jasmine based on manganella conduct.soon thereafter,jasmine purchased from evanston the employment practices liability insurance policy at issue here the policy.jasmine coverage from evanston under the policy consisted of a series of annually renewed installments.the policy covers any claim that seeks relief for a wrongful employment practice and is made and reported to evanston during the policy period or an extended reporting period.a wrongful employment practice includes,as relevant here,conduct of an insured with respect to an employee that allegedly culminated in violation of any state,federal or local civil rights or law fair employment practices law.for a resulting claim to be covered,a wrongful employment practice must have happened in its entirety during the policy period or after the retroactive date here,april.importantly,one of the policy exclusions the disregard exclusion bars coverage for claims based on conduct committed with wanton,willful,reckless or intentional disregard of any law or laws that is or are the foundation for the claim.
in july,manganella sold jasmine to lerner new york,for approximately million.manganella and lerner executed a stock purchase agreement spa to effectuate the sale and an employment agreement under which manganella would remain jasmine president for three years.under the spa,million of the purchase price was placed in escrow,as security in the event of a major employment breach by manganella.a major employment breach is a breach of the employment agreement that arises from,among other things,a refusal to comply with any significant policy of lerner.a few months after the sale was completed,jasmine cancelled the final installment of the policy,but purchased an extended reporting period,which allowed for coverage of claims made and reported during the months following the effective date of the cancellation.
in may,further allegations of sexual harassment by manganella prompted jasmine to hire an outside investigator,stier anderson llc,which interviewed several employees,including burgess she recounted inappropriate comments that manganella had made in the past.on june,as a result of conduct revealed by the investigation,manganella was fired.in a letter to manganella,lerner accused him of committing multiple major employment breaches by sexually harassing four female employees and downloading sexually explicit images on company computers,all in violation of lerner code of conduct.lerner demanded that manganella agree to release the escrowed million.
one week later,lerner invoked the spa arbitration clause,contending that manganella had forfeited the escrowed funds by committing a major employment breach.the arbitration panel held ten days of hearings and received extensive written and oral argumentation.the panel issued its ruling in april,finding that manganella had sexually propositioned several women employees and inappropriately touched and propositioned one of these employees,in willful violation of lerner corporate code of conduct.the panel explained we find,despite his protestations to the contrary,that manganella was well acquainted with the company policy on sexual harassment and other acts of inappropriate conduct.we find thus that he did not comply with the policy and that his refusal was willful.
the panel also found,however,that lerner had failed to give manganella notice of and an opportunity to remedy these violations,as required by the spa.consequently,the panel awarded manganella the escrowed funds,along with interest and attorneys fees.the arbitration award was confirmed by a federal court in august.manganella lerner,cv rjh,order confirming arbitration award.
on march,roughly a month before the arbitration ended,burgess filed a charge of discrimination against manganella,lerner,and jasmine with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad.the mcad charge alleged that,t hroughout her employment with jasmine,manganella subjected burgess to nearly constant physical and verbal sexual harassment,including inappropriate comments about burgess s body,inappropriate touching,and,eventually,coerced sexual activity on five separate occasions.manganella also made sexual comments about other women in burgess s presence,and threatened burgess and others with physical violence.
ten days after burgess filed the mcad charge,manganella notified evanston of her claims and requested coverage under the policy.less than two weeks later,evanston replied,denying coverage for burgess claims on the ground that it was apparent that the harassment alleged in her mcad charge did not happen in its entirety subsequent to the april,retroactive date,as required for coverage.evanston letter also adverted,without elaboration,to the disregard exclusion.
manganella filed this action against evanston in july,seeking a ruling that evanston was required under the policy to defend and indemnify him against burgess mcad charge.he also alleged breaches of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and violations of.laws chs,and,all stemming from evanston refusal to defend and indemnify him.after discovery,manganella and evanston for summary judgment.the district court held that evanston should have at least investigated the mcad charge before denying coverage,given that it was aware of certain facts suggesting that manganella unlawful conduct may not have begun prior to the policy retroactive date.manganella evanston ins,d.the court also concluded,however,that the conduct described in burgess mcad charge fell within the policy disregard exclusion.the court found that the arbitration panel determination that manganella had harassed his employees including burgess in willful violation of lerner code of conduct also established that,for purposes of the disregard exclusion,manganella acted with wanton,willful,reckless or intentional disregard of the massachusetts sexual harassment law underlying burgess mcad charge.id.at.the district court thus held that the doctrine of issue preclusion barred manganella from relitigating that question,and granted summary judgment for evanston.id.at manganella now appeals that ruling.
ii.analysis 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.baker paul travelers ins,cir.likewise,w e review de novo the district court application of the doctrine of issue preclusion because t he applicability vel non of preclusion principles is a question of law.keystone shipping new eng.power,cir second alteration in original quoting monarch life ins.ropes gray,cir.
the crux of this appeal is whether the district court properly applied the doctrine of issue preclusion to bar manganella from litigating whether the policy disregard exclusion applies to the conduct alleged in burgess mcad charge.as described above,the district court held that the arbitration between lerner and manganella had decided,in the affirmative,the crucial question of whether manganella acts,as alleged by burgess,were committed with wanton,willful,reckless,or intentional disregard for the massachusetts sexual harassment law that formed the basis for her claims against him.d at.although the parties dispute whether massachusetts or federal preclusion principles govern this question,we need not resolve that quarrel because we see no material difference in how the two standards would apply here.see keystone shipping,at noting that our cases apply the same traditional preclusion principles that would control in a massachusetts court.
issue preclusion also called collateral estoppel prevents a party from relitigating issues that have been previously adjudicated.rodríguez garcía miranda marín,cir.the doctrine applies to issues of fact as well as those of law,allen mccurry,d,and can apply where the subsequent proceeding involves a cause of action different from the first,see comm r sunnen.under modern preclusion doctrine,the central question is whether a party has had a full and fair opportunity for judicial resolution of the same issue.rodríguez garcía,at quoting fiumara fireman fund ins,cir.
generally,final arbitral awards are afforded the same preclusive effects as are prior court judgments.see fleetboston fin.alt,cir citing wolf gruntal,cir.as we have noted,however,there may be particular difficulties in applying preclusion principles to an arbitral award,especially where the reasoning behind the award is unexplained.id.at.thus,it has been suggested that courts have discretion as to whether issue preclusion is appropriate in the arbitration context.id.citing charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed.here,though,w e need not consider that suggestion,as we find it clear that the outcome we reach is consistent with the traditional requirements.id.
under those traditional requirements,issue preclusion may be applied to bar relitigation of an issue decided in an earlier action where the issues raised in the two actions are the same the issue was actually litigated in the earlier action the issue was determined by a valid and binding final judgment and the determination of the issue was necessary to that judgment.accord mercado salinas bart enters.int l,cir.here,manganella argues that two of these predicates are missing identity of the issues and necessity to the judgment.we begin with identity of the issues.
for issue preclusion to apply here,the arbitrators must have decided an issue the same as the one presented in this case.smith bayer,d.the identity of the issues need not be absolute rather,it is enough that the issues are in substance identical.see montana united states,d asking whether the issues presented in the two actions are in substance the same.further,the issue need not have been the ultimate issue decided by the arbitration issue preclusion can extend to necessary intermediate findings,rodríguez garcía,at,even where those findings are not explicit,grella salem five cent sav.bank,cir.nevertheless,the arbitrators must have effectively resolved the issue presented here whether manganella conduct,as described in the mcad charge,was committed with wanton,willful,reckless or intentional disregard of the massachusetts sexual harassment law underlying the charge.
manganella argues that the arbitrators were simply never called upon to decide whether he acted in disregard of state law.he claims that lerner code of conduct is broader and stricter than state sexual harassment law the code,he says,reaches not only sexual harassment serious enough to violate the law,but also less serious harassment,as well as behavior that would embarrass the company or constitute a failure of leadership.thus,manganella argues,the arbitrators did not,in the process of deciding whether he violated the code,decide anything about the relationship between his conduct and state law.
we think that manganella overstates the differences between the code of conduct and the state law referenced in the disregard exclusion.the relevant portion of the code provides 
we are committed to maintaining a workplace entirely free from illegal discrimination or harassment 
the term harassment may include unwelcome slurs and other offensive remarks,jokes and other verbal,graphic or unwelcome physical contact.harassment may also include unwelcome sexual advances,requests for sexual favors or unwelcome or offensive touching and other verbal,graphic or physical conduct of a sexual nature 
the applicable state law similarly provides that sexual harassment means 
sexual advances,requests for sexual favors,and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when a submission to or rejection of such advances,requests or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or as a basis for employment decisions or b such advances,requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual work performance by creating an intimidating,hostile,humiliating or sexually offensive work environment.
laws ch.thus,both the state law and the code reach sexual advances,requests for sexual favors,and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
to be sure,the law does impose a severity requirement absent from the code the behavior described above is unlawful only if it involves a quid pro quo or creat es an intimidating,hostile,humiliating or sexually offensive work environment.but this requirement does not,as manganella suggests,mean that a single incident can not constitute unlawful sexual harassment.in fact,the supreme judicial court has declined to require sexual harassment claims to be based on any particular number of incidents.see gnerre.comm against,citing,div.of interco.comm against,see also maltese thacker,no,wl,at.may,a single incident can,depending on the nature and severity of the conduct,constitute sexual harassment.thus,the fact that the arbitrators did not expressly find that manganella had propositioned any particular employee more than once does not mean that his conduct could not have run afoul of the law.
none of this is to say that we see no distinction between the standard imposed by the code and that created by the law.rather,the point is that the two standards are similar enough that we are unable to discern a meaningful difference,on the facts of this case,between acting in willful violation of the former which the arbitrators found manganella to have done and acting with wanton disregard of the latter which triggers the disregard exclusion.because of this similarity,sexually harassing conduct committed in willful violation of the code,by a person familiar with the law,would,on these facts,show a wanton or reckless disregard for whether that conduct was lawful.
manganella position is that the two issues are nevertheless not the same because the arbitrators did not make any findings specific to burgess herself.thus,he contends,the arbitration could not have decided whether the conduct alleged in burgess mcad charge was committed in disregard of the law.this argument,however,is impossible to square with manganella admission below that burgess is one of the jasmine employees who the arbitration panel found manganella had sexually harassed.in light of that concession,the only open question is whether burgess was one of the several employees manganella was found to have sexually propositioned or was instead the one employee he inappropriately touched and propositioned.but for present purposes,this distinction is immaterial for the reasons given above,we do not see how manganella could have undertaken any of this conduct without a wanton or reckless disregard for its legality.thus,the lack of factual findings expressly tied to burgess herself does not place the present issue beyond the scope of the arbitrators decision.
one final point bolsters our conclusion that the arbitrators effectively decided the issue presented here proof of a willful violation of the code and proof of conduct committed in disregard of the law would be extremely similar.see wright et,supra,at noting that,in defining the issues precluded by a prior action,courts consider,among other factors,whether there is a substantial overlap between the evidence or argument advanced in the two proceedings accord restatement second of judgments cmt.c.apart from the question of findings specific to burg
