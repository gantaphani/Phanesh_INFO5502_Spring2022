helga valentín,also known as helga valentín de jesús,invites us to reverse an order of the district court dismissing her medical malpractice suit for lack of jurisdiction.bound by a relatively restrictive standard of review,we decline her invitation.
on december,valentín sued a cadre of hospitals,physicians,insurers,and a health services the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.claiming that she was a citizen of florida whereas all the defendants were citizens of puerto rico,the plaintiff premised federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount see a.because it is valentín citizenship that is at issue here,we make no attempt to enumerate,or to differentiate among,the various defendants.
for federal jurisdictional purposes,diversity of citizenship must be determined as of the time of suit.bank one montle,cir.thus,the critical date here was december,and the plaintiff jurisdictional assertion hinged upon her contention that she was a citizen of florida at that time.the defendants scoffed at this contention and,after conducting some preliminary discovery,moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.see.b.they took the position that the plaintiff true home was in puerto rico.
according to her own account,derived from her deposition testimony,the plaintiff was born in mayagüez,puerto rico,in.her family subsequently moved to yauco.she lived there with her mother and studied nursing at a local university.when she completed her studies,she returned to mayagüez and began working at the mayagüez medical center mmc in late.
at some point,the plaintiff sister married and moved to florida.after toiling at mmc for over five years,the plaintiff,using her accrued vacation time,spent a month visiting her sister and.during that visit,she experienced acute abdominal pain.doctors in florida informed her that she needed extensive tests and,quite likely,surgery.cognizant of the requirements of her health insurance plan,she returned to puerto rico for care.surgery proved necessary during the winter of.when performed,it went poorly.
the ensuing complications prompted the plaintiff to repair to florida in april of,seeking more sophisticated medical care.her sister and again provided her with a place to live.when she left for florida,however,she did not terminate her employment with mmc.to the contrary,her pooled their accumulated sick leave totaling days and donated it to her so that she could pursue treatment alternatives without losing her job.
even after the plaintiff had exhausted all available sick leave,she did not resign.instead,she requested that mmc grant her an indefinite period of unpaid leave.mmc acquiesced.although the plaintiff never returned to work at mmc,she did not sever that tie until march of three months after she filed the instant action.
these facts led the parties to opposite conclusions about the plaintiff citizenship.on january,the most aggressive of the defendants,united healthcare plans of puerto rico uhp,filed a motion to dismiss under rule b,in which it asserted an absence of diversity jurisdiction.several other defendants filed motions joining adopting this motion.the plaintiff opposed these initiatives,maintaining that she had become a citizen of florida and,therefore,that jurisdiction was properly laid in the federal court.in an effort to streamline the proceedings,the district court gave the remaining defendants until march to stake out their positions jurisdiction and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for may 
one additional defendant responded to the court invitation and filed a motion to dismiss within the specified interval.as the date set for the evidentiary hearing approached,the plaintiff,by motion filed on may,asked the court to suspend that hearing and determine the existence vel non of jurisdiction on the parties written submissions.the court,apparently yielding to this entreaty,proceeded to decide the jurisdictional issue on the papers.
in a carefully considered opinion,the court determined that the plaintiff went to florida in with the intent of returning to puerto rico that her intent remained unchanged on december,and that,therefore,she was still a citizen of puerto rico when she filed suit.valentín uhp,slip op.at july,unpublished.in the court view,the evidence showed only that the plaintiff returned to florida in to receive medical treatment and that she harbored the intention and desire of living in florida at some time in the future.id.at.because even a definite and sincere intention to make a place one home at some time in the future is not enough to make that place an individual present domicile,the court found the evidence insufficient to support the plaintiff claim of florida citizenship.id.
the plaintiff attack on the district court ruling is vigorous,but largely misdirected.her principal arguments rest on serial misconceptions of the proper protocol for determining jurisdiction and the level of appellate review that applies thereafter.we first expose these misconceptions and then use the correct standards to resolve this appeal.
the proper vehicle for challenging a court jurisdiction is federal rule of civil procedure b.this rule is a large umbrella,overspreading a variety of different types of challenges to jurisdiction.some grounded in considerations of ripeness,mootness,sovereign immunity,and the existence of federal question jurisdiction are good examples,see,ernst young depositors econ.prot,cir ripeness,cir mootness murphy united states,cir sovereign immunity biw deceived local,cir federal question present what amount to pure or nearly pure questions of law,and thus engender de novo review.those types of challenges are beyond the scope of this opinion.
in more prosaic situations,such as when a defendant challenges the existence vel non of diversity jurisdiction,the challenge can be launched in either of two formats.see james moore et,moore federal practice ed outlining procedures for resolving challenges to jurisdiction.we explore that dichotomy.
the first way is to mount a challenge which accepts the plaintiff version of facts as true and addresses their sufficiency,thus requiring the court to assess whether the plaintiff has propounded an adequate basis for jurisdiction.ohio life ins.united states,cir menchaca chrysler credit,cir.in performing this task,the court must credit the plaintiff factual allegations usually taken from the complaint,but sometimes augmented by an explanatory affidavit or other repository of uncontested facts,draw all reasonable inferences from them in her favor,and dispose of the challenge accordingly.see herbert acad.of,lawrence dunbar,cir per curiam see also barrett lombardi,cir assuming truth of uncontested facts set forth in plaintiff explanatory affidavit.for ease in classification,we shall call this type of challenge a sufficiency challenge.
the second way to engage the gears of rule b is by controverting the accuracy rather than the sufficiency of the jurisdictional facts asserted by the plaintiff and proffering materials of evidentiary quality in support of that position.unlike,say,a motion for summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure c,this type of challenge under federal rule of civil procedure b which we shall call a factual challenge permits indeed,demands differential factfinding.thus,the plaintiff jurisdictional averments are entitled to no presumptive weight the court must address the merits of the jurisdictional claim by resolving the factual disputes between the parties.see garcia copenhaver,bell,cir.in conducting this inquiry,the court enjoys broad authority to order discovery,consider extrinsic evidence,and hold evidentiary hearings in order to determine its own jurisdiction see lawrence,at rosales united states,cir.
the rationale for this praxis is obvious.a court authority to hear a particular case is a necessary precondition to the proper performance of the judicial function.thus,when a factbound jurisdictional question looms,a court must be allowed considerable leeway in weighing the proof,drawing reasonable inferences,and satisfying itself that jurisdiction has attached.see williamson tucker,cir.
the relevance of this dichotomy is readily apparent here.the motions to dismiss in this case plainly constitute factual challenges they place in issue the accuracy,as opposed to the sufficiency,of the plaintiff jurisdictional allegation.the plaintiff blinks this reality,arguing that the district court should have viewed the facts in the light most favorable to her position and,in a misguided effort to reinforce that point,repeatedly characterizes the court order as a grant of summary judgment,appellant br.at.
we flatly reject this revisionism.as said,the motions before the district court were factual challenges under rule b.it is pellucid that a trial court approach to a rule b motion which asserts a factual challenge is quite different from its approach to a motion for summary judgment.see ohio life,at see also kamen v.at t,cir explaining that a district court can not convert a factual challenge under rule b into a summary judgment motion.the plaintiff,therefore,is fishing in an empty stream when she attempts to discredit the lower court decision by adverting to a wholly inapplicable standard used for adjudicating summary judgment motions under which the existence of a genuine issue of material fact ordinarily defeats the motion.
the rule of decision applicable to factual challenges under rule b is unaffected by the district court cancellation of the scheduled evidentiary hearing and its subsequent adjudication of the jurisdictional issue on the papers.a court sometimes may decide factual challenges under rule b without convening an evidentiary hearing,zappia middle constr.emirate of abu dhabi,cir.the key considerations are whether the parties have had a full and fair opportunity to present relevant facts and arguments,and whether either party seasonably requested an evidentiary hearing.aoude mobil oil,cir upholding dismissal of suit without evidentiary hearing because,inter alia,motions to dismiss generally do not necessitate evidentiary hearings,and in all events,the appellant had not requested such a hearing.
where,as here,the parties were afforded ample time to take depositions,compile written submissions,and prepare briefs,they had a sufficient opportunity to be heard.see generally.e authorizing federal district courts to hear motions and determine ancillary facts on affidavits or depositions.this opportunity,coupled with the fact that the plaintiff herself exhorted the district court to abandon its plan to hold an evidentiary hearing,sounds the death knell for the plaintiff argument.under the circumstances,we think that the plaintiff is estopped from asserting before us that the district court blundered in failing to convene an evidentiary hearing.after all,a party who requests a court to take a specific course of action ordinarily can not be heard to complain when the court obliges,john zink zink,cir united states coady,cir.we conclude,therefore,that the court correctly proceeded to find the facts without holding an evidentiary hearing.
the plaintiff second misconception relates to the applicable standard of appellate review.that standard,too,depends on whether a challenge is addressed to the sufficiency of the facts upon which the plaintiff jurisdictional averments rest or the accuracy of those facts.see thompson franklin,cir.as noted,the district court disposes of a rule b sufficiency challenge on the basis of the plaintiff version of the relevant events,taking the facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the pleader.because the facts are not in issue,the court determination engenders de novo review.see spielman genzyme,cir corrada betances,cir.
in contrast,a district court faced with a factual challenge under rule b ordinarily must resolve disputed facts or,at least,choose among competing inferences from subsidiary facts.on appeal,such findings will be set aside only if clearly erroneous.herbert,at.even though the question of legal status that lies at the heart of a determination of a mixed question of law and fact,the same deferential standard of review endures.see hawes club ecuestre el comandante,cir reviewing such a determination for clear error see also in re extradition of howard,cir noting that appellate courts normally review mixed questions under the clearly erroneous standard.
of course,once the court has found the facts,its ultimate legal conclusion is subject to de novo review.see generally ornelas united states,d discussing appropriateness of de novo review in determining whether a set of facts,once established,satisfies a particular legal standard.thus,in hogar agua y vida en el desierto,cir,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on a rule b motion and found the facts.on appeal,however the facts,as found,were not contested,and thus,we used a de novo standard of review.see id.at since the only dispute on appeal concerns the legal sufficiency of undisputed jurisdictional facts,we review the rule b dismissal de novo.this aptly illustrates the shifting standards of review that sometimes operate within the confines of a single jurisdictional inquiry.
the proper standard of review in this case is straightforward.the lower court addressed a factual challenge under rule b a challenge that required it to find the facts,choose among conflicting inferences,and make credibility judgments.accordingly,we must accept the court findings and the conclusions drawn therefrom unless the whole of the record leaves us with a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.cumpiano banco santander,cir explicating nature of clearly erroneous standard.we then must determine whether the facts,as supportably found,justify the court ultimate legal conclusion as we explain below,the district court decision easily survives scrutiny under these criteria.
in order to sustain diversity jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case,the plaintiff had to demonstrate,inter alia,that she was a citizen of florida.see a see also toste farm hadbury,cir explaining that the party invoking diversity jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating complete diversity.for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,citizenship usually is equated with domicile,cir.a person domicile is the place where he has his true,fixed home and principal establishment,and to which,whenever he is absent,he has the intention of returning.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.domicile requires both physical presence in a place and the intent to make that place one home.id.it follows logically that in order to change domiciles,a person must move to a new state in which she intends to remain indefinitely.hawes,at.
in this instance,the court below relied chiefly on the facts catalogued in the plaintiff deposition to find that she had not become a florida domiciliary on or before december.since a party former domicile persists until a new one is acquired,the district court reasoned that the plaintiff was a citizen of puerto rico on the critical date and that,therefore,complete diversity was absent.valentín,slip op.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court weighted heavily the undisputed fact that the plaintiff did not quit her job at mmc until some time in id.at.the court also emphasized that the plaintiff left the bulk of her belongings at her residence in mayagüez when she journeyed to florida,that she kept a car registered there,and that she maintained a puerto rico bank account until some time in.id.at.
the plaintiff complains bitterly that she offered explanations for these facts and asserts that there was other evidence that pointed to the opposite conclusion.that is true as far as it it does not take the plaintiff very far.the lower court gave meticulous consideration to the plaintiff explanations,but found them wanting,supra note.the court paid similar heed to the evidence favorable to the plaintiff position the plaintiff had obtained a florida driver license on may,at about the same time,she had received a charge card from a florida bank and had applied for a few nursing jobs in florida although she was not authorized to practice there she took the examination for a florida nursing lic
