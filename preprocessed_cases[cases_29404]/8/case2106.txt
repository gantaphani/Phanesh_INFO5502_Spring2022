in this case we must apply bedrock principles of federalism,embodied in the younger abstention doctrine.younger harris,d.we are asked to determine whether a federal court was empowered to enjoin ongoing state administrative proceedings brought by the new york state department of labor dol against a contractor,diamond d construction corporation diamond d.more precisely,we must inquire whether the manner in which the dol investigation and administrative proceedings were conducted,coupled with the precarious financial position inflicted upon diamond d,created sufficient circumstances to trigger either or both of the established exceptions to the younger abstention doctrine.because we hold that the dol conduct and its effects on diamond d are not encompassed by either exception,we conclude that the district court was required by younger to abstain from taking jurisdiction over this claim for injunctive relief therefore,we vacate the preliminary injunction and remand this case to the district court.

diamond d is a contractor that derives significant revenue from public contracts for road construction.recently,diamond d has served as the general contractor for several road construction projects in western new york,including the three projects at issue here.the new york state department of transportation dot was the sponsoring agency for two of these projects.the third was sponsored by the erie county department of public works.
the dol investigation 
in june,two diamond d employees sent written complaints to the dol alleging underpayment of wages by diamond eight months after receiving the complaints,the dol assigned ronald kinn to investigate the allegations.kinn requested payroll records from diamond d for the three public works contracts called into question.diamond d initially refused to comply with kinn request.kinn therefore conducted his wage investigation using other available evidence.
from the dot and erie county,kinn obtained most but not all of the certified diamond d payroll records that it was required to submit for review pursuant to its contracts with the sponsoring agencies.however,kinn apparently placed greater reliance on records kept by the engineers and inspectors employed by the sponsoring agencies.these latter records generally included a count of the number of workers and pieces of equipment,tracked the volume of materials used and charted the progress of the project.they did not include a detailed list of the number of hours worked by individual employees or the classification of the work performed.
according to one of the agency officials that kinn consulted,these records amount to little more than a handy way for the sponsoring agency to get a rough idea of the men,equipment and material on a job.nevertheless,kinn relied extensively on agency records,even when they apparently conflicted with the certified payrolls he had obtained from the sponsoring agencies and even though several officials expressly told him that the agency records could not be reliably used to determine accurately the number of hours worked by individual workers or the type of work performed.rounding out his investigation,kinn interviewed a few diamond d employees,including the complainants,and obtained a smattering of pay stubs and forms.kinn was rebuffed in his efforts to interview diamond d management.
kinn then set about estimating the amount of underpayments to diamond d workers.using the evidence he had gathered and drawing other inferences from his investigation,kinn claimed to have constructed estimates of the number of workers on each job site on each day,the number of hours worked by each worker and the classification of work performed by each worker.thus,kinn supposedly reconstructed,on a daily basis,the events that took place on each project.however,the district court found that kinn methods of estimation were not nearly so precise.
with regard to the number of workers,in addition to the people listed in the agency reports and the certified payrolls,kinn assumed that there was at least one operator for each piece of equipment present on a job site.he made this assumption even though the agency officials told him it was baseless,as a single worker could,and often did,operate more than one piece of equipment during the course of the day.if kinn was not able to identify who the supposed operator of the equipment was,he dubbed the worker unknown or unknown.thus,for one day,based on the equipment present at the job site,kinn concluded that there were six operators including two unknowns,even though the certified payroll indicated two operators and the agency report showed only one operator.
when it came to calculating the number of hours worked by each individual,kinn indulged in an even more sweeping assumption diamond d laborers generally worked at least ten hours each day.kinn employed this assumption even though it was directly contradicted by information in his possession.for instance,kinn presumed days for one employee when the daily entries in that employee own diary which was in kinn possession frequently listed less than ten hours.
finally,when it came to classifying the work performed by each employee,the district court found that kinn made no distinction between the work performed at the job site and work,such as manufacturing guardrails at the diamond d machine shop.kinn assumed every employee spent his entire work day at the job site,and thus was entitled to the higher prevailing wage for work.thus,if a certified payroll indicated that an employee worked less than ten hours,kinn rather than inquire whether the employee had done work simply assumed that the employee worked ten hours and had not been paid for the hours not indicated in the payroll.kinn employed this technique fully knowing that it was wrong.he testified that not only was he aware of the distinction,but also that diamond d employees worked a significant number of hours.
using these inscrutable methods,kinn eventually concluded that diamond d had grossly underpaid its workers,arriving at an estimated underpayment of almost across the three projects investigated.kinn then applied the statutory rate of interest,for periods of four or five years.the interest ran from the date the underpayments allegedly began rather than the dates each underpayment was made.the interest on the underpayments for all three projects totaled more than.kinn then applied the maximum civil penalty allowed under the prevailing wage law,of the underpayment plus interest.these civil penalties alone surpassed.thus,in october,as a result of kinn investigation and underpayment estimates,the dol issued withholding notices on the three projects in the aggregate amount of more than million.kinn then sent his files to the dol for review and for diamond d administrative hearing.
the federal court action 
the entry of the withholding notices forced diamond d into an untenable financial position.it was faced,on one hand,with a cash crisis created by the notices of withholding that were tying up million,and on the other,by its inability to obtain new work because its insurer would not bond future projects until those withholding notices were resolved.to stave off insolvency,diamond d urgently needed administrative review of kinn investigation.however,several months passed and the dol had not yet moved to begin the administrative hearings to which diamond d was entitled.
faced with narrowing options,in april,diamond d filed the instant action in the united states district court for the western district of new york curtin.diamond d lawsuit alleged that the dol investigation and subsequent refusal to schedule hearings violated its due process rights.diamond d sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin any dol administrative proceedings and to require the dol to withdraw the notices of withholding.diamond d also sought money damages pursuant to against the state official defendants in their individual capacities only after this lawsuit was filed did the dol finally issue a notice of hearing to diamond d,but even then,the dol scheduled just three days of near enough time for the comprehensive challenge diamond d wished to mount against kinn estimates.
the district court initially denied diamond d request for injunctive relief,finding that the younger abstention doctrine precluded the court from enjoining the state administrative proceedings and the eleventh amendment would likely bar the release of the withheld funds.diamond d i,d at.the district court recognized that,in light of its ruling on younger abstention,the only relief that the court might prudently award would be an order directing the dol to hold its hearings without any further delay.id.at.additionally,the district court found it curious that plaintiff never petitioned the appropriate state court to issue a writ of mandamus that would have directed the dol to hold its hearing without any further delay.id.
diamond d moved for reconsideration of the district court ruling,and the court reversed itself in part by scheduling evidentiary hearings to resolve whether the dol acted in bad faith and the dol investigation and proceedings violated diamond d substantive due process rights.diamond d ii,d at.in its decision,the district court noted that settlement discussions had consumed the first three days of the dol administrative hearings and that the next hearing day was scheduled for august.id.at.against this background,the district court found that the extent of progress at the dol hearings will be relevant to this court inquiry into whether the dol has violated diamond d constitutional right to procedural and substantive due process.id.the district court further suggested that diamond d might be able to overcome the eleventh amendment jurisdictional bar under the authority of associates of surrogates and supreme court reporters new york,cir.diamond d ii,d at.the court,however,continued to express puzzlement over diamond d failure to seek a writ of mandamus in state court.id.at.
while the district court heard evidence on diamond d preliminary injunction request,the dol administrative hearings continued.by the time the district court issued its final decision on january,the dol had held thirty days of hearings and had scheduled more.
after completing its evidentiary hearings,the district court granted diamond d motion for a preliminary injunction.it held that while all the conditions for applying younger abstention were met,the dol investigation was so arbitrary,and its impact on diamond d so severe,that both of the established exceptions to the younger doctrine bad faith and extraordinary circumstances were satisfied in this case.diamond d iii,d at.the district court failed,however,to address eleventh amendment immunity.having found that retaining federal jurisdiction was appropriate,the court concluded that diamond d would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction and had also established a likelihood of success on the merits of its substantive due process claim.id.at.the district court thus enjoined the dol ongoing administrative proceedings and ordered the dol to withdraw all the notices of withholding.id.the dol now appeals from that order.
discussion 
we hold that the district court erred in its conclusions that the bad faith and the exceptional circumstances exceptions to the younger doctrine of mandatory abstention were satisfied in this case.
because we find that younger abstention is mandated in this case,we need not address the district court factual findings.however,assuming the district court characterization of the dol investigation,diamond d financial condition,and the pace of the dol administrative proceedings is accurate,we conclude that these circumstances do not come within either of the tightly defined exceptions to the younger abstention doctrine.
standard of review
