christine hines originally brought this action in massachusetts state court against the state room,where she formerly was employed in the amended complaint,which was before the district court following removal,hines and her coplaintiffs sought unpaid overtime wages that they claimed were due under the fair labor standards act flsa,and related state statutes.in addition to the state room,longwood events,belle mer,and james apteker were named as defendants.after various further amendments,including the addition of counterclaims,and following discovery,the defendants sought summary judgment on the wage claims.the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs were exempt from the overtime requirement because they were administrative employees under the flsa,a.the plaintiffs countered that their work did not involve sufficient discretion to satisfy the exemption.the district court determined that the duties of the employees did involve substantial discretion and,under our precedent,the exemption was applicable accordingly,partial summary judgment was entered for the defendants.the plaintiffs now appeal.they continue to contend that their employers have failed to demonstrate that they acted with any meaningful discretion and,therefore,to carry the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the exemption.because the district court correctly applied governing legal principles,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
the state room and belle mer are affiliated banquet facilities that host wedding receptions and other social functions in boston,massachusetts,and newport,rhode island,respectively.at.individual defendant james apteker is the founder and president of the state room and belle mer.longwood events is an affiliated management company that provides accounting and services for the banquet facilities.according to the complaint,longwood is the corporate parent for the state room and belle mer,and the companies share common management.
the plaintiffs are former sales at one or both of the defendant facilities hines was employed from to at the state room mary,at belle mer from to and jessica leporacci,at belle mer for several months in,then at the state room through.as sales managers,the plaintiffs were the primary client contacts on behalf of the event venues.principally,their role was to secure event business for the company,either by use of a list kept by management or in response to inquiries by potential clients.when given a list,the plaintiffs would assess which calls were likely to generate business and would not make calls they determined would be unproductive.see at dep.explaining that,after researching a list of law firms to cold call,she would not contact a firm of three attorneys to offer to host a holiday party and agreeing that the research she did would help her determine whether to call or not.as part of their regular tasks,plaintiffs spoke by phone and in person with potential clients they toured the facility with potential clients to sell events and they assisted clients in determining which venue and time might be appropriate for an event and what minimum charges would apply.the goal behind this work was to commit a prospective client to a contract for an event.in addition to the efforts with individual clients and prospective clients,the plaintiffs engaged in broader sales efforts.for example,testified that she marketed belle mer by attending chamber of commerce or convention and visitors bureau events as the company representative,again with the goal of bring ing events to belle mer.id.dep.to bring in business from within her assigned nonprofit sector,hines suggested to her supervisor that she could develop a lunch presentation on how to plan a gala fundraiser for a non profit as a marketing tool.at email from hines to a supervisor.
for the majority of the plaintiffs tenure with the defendant facilities,their duties extended beyond securing the basic sale and event contracts.they were required to work with clients to design details and menus that would meet each client expectations they prepared internal order forms that explained every detail of the event for the operations staff and from time to time,they attended events to ensure that the client wishes were carried out.as stated in her deposition,soup to nuts is what i was doing back then.you did have any events managers.you ran the whole thing.at dep.id.at dep.confirming that her duties included c oordinat ing the setup,design,and execution of the wedding see also at leporacci dep.describing her work as an events manager as including organizing tastings,menu selection,linen selection,design of the space,and everything else that goes into planning an event at hines dep.answering affirmatively when asked if she work ed closely with nonprofit board committees in researching,designing and executing events.the plaintiffs were responsible for maintaining a relationship with clients and satisfying client needs in the course of their event planning with the defendant venues.see contemporaneous email from supervisor to sales and events management staff stating,i t is your responsibility to proactively manage client expectations and obligations.you are accountable for the life of this client while they book,and then plan and execute their event with us.at hines dep.agreeing that her job was to keep the client happy from the initial contact through the actual event.
indeed,the picture that emerges from the record is one in which the primary role of sales managers was to secure a steady stream of business by selling each prospective client on a package of options location,timing,atmosphere,design,food and the like,all within the client budget and by ensuring that each event so planned was a success.see at dep.explaining the process of creating an event within a client budget id.dep.t his is a event,let make it the most incredible thing you will ever have in your life.even if you have a small budget,let still make it the most breathtaking thing that could ever happen to you,and how that is going to happen is customer service.you have got to believe in me.in so doing,the sales managers secured clients one at a time,but also worked to maintain and enhance the reputation of their venues as a desirable location for custom,events for private and nonprofit clients.see at hines dep.confirming that her tasks included develop ing relationships with clients and encourag ing repeat business see also at longwood events sales handbook instructing sales staff to c apitalize on opportunities immediately while clients have positive feelings about their event 
the record also establishes some things that the plaintiffs did not do in the course of their daily work.specifically,the plaintiffs had virtually no authority to make any financial decisions.when working with a potential client to secure an event contract,the sales managers were bound by price schedules controlled by management that dictated minimum charges for particular rooms based on the times and dates of the event.at dep.noting that the prices and minimums do change and that t here is no wavering unless you want to marry in the winter.beyond the event minimum,each option a client might select for a particular event carried a price already fixed by management,the sum of which defined the total cost for the entire event,and sales managers were not permitted to deviate or discount in any way without management approval.see,at longwood events sales handbook do not provide discounts or lower food and beverage minimums without sales director approval.id.at a ny discounts are with a sales director approval only.further,although they signed final event contracts as representatives of the defendant businesses,they were permitted to do so only when management had approved the terms.at gullins aff.indeed,they were prohibited expressly from creating any financial obligations for the businesses without management approval.at emails from supervisor forbidding the staff from creating obligation s for the company without prior approval see also at gullins aff.they did not generate the form contracts or intake forms that they used to structure their interactions with clients and to forward client information to management.id.at.they were not supervisors and had no direct authority over any other staff.id.they were not for their respective businesses.see id.at.
the plaintiffs were guided by the longwood events sales handbook,which presents t he longwood events way of selling.at.some of the instructions provided are specific and directive,such as do not hold dates beyond the day timeframe,or n ever match a deal from last year,id.at.equally often,however,the handbook instructions are generalized,strategic or aspirational.see id.at always take the customer perspective.anticipate what they would want and listen to what they are asking for.roll up your sleeves and do whatever it takes to ensure the customer has a great impression of longwood events and the venue,enlisting operations and kitchen where necessary.id.at always make a concerted effort to up sell id.make sure the menu fits the event.are we selling something requiring a knife and fork for an event which is intended to have a cocktail feel and light seating.in addition to the directions provided by the handbook,the defendant businesses provided a scripted response to one specific question that sales managers sometimes received regarding an affiliated venue,the development of which the defendants had abandoned.the vast majority of the plaintiffs work as sales managers,however,involved unscripted conversations with clients and potential clients.
hines earned a year in her role,second in the department only to the director of sales earned leporacci earned between and.although the plaintiffs claimed to have worked more than forty hours per week on a consistent basis indeed,the offer letters that they received expressly stated that they would work to hours per they did not receive overtime pay during their tenure as sales managers because the defendant businesses designated them as exempt employees for purposes of overtime laws.although they were required to for some portion of their tenure,they were not required to keep specific hours.
all of the plaintiffs had left the defendants employ by the time this action was commenced.when hines resigned in,she requested a severance,which was denied.apteker claims that,when hines was informed that severance was unavailable,he heard her mumble something that he understood to be a threat that she would go after the company and find a way to get the denied severance.at apteker dep.
district court proceedings 
after being granted leave by the massachusetts attorney general office,hines filed a class action complaint in the massachusetts state courts alleging violations of the massachusetts and federal overtime laws on behalf of herself and a putative class.she alleged that the state room improperly had classified her as an exempt employee in order to avoid its overtime obligations.the state room removed the action to the district court.
in an amended complaint filed in federal court,hines removed her class action allegations,added and leporacci as plaintiffs and added belle mer,longwood and as defendants.the amended complaint included seven claims under the flsa and related massachusetts and rhode island wage and hour laws.
in response,the defendants filed a state tort for abuse of process.they claimed that the overtime suit was in retaliation for the denial of hines requested severance.hines,in turn,that the abuse of process allegation was made in retaliation for filing the initial suit,relying on the provision in the flsa,a.
following discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the original wage claims.hines sought summary judgment on her retaliation claim.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and denied hines motion.the court set forth the relevant portion of the flsa and the regulations and noted that the central issue in the case was whether the plaintiffs had exercised sufficient discretion and independent judgment in their work to be classified properly as administrative employees exempt from the overtime requirement.the court acknowledged that the flsa places the burden on the employer to establish the applicability of the exemption and that the courts have required that the exemption be drawn narrowly against the employer.however,the court found this circuit decisions in cash cycle craft,cir,and reich john alden life insurance,cir,instructive and determined that they were strong support for the defendants position in the present case.the court concluded that,like the plaintiffs in cash and john alden,the plaintiffs here had a primary task of communicating with clients and assessing client needs.although a handbook guided these important interactions,it did not script them instead,the plaintiffs work required a significant measure of judgment in all of their daily interactions.the plaintiffs were the primary conduit between defendants and their clients,and their efforts constituted major assignments affecting a substantial portion of defendants business.at.further,although the options that the plaintiffs presented to clients for various services were by management,the plaintiffs determined for themselves how best to fit those options to the needs of each individual client.id.that plaintiffs supervisors had the authority to review and approve,noted the court,was not dispositive under the regulations.after reviewing the evidence,including the plaintiffs own descriptions of their work for the defendants on their personal resumes,which the opinion set forth in full,the court concluded that the employers had established that the plaintiffs fell properly within the administrative exception.
the court did acknowledge that,with respect to many of the factors identified in the regulations as relevant to the application of the administrative exemption,the plaintiffs had demonstrated questions of fact.the court,moreover,noted that the plaintiffs had produced evidence that weighed against determining that they were properly classified within the administrative exemption they did not shape indeed,they were required to follow management policies,and they did not negotiate or obligate financially the defendants.further,the district court concluded that,in its view,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,they did not have meaningful discretion regarding the selection of potential clients to approach.nevertheless,the court found that the evidence clearly demonstrated that the plaintiffs exercised discretion and independent judgment in determining how to assemble an event to suit each client taste.id.at.accordingly,summary judgment was entered for the defendants on the wage claims.
the district court further ruled that disputed issues of fact remained on the abuse of process claim against hines,and therefore denied summary judgment on that.the parties then jointly moved for entry of a separate judgment under rule b,which the district court entered upon concluding that the ruling on the wage claims was final and that there was no persuasive reason for delay proceedings on the counterclaims were stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.hunt golden rule ins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in the typical case,we will reverse a grant of summary judgment only if,making all factual inferences in favor of the party,a rational factfinder could resolve the legal issue for either side.d h therapy,llc boston mut.life ins,cir 
b.the flsa and the department of labor regulations 
the flsa of,as amended,establishes a federal minimum wage and restricts youth labor.see.in addition,the act requires overtime pay payment at the rate of one and of the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of a work week.id.a.the statute also sets forth various exemptions from the overtime requirement.relevant to the present case,the overtime requirement in does not apply to any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary.id.a.
pursuant to the statute express delegation of rulemaking authority,the secretary has issued detailed regulations,following procedures,defining each of the exemptions in.see generally part see also a providing authority john alden,at discussing the regulations.
the regulations in effect at the time of the plaintiffs employment provide a single for determining whether an employee qualifies for the administrative exemption 
a the term employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity in section a of the act shall mean any employee 
compensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than per week or per week,if employed in american samoa by employers other than the federal government,exclusive of board,lodging or other facilities 
whose primary duty is the performance of office or work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer customers and 
whose primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.
a.the sections that follow provide substantial further direction regarding the implementation of this standard test for the administrative exemption,and we shall address them in significant detail below as we analyze the application of the regulatory mandate to the case before us.
at the outset,we note that we are guided by a general interpretive principle.because of the remedial nature of the statute,the supreme court has emphasized that the exemptions should be narrowly construed and limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.arnold ben kanowsky,see also john alden,at quoting arnold.
the parties concede,and the record is clear,that the sales managers were compensated on a salary basis at a level in excess of the required per week.the parties also agree that the second prong,see a,which requires that the qualifying employee primary duty must be the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer customers,is met.the regulations further provide 
the phrase directly related to the management or general business operations refers to the type of work performed by the employee.to meet this requirement,an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business,as distinguished,for example,from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment.
we agree with the parties that the second prong is met.as our decisions in john alden,and cash,make clear,the work performed by hines,leporacci and properly is considered administrative.the principal business of the defendant employers is providing banquets.the sales aspect of the defendants businesses,although necessary to their success,is clearly ancillary to the principal function of actually providing the banquet services themselves.the plaintiffs own descriptions of their duties further make clear that they were focused on more than simple individual sales transactions.with respect to each individual transaction,the sales managers own testimony indicates that they did not simply close contracts.instead,they worked with each client to create a custom event in all of the particulars.further,they worked to establish relationships,to keep clients happy and to maintain the overall reputation of their employers.accordingly,the second prong of the administrative exemption is satisfied.
discretion regarding matters of significance 
the parties real dispute in this case concerns the third prong of the administrative exemption,whether the employees primary duty include d the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.a.the regulation itself provides substantial further guidance on this point 
a to qualify for the administrative exemption,an employee primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.in general,the exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct,and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.the term matters of significance refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.
b the phrase discretion and independent judgment must be applied in the light of all the facts involved in the particular employment situation in which the question arises.factors to consider when determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance include,but are not limited to whether the employee has authority to formulate,affect,interpret,or implement management policies or operating practices whether the employee carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business whether the employee performs work that affects business operations to a substantial degree,even if the employee assignments are related to operation of a particular segment of the business whether the employee has authority to commit the employer in matters that have significant financial impact whether the employee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and procedures without prior approval whether the employee has authority to negotiate and bind the company on significant matters whether the employee provides consultation or expert advice to management whether the employee is involved in planning long or business objectives whether the employee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of management and whether the employee represents the company in handling complaints,arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.
c the exercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that the employee has authority to make an independent choice,free from immediate direction or supervision.however,employees can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level.thus,the term discretion and independent judgment does not require that the decisions made by an employee have a finality that goes with unlimited authority and a complete absence of review.the decisions made as a result of the exercise of discretion and independent judgment may consist of recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of action.the fact that an employee decision may be subject to review and that upon occasion the decisions are revised or reversed after review does not mean that the employee is not exercising discretion and independent judgment 
e the exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of skill in applying techniques,procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources the exercise of discretion and independent judgment also does not include clerical or secretarial work,recording or tabulating data,or performing other mechanical,repetitive,recurrent or routine work 
the plaintiffs contend that they perform virtually none of the duties outlined as f actors to consider in subsection b,that they do not have authority to make an independent choice,free from immediate direction or supervision,id.c,and that their work,properly characterized,involved more skill than discretion,see id.e.in particular,the plaintiffs focus on their lack of any authority to make any decisions of financial consequence to their employers,their lack of supervisory authority and their lack of authority.
again,we begin with our own precedents in john alden and cash.in john alden,we evaluated a claim by marketing representatives who alleged that john alden insurance had misclassified them as exempt and denied overtime in violation of the flsa.the marketing representatives each worked with a list of independent field agents,not employed by john alden,who worked directly with end customers seeking insurance.those agents,in turn,would recommend a variety of insurance products to consumers,in
