petitioner jean belot appeals from the denial by the united states district court for the southern district of new york pauley,of his petition for writ of habeas corpus,seeking to set aside his new york state conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.the district court,following the recommendation of magistrate judge michael dolinger,found that the petition was two days late and thus dismissed it as.see belot burge.belot does not deny that his petition was late,but argues that the district court should have given him the benefit of equitable tolling.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
belot was indicted in the supreme court of new york for murder and criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees.the jury found him guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,and not guilty on the other counts.the court sentenced belot,as a persistent violent felony offender,to an indeterminate prison term of twenty years to life.
after belot was unsuccessful in his direct appeal,he filed a motion under new york criminal procedure law to vacate his judgment on march.that same day he executed his first petition under.on july,belot moved to withdraw the petition in order to exhaust remedies in the state courts.magistrate judge mark fox issued an order dismissing the petition without prejudice.see belot walker.in that order,judge fox provided a chronology of relevant dates and events to help belot calculate how many days remained before expiration of his limitation period under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.see d a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the order advised belot that t otal elapsed time is days,which means that petitioner has days in which to file his new petition following the exhaustion of state remedies.belot,at.belot replied by letter petitioner takes notice of the total elapsed time of days,which the court considerately totaled for the petitioner.petitioner is informed that he has days in which to file the petition once state remedies are exhausted.
after magistrate judge fox issued his order,belot application remained pending in state court,further tolling the limitation period for the filing of the federal petition.in a decision and order dated june,the county court of dutchess county denied the motion.the new york state supreme court,appellate division,second judicial department denied belot application for leave to appeal the denial on september.at that point,his limitation period began again to run.according to magistrate judge fox calculation,belot had until december,to file his petition.he filed his petition on january.when he filed his new petition,it was assigned to magistrate judge michael dolinger.magistrate judge dolinger disagreed with magistrate judge fox calculation.under magistrate judge dolinger calculation,belot had until december,to file his petition.thus under either calculation,belot petition was untimely.
belot does not dispute that his petition was untimely.he argues instead that he should be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling because the auburn correctional facility,where he was incarcerated at the time of his filing,was under a lockdown from december,to december,and as a result,he was denied access to the law library.he claims he was therefore unable to complete the final version of his petition.because he believed his petition was due by december,belot had requested and been granted special access to the prison law library for several days in december,permitting him to use the library for longer hours than otherwise would have been the case.as a result of the lockdown,however,belot alleges that his access to the library was very substantially diminished until december,believing that he would not be able to meet his december,deadline,belot wrote a letter to the pro se clerk of the district court on december,saying that his petition would be delayed due to the lockdown and asking for an extension.the court never acted on this request.as noted,he filed his petition on january.
magistrate judge dolinger rejected belot claim of entitlement to equitable tolling.see belot burge.the magistrate judge gave two grounds.first,lockdowns were sufficiently routine that they did not qualify as an extraordinary circumstance necessary to justify equitable tolling and second,notwithstanding the lockdown,belot could have filed an,id.at,and,in any event,knowing that he had approximately days from the conclusion of his collateral appeal to file his petition,belot should not have waited so long to work on his petition.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of the petition as,and the district court ruled accordingly.
discussion 
we have held that in rare and exceptional circumstances a petitioner may invoke the courts power to equitably toll the limitations period.doe menefee,cir quotation marks omitted.to qualify for such treatment,the petitioner must establish that extraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his petition on time,and that he acted with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll.id.quotation marks omitted.
a threshold question is what standard of review we should apply when reviewing a district court denial of equitable tolling as to a petition under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.in baldayaque united states,cir,we reviewed the district court finding of fact for clear error and applied de novo review to the district court analysis of a controlling legal question.id.at.that case,however,did not involve our circumstances,where the district court denied equitable tolling not as a matter of law,but as an exercise of its discretion.we decide this as a matter of first impression in our circuit.
other circuits are divided on the applicable standard of review for equitable tolling determinations under aedpa of questions other than findings of fact.some circuits have held that when the facts are undisputed,the district court decision on equitable tolling is reviewed de novo.see brinson vaughn,cir alito,noting but not holding that we are inclined to believe that where,as here,the relevant facts are not disputed,a district court decision on the question whether a case is sufficiently extraordinary to justify equitable tolling should be reviewed de novo.wade battle,cir we review de novo a district court decision on equitable tolling.dunlap united states,cir in this circuit,we hold that where the facts are undisputed or the district court rules as a matter of law that equitable tolling is unavailable,we apply the de novo standard of review to a district court refusal to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in all other cases,we apply the abuse of discretion standard.emphasis added miles prunty,cir w here,as here,the facts are undisputed as to the question of equitable tolling,we review de novo.
other circuits have held that the district court decision on equitable tolling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see cordle guarino,cir we review the district court decision regarding equitable tolling in this habeas case for abuse of discretion.burger scott,cir w e review the district court decision on equitable tolling of the limitation period for an abuse of discretion.several circuits,however,take a third approach and provide for de novo review when the district court denies equitable tolling as a matter of law,and abuse of discretion in other circumstances where the court decision is based on exercise of discretion.see rouse lee,cir w here the relevant facts are undisputed and the district court denied equitable tolling as a matter of law,we review the district court decision de novo.in all other circumstances,we review the denial of equitable tolling for an abuse of discretion.emphasis added united states saro,we have examined whether the court was correct,rather than whether it abused its discretion,because we employ de novo review when a district court the court appears to have done the facts can not justify equitable
