the plaintiffs are investors who were defrauded by lawyer david schick in the early as part of his ponzi scheme.many of schick victims have tried with varying degrees of success to recover some of their lost investments from schick estate in bankruptcy,see,in re venture mortgage fund,cir,and from various banks that allegedly either abetted or failed to detect schick activities,see,schmidt fleet bank,d.
this is the second time we have considered these investors claims against these defendants.the plaintiffs allege that the defendant banks assisted schick by failing to report his overdrafts on attorney fiduciary accounts to the state bar for disciplinary action and by evading their reporting duties by misleadingly marking some checks drawn against accounts with insufficient funds as refer to maker.the district court frederic block,judge previously dismissed the plaintiffs attempt to bring these allegations as a claim under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their claims.see lerner fleet bank,d.we affirmed the court dismissal of the rico claim because the plaintiffs had failed to plead sufficient facts to show proximate causation under the rico statute.see lerner fleet bank,lerner i,cir,cert.denied,d.but because we concluded that there was an adequate basis for diversity jurisdiction and supplemental jurisdiction over parties,we remanded with instructions for the court to decide the plaintiffs claims.
on remand,the district court again granted the defendants rule b motion to dismiss,concluding that because all of the plaintiffs claims include an allegation on the element of proximate causation,the dismissal of the plaintiffs rico claim for lack of proximate cause required that the claims be dismissed on the same grounds.we disagree.a plaintiff must make a different showing of proximate that is often more difficult to bringing suit under the rico statute than when bringing a cause of action.our finding of a failure of the allegations of proximate cause under rico does not,therefore,necessarily imply a similar finding for the plaintiffs claims.
we conclude that each plaintiff who actually had funds on deposit with the defendants fleet bank,fleet,sterling national bank and trust company of new york sterling,or republic national bank of new york republic has stated a claim against that bank or those banks for negligence and for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty under new york law.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed those claims.we affirm the district court dismissal of each of the plaintiffs claims against any such defendant in which the plaintiff did not have funds on deposit.we also affirm with one exception the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims for fraud and commercial bad faith.
background 
we outlined the substance of david schick fraudulent scheme in lerner i 
schick convinced investors that he had devised a scheme for generating a high return on their investments.schick would bid on distressed mortgage pools at auctions by the resolution trust company,the federal deposit insurance company fdic,and other banking institutions.upon being awarded the bid,he would immediately try to the mortgage pool to another buyer for a quick profit.the acceptance of his bid was subject to a due diligence period,so schick assured his investors that if he was unable to find a buyer within the time period,he would be able to rescind his original purchase without incurring any penalty.schick plan was apparently,he explained to the investors,in order to make this scheme work,schick had to prove to the fdic that he could complete the purchase.he would therefore be required to deposit substantial sums of cash as evidence of his good faith.this is where schick potential investors came in.
to convince wary investors that their money would be secure,schick agreed to deposit the entrusted funds in escrow accounts covered by restrictive provisions.lerner fleet bank,d.he also entered into escrow agreements with the investors that stated escrow agent are attorneys sic admitted to practice in the state of new york and shall act as fiduciary in accordance with the relevant provisions of the judiciary law and all other ethical or legal standards for attorneys admitted to practice in the state of new york and expressly agrees that the only person who shall be entitled to,or have any right or interest in the escrow deposit shall be the depositor.armed with these guarantees,and relying on the fact that schick was an attorney in good standing with the new york bar,the investors turned their money over to schick for deposit in the defendant banks.ultimately,however,these escrow agreements provided little protection against schick unscrupulous conduct.before the investors discovered his fraud,schick had raided the accounts repeatedly and managed to steal approximately million.
id.at brackets in original.
the plaintiffs based their rico claims primarily on the banks failure to report schick overdrafts on his attorney fiduciary accounts to the lawyers fund for client protection of the state of new york,as required by new york law.new york disciplinary code requires that a lawyer who is in possession of funds belonging to another person incident to the lawyer practice of law,shall maintain such funds in a banking institution within the state of new york which agrees to provide dishonored check reports to the lawyers fund.see regs.tit,b.each of the defendants had entered into one or more agreements with the lawyers fund,in which they agreed to report all checks drawn by attorneys on special,trust,escrow,or iola accounts that were dishonored for insufficient funds.see id.at.
the lawyers fund uses these reports of checks dishonored for insufficient funds,known colloquially as bounced checks,to initiate disciplinary proceedings against lawyers who mishandle client funds.a check on a client account that is dishonored for insufficient funds is often evidence that a lawyer has improperly commingled client funds,in violation of his or her fiduciary duties.see generally aba model rules for trust account overdraft notification,available at http last visited june.
in support of their rico claim,the plaintiffs alleged primarily that the banks engaged in a conspiracy to corrupt the lawyers fund.after we affirmed dismissal of that claim and remanded to the district court for its consideration of the plaintiffs claims,the court instructed the plaintiffs to submit an amended complaint that pared down their many claims.the plaintiffs second amended complaint replaced the portion of the original complaint addressing the causes of action.but the first pages of the earlier complaint,which described the factual background of the allegations,remained substantially unchanged.see oral arg.tr.of april,at t his was not an exercise in realleging the facts of the case.and if you compare the first amended complaint to the second amended complaint,you will see that the hundreds and hundreds of allegations of facts,that they all the same.we did redo that part of the complaint.all we did was cut down the claims.
our recitation of the remainder of the facts focuses on those allegations that are most relevant to the plaintiffs remaining claims.in stating the facts for purposes of considering this appeal,we take all of the plaintiffs allegations to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.pena deprisco,cir internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.the narrative that we are about to repeat therefore paints various defendants in decidedly unflattering colors,which may or may not be borne out by the facts.id.at quoting holtz rockefeller,cir.
according to the second amended complaint,although schick told his clients that the accounts were escrow deposits,he never executed escrow agreements with the banks.escrow accounts are classified as special deposits,which must be segregated from the bank other assets.instead,schick deposited their funds in attorney trust accounts and iola accounts,which are classified as general deposits that become part of the bank general assets.see peoples westchester sav.bank fdic,cir.although schick told the investors that the funds could not be withdrawn without their permission,schick had full access to the accounts and was free to withdraw from them without the clients knowledge or consent 
according to the second amended complaint,schick had a close business relationship with leonard patnoi,then the branch manager of fleet broad street branch.patnoi served as schick accounts officer at fleet from to.around or,patnoi was terminated as branch manager at fleet broad street branch,then rehired as branch manager at fleet hewlett branch and subsequently promoted to vice president of the bank.when patnoi moved to the hewlett branch,schick either transferred his existing accounts to the hewlett branch or opened new accounts there.patnoi again served as the fleet account officer of schick accounts.between and,deposits at the hewlett branch totaled approximately billion.schick was the single largest source of deposits at the hewlett branch,averaging million per month.the plaintiffs allege that in light of the enormous amount of business the bank was doing with schick,fleet was willing to bend the rules for him.
the plaintiffs further allege that beginning in,schick began writing checks on attorney fiduciary accounts at fleet that had insufficient funds to cover them.fleet would honor these checks despite the insufficient funds by extending automatic loans to cover the overdrafts.the bank allowed these overdrafts even though it knew that schick was under a duty as an not to commingle his clients funds.by allowing the overdrafts to continue,the plaintiffs allege,fleet intentionally and knowingly permitted schick to violate the implied and written agreements governing account documents and restrictions,knowing recklessly indifferent to the fact that such conduct was in violation of plaintiffs rights as intended beneficiaries under said contracts and would cause each of them injury.second am.compl.
sometime in,fleet district manager with responsibility for the hewlett branch confronted patnoi about the overdrafts.patnoi then told schick that fleet could no longer cover his overdrafts and that the bank would begin dishonoring schick checks drawn against insufficient funds.schick allegedly responded that if fleet bounced his checks,the bank would be required by law to report schick to the lawyers fund and that if schick were disbarred,schick could no longer bring business to the bank.fleet would then bear the loss associated with all of schick overdrafts.patnoi agreed not to report the bounced checks to the lawyers fund and to respond to any inquiries about them by vouching that there were balances in the accounts.patnoi also promised schick that the other employees at the hewlett branch would tell the same story.id.at.the plaintiffs allege that this plan was approved by officers at the highest levels of the bank.the plaintiffs do not,however,allege any specific instance of a bank officer actually telling such a story.
at some point in or,schick told patnoi that he was having trouble explaining the bounced checks to investors.patnoi met with his superiors,and they devised a plan to return the checks to the payees marked as refer to maker,without indicating that they were being returned for insufficient funds.the plaintiffs assert that fleet adopted this strategy with the intent of misleading those payees.one plaintiff,crestfield associates,received a refer to maker check on january,six weeks after it made its one and only investment with schick.
a similar pattern of behavior emerged involving schick and sterling.around march,according to the plaintiffs,schick began bouncing checks drawn on his accounts there.the plaintiffs allege that sterling,like fleet,with at least reckless disregard of the consequences to the plaintiffs and all other victims of schick scheme,intentionally failed and wrongfully omitted to report those bounced checks to the lawyers fund solely so as to protect sterling valuable business relationship with schick.id.at.
in,sterling began auditing schick accounts.sterling executive vice president leonard rudolph told schick that the bank was worried about the overdrafts and that it was required to report dishonored checks to the lawyers fund.according to the plaintiffs,schick told rudolph how fleet is handling the problem and suggested that sterling return problem checks to the payees marked refer to maker.id.at.at about this time,rudolph also advised schick to use an account entitled without any more descriptive words such as special,escrow,or trust in the title in order to avoid the lawyers fund reporting requirements.schick had subsequent meetings with other sterling executives in which they discussed schick business in depth and agreed to mark bounced checks as refer to maker and not to report the insufficient funds to the lawyers fund.
the second amended complaint further asserts that after learning that a check issued on a sterling account had been returned marked refer to maker,a representative of the regal trade,telephoned rudolph and asked him why the check had been returned.rudolph told the representative that there were back office problems,which had nothing to do with schick,but as a result of which the check was returned and he should call schick and arrange to get replacement checks.id.at.the regal representative asked rudolph directly whether there were sufficient funds in schick account to cover the check.rudolph confirmed that there were.
in late,schick began to do business with republic.in february,march,and april of,republic returned a series of checks drawn on schick fiduciary accounts for insufficient funds without reporting the transactions to the lawyers fund.republic also returned at least two checks marked refer to maker on a separate schick account.none of the plaintiffs had funds in this account or received one of these returned checks.
based on the foregoing facts,the plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged four claims fraud and aiding and abetting fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,and commercial bad faith.the district court granted the defendants rule b motion to dismiss these claims,reasoning that because the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to support a finding of proximate cause for their rico claim,they similarly failed to do so for their claims 
there is no principled distinction between the basis for dismissing the rico claims on grounds and the basis for similarly dismissing the state claims requiring proximate causation.the plaintiffs do not argue that they have established proximate causation rather,they contend that there is a causal connection between the defendants conduct and their injuries.a causal connection,however,only establishes that but for defendants actions the plaintiffs would not have been incurred their injuries by contrast,proximate causation requires an additional defendants actions were a substantial factor in plaintiff injuries and that those injuries were reasonably foreseeable to the defendants thus,even if plaintiffs could establish causation,that is not sufficient to establish proximate causation.

ii.rico proximate cause common law proximate cause 
rico provides a private right of action for a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter.c.in order to bring suit under c,a plaintiff must plead the defendant violation of,an injury to the plaintiff business or property,and causation of the injury by the defendant violation.commercial cleaning,colin serv,cir.rico use of the clause by reason of has been held to limit standing to those plaintiffs who allege that the asserted rico violation was the legal,or proximate,cause of their injury,as well as a logical,or but for,cause.id.
there is no little confusion in the case law about the meaning and proper use of the term proximate causation in the rico context when a plaintiff brings suit under with any suit on a statute he or she must show both that he or she is within the class the statute sought to protect and that the harm done was one that the statute was meant to prevent.abrahams young rubicam,cir,cert.denied,d see also anza ideal steel supply,d finding no proximate cause to support the plaintiff rico suit because t he cause of the plaintiff asserted harms is a set of actions offering lower prices entirely distinct from the alleged rico violation defrauding the state.when used in this context,the term proximate causation thus takes on a meaning that is different from its ordinary meaning at common law 
at common law,so long as the plaintiff category is foreseeable,there is no requirement that the risk of injury to the plaintiff,and the risk of the harm that actually occurred,were what made the defendant actions wrongful in the first place.with statutory claims,the issue is,instead,one of statutory intent was the plaintiff even though foreseeably injured in the category the statute meant to protect,and was the harm that occurred again,even if foreseeable,the mischief the statute sought to avoid.see gorris scott,ex.preamble of statute made clear that the mischief the statute sought to prevent was only disease and did not encompass the risk of losing sheep off the side of a ship.
abrahams,at footnote omitted.as we explained in abrahams,the use of no proximate cause language as the ground for dismissal in statutory cases frequently leads to confusion when the issue of proximate cause is raised in related common law claims because the phrase proximate cause may cover a greater or lesser swath of injuries and victims when used in the statutory context.id.at 
our conclusion in lerner i that the plaintiffs had not pleaded facts sufficient to support a finding of proximate cause in the rico action,therefore,does not necessarily mean that their injuries were,under the facts alleged,not proximately caused by the banks actions for purposes of the plaintiffs claims under the common law.in abrahams,for example,we concluded that the plaintiff could not bring a rico suit because he was neither an intended target of the scheme nor an intended beneficiary of the laws prohibiting it.abrahams,at.but we also concluded that the rico ruling is not dispositive of the plaintiffs negligence claim.id.at.t he duty to act with reasonable care establishes a general standard of conduct and is not limited to protecting certain classes of person from particular kinds of harms.id.at 
even when stemming from the same fact pattern,then,proximate causation may be present or absent depending on the cause of action under which the plaintiff brings suit in lerner i,we concluded that the plaintiffs injuries were not proximately caused by the defendants racketeering activity,not that their injuries were not proximately caused by the defendants conduct.indeed,we have subsequently interpreted our decision in lerner i to stand for the proposition that a plaintiff does not have standing if he suffered an injury that was indirectly and hence not proximately caused by the racketeering activity or rico predicate acts,even though the injury was proximately caused by some violations committed by the defendants.baisch gallina,cir emphasis added.rico and claims will often depend on different chains of causation stemming from the same underlying conduct.accordingly,even though we concluded in lerner i that there was no proximate causal connection between the plaintiffs injuries and rico violations under the facts as alleged,the district court erred in failing to determine whether the plaintiffs had nonetheless alleged a proximate causal connection between the plaintiffs injuries and the defendants tortious conduct.
the district court error is understandable in light of the plaintiffs failure to revise the bulk of their complaint on remand or to display alternate theories of causation with any prominence.the plaintiffs instead emphasized before the district court the same theory of causation that they had previously argued in support of their rico claim that the plaintiffs losses resulted from the banks conspiracy to corrupt the lawyers fund.it is not altogether impossible that the same chain of causation may,in some circumstances,fail to establish proximate cause under rico and still support proximate cause for a claim.see moore,at calabresi,concurring i t is usually easier for intervenors to break the chain of causation in rico than it is at common law.but this particular theory of liability,whether marshaled in support of a rico claim or a negligence claim,rests on assumptions that are inherently speculative,lerner i,at.see,part,below finding this theory insufficient to establish proximate cause for negligence claim against banks in which plaintiffs funds were not deposited laborers local,at concluding that,under both rico and fraud,plaintiffs injuries were too indirect because the defendant allegedly harmed a third party,not the plaintiff bringing the instant suit.
the plaintiffs have lately come to the view that they were mistaken in focusing on the alleged conspiracy to corrupt the lawyers fund in pursuing their claims.see oral arg.tr.of april,at if you want to tell me that it could have been argued better or it should have emphasis should have been on the l awyers f und,given the nature of the case and the second circuit ruling in the prior know,if i have to,i say sure,okay.but we disagree with the defendants assertion that the plaintiffs have waived all alternative theories of causation.the complaint separately alleges other such theories for each of the four claims.see second am.compl.
we now consider each of the plaintiffs theories as to each claim in turn.
iii.negligence 
to establish a prima facie case of negligence under new york law,a plaintiff must demonstrate a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff,a breach thereof,and injury proximately resulting therefrom.solomon ex rel.solomon city of new york,see also king crossland sav.bank,cir.
joint and several liability to all plaintiffs 
each plaintiff appears to assert a negligence claim against each defendant bank,whether or not schick ever deposited that particular plaintiff funds with that particular bank.we do not think any of the plaintiffs has stated a claim for negligence against banks in which their funds were not deposited.
as a general matter,b anks do not owe a duty to protect them from the intentional torts of their customers.in re terrorist attacks on,d,see also renner chase manhattan bank renner i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,century bus.credit fork bank,dep t t o hold that banks owe a duty to their depositors creditors to monitor the depositors financial activities so as to assure the creditors collection of the depositors debts would be to unreasonably expand banks orbit of duty.as a new york trial court concluded in another case,a bank has no duty to customers of other banks.with billions of banking transactions occurring in new york alone,this would be the equivalent of making new york banks liable to the world banking public.eschel fleet bank,index,slip op.at footnote omitted.
even if the banks did owe them a duty of care,the plaintiffs allegations could not establish proximate cause with respect to banks that did not hold their funds.the plaintiffs argue that if any of the banks had reported schick misappropriation of funds,the bar disciplinary committee would have intervened sooner and prevented schick from defrauding his future clients.but as discussed in part ii,above,we think that,whether alleged as a rico claim or not,the banks failure to report schick overdrafts is too far removed from the damages schick subsequently caused to persons who never deposited funds with the bank and who participated in future transactions to which the bank was not a party.to find proximate causation in this context would,in effect,require a bank that failed to report an attorney overdrafts on a fiduciary account to be an insurer for any damages that lawyer subsequently causes to any of his or her future clients.by the plaintiffs reasoning,the banks could also be liable for any hypothetical malpractice action against schick based on poor performance at trial or bad legal advice in unrelated cases.liability for negligence does not extend that far.life is too short to pursue every human act to its most remote consequences for want of a nail,a kingdom was lost is a commentary on fate,not the statement of a major cause of action against a blacksmith.holmes sec.investor prot,d scalia,concurring in judgment.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the second amended complaint to the extent that the plaintiffs seek to recover from banks in which their funds were never deposited on a theory of negligence.
each bank liability to plaintiffs with funds deposited at that bank 
several plaintiffs also allege that schick deposited their funds in fiduciary accounts with one or more of the three defendant banks.the analysis of negligence in these circumstances is different.
as a general matter,a depositary bank has no duty to monitor fiduciary accounts maintained at its branches in order to safeguard funds in those accounts from fiduciary misappropriation.norwest mortgage,dime sav.bank of,dep t see also grace ex rel.fox corn exch.bank trust.the bank has the right to presume that the fiduciary will apply the funds to their proper purposes under the trust.bischoff ex rel.schneider yorkville bank,see also clarke pub.bank trust of.as noted,we have held that this general principle applies to attorney trust and iola accounts.see peoples westchester sav.bank,at in maintaining an iola account,the lawyer,not the bank,is charged with a fiduciary duty to the client.
nevertheless,a bank may be liable for participation in such a diversion,either by itself acquiring a benefit,or by notice or knowledge that a diversion is intended or being executed.in re knox.adequate notice may come from circumstances which reasonably support the sole inference that a misappropriation is intended,as well as directly.bischoff,at,at.having such knowledge,the bank is under the duty to make reasonable inquiry and endeavor to prevent a diversion.id.at,at see also norwest mortgage,at,at facts sufficient to cause a reasonably prudent person to suspect that trust funds are being misappropriated will trigger such a duty of inquiry on the part of a depositary bank,and the bank failure to conduct a reasonable inquiry when the obligation arises will result in the bank being charged with such knowledge as inquiry would have disclosed.although s mall overdrafts are generally insufficient to trigger a duty of inquiry,see also grace,at,at,the bank duty may be triggered by chronic insufficiency of funds,norwest mortgage,at,at see also chase manhattan bank,dep t stating that evidence of overdrafts against these accounts,or of any other suspicious activity in such accounts,would have put chase on notice of possible impropriety.
although they invoke this line of cases generally,the plaintiffs rely primarily on home savings of america,fsb amoros,dep t.there,the first department concluded that t here is,at the very least,a factual issue as to whether the chronic and extremely serious insufficiency of funds in the mortgage trust account in early october,combined with the contemporaneous and roughly commensurate sapping of that account into other of the bank accounts plainly being utilized by the account fiduciary for nontrust purposes was sufficient to place the bank on notice of the misappropriation.id.at,at.a mong the various indicia of fiduciary misappropriation,surely account insufficiency must rank very highly,revealing as it does a telling disparity between entrusted funds and fiduciary expenditures which,in turn,may be,and often is,indicative of trust withdrawals for nontrust purposes.id.at,at.
the home savings court also emphasized that a bank duty to report bounced checks on iola accounts reflects the fact that overdrafts are particularly probative in signaling misappropriation 
disciplinary counsel nationwide know from experience that a bounced check on a lawyer trust account is an obvious signal that law clients money may be in jeopardy alter,outside counsel,coming the dishonored check notice rule,nylj,at,col,at,col.indeed,it is precisely because trust account insufficiency is considered such a reliable sign of fiduciary misappropriation that depositary banks maintaining attorney trust accounts must make a dishonored check report to the lawyers fund for client protection whenever a properly payable instrument is presented against an attorney special,trust or escrow account which contains insufficient available funds,and the banking institution dishonors the instrument for that reason nycrr c.
at.the first department concluded that,a lthough we are not of the view that the bank evident default in the performance of its regulatory obligation to make a report of check dishonor suffices to establish its liability for the loss occasioned by the defrauder misappropriation,we do think such default may be adduced as some evidence of the bank negligence.id.at,at.
fleet and republic argue that schick relevant accounts at their banks were not properly designated as attorney fiduciary they were labeled simply attorney at law and that the banks therefore had no duty to investigate under home savings.but according to the plaintiffs complaint,whether or not the accounts were titled iola accounts,the banks had actual knowledge that the accounts were intended to be trust accounts for client funds.for purposes of this rule b motion,of course,we assume that allegation to be true.eschel fleet bank,index,slip.op.at declaring,in another case,that i n the complaint,plaintiffs conclusorily allege deposits into de facto attorney escrow accounts eventually,plaintiffs must establish that their funds were deposited in such accounts.however,at the pleading stage,all that is necessary is that defendants have notice of plaintiffs claim.they do.
sterling concedes that its accounts were labeled as iola accounts,but instead argues that under new york judiciary law,it was required to report only those overdrafts that were dishonored due to insufficient funds and that,under new york law,if the bank chooses to honor the overdraft,it need not report the attorney overdraft to the lawyers fund.sterling notes that the aba model new york that financial institutions report all overdrafts,see model rules for client protection american bar association center for professional responsibility model rules for trust account overdraft notification.sterling therefore argues that new york notification law represents a considered policy choice to depart from a stricter reporting requirement suggested by the aba.but whether or not sterling violated new york judiciary law by failing to report the overdrafts that it honored,still,the fact that schick was overdrawing his fiduciary accounts constituted strong evidence that he was,at the very least,mishandling his clients funds the fact that a tortfeasor complies with relevant laws and regulations does not insulate it from liability if it fails to act objectively reasonably.see restatement second of torts compliance with a legislative enactment or an administrative regulation does not prevent a finding of negligence where a reasonable man would take additional precautions.tufariello long island,cir citing section in the context of negligence under the federal employers liability act charter oak fire ins.wholesale liquidators,d,citing section royal ins.of am,same.
once schick began repeatedly to overdraw on his attorney trust accounts at a defendant bank,that bank had a duty under home savings to make reasonable inquiries and to safeguard attorney trust funds from schick misappropriation.the court in home savings noted that a breach of duty had been properly alleged when not one but checks in very substantial amounts were dishonored in a context of account insufficiency.home savings,at,at.the scale and scope of schick pattern of dishonored checks easily exceeds those in home savings.
home savings also makes clear that the banks alleged breaches of their duty to investigate and,if necessary,safeguard the funds in its trust account,would qualify as a proximate cause of the clients losses.see id.t here can be little doubt in light of the results of the audit in question or the bank own internal investigation performed during the following month,that a reasonable investigation by the bank initiated at an earlier date would have uncovered the embezzlement.
republic argues that plaintiffs who deposited funds in republic accounts can not show causation because schick did not begin overdrawing on those accounts until early,and,therefore,even if the banks had reported those checks dishonored for insufficient funds to the lawyers fund,schick would still not have been disciplined before his scheme collapsed in april.but whether or not the disciplinary authorities would have disbarred schick in time to protect the clients funds,republic could have acted immediately to protect the funds as soon as it discovered schick misappropriation.by ignoring evidence of schick misconduct and allowing him to continue to use republic accounts,republic allegedly allowed itself to become a conduit for schick activities.like the defendant held liable in bischoff,by supinely paying,under the facts here,the subsequent checks of the trustee,it became privy to the misapplication.bischoff,at,at see also grace,at,at by ignoring these facts and their necessary implications,the bank became a guilty participant in the trustee embezzlement of trust funds deposited in the trust account in the bank and from that date it became liable as a joint wrongdoer for all moneys which the trustee embezzled.bassman blackstone,index,slip op.at concluding,in another action,that m uch like the court in home savings,this court is constrained to find that at the very least these fact s sufficiently plead a cause of action for negligence.
accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court to the extent that it dismissed the plaintiffs claims for negligence against a defendant bank in which his,her,or its funds were deposited.
federal rule of civil procedure b sets forth a heightened pleading standard for allegations of fraud in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.we have explained that in order to comply with rule b,the complaint must specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent,identify the speaker,state where and when the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.mills polar molecular,cir.

fraudulent misrepresentation 
under new york law,t o state a cause of action for fraud,a plaintiff must allege a representation of material fact,the falsity of the representation,knowledge by the party making the representation that it was false when made,justifiable reliance by the plaintiff and resulting injury.kaufman cohen,dep t 
only one plaintiff,regal trade,has alleged an affirmative representation that it relied upon to its detriment.according to the complaint 
u pon receipt of the notice of dishonor from holm drath bank,accompanying the return of schick checks unpaid,marked refer to maker,as aforesaid,mark karasick regal trade representative,telephoned sterling main office in new york,from new jersey,spoke with rudolph,and asked why schick checks were returned.rudolph falsely and fraudulently responded that there were back office problems,which had nothing to do with schick,but as a result of which the check was returned and he should call schick and arrange to get replacement checks.karasick directly asked rudolph on that occasion whether there were sufficient funds to cover the returned check,to which rudolph falsely and fraudulently affirmatively responded that there were sufficient funds to deposit.
second am.compl.the complaint further states that in reliance on the defendant fraudulent misrepresentations,regal trade continued to entrust its funds to schick.id.at.these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for fraud by regal against sterling.
none of the other plaintiffs,however,points to any misrepresentation from a defendant bank on which it relied.besides regal trade phone call to sterling,the only other possible misrepresentations alleged in the second amended complaint are the refer to maker stamps placed on schick dishonored checks.only one of the that it received a refer to maker check.but crestfield can not show any reliance on this statement because it had already made its one and only investment with schick six weeks earlier.
with the exception of regal trade claim against sterling,therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed the plaintiffs claims for fraud.
fraudulent concealment 
i nstead of an affirmative misrepresentation,a fraud cause of action may be predicated on acts of concealment where the defendant had a duty to disclose material information.kaufman,at,at.we have explained that d uring the course of negotiations surrounding a business transaction,a duty to disclose may arise in two situations first,where the parties enjoy a fiduciary relationship,and second,where one party possesses superior knowledge,not readily available to the other,and knows that the other is acting on the basis of mistaken knowledge.aaron ferer sons chase manhattan bank,cir citations omitted.as several district courts have suggested,such a duty usually arises in the context of business negotiations where parties are entering a contract.ray larsen assocs.nikko,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,see also ryan hunton williams,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,renner chase manhattan bank renner ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at june,williams bank leumi trust,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.
even if the withholding of information could constitute fraudulent concealment in the absence of business negotiations,the plaintiffs would still be required to show that they relied on the banks fraudulent failure to disclose.no plaintiff has alleged any such reliance.instead,they claim reliance on i the fact that schick was an attorney admitted to the practice of law in the state of new york in good standing,and ii the integrity of the new york state attorney disciplinary system.second am.compl.none of them alleges that he or she contacted the appellate division to determine whether there had been previous disciplinary actions taken against schick.in the absence of an allegation that the plaintiffs actually relied on the banks omissions,they have not stated a claim for fraudulent concealment.
aiding and abetting fraud 
to establish liability for aiding and abetting fraud,the plaintiffs must show the existence of a fraud the defendant knowledge of the fraud and that the defendant provided substantial assistance to advance the fraud commission.jp morgan chase bank winnick,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also franco english,dep t requiring nexus between the primary fraud,defendant knowledge of the fraud and what it did with the intention of advancing the fraud commission.

although the plaintiffs conclusorily allege that the banks had actual knowledge,we think that they failed to plead facts with the requisite particularity to support that claim.the plaintiffs allege in detail that the banks knew that schick engaged in improper conduct that would warrant discipline by the appellate division,but those alleged facts do not give rise to the strong inference,required by federal rule of civil procedure b,of actual knowledge of his outright looting of client funds.see,ryan,wl,at,dist.lexis,at allegations that chemical suspected fraudulent activity do not raise an inference of actual knowledge of wolas fraud.renner ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at stating that although bank had previously rejected the transactions on the basis that they were potential vehicles for fraud,there is no factual basis for the assertion that chase officials actually knew that the fraud was,in fact,occurring.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed the plaintiffs claims for aiding and abetting fraud.
iv.commercial bad faith 
the new york court of appeals fashioned the doctrine of commercial bad faith as an exception to the general rule that a bank is absolved of liability for a check made out to a fictitious payee when the maker knows that the payee is fictitious.see law.the doctrine provides that a bank may be held liable if it in fact knows of the fraud and participates in it.see,citibank,getty petroleum am.exp.travel related servs.we have considerable doubt whether the doctrine has any applicability to these plaintiffs claims,which do not allege fraud in the making and cashing of checks.peck chase manhattan bank,dep t.
even if a claim for commercial bad faith were available in this context,however,the plaintiffs claims would fail for the same reason as do their claims for aiding and abetting fraud.claims of commercial bad faith,like claims of fraud,are governed by the heightened pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.see wight bankamerica,cir.a claim of commercial bad faith requires that the bank have actual knowledge of facts and circumstances that amount to bad faith,thus itself becoming a participant in a fraudulent scheme,at,at,at.a transferee lapse of wary vigilance,disregard of suspicious circumstances which might have well induced a prudent banker to investigate and other permutations of negligence are not relevant considerations.getty petroleum,at,at,at.because the plaintiffs fail to plead facts giving rise to the strong inference of actual knowledge of fraud required by federal rule of civil procedure b,we affirm the district court dismissal of their claim for commercial bad faith.nigerian petroleum citibank,wl,at,dist.lexis,july,citing getty and granting rule b motion to dismiss claim of commercial bad faith for failure to plead adequately defendant actual knowledge of fraud.
aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty 
as already noted,a bank generally has no duty to monitor fiduciary accounts maintained at its branches in order to safeguard funds in those accounts from fiduciary misappropriation.norwest mortgage,at,at.some of the plaintiffs here have nonetheless stated claims against some of the defendant banks for aiding and abetting schick breach of fiduciary duty.
a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty requires a breach by a fiduciary of obligations to another,that the defendant knowingly induced or participated in the breach,and that plaintiff suffered damage as a result of the breach.kaufman,at,at accord in re sharp int l,cir see also wechsler bowman,any one who knowingly participates with a fiduciary in a breach of trust is liable for the full amount of the damage caused thereby to the cestuis que trust.with respect to the second requirement,a lthough a plaintiff is not required to allege that the aider and abettor had an intent to harm,there must be an allegation that such defendant had actual knowledge of the breach of duty.kaufman,at,at.and a person knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty only when he or she provides substantial assistance to the primary violator.id.at,at.
the complaint alleges that each defendant had actual knowledge that schick and his law firms violated their fiduciary duties to some or all of the plaintiffs,inter alia,by reason of the fact that schick attorney fiduciary accounts were overdrawn numerous checks written on schick attorney fiduciary accounts were dishonored for insufficient funds and schick on numerous occasions transferred funds from the schick attorney fiduciary accounts to his personal account s.second am.compl.
as discussed above,these red flags,as alleged,were insufficient to establish a claim for aiding and abetting fraud because,although they may have put the banks on notice that some impropriety may have been taking place,those alleged facts do not create a strong inference of actual knowledge of schick outright theft of client funds.but the claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty does not depend on such knowledge of outright theft.schick commingling of funds was not only an indication of a breach of fiduciary was,in and of itself,a breach.see aba model rules for trust account overdraft notification,available at http last visited,june,in light of the purposes of this rule,and the ethical proscriptions concerning the preservation of client funds and commingling of client and lawyer funds,it would be improper for a lawyer to accept overdraft privileges or any other arrangement for a personal loan on a lawyer trust account.we therefore conclude that the bank actual knowledge of this breach of duty may provide the basis for an aiding and abetting claim.
as noted above,to establish the banks knowing participation,the plaintiffs must also show that the banks gave schick substantial assistance in breaching his fiduciary duty to his clients.substantial assistance occurs when a defendant affirmatively assists,helps conceal or fails to act when required to do so,thereby enabling the breach to occur.however,the mere inaction of an alleged aider and abettor constitutes substantial assistance only if the defendant owes a fiduciary duty directly to the plaintiff.kaufman,at,at see also sharp,at.
the defendants argue that they could not have given substantial assistance if they did no more than passively fail to report schick bounced checks because they owed no independent fiduciary duty to schick clients.but as discussed above with regard to the plaintiffs negligence claim,banks do have a duty to safeguard trust funds deposited with them when confronted with clear evidence indicating that those funds are being mishandled.neither a large bank nor a small bank may urge that it is ignorant of facts clearly disclosed in the transactions of its customers with the bank nor may a bank close its eyes to the clear implications of such facts.grace,at,at.as in bischoff,the plaintiffs here allege that the banks had sufficient information to place them under the duty to make reasonable inquiry and endeavor to prevent a diversion.bischoff,at,at.
the rule that liability for aiding and abetting is limited to those with a duty to disclose is based on the principle that since there is ordinarily no duty to take affirmative steps to interfere,mere presence at the commission of the wrong is not enough to charge one with responsibility.page keeton et,prosser keeton on the law of torts at ed see kolbeck.at incorporating the requirement into the test for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.we think that the duty to prevent a diversion described in bischoff and home or not it is specifically designated as a fiduciary such a duty to interfere as that contemplated by the first department in kaufman 
because of their duty to prevent a diversion,the defendant banks in this c
