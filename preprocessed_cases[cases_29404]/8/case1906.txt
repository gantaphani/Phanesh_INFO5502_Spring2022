background 
at all relevant times,globalnet was in the business of providing news and financial information to private investors in europe and the united states and to trading facilities.globalnet is a delaware company that had an office in boca raton,florida,at the time that its business relationship with crystal began.crystal is a commercial insurance broker incorporated,licensed,and headquartered in new york.crystal also has offices in various locations in the united states,including two in florida.crystal,as an insurance broker,arranged for globalnet to purchase directors and officers d o liability coverage for the period december,to december.the primary d o policy was issued by national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pennsylvania national union,an excess d o policy was issued by lloyd of london,and a second excess d o policy was issued by federal insurance company.the d o policies insured globalnet for liability for any wrongful acts of its officers and directors and did not limit the insured risk to any particular site.
crystal also arranged for the financing of the premium payments for globalnet d o coverage through credit aicco,an affiliate and member of american international group.although crystal never was a party to the premium financing agreement the financing agreement between aicco and globalnet,it warranted to aicco that it had placed the d o policies as broker on behalf of globalnet.on january,crystal sent a letter to globalnet at its florida palmetto park road,boca raton,fl the palmetto park road address enclosing the proposed premium financing agreement.the letter instructed globalnet to sign,date,and return the financing agreement to crystal with a check in the amount of,representing the amount of the down payment.the letter also requested that the first installment payment in the amount of due january,be paid to aicco.on or about january,globalnet entered into the financing agreement with aicco for the financing of its premium payments for the d o coverage.the premium payments on globalnet d o coverage were sent from the globalnet florida office until sometime in the summer of.the payments were sent to aicco address in dallas,texas,as directed by the payment stub provided by aicco.
in august,aicco sent a september premium finance statement the statement,dated august,to globalnet at its palmetto park road address.globalnet had closed and vacated its office at that address in late june or early july as a result of globalnet absence from the palmetto park road location,the statement could not be delivered and was returned to aicco.the returned envelope bore a legend notifying aicco of a new address for mizner boulevard,boca raton,florida the mizner address.aicco corrected its records to account for globalnet new address and the september statement to the mizner address.according to aicco,crystal would not have been advised of the address change by either aicco or globalnet.
on or about october,aicco sent an intent to cancel notice to globalnet,indicating that globalnet d o coverage would be cancelled,effective october,due to the of premiums,unless a premium of and a late fee of were paid.on or about october,aicco mailed a cancellation notice to globalnet,informing it that its d o policies were cancelled for globalnet failure to pay its premiums.both the intent to cancel notice and the cancellation notice were mailed to the mizner address.
the mizner address was occupied by a company called international capital growth icg,which was a company from globalnet in july or august of,before globalnet was acquired by newmedia spark.peter wallis wallis,the associate general counsel for globalnet,had instructed the boca raton post office to forward all mail addressed to globalnet at the palmetto address to the mizner address.wallis stated that he filed the change of address with the post office because,otherwise,the mail would have just collected outside the front door,and i still for whatever reason felt a fiduciary responsibility to make sure the mail got through you know,i mean,i was paid to be outside counsel.
according to globalnet,m ail intended for global n et was generally supposed to be forwarded to london.further,it was the custom and practice of someone at the mizner address to forward mail addressed to globalnet to someone in london.however,the intent to cancel notice and the cancellation notice,which were sent to the mizner address,were never received by globalnet london office.consequently,globalnet did not become aware of the missed premium payment,the notice of cancellation,or the resulting cancellation of the d o coverage until late february.
crystal received both the notice of intent to cancel and the cancellation notice in october at its office in new york city.aicco also contacted crystal by telephone concerning the cancellation of globalnet d o coverage on numerous occasions.previously,crystal had received an from ron goldie of globalnet,stating that w ith the pending close of the tender offer from newmedia spark the mailboxes will be closing soon.after the d o policies were cancelled on october,in accordance with the cancellation notice,they could be reinstated only by the various d o insurance carriers,including national union.
globalnet claims that it was detrimentally affected by the termination of the d o policies when,on may,national union disclaimed coverage for three separate claims made against globalnet on the grounds that the policies were cancelled for nonpayment of premium.moreover,national union informed globalnet that it was not interested in reinstating the d o policies due to activity on the account.
on january,globalnet commenced the diversity action giving rise to this appeal by filing its complaint.globalnet alleged that crystal breached its contractual and fiduciary duties as its insurance broker and was negligent in the performance of its services.these claims stemmed from crystal failure to notify globalnet that its d o insurance policies were to be cancelled for failure to make timely premium payments.globalnet also named aicco as a defendant in this action,asserting claims for breach of contract however,aicco is no longer a party to the action 
on february,after the completion of discovery,crystal moved for summary judgment.globalnet for partial summary judgment on march.both motions were heard and marked fully submitted on march.on july,the district court issued an opinion and order granting crystal motion for summary judgment and denying globalnet for partial summary judgment.the district court applied the rules of new york,which was the forum state.the district court first determined,under a test for determining choice of law,that globalnet contract claims against crystal were governed by new york law because the insurance policies were executed,issued,and brokered in new york state.next,the district court found that globalnet tort claims against crystal were governed by new york law under an test.under that test,the district court determined that globalnet tort claims were based on a failure to tort of omission implicating the regulation of a broker new york,crystal principal business location.applying new york law,the district court determined that crystal was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,assuming without deciding that an insurance broker owes a duty to the insured to notify it of an imminent or recent cancellation,because the broker liability does not extend to circumstances in which the insured knew or should have known of the cancelled coverage.
globalnet filed a timely notice of appeal on december.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

ii.choice of law 
globalnet alleged three causes of action against crystal professional negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract,all arising from crystal alleged failure to notify globalnet of aicco mailing of the notice of intent to cancel and the cancellation notice to globalnet for nonpayment of premium.globalnet posits that florida law should apply to its claims.crystal argues that new york law should apply.
a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the choice of law analysis of the forum state.klaxon stentor.gilbert seton hall,cir.here,the forum state is new york,as the action was properly venued in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.neither party disputes that new york rules apply.the new york court of appeals has held that the first step in any case presenting a potential choice of law issue is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions involved.in re allstate ins,stolarz,see also zurich ins.shearson lehman hutton.
there is an actual conflict between the laws of new york and florida concerning these claims.under florida law,an insurance broker generally undertakes a fiduciary relationship with an insured and may be held liable under theories of contract and tort for violations of this fiduciary duty.see almerico rli ins,so d,as a general principle,an insurance broker is an agent of the insured.see also frank hall of new york,cir when a broker agrees to obtain insurance for a client,the broker becomes the client agent.as agent,the broker owes his client a duty of care and a duty to exercise the skill he holds himself out as having.a breach of these duties may subject the broker to liability in both contract and tort.citations omitted moss appel,so d,concluding that a broker was in a continuing fiduciary relationship with the insured.under new york law,however,a broker is not in a special relationship with an insured and generally owes the insured no more than the duty to procure the insurance coverage that the insured requests.murphy kuhn.
under new york law there are two different analyses,one for contract claims,another for tort claims.fieger pitney bowes credit,cir applying new york law,on remand to wl,aff,cir.accordingly,we review each of globalnet claims in turn.
contract claims 
the new york court of appeals has held that in contract cases,the center of gravity or grouping of contacts analysis is to be applied in determining the choice of law.stolarz,at,see also in re travelers indemnity levy.the center of gravity or grouping of contacts choice of law theory allows a court to consider a spectrum of significant contacts.stolarz,at.in stolarz,the new york court of appeals listed several factors which should be considered in a conflict of law analysis in a contract case.these factors include the place of contracting,negotiation and performance the location of the subject matter of the contract and the domicile of the contracting parties.id.at,citing restatement second of conflict of laws.
the district court found that this action involved a matter of coverage globalnet d o carrier issued both a reservation of rights letter and a disclaimer to globalnet.therefore,the scope of the insurance coverage is at issue here the district court,relying primarily on avondale industries,travelers indemnity,and olin ins.of north america,aff,cir,determined that new york law applied to the contract claims.the district court,following avondale industries,reasoned that b ecause the risks covered by global n et policy are not limited to one state,the law of the state where the policies were executed,issued and brokered will be applied to the contract claims.
however,the contracts in this case are neither the insurance agreements for d o coverage between globalnet and the insurance carriers nor the premium financing agreement between globalnet and aicco.here,the contract for purposes of a analysis was the brokerage contract between globalnet and crystal.under that contract,crystal,as broker,procured and negotiated for the d o insurance policies on behalf of globalnet and arranged the premium financing agreement for globalnet.
avondale and olin are not applicable to the case at bar because both of those cases involved matters of insurance coverage.see avondale industries.at stating that,where the insured interests include a wide geographic al range,new york courts have applied the law of the state where the policies were executed,issued and brokered,and where the insured had its principal place of business.olin.at stating that,when insurance contracts are specifically at issue,new york courts have looked principally to the following factors the location of the insured risk the insured principal place of business where the policy was issued and delivered the location of the broker or agent placing the policy where the premiums were paid and the insurer place of business zurich ins,at,noting that in cases where insurance contracts are at issue,the applicable law is the law of the state of the insured risk.nonetheless,the analysis remains the center of gravity or grouping of contacts for claims sounding in breach of contract between a broker and an insured.
here,there is an adequate grouping of contacts to apply new york law to the contractual claims.the policies were brokered in new york by crystal,which is also a corporation headquartered and licensed to do business in new york.globalnet,in contrast,was incorporated in delaware,with its principal place of business having moved from florida to london,england.the financing agreement between aicco and globalnet was prepared by crystal and executed in new york.aicco is also a new york corporation.in the performance of its brokerage responsibilities,crystal procured the d o coverage from national union,whose address on the schedule of policies addendum to the financing agreement and on the notice of acceptance was listed as a new york city address.we therefore see no reason to disturb the holding of the district court insofar as it held that new york law applies to globalnet breach of contract claim.
tort claim 
the new york court of appeals has held that the relevant analytical approach to choice of law in tort actions in new york is the i nterest analysis.schultz boy scouts of.the new york court of appeals has defined interest analysis as requiring that t he law of the jurisdiction having the greatest interest in the litigation will be applied and the only facts or contacts which obtain significance in defining state interests are those which relate to the purpose of the particular law in conflict.id.second and third alterations in schultz quoting miller miller.under this formulation,significant contacts are,almost exclusively,the parties domiciles and the locus of the tort schultz,at.
