these appeals require us to consider the extent to which a debtor who files for chapter bankruptcy protection has the ability to control the personal injury action that is the principal asset of her estate.in the proceedings below,the bankruptcy the request of the the removal of the debtor preferred choice of special personal injury counsel and then denied the debtor motion to dismiss her bankruptcy petition,even though she had arranged to pay all of her debts in full in an attempt to have her preferred counsel continue to prosecute the personal injury action.under the circumstances present here,including several instances of apparent misconduct by the special personal injury counsel,we hold that the bankruptcy court did not err in approving the trustee request to remove that counsel.however,we also hold on the present record that the court exceeded the bounds of its allowable discretion in denying the debtor motion to dismiss.accordingly,the district court order at issue in appeal is affirmed,the order at issue in appeal is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
background 
in april,appellant sueann smith filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.she had debts of approximately,and a single potential asset a personal injury claim based on a prior sledding accident in which she was blinded in one eye.all parties agree that if the personal injury claim is successfully prosecuted,recovery would likely far exceed creditors claims against smith.
appellee robert geltzer was chosen to be the permanent chapter trustee representing smith estate,and in october,the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of new york carla craig,chief judge approved geltzer request to retain appellant jeffrey schwartz as his special counsel to prosecute smith personal injury action.the bankruptcy court ordered that the personal injury action was to be pursued on behalf of the trustee,robert geltzer,as opposed to the debtor directly,as is customary in bankruptcy cases.however,in january,schwartz filed a complaint in new york state court that listed smith,not geltzer,as the plaintiff.this was the first of a litany of errors that,when viewed together,reflect at best a lack of understanding of the bankruptcy process and at worst an effort to circumvent its requirements.
it took nine months and five separate entreaties by geltzer before schwartz,in october,amended the caption to list geltzer as the plaintiff.in the meantime,schwartz brought on another attorney,robert ginsberg,to prosecute the personal injury getting the approval of either the trustee or the bankruptcy court.after geltzer informed schwartz that such approvals were required under the bankruptcy code before ginsberg could begin serving as trial counsel,schwartz and ginsberg tried to get around this requirement informally.ginsberg sent schwartz a letter,with a copy to geltzer,suggesting that you schwartz can continue to remain the attorney of me as trial all of the mail in your office and then bring it simply announce that i am affiliated with your office on this case.naturally our arrangements would remain the same.a subsequent letter from ginsberg revealed that he had already been working on the personal injury action,including retaining an expert and preparing a bill of particulars,without the trustee or the bankruptcy court knowledge or authorization.
geltzer then moved the bankruptcy court for an order removing schwartz as special personal injury counsel and requiring schwartz to turn over the personal injury file to a new special counsel.smith the debtor filed an affidavit in opposition to the trustee motion.she stated that she ha s a substantial interest in the outcome of this case and that she wanted ginsberg,one of the most highly regarded trial attorneys in the plaintiff personal injury field,to represent the estate.while geltzer motion was pending,ginsberg continued,still without authority,to prosecute the personal injury action and went so far as to file court papers representing that he was counsel to geltzer.
on december,chief bankruptcy judge carla craig held a hearing on the motion to remove schwartz.at one point chief judge craig asked the attorneys to meet in the hallway to try to work it out.when they returned,an associate of geltzer told the court that ginsberg came up to him and goes,is there anything i can do to sweeten the pot ginsberg denied making such an offer.three weeks later,chief judge craig issued a written decision granting the trustee motion to remove schwartz as personal injury counsel and directing schwartz to turn over to geltzer all files relating to the personal injury action.the bankruptcy court entered a formal order to this effect on january.
in her opinion,chief judge craig explained that the trustee motion was overwhelmingly supported by th e record,including that a schwartz delayed at least six months before acting on the trustee request that he amend the caption in state court b schwartz transferred the case to ginsberg without approval of the trustee or the bankruptcy court and c ginsberg worked on the case and attempted to remain as trial counsel despite the lack of trustee or court approval,thus creat ing a legitimate and substantial concern in the mind of a reasonable person that this personal injury action,which was being handled by an attorney who had no authority to do so,might be settled in a similarly unauthorized fashion,possibly even without payment of the proceeds to the trustee.chief judge craig was especially concerned with the letter sent by ginsberg suggesting that schwartz remain as attorney of record while ginsberg would act as trial counsel because such arrangements are prohibited under section a of the bankruptcy code and,without proper authorization,can constitute a violation of the new york lawyer code of professional responsibility.it is appalling,and incomprehensible,wrote chief judge craig,that ginsberg could think it was permissible,in the absence of consent by the trustee and court approval,for him to act as counsel on this case and receive a fee for doing so,funneled through schwartz as attorney of record.chief judge craig also credited geltzer associate account of the exchange in the hallway and noted that ginsberg attempt to sweeten the pot is an additional reason why the trustee is amply justified in refusing to retain him,particularly in light of ginsberg persistent and flagrant disregard of his obligations as an attorney.finally,chief judge craig found that whatever weight should be accorded the debtor preference to retain ginsberg was outweighed by the clear evidence that schwartz and ginsberg should not be retained to represent the estate.
schwartz appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court decision in an opinion and order issued on august.schwartz filed a timely appeal to this court,docketed as,which is the first appeal we address,infra.
almost immediately after the bankruptcy court issued its removal decision,smith,on february,moved to dismiss her bankruptcy case.in support of her motion,smith said that she still had confidence in schwartz and ginsberg and wanted to obtain control of the prosecution of the personal injury claim.to that end,smith obtained a commitment from setareh holding whereby setareh would provide smith with up to to pay the claims of the estate in return for a lien against any recovery in the personal injury action in the amount of plus interest per month.ginsberg law firm agreed to advance all payments for the trustee commission until now,court fees or expenses which have been incurred,with this advance to be treated as a disbursement to be deducted from the total settlement or judgment of the personal injury litigation without interest.smith argued that with these arrangements,dismissal of her chapter petition would be in her best interest,would satisfy her creditors,and no one will suffer any prejudice.
while smith motion was pending,schwartz and ginsberg refused to turn over the personal injury file to defiance of the bankruptcy court january,ginsberg continued to prosecute the personal injury action,including filing responses to discovery requests 
geltzer,as trustee,opposed smith dismissal motion on multiple grounds,including that the creditors were provided with no certainty,at all,that they will be paid by the debtor dismissal would be against smith best interests due to ginsberg record of incompeten ce and dishonest y and because setareh interest rate is significantly greater than the federal interest rate of per annum and he,as trustee,would be disadvantaged by dismissal because there was no agreement as to what fees he would be entitled to receive,and the proposed deal provided a commission for his work only until now,which at that time amounted to zero dollars.geltzer argued that i t appears that ginsberg is effectively trying to buy a dismissal of the debtor bankruptcy case,and eliminating the role of the federal bankruptcy trustee,trusting to the debtor to pay her creditors,all so ginsberg can line his own pockets with the proceeds of the debtor personal injury action at the trustee expense.
at the end of a hearing held on march,the bankruptcy court denied the motion to dismiss.chief judge craig explained that she would ordinarily give a lot of weight or at least some substantial weight to smith desire to be represented by schwartz and ginsberg,but ultimately concluded that,given the attorneys extraordinary record of incompetence,absolute refusal to obey court orders,and failure to recognize their ethical requirements,it was not in smith best interest to be represented by them.chief judge craig cited the attempt by schwartz and ginsberg to enter into a arrangement without authorization,their refusal to comply with the court turnover order,and the fact that they continued to hold themselves out as functioning attorneys in this case after they had been discharged.
during the course of the hearing,chief judge craig rejected the trustee argument that lack of certainty that the debts would be paid meant that dismissal would not be in the best interest of smith creditors,given that the bankruptcy court could work out a mechanism where the monies advanced by setareh are distributed under the court supervision.but chief judge craig provided two additional reasons for her decision.first,she found it hard to see why someone would agree to setareh terms,which provided for an interest rate far greater than what smith would be subject to in bankruptcy,thus giving rise to a concern that smith has been imposed upon by schwartz and geltzer.however,even though smith was present in the courtroom during the hearing,she was not asked to testify.second,the parties continued to dispute the amount that would be owed to geltzer as trustee if the dismissal were to be granted,thus fostering additional litigation over geltzer fees and over the commission amounts.
smith appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.the district court reasoned that a debtor ability to repay creditors is not,by itself,adequate cause justifying dismissal,but rather is part of the required inquiry into whether dismissal would be in the best interest of all parties in interest.the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court had acted within its allowable discretion because its decision was based on a proper assessment of the vagaries of the case and not on any clearly erroneous facts or errors of law.
smith filed a timely appeal to this court,docketed as,which is the second appeal we address herein.
ii.discussion 
where,as here,a district court acts in its capacity as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case,the district court decisions are subject to plenary review.dairy mart convenience stores,nickel in re dairy mart convenience stores,cir gulf states exploration manville forest prods.in re manville forest prods,cir.we thus review independently the factual findings and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court,accepting its findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous and reviewing its conclusions of law de novo.babitt vebeliunas in re vebeliunas,cir resolution trust best prods.in re best prods,cir.
a.the removal of schwartz as special counsel 
we first consider the bankruptcy court decision granting geltzer motion to remove schwartz as special personal injury counsel.a bankruptcy trustee ability to hire professionals is governed by section a of the bankruptcy code,which permits the trustee to employ an attorney to assist in his duties with the court approval,so long as the attorney to be hired do es not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate,and is a disinterested person.a.under this provision,a trustee choice of special counsel is subject to the evaluation and approval of the bankruptcy court.see pryor ready pontisakos in re vouzianas,cir.in exercising its approval function,however,the bankruptcy court should interfere with the trustee choice of counsel o nly in the rarest cases,such as when the proposed attorney has a conflict of interest,or when it is clear that the best interest of the estate would not be served by the trustee choice.id.at quoting in re mandell,cir.courts give the trustee such deference in choosing special counsel because of the highly confidential relationship between the special and the.id.quoting mandell,at.
importantly,the special counsel represents the trustee,not the debtor.see id.thus,section a does not give a bankruptcy court authority to reject a trustee choice of counsel solely because of an objection by the debtor.rather,the debtor objection is relevant only to a bankruptcy court consideration of the best interest of the estate,or of whether the chosen special counsel is conflicted.
applying these principles here,we find no error in the bankruptcy court determination that there were no circumstances that would give it reason to interfere with geltzer decision to remove schwartz as special personal injury counsel.there was no indication or allegation that the attorney with whom geltzer chose to replace schwartz was conflicted or unqualified to litigate the personal injury action,and ample evidence supported the bankruptcy court conclusion that the best interest of the estate would not be served by requiring geltzer to continue to be represented by schwartz,including,inter alia,schwartz delay in amending the state court caption and his transferring the personal injury file to ginsberg without court or trustee approval.indeed,the only factor weighing in favor of rejecting geltzer motion was smith preference to have schwartz and ginsberg prosecute the personal injury action.but that preference alone is insufficient to turn this into one of the rarest cases in which interference with the trustee choice could be justified.pryor,at 
b.the denial of smith dismissal motion 
motions to dismiss a bankruptcy petition are governed by section of the bankruptcy code,which provides 
the bankruptcy court may dismiss a case only after notice and a hearing and only for cause,including 
unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors 
nonpayment of any fees and charges required under chapter of title and 
failure of the debtor in a voluntary case to file,within fifteen days the information required by paragraph of section,but only on a motion by the united states trustee.
a.although this provision does not specifically provide for a debtor motion to dismiss a petition,courts have routinely held that section a applies to such cases.see,turpen eide in re turpen,cir.bap in re schwartz,in re klein.under section a,the debtor has no absolute right to dismissal of a chapter case.turpen,at see also in re klein,at.rather,a debtor seeking dismissal must show cause.a see dinova harris in re dinova,cir.bap.however,the bankruptcy code does not define cause,and the three examples given in section a are illustrative,not exclusive.see neary padilla in re padilla,cir dionne simmons in re simmons,cir.
where,as here,a debtor moves for dismissal,courts in this circuit have determined whether cause exists by looking at whether dismissal would be in the best interest of all parties in interest.dinova,at see also in re schwartz,at in re hull.we agree that this is the appropriate analysis.the best interest of
