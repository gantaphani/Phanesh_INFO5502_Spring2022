background 
irene kendall began working for avon products,avon in at age thirty.in,she became disabled and collected disability benefits from avon.although she became eligible for early retirement in under avon retirement plan the plan,she continued to collect disability benefits,and to accrue years of service under the plan,until.
the plan provides for an accrued benefit within the meaning of the relevant provision of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,at the statutory normal retirement age of pursuant to a formula of the plan participant average final compensation for the first ten years of service of the average final compensation of years the plan participant worked in excess of of the plan participant social security benefits multiplied by years of service completed after the month the plan participant turns age up to a maximum of fifty years the latter figure is known as the social security offset offset.
under the plan,the plan participant can elect to retire early and receive benefits when the sum of the plan participant years of employment and the plan participant age equal the rule of or the rule.the accrued benefit calculation for plan participants who opt to retire under the rule of is the same as the calculation for those that retire at age,but the offset deducted from the rule of plan participant accrued benefit calculation is reduced until age therefore,plan participants who retire before the age of under the rule of provision could theoretically receive higher benefits per year than those employees that retire at age who have the identical salary,position,and have served the same amount of time.by the time the retired plan participants reach age,the offset is no longer discounted.
kendall claim for relief 
kendall filed a class action complaint on behalf of a ll plan participants with one hour of service on or after january,who have accrued benefits under the plan.she alleges that the plan violates various provisions of erisa and seeks revision of the plan.
claims i and iv plan violates b b 
in claims i and iv of her complaint,kendall alleges that the rule of portion of the plan violates b b under that section,a plan must meet two requirements the accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age must be equal to the normal retirement benefit and the rate of accrual at normal retirement age can not exceed of the accrual rate from the prior year.
the normal retirement benefit referred to in the first b b requirement is the greater of the early retirement benefit under the plan or the benefit under the plan commencing at normal retirement age.see also a c ii because b b requires the normal retirement benefit and the benefit accrued at normal retirement age to be equal,the early retirement benefit can not be greater than the benefit accrued at normal retirement age.in claim iv,kendall contends that the rule of violates the first requirement because,in her view,the early retirement benefit conferred by the rule of would be greater than that benefit under the plan commencing at normal retirement age.
regarding the second requirement,the annual accrual rate of a plan must not increase by more than from one year to the next.for example,if under a retirement plan,a plan participant rate of accrual in is per year,the plan participant rate of accrual in could not exceed per year,that figure being of the accrual rate.joint appendix at providing an example of a situation in which the rule of as applied to a hypothetical plan participant would violate the second requirement of b b.in claim i,kendall alleges that due to the reduction in offset under the rule of,the rule violates b b she seeks to revise the plan to retroactively reduce rates of accrual to be no smaller than of the rate of accrual in effect at the earliest possible rule of retirement date.
claim ii offset termination changed base for benefit computation 
in claim ii of her complaint,kendall asserts that the plan general offset provision violates b b by discontinuing the offset after fifty years of employment.she argued at the district court that discontinuing the offset changed the base of computing the normal retirement benefit after the fiftieth year of employment.according to treasury department regulations,a base for computation of retirement benefits may not change solely by reason of an increase in the number of years in participation.b b ii f.kendall claims that the discontinuance of the offset after fifty years of service effectively increased the benefits a plan participant receives based solely on increased years of service she seeks elimination of the offset for all plan participants.
claim iii withholding offset until age reduces benefits based on age 
kendall also challenges the provision withholding the offset until an employee reached age,claiming that it effectively reduces the employee accrued benefit upon reaching age.she asserts that this violates b h i,which bars a reduction in accrued benefits because of the attainment of any age.she seeks to eliminate the offset for all plan participants.
claims v and vi plan amendment decreases benefits 
kendall does not appeal the district court dismissal of these claims.
claim vii method of annualizing partial payment violates regulations 
kendall contends that the calculation used to determine average final compensation afc the dollar amount upon which benefits calculations are section of the plan violates irs regulation a c.under a c,if a plan bases its normal retirement benefits on compensation,the compensation must reflect the compensation which would have been paid for a full year of participation in the plan.under the plan,the afc is the employee five highest years of compensation within the last ten years of employment.all compensation is annualized.if the annualized compensation is one of the five highest years of compensation,the annualized compensation year will be replaced by the sixth highest compensation year.kendall claims that this replacement reduces the afc and therefore the benefit that has accrued under the plan.a c requires that compensation used to calculate benefits must reflect what would have been paid for a full year of participation in a plan.kendall argued in the district court that substituting a theoretical higher earning year,the annualized year,for the lower earning year,violated the regulation.
claims viii and ix amendments reduces benefits and failure to notify violates erisa 
kendall claims that the use of the plan to calculate benefits prior to the effective date of the plan violated g claim viii,and that the plan administrator violated h by failing to give timely notice prior to the effective date claim ix.
relief sought at the district court 
kendall requested that the district court declare that the challenged plan provisions violate erisa enjoin the plan from enforcing said provisions order avon,to reform the plan to bring it into compliance with erisa order avon to recalculate the accrued benefits or pensions of all class members under the terms of the reformed plan order avon to pay to the members of the class who are pensioners or beneficiaries receiving benefits,the difference between the amounts paid to them and the amounts due under the reformed plan order avon to account for all the gains and earnings that resulted from the violations of erisa order avon to disgorge and pay to the class their gains and earnings and order avon to pay costs and attorney fees.
district court decision 
in response to the complaint,avon filed a motion to dismiss kendall complaint for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion.the court dismissed claims ii,iii,vii,viii,and ix for lack of standing and claims i,iv,v,and vi for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted 
kendall appeal 
kendall appeals to this court with respect to all claims except v and vi.kendall contests she has standing to bring her claims because a confers standing to bring claims of erisa violations regardless of whether she was personally injured or,alternatively,she was directly injured by the erisa violations because once the terms of the plan are brought into compliance with erisa,the amount of her pension will be higher.exactly how much higher will be known only after reformation of the plan.kendall also alleges a specific calculable injury with regard to claims vii,viii,and ix,claiming that the afc used to calculate her benefits would have been higher had the plan conformed to governing regulations.however,kendall only provides specific calculations of her injury under section d of the plan,which applies only to plan participants who qualify for disability benefits.kendall did not claim injury under this provision or provide this calculation before the district court.
with regard to claim i,kendall argues that the rule of is an accrued benefit under this court case law and therefore must be taken into account when considering whether the plan violates b b second requirement.with regard to claim iv,kendall contends that the rule of benefit is greater than any accrued benefit at normal retirement age because the court should measure each accrued benefit based on absolute amounts and not hypothetical actuarial values 
with regard to claims ii,iii,vii,viii,and ix,kendall asserts the same basic arguments raised in her complaint except the addition,in claim to claims viii and an allegation that section d method of annualizing kendall disability benefits also violates erisa 
discussion 
we conclude that kendall lacks standing to bring claims i,ii,iii,and iv we are also of the view that with regard to claims vii,viii,and ix she was given ample opportunity to amend her complaint to allege an erisa violation under the correct provision of the plan.thus,we see no reason to allow her to effectively amend her complaint on appeal 
we review constitutional standing de novo,cent.states se.sw areas health and welfare fund managed care,cir hereinafter central states i,and statutory standing de novo,provided the statutory standing questions are of a legal nature,see united states cambio exacto,cir.in deciding questions of standing,this court accepts as true all material allegations of the complaint and construes the complaint in favor of the complaining party.fin.insts.ret.fund office of thrift supervision,cir hereinafter firf.
a plan participant suing under erisa must establish both statutory standing and constitutional standing,meaning the plan participant must identify a statutory endorsement of the action and assert a constitutionally sufficient injury arising from the breach of a statutorily imposed duty.see central states i,at noting that statutory standing does not necessarily provide constitutional standing internal quotation marks omitted.plan participants have statutory standing to bring a civil action to a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of erisa or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a.
article iii confines constitutional standing to plaintiffs who can establish that they have suffered some.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d t he core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.there are three article iii standing requirements the plaintiff must have suffered an there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct at issue and the injury must be likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.in a class action,once standing is established for a named plaintiff,standing is established for the entire class.cent.states se.sw.areas health welfare fund managed care,cir hereinafter central states ii.
to qualify as a constitutionally sufficient,the asserted injury must be concrete and particularized as well as actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.baur veneman,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also lujan,at.t o support standing,the plaintiff injury must be actual or imminent to ensure that the court avoids deciding a purely hypothetical case in which the projected harm may ultimately fail to occur.baur,at internal citation omitted.
in certain situations,t he actual or threatened injury required by art.iii may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing.warth seldin,d internal quotation marks omitted.t he standing question in such cases is whether the constitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff position a right to judicial relief.id.
kendall contends that she need not show individualized harm as a plan participant under a to assert constitutional standing,but that in any event she has suffered injuries in fact that include avon alleged breach of fiduciary duty owed to her to comply with erisa,blue see a d the offset under the plan prevents her from realizing higher benefits avon improper calculation of her afc under the regulations denied her a higher benefit and when the plan is modified to comply with erisa,she will necessarily receive a higher benefit because g requires that no plan amendment reduce a participant benefit.
her first erisa,or specifically a,does not require a showing of direct a clear misstatement of law.kendall overlooks the fact that she must allege some injury or deprivation of a right,even if that right is statutorily created.see warth,at.furthermore,a only applies to claims for injunctive relief,and despite kendall assertions to the contrary,many of kendall claims are effectively claims for money damages outside the scope of a.in particular,kendall asked the district court to,among other things order defendants to pay to the members of the class who are pensioners or beneficiaries receiving benefits,the difference between the amounts paid to them and the amounts due under the reformed plan order defendants to account for all the gains and earnings that resulted from the violations of erisa order defendants to disgorge and pay to the class their gains and earnings and order defendants to pay costs and attorney fees.
in central states i we held that r equests for restitution or disgorgement under erisa are different from requests for injunctive relief.obtaining restitution or disgorgement under erisa requires that a plaintiff satisfy the strictures of constitutional standing by demonstrating individual loss,to wit,that they have suffered an.at internal citations,quotation marks,and alteration omitted.the supreme court has presaged this rationale,noting a lmost invariably suits seeking whether by judgment,injunction,or declaration to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff are suits for money damages,as that phrase has traditionally been applied,since they seek no more than compensation for loss resulting from the defendant breach of legal duty.life annuity ins.knudson,d alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.kendall claims for payment of benefits under a revised plan and fees is effectively a request for a disgorgement of funds kendall believes avon gained by not paying out benefits under a plan that conforms with erisa.we therefore require that kendall demonstrate some to have standing to bring these claims.
kendall second she suffered an actual examining the rights erisa confers on plan participants alleging a breach of fiduciary duty and the resultant loss of benefits.
breach of fiduciary duty 
kendall claim is based on the simple contention that avon had a fiduciary duty to execute a pension plan that complied with erisa.there is no doubt that erisa imposes on plan fiduciaries a duty to act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of erisa.a d.the statute does impose a general fiduciary duty to comply with erisa,but it does not confer a right to every plan participant to sue the plan fiduciary for alleged erisa violations without a showing that they were injured by the alleged breach of the duty.see flanigan,cir.
kendall looks to central states i to support her argument that a plaintiff has standing to sue for a breach of fiduciary duty under erisa without a showing of individualized harm.in central states i,this court remanded to the district court to determine whether plaintiff plan participants had met the requirement under lujan in a suit against the benefits manager for erisa violations.at.we noted that while the third circuit had held that a plan participant may have article iii standing to obtain injunctive relief related to erisa disclosure and fiduciary duty requirements without a showing of individual harm to the participant,requests for restitution and disgorgement under erisa require that plaintiffs meet the requirement of lujan.id.at citing horvath keystone health plan,cir see also harley.mining,cir noting that plaintiffs bringing erisa claims against a benefit plan must suffer an.on remand,the district court found,and this court then affirmed,that an benefit plan participant had standing to bring an erisa claim against the benefits manager because the benefit plan was in a contractual relationship with the benefits manager.see central states ii,at.therefore,neither central states i nor central states ii addressed or decided whether a breach of fiduciary duty in and of itself could constitute an.the central states ii court left for a future panel the resolution of whether plan participants would have standing to assert the vindication of intangible right s id.at.
even in cases where plaintiffs need not show an individualized harm,they must still allege some injury in the form of a deprivation of a right as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty conferred by erisa.in horvath,the third circuit held that a plan participant need not demonstrate actual harm in order to have standing to seek injunctive relief requiring that the plan administrator satisfy its disclosure or fiduciary responsibilities because under the relevant provisions of erisa the plan participant had a right to receive particular information and to have the plan administrator act in a fiduciary capacity.at.while the participants did not have to show they were specifically injured,pecuniarily or otherwise,they did have to show that they were generally harmed by the deprivation of a specific right to receive information.
kendall,however,only alleges that avon deprived her of her right to a plan that complies with erisa,deprivations she contends occurred as a result of avon breach of its fiduciary duty to comply with erisa.this argument is obviously circular.while plan fiduciaries have a statutory duty to comply with erisa under a d,kendall must allege some injury or deprivation of a specific right that arose from a violation of that duty in order to meet the requirement.see firf,at.kendall can not claim that either an alleged breach of fiduciary duty to comply with erisa,or a deprivation of her entitlement to that fiduciary duty,in and of themselves constitutes an sufficient for constitutional standing.
elimination of the offset and general amendments to the plan 
kendall claims that she is also injured by virtue of the fact that she is receiving less in benefits than she would have received under a plan that did not violate erisa.specifically,she seeks an elimination of the social security offset and a recalculation of her afc giving her higher benefits.more generally,she claims that amending the plan will increase her benefits by an amount when the plan is modified to conform to erisa.
a plan participant may allege a constitutional based on a theoretical injury.in firf,the district court held that employees lacked standing to bring an erisa claim against a pension fund for refusing to credit surpluses from the employees former employer to the payments that the employees new employer was required to make to the fund.see id.at.this court reversed the district court,believing that erisa casts a wider net.id.we held the employees had standing to bring a claim because they were theoretically injured by the funds mismanagement of assets,some of which could be theirs.id.at.
the seventh circuit has come to a similar conclusion.in mccarter ret.plan for dist.managers of am.family ins.group,the court found that plan participants who had opted to cash out their retirement plans in a lump sum prior to reaching normal retirement age had standing in an erisa action to challenge the window the plan gave for choosing the opt out,cir.the plan participants argued that limiting the amount of time the participants had to choose the opt out violated e,which provides that benefits exceeding may not be paid out without consent of the participant.id.in finding standing,the court noted,t he injury the plan participants monthly income at retirement age is diminished if participants are stampeded into taking cash,which then burns holes in their be traced to the plans terms and can be redressed by a judgment in plaintiffs favor.no more is required for standing.id.
however,in both firf and mccarter,the plaintiffs could point to an identifiable and quantifiable pool of assets to which they had colorable claims.these cases are distinguishable from the case before us.here,kendall alleges an injury based on an increase in benefits as a result of elimination of the offset or general amendments to the plan.
the case before us more closely resembles drutis rand mcnally,cir.in drutis,the court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a claim that their pension plan discriminated on the basis of age in violation of b h because they suffered no injury as a result of the challenged plan.id.at.the plaintiffs had the option of choosing either to remain with their current plan or to be subject to a new plan.id.the plaintiffs chose the old plan but sued claiming the new plan violated erisa and alleged that were the new plan modified to comply with erisa,they would have chosen the new plan,thus receiving higher benefits.id.the plaintiffs argued that they should be entitled to choose a version of the new plan absent alleged violations.the court held the plaintiffs did not meet the requirement because their injury was entirely speculative and any harm to plaintiffs was hypothetical at best.id.the court concluded that article iii standing ultimately turns on whether a plaintiff gets something other than moral satisfaction if the plaintiff wins.id.at emphasis omitted.
kendall claim,that she would receive more in benefits were the offset to be eliminated or the plan modified to conform to erisa,is not an.her benefits were not reduced by any more than the customary offset and a reduced offset during the period in which kendall elected to collect under the rule of,which kendall acknowledges was legal.while it may be true that eliminating the entire offset would increase the amount each plan participant receives in benefits,kendall has no right under erisa to receive benefits that have not been reduced by a lawful social security offset,and furthermore,kendall offers no proof that avon would not adjust the plan to offset for its employees social security benefits through some other means.while avon may not amend the plan to reduce its employees benefits,it may amend the plan to keep its employees net benefits static.and while it is possible that distributing the offset evenly among all participants could reduce kendall offset,kendall alleged nothing to support her contention that avon would decrease the offset per participant.likewise,kendall concedes that her future benefits under a modified plan that conforms to erisa are not yet determined.the best kendall offers the court is a calculation of how a hypothetical plan participant would be injured by the rule of provisions of the plan.her claim,like the claim in drutis,is speculative and therefore does not constitute an 
kendall does state an identifiable and quantifiable injury in her appeal of claim vii by arguing that her afc was not calculated in accordance with erisa for purposes of section d of the plan,resulting in a reduction of her benefits.kendall provides mathematical calculations to support her claim,and more importantly,her claim relates to a past and present reduction in accrued benefits.kendall has sta
