background 
mmc terminated vangas when she was unable to work after exhausting her leave of absence under the family medical leave act fmla.vangas brought claims against mmc,quinn her immediate supervisor,and burns the head of human resources for the care management organization.vangas alleged that defendants violated the nyshrl and nychrl by failing to accommodate her disability.and vangas also brought claims under cobra alleging that mmc failed to properly send notification of their right to continued coverage under mmc medical insurance plan 
mmc hired vangas in,and at the time of her termination in,vangas worked as a utilization management analyst uma in yonkers.during all relevant times of her employment,vangas lived in cornwall on hudson,new york.as a uma,vangas performed patient assessments by speaking with them over the phone.vangas accessed patient contact information and authorizations through databases on her work computer,including the care enhanced clinical management software ccms and carecast.
on march,vangas was diagnosed with cancer.after meeting with quinn and quinn supervisor,kathleen byrne byrne,that same day,vangas went on immediate leave.vangas subsequently filled out fmla forms,which informed her that during her leave she was to stay in contact with mmc and inform mmc if she would not be able to return to work as scheduled,and vangas indicated on those forms that her leave period would end in june.the fmla forms also indicated that vangas would need to be medically cleared prior to returning to work.in june,vangas was hospitalized briefly after a complication due to her treatment.on june,vangas doctor filled out paperwork,setting a new expected return to work date of july.thereafter,vangas did not return to work as scheduled,but mmc unilaterally extended her leave.in july,after vangas did not return to work,quinn and byrne spoke with burns.thereafter,on or around july,they mailed vangas a certified mail letter regarding her fmla leave.vangas testified that she received two notices that she had a certified mail letter,but did not retrieve the letter,which was returned unclaimed.
on august,vangas doctor indicated that she could return to work on august.the same day,vangas spoke with burns assistant who informed her of the need to complete more fmla paperwork in late august,vangas began experiencing new symptoms including blurred vision,headaches,dizziness,and facial swelling.on august,just one week prior to her revised return to work date,vangas visited her doctor for an mri and ultrasound.at that appointment,vangas doctor filled out additional fmla paperwork stating that the duration of her condition was unknown.
vangas spoke with quinn about her new symptoms on august.on august,the day before she was supposed to return to work,vangas called,left a voicemail message,and texted quinn,telling her that she was not feeling well,would not be returning the next day,and was following up with doctors.quinn did not respond.vangas did not return to work august,and was terminated that same day.on august,in a conversation with burns,vangas conceded that she was not medically cleared for work.
in ruling on defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court held that vangas statements on august,that she was not feeling well and would not be returning to work the next day,were a request for indefinite leave,as vangas was unable to provide a return to work date.the district court concluded that requests for indefinite leave,as a matter of law,are not requests for reasonable accommodation under the nyshrl.the court ruled,however,that material questions of fact existed as to whether defendants failed to accommodate a reasonable request to work from home and as to the other claims.thus,the case proceeded to a jury.
after the close of vangas case,both defendants and vangas moved for a directed verdict on the nyshrl claims.the district court denied the motions and allowed the nyshrl claim to proceed to a jury verdict.the jury found in vangas favor and awarded damages of.on april,the district court denied defendants renewed motion for jmol under federal rule of civil procedure rule on the nyshrl claim.the district court also denied defendant motion for a new trial based on alleged errors in the jury instructions and summation under rule e and denied relief from the judgment under rule b.the district court granted,however,defendants alternative motion for a new trial pursuant to rule a,holding that a new trial would be awarded unless vangas agreed to remittitur reducing damages to.vangas subsequently agreed to the remittitur.
on appeal,defendants contend that they were entitled to jmol on vangas nyshrl claim,arguing that vangas attorney was improperly permitted to suggest hypothetical accommodations not requested by vangas.they further argue that the district court improperly permitted the jury to consider the feasibility of vangas alleged request to work from home,made at a time she was not cleared to work and was being accommodated with leave.vangas responds that these matters were properly before the jury and it could infer from mmc failure to engage in an interactive process that reasonable accommodation was refused.we reverse the district court denial of defendants motion for jmol on the nyshrl as at the relevant time,no reasonable accommodation was possible.
defendants also moved for a directed verdict at the close of vangas case on the nychrl claim.the district court dismissed vangas nychrl claim,holding that because vangas neither worked nor lived in new york city,and her only contacts with the city were tangential,her termination had no impact in nyc.on appeal,vangas argues that she did not need to feel the impact of her termination in nyc to trigger the protections of the nychrl rather,it is sufficient that the patients she worked with felt the impact in nyc.we affirm the district court dismissal of the nychrl claim.
the district court decided the cobra claims as trier of fact.testimony relevant to those claims indicated that and vangas lived at wood avenue,cornwall on hudson,new york.although the zip code was correct in the cobra notices,the town was abbreviated to cornwallonhuds.mmc director of benefits,eileen montalto,testified that mmc maintains a service agreement with wageworks,an outside vendor to administer mmc cobra benefits.she testified that upon the termination of an employee,wageworks is electronically sent a file relating to the employee and that within three to five days,wageworks mails a letter to the employee setting forth the cobra coverage.she further testified that the shortening of the town name was likely due to a character limit in the town field in the electronic system.vangas testified that she did not receive the cobra notices,but conceded that she receiv
