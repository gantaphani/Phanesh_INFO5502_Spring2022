in,for reasons that are in dispute wright medical terminated the agreement.thereafter,wright medical proceeded to appoint another distributor for its products in rhode island.
at some point not relevant to this appeal,mercurio filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy act,et,and peter furness trustee became the trustee in bankruptcy.
five years after termination of the agreement,the trustee,on behalf of mercurio,commenced the present suit as an adversary proceeding against wright medical in the bankruptcy court for the district of rhode island.the substance of this action concerns an alleged breach of contract by wright medical in terminating the agreement.wright medical moved the bankruptcy court to compel arbitration of that controversy pursuant to the terms of the agreement.the bankruptcy judge granted this request,but ordered the arbitration to take place in rhode island rather than in tennessee as stipulated in the agreement.
the record is fairly sparse as to the reasoning of the bankruptcy court in bypassing the agreement unambiguous language in this respect.the order itself merely states in conclusory language that the arbitration take place in rhode island.from the transcript of the proceedings,however,it is apparent that the bankruptcy judge felt that there was a need to resolve the case with some celerity,and that sending the matter to tennessee for arbitration,where none of the witnesses or evidence was present,would militate against this goal.although we can not fault the judge laudable purpose,arbitration is a contractual matter in which,absent unusual circumstances not present in this case,the parties are entitled to the measure that they bargained for.
the bankruptcy judge order was appealed to the district court,where the arguments followed suit to those made before the bankruptcy court.thus,the transcript of the proceedings shows that the presence of witnesses in rhode island spurred the trustee argument,and in turn,the district judge oral determination affirming the bankruptcy court order.the district judge found that the trustee would be serious ly inconvenienc ed in litigating in memphis,tennessee,and effectively deprived of his day in court,and thus designated rhode island as the place of arbitration.arrow plumbing heating,am.mech.servs.
the heavy burden of proof required to set aside a forum selection clause on grounds of inconvenience,carnival cruise lines,shute,d,demands more of a litigant,however,than simply showing that another location would be more convenient.were it otherwise,forum selection clauses would almost never be enforceable,for inconvenience to at least one of the parties is an almost forgone conclusion when dealing with a provision that requires litigating away from one home turf.yet these clauses are standard fare in today and international contractual relationships.at the time these contracts are entered into,the parties routinely,voluntarily,and knowingly agree to litigate be bound by the decision of fora located in distant locations.thus,something considerably more than the mere inconvenience of traveling to litigate in a different,even faraway foreign jurisdiction,is required to overcome a contractual agreement to do so.royal bed spring famossul industria e comercio de moveis ltda,cir a showing of inconvenience as to a foreign forum would not be enough to hold a clause unenforceable,especially if that inconvenience was known or contemplated by the parties at the time of their agreement.the cost of such litigation alone can not be enough to meet the heavy burden imposed upon the reneging party,who may now have second thoughts.cent.contracting maryland cas,cir mere inconvenience or additional expense is not the test of unreasonableness since it may be assumed that the plaintiff received under the contract consideration for these things.
the record in this case is bare of specific evidence regarding the extraordinary additional costs involved in litigating in tennessee that were not foreseen by the contracting parties when they entered into the agreement.oso accepted some costs beforehand as a normal consequence of arbitrating in tennessee.see the bremen,at.moses business card exp,cir increased expenses are inherent in a forum selection clause.with a distributorship in rhode island,the likelihood existed that witnesses and evidence would be located there rather than in tennessee.oso,however,chose to commit to tennessee as the forum for dispute resolutions.the trustee stands in the debtor shoes and is not entitled to avoid the forum selected by oso on mere allegations of inconvenience.see in re d√≠az contracting,cir n either the bankruptcy court intimate knowledge of nor defendant concessions concerning precarious financial condition operates to discharge its burden of establishing grave inconvenience under the bremen doctrine.
