donald hutchins,an employee for bath iron works biw,was awarded medical benefits in because of a injury stemming from exposure to asbestos dust and other pulmonary irritants.birmingham fire insurance company birmingham was ruled to be the responsible carrier.four years later,hutchins sought and obtained full disability benefits.at that time,an administrative law judge alj found that hutchins had been exposed to additional irritants while biw was and therefore shifted responsibility for his payments to biw.the benefits review board of the department of labor the board upheld the decision.the company challenges that ruling,arguing,inter alia,that the alj exceeded the scope of his authority in the liability and that the record fails to support a finding of new toxic exposure.we affirm the board decision.
background 
hutchins worked as a pipefitter for biw from until,when he transferred to the company planning office because of breathing problems he filed a claim under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,alleging a gradual injury resulting from continuing exposure to asbestos and other toxic chemicals.after proceedings before an alj and appeals to the board,he was found to have multiple,lung diseases and was awarded medical benefits.although biw had become just after hutchins transfer to the planning department in,there was no evidence presented during the original proceedings that he was exposed to harmful stimuli in his new position.as a result,birmingham,which had insured biw during the most recent period of harmful exposure,was assigned full responsibility for hutchins payments.see liberty mut.ins.commercial union ins,lst cir liability for the effects of an occupational disease falls upon the last responsible insurer.
hutchins health continued to deteriorate,forcing his retirement in may.shortly thereafter,he filed a claim seeking modification of the earlier benefits award to include disability payments in addition to medical benefits.see providing for modification.based on a deposition of hutchins taken in september,birmingham took the position that hutchins had continued to be exposed to airborne irritants at biw after he moved to the planning department and that this exposure triggered the disability.birmingham contended that biw,now,should inherit the responsibility for hutchins compensation as the last responsible insurer.
birmingham focused in particular on an incident that occurred near the planning office blueprint room on march.according to hutchins,as he passed by the room,he inhaled a substance that nearly caused him to pass out and required him to receive oxygen.he filled out a company statement of injury,and was out of work for about two weeks following the episode.hutchins also testified that he experienced breathing problems in early because of a problem with the air conditioning that caused exhaust fumes to come into his work area.
biw argued,however,that the earlier alj decision conclusively established that hutchins was last exposed to toxins during birmingham period of coverage.it pointed out that hutchins did not assert a new injury in his request for increased benefits,but simply requested additional compensation based on the change in his condition to total disability.moreover,biw asserted that the medical reports in the record failed to support an aggravation or new injury that would warrant a change in liability.the company maintained that hutchins disability resulted from a natural progression of his previously diagnosed lung diseases and that responsibility for compensating him should remain with birmingham.
the the same one who had presided over the earlier with birmingham,finding that hutchins had experienced additional exposure to injurious pulmonary stimuli at the shipyard up to and including at least that acute exacerbation on march,when biw was.accordingly,the judge modified the original ruling by awarding hutchins permanent total disability benefits and shifting responsibility for payments to biw.the board affirmed,and this appeal followed.biw continues to assert both procedural and substantive challenges to the ruling.
our review of the board decision is limited to legal issues,including the question of whether the board adhered to the substantial evidence standard when it reviewed the alj factual findings.bath iron works brown,cir bath iron works white,cir.
ii.procedural issues 
hutchins initiated the second,disability,phase of his lhwca case by filing a claim for compensation in august.in it,he identified the date of injury as may,the date established in the first proceeding by the alj who awarded hutchins medical benefits.biw maintains that,because no new injury was alleged,the only question before the alj was whether the earlier award should be modified upward to compensate hutchins for the change in his condition to total disability.in the company view,there was no basis for reconsidering the previous judgment that birmingham was the insurer responsible for hutchins benefits.biw argues that the company was unfairly ambushed by the unexpected scope of the proceedings,that the alj lacked authority to responsibility,and that the alj applied an incorrect legal standard in determining liability.we find the company arguments unpersuasive on each of these issues.
notice.we previously have taken a pragmatic view of notice requirements under the lhwca in light of the liberal construction enjoyed by the statute.see bath iron works director jones,cir.in jones,we deemed inconsequential the lack of a new injury claim under of the lhwca where the employee letter seeking modification of benefits and the modification proceedings themselves provided timely notice that he was asserting a new injury claim.id 
similarly here,biw knew the salient facts from early on that hutchins had completed a statement of injury form following the march,print room episode and that birmingham sought to cast off responsibility for hutchins payments based on new harmful exposures while biw was the only significant gap was that biw had no notice of,and did not participate in,hutchins deposition in the fall of.any disadvantage was subsequently remedied,however,when biw received a transcript of the deposition and was able to hutchins at the hearing before the alj.indeed,the alj expressed a willingness to offer additional access to hutchins before closing the record if biw argued that it was necessary.in these circumstances,we see no unfairness in the alj and board consideration of whether liability for hutchins payments should shift to biw.
scope of authority.biw maintains that,even if the company received adequate notice,the alj lacked the authority to liability for hutchins benefits in a modification proceeding,see,whose purpose it asserts is limited to exploring whether an employee compensation should be changed to reflect changes in his health or other circumstances.the company argues that,pursuant to principles of res judicata,the alj was bound by the prior administrative determination that birmingham was the responsible carrier.our jones case,at,dispenses with this assertion as well.there,as here,the alj confronted a claim of new injury in a modification proceeding,such injury was found,and the responsible carrier consequently changed from an insurance company to biw as a employer.id.
that decision was not aberrational.it is well established that traditional notions of res judicata do not govern modification proceedings,which may be brought whenever changed conditions or a mistake in a determination of fact makes such modification desirable in order to render justice under the act,shipyards,d per curiam quoting,see also banks chicago grain trimmers ass n,d jessee director,owcp,cir t he principle of finality just does not apply to longshore act claims as it does in ordinary lawsuits.the alj in considering the record of hutchins medical and employment history thus had broad discretion to revisit issues already decided and,if appropriate,to correct mistakes of fact,whether demonstrated by wholly new evidence,cumulative evidence,or merely further reflection on the evidence initially submitted,at.as the board conclude
