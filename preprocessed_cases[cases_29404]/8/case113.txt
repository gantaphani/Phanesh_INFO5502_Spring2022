lynch,circuit judge.
this case comes to us once again from the district of puerto rico.earlier,we reversed the dismissal of the action.garayalde rijos municipality of carolina,cir.the issue this time is whether the defendant offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure was properly accepted by the plaintiff such that the district court did not err in entering judgment for the plaintiff.no issue concerning rule d provision is presented.
on september,waleska garayalde rijos filed a complaint against the municipality of carolina carolina in the federal district court of puerto rico,alleging employment discrimination and retaliation.after we remanded the case,the trial date was set for december.
the key date for the purpose of this appeal is november.at pm that day,carolina extended to garayalde rijos what it explicitly labeled a rule offer of judgment for at pm,carolina informed the district court by electronic filing that no settlement had been reached.this was followed closely by a pm motion by garayalde rijos informing the district court that she was accepting carolina rule offer of judgment.carolina then made a motion to clarify,which asked the district court to withhold judgment on the basis that garayalde rijos had not been willing to accept some of its conditions and thus no agreement had been reached between the parties.the district court denied that motion and entered judgment for garayalde rijos on november.carolina then made a motion for reconsideration on december,claiming that because garayalde rijos had rejected the offer prior to purportedly accepting it,the offer should have been considered withdrawn.the district court denied that motion later that same day.this appeal followed.
carolina argues that the district court erred in entering judgment because garayalde rijos had already rejected the offer of judgment prior to informing the court of her acceptance.meanwhile,garayalde rijos argues that she never rejected the offer.we need not wade into this contested factual issue to resolve this appeal because even an express rejection does not terminate a rule offeree power to accept the offer within a period 
rule provides that a t least days before the date set for trial,a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms,with the costs then accrued.a.if the offer is accepted,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance,plus proof of service,at which time the clerk must enter judgment.id.a party decision not to accept a rule offer of judgment comes with consequences if the judgment that the offeree ultimately obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer,the offeree is on the hook for the offeror costs.id.d.
this rule was designed to encourage the settlement of private disputes.marek chesny,d.its mechanism for doing so is its provision,which enables an offeror to put pressure on the offeree to evaluate the likely value of her claim and think very hard about whether continued litigation is worthwhile.id.at.in return,rule guarantees the offeree fourteen days to contemplate the offer,as though the offeree had paid for a option.see richardson passenger.if the offeror were able to revoke the offer at any time,the offeror would be able to exert even greater settlement pressure than the rule contemplates,throwing off the rule rather finely tuned balance.see id.as a result,a number of federal courts have suggested that rule offers should be treated as irrevocable option contracts.id.at t he few federal courts that have considered the revocability of offers under rule have treated rule offers as at least generally irrevocable during the day period.see also colonial penn ins.coil,cir.commentators have also endorsed this rule.see,alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed simon,the riddle of rule,geo,udall,may offers of judgment under rule be revoked before acceptance.
federal courts have applied ordinary contract law principles to determine whether there has been a valid offer and acceptance under rule.see,andretti borla performance,cir arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cty.of albany,cir per curiam stewart prof l computer,cir radecki amoco oil,cir see also wright et,supra.under ordinary contract law principles,the irrevocable nature of a rule offer has particular significance neither a rejection nor a counteroffer terminates the offeree ability to accept a rule offer within the period.restatement second of contracts am.law inst linton corbin,corbin on contracts ed allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts ed see also kirkland sunrise opportunities,pope lil abner,d,butler smithfield foods,united states hendricks,c,wl,at.june.this conclusion is consistent with the language of rule itself,which recognizes only two types of offers offers accepted within fourteen days and offers not accepted within fourteen days and does not even contemplate a counteroffer or an affirmative rejection within the period.because garayalde rijos filed a timely acceptance,the district court entry of judgment was correct regardless of what took place in the contested series of exchanges between the parties in the time between the offer of judgment and garayalde rijos acceptance 
carolina argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by the text of rule b,which says that a n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.b.however,the rule that a rejection or counteroffer does not terminate the offeree power of acceptance does not contravene the text of the rule,which merely says that an offer is considered withdrawn if not accepted within the period.carolina also claims that our conclusion is at odds with the supreme court opinion in genesis healthcare symczyk,d.specifically,carolina points to the statement that the recipient rejection of an offer leaves the matter as if no offer had ever been made.id.at kagan,dissenting quoting minneapolis ry.columbus rolling mill.however,that statement comes from a part of justice kagan dissent discussing a completely unrelated issue an offeree rejection of a rule offer that would have afforded her complete relief and that rejection effect on the continued existence of a live controversy.id.at.a quote,particularly from a dissent that does not even remotely address the issue at hand,does not persuade us to reach the opposite conclusion.
in a further attempt to backtrack on its offer,carolina argues that its offer should not have been considered a proper rule offer,despite the fact that it was carolina itself that labeled its november,offer a rule offer of judgment.specifically,carolina argues that because its offer was not made a t least days before the date set for trial.a,the offer should have been considered a settlement offer that could not have led to entry of judgment without a joint request for settlement.however,this argument is waived because it was not raised in the district court in any of carolina motions objecting to garayalde rijos acceptance of the offer,or in its motion for reconsideration of entry of judgment.see curet vel√°zquez acemla de puerto rico,cir it is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court can not be surfaced for the first time on appeal.quoting mccoy.inst.of,cir.as a result,carolina attempt to take back its offer is to no avail.
for the reasons stated,the judgment is affirmed.costs are awarded against carolina.
the parties allege several subsequent events carolina offers an email that suggests that garayalde rijos extended a counteroffer to carolina at pm.garayalde rijos,for her part,offers an email that suggests that carolina responded to the counteroffer by renewing its original offer at pm.carolina claims that,in a subsequent phone call at pm,garayalde rijos rejected the original offer.however,because none of this information was presented to the district court,we do not consider these events in this appeal.
although it is not clear what standard of review we should apply to the district court entry of judgment,we need not decide that question because there was no error by the district court.
