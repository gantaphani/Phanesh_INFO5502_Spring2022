background 
in this dispute as to whether vcg was a customer of wcm within the meaning of the finra code with respect to the credit default swap in question,both sides moved for summary judgment.the following facts are drawn largely from the parties pleadings and their summary judgment filings and,unless otherwise noted,are not in dispute.
a.the credit default swap agreement 
at the times pertinent to this action,wcm was a registered and a member of finra or of one of its predecessor organizations,see part.below.wachovia bank was a national banking association and not a member of finra.vcg was a hedge fund with,by july,more than million in assets under management.vcg was run by a board of directors but had no employees services were provided to vcg by vanquish capital group llc vanquish capital,whose chief executive and investment officer was vcg board member donald uderitz.vcg investments were managed by vanquish advisors llc vanquish advisors,which was principally owned by uderitz.
in may,vanquish capital employee jonnathan wong,acting on behalf of vcg,contacted scott williams,a wcm employee,to initiate negotiations for a credit default swap agreement between vcg and wachovia bank with respect to a collateralized debt obligation cdo,to wit,notes issued by forge abs,llc forge,an unrelated entity.see generally eternity global master fund morgan guaranty trust,cir a credit default swap,the most common form of credit derivative,is a contract which transfers credit risk from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller internal quotation marks omitted.the eventual credit default swap agreement between vcg and wachovia bank the trade or agreement or credit default swap agreement required the bank the protection buyer to pay a fixed,periodic fee to vcg the protection seller over the term of the cdo in exchange for vcg agreement to make payments to the bank upon the occurrence of certain events,including a default by forge on the cdo.vcg was required to deposit with wachovia bank as collateral security for vcg obligations.
the agreement was memorialized in four separate documents.three dated may,were documents using international swaps and derivatives association isda templates,to wit an isda master agreement that set the general trading terms between the parties to govern their anticipated credit default swap,an isda master agreement schedule isda schedule that altered or supplemented the standard isda master agreement terms to fit the parties specifications,and a credit support annex to the isda master agreement credit support annex that provided the terms under which the parties would exchange collateral as part of the credit default swap.the fourth document was a trade confirmation dated may,trade confirmation that confirmed the specific terms of the parties forge credit default swap which had taken place on may,the trade confirmation incorporated by reference the terms of the three previously executed documents.the isda master agreement provided that all of these trade documents would constitute a single agreement between vcg and wachovia bank.
on behalf of vcg,the terms of the isda master agreement,the isda schedule,and the credit support annex were negotiated by vanquish capital general counsel,and those documents were executed by uderitz.on behalf of wachovia bank,the terms of those three documents were negotiated by alexis alpert,a wachovia bank vice president,who also executed those documents on behalf of the bank.the trade confirmation was executed by uderitz on behalf of vcg and by wachovia bank employee tracey bissell on behalf of the bank.the terms of the trade confirmation had been negotiated by wong on behalf of vcg and by wcm employees williams,thomas edwards,and william mcandrews.williams and edwards were directors of wcm cdo trading desk who reported to sergei zagin,the head of that desk mcandrews was both a director with wcm and an officer of wachovia bank all four had authority to negotiate credit default swaps on behalf of the bank.plaintiffs contend that williams,edwards,and mcandrews negotiated the terms of the trade confirmation on behalf of the bank.although vcg refused to admit that those three had negotiated on behalf of the bank,vcg did not point to evidence calling that contention into serious question.there is no dispute,for example,that wcm cdo desk was regularly engaged in trading credit default swaps on cdos,and that the party on one side of such trades was wachovia bank.vcg statement of material facts pursuant to rule,in support of its motion for summary judgment see plaintiffs response to defendant statement of material facts,admitting this portion of vcg assertion.wong,who had initiated discussions for the forge credit default swap on instructions from uderitz and another vcg board member,testified in deposition that he had contacted williams because williams was a friend he had known prior to working for vcg.before that call to williams,wong had had no interaction with anyone at wachovia with respect to the credit default swap.wong knew williams was employed by wachovia but did not know by which wachovia entity.after contacting williams,wong dealt principally with edwards and mcandrews wong also did not know which wachovia entity employed edwards or mcandrews.wong testified in part as follows 
q.in the course of your employment with vanquish capital,do you know whether you ever interacted with wachovia capital markets,llc 
i do know if i ever interacted with wachovia capital markets,llc.i was never really sure what entity i was essentially dealing with.
do you know what entity was the counter party to the cds trade 
from the document,wachovia bank.
emphasis added.
neither vanquish capital,which had negotiated the terms of all four trade documents on behalf of vcg,nor wcm,which had participated in the negotiation of the trade confirmation terms,was a party to the credit default swap or any of the four documents.
the isda master agreement,which contained a section detailing what e ach party represent ed to the other party isda master agreement,was augmented by the isda schedule,which added,inter alia,a section g,in which each party disclaimed any reliance on the other party,or on any of the other party affiliates,in deciding to enter the trade the disclaimer clause 
g non reliance.for any relevant agreement the party acknowledges that the other party acts only at arm length and is not its agent,broker,advisor or fiduciary in any respect,and any agency,brokerage,advisory or fiduciary services that the other party or any of its affiliates may otherwise provide to the party or to any of its affiliates excludes the relevant agreement,that it is relying solely upon its own evaluation of the relevant agreement and that it understands the relevant agreement and those risks,has determined they are appropriate for it,and willingly assumes those risks,and that it has not relied and will not be relying upon any evaluation or advice from the other party,its affiliates or the representatives or advisors of the other party or its affiliates except representations expressly made in the relevant agreement or an opinion of counsel required thereunder.
isda schedule part c emphases added.the disclaimer clause defined relevant agreement to mean this agreement,each transaction,each confirmation,any credit support document,and any agreement including any amendment,modification,transfer or early termination between the parties relating to any of the foregoing.id.the isda master agreement also included a merger clause stating that the agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto isda master agreement a.
vcg court action against wachovia bank 
in november,after a dispute between the parties had arisen over the extent of vcg obligation to provide collateral under the agreement,vcg commenced an action against wachovia bank in new york state supreme court,alleging,inter alia,fraud,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.wcm was not named as a defendant in that action.wachovia bank promptly removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york,see cdo plus master fund wachovia bank,civ.vcg wb,and counterclaimed for breach of contract.
in july,the district court dismissed all of vcg claims against wachovia bank in vcg wb except a claim for breach of contract.see wl,at.in august,the court granted summary judgment in that action in favor of wachovia bank,dismissing vcg claim and upholding the bank counterclaim.see wl,at.
c.the present action and the decision of the district court 
in the meantime,in may,vcg had initiated against wcm the finra arbitration that is the subject of the present action.vcg alleged,inter alia,that wcm had fraudulently induced vcg to enter into the trade and had breached the finra conduct rules and its own fiduciary duties.see vcg finra dispute resolution statement of claim at.wachovia bank was not named as a respondent in vcg arbitration claim.
wachovia bank and wcm jointly commenced the present action in june,seeking to enjoin the finra arbitration on the grounds that the arbitration was duplicative of vcg lawsuit against wachovia bank,which was then still pending in the district court,and that the finra arbitration could not proceed because vcg neither had an arbitration agreement with wcm nor was a customer of wcm within the meaning of the finra code,which requires a member to arbitrate disputes in connection with the member business activities when requested to do so by its customer.
following a period of discovery in the present action,the parties filed for summary judgment,submitting papers including excerpts from depositions in vcg wb that disclosed the events described in part above.in an opinion and order reported at wl,civ,the district court granted vcg summary judgment motion and denied the motion of wachovia bank and wcm.
the district court ruled that,because edwards and williams were employed exclusively by wcm,their role in negotiating the trade was sufficient to implicate wcm in the deal in a manner that made vcg wcm customer.the court stated that 
it is undisputed that williams and edwards were employed exclusively by wcm and their duties in that capacity included facilitating the trade as wachovia bank representatives.while they may well have represented wachovia bank,they were clearly performing services for wcm in so doing.thus,there is no factual issue as to whether wcm,as an entity,was involved in the transaction 
here,williams and edwards were employees solely of wcm their interactions with vcg representatives bring vcg within the broad scope of the term customer as used in finra rule the business activities language of finra rule is again quite broad,excluding only the insurance business activities of a member that is also an insurance company.this insurance is indicative of the sweep of the rule,and negates any implication that its arbitration mandate is limited to matters arising in traditional brokerage or advisory customer relationships.
wl,at first emphasis in original other emphases added.
the district court rejected plaintiffs contention that vcg could not be deemed a wcm customer in light of vcg acknowledgement in the disclaimer clause that it had not relied on wcm for advice.the court noted that the finra definition of customer provides that that term does not include brokers and dealers,and it stated that the fact that that is the sole stated exclusion suggests that finra intended to require its members to arbitrate disputes with the full array of parties with whom they have business dealings,without limiting the scope of the rule to parties who reasonably relied on the finra member for impartial advice.id.at.the court concluded that the fact that vcg could not have reasonably relied on wcm for impartial advice was inapposite to the question of vcg customer status.id.
the court directed the parties to proceed to finra arbitration,id.at,and dismissed plaintiffs complaint.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,wachovia bank and wcm contend,inter alia,that given the present record,including vcg representations in the disclaimer clause,the district court should have granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs rather than vcg.vcg urges us either to dismiss the appeal on the ground of mootness because plaintiffs have not sought a stay of the district court decision pending appeal and wcm has participated in the ongoing finra arbitration see vcg brief on appeal at,or to affirm on the grounds that because wcm employees were conducting some of the negotiations wcm induced or shepherded vcg investment id.at,and that if there is any ambiguity as to whether vcg was wcm customer,our decision in john hancock life ins.wilson,cir john hancock,requires that the ambiguity be resolved in favor of arbitration vcg brief on appeal at.we conclude,given the factual record in this case,that plaintiffs arguments have merit and that the district court should have granted summary judgment in their favor.
we note first that vcg contentions as to mootness and the thrust of john hancock have already been rejected by this court.as to the former,vcg moved for dismissal of the present appeal on the ground of mootness or for permission to supplement the record that motion was pending when vcg filed its brief.its motion was thereafter denied by a panel of this court,both orally in open court on march,and in a confirming written order entered on march.accordingly,vcg present mootness contention is itself moot.as to vcg assertion that john hancock requires that finra arbitration be ordered notwithstanding any doubts about the scope of an arbitration provision,that contention was advanced by vcg in a similar action involving its participation in a different credit default swap and was rejected.see citigroup global markets,vcg special opportunities master fund,cir citigroup vcg.
as for vcg assertion that wcm induced or shepherded vcg investment in the credit default swap with wachovia bank,we reject that contention because,for the reasons that follow,it is squarely contradicted by the record.
standards of review 
summary judgment 
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against which summary judgment was granted and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.see,fabozzi lexington insurance,cir.we will affirm the judgment only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
when each side has moved for summary judgment,the district court in entertaining the motions and the court of appeals in reviewing the district court decisions are required to assess each motion on its own merits a
