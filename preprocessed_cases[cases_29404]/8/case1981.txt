the,alan arnold arnold,individually and doing business as mccauley trucking company,appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york amon,dismissing,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arnold complaint i alleging that,the trustees and fiduciaries of the local pension fund,unlawfully denied arnold pension benefits and ii seeking various forms of legal and equitable relief therefor.on appeal,arnold contends,inter alia,that the district court erred in concluding that arnold was not an employee as defined by erisa that he maintained a plan that was not an employee benefit plan under erisa and,therefore,that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking.
for the reasons that follow,we find that the district court erred in focusing entirely on the wrong question.the question of primary jurisdictional significance is not whether arnold was an employer,which implicates his ability to establish an employee benefits plan under erisa,but whether the pension benefits plan maintained by the trustees of the local pension fund is an employee benefits plan,pursuant to a.we conclude that it is.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
background 
a.the fund 
the,anthony storz,daniel gallo,william turis,harvey lucks,and john zak collectively,defendants,are or were trustees and fiduciaries of the local pension fund collectively,the fund,which,at all relevant times,was a jointly administered,trust fund operated pursuant to the terms of various collective bargaining and trust agreements.in accordance with those trust agreements and certain rules and regulations pertaining thereto,the trustees of the fund the trustees have provided health and pension benefits to beneficiaries of the fund,including union members,retirees,and their dependents,on whose behalf contributions to the fund were made.such contributions are and were made pursuant to the terms of each contributing entity collective bargaining agreement,or agreements,with truck drivers local union local or the union,which is affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers of america.
arnold,mccauley trucking,and local 
mccauley trucking company mccauley is or was an unincorporated entity that was established in and at all relevant times maintained a business address in the county of suffolk,state of new york.arnold worked for mccauley and,in fact,was both its sole owner and only employee.soon after first doing business as mccauley in,arnold was informed by someone affiliated with local that,in order to transport freight by truck within new york state,arnold would have to become a member of the union.that same year,mccauley executed with local the first of a series of collective bargaining agreements collectively,the cba,which took the form of national master freight agreements and supplemental agreements for the metropolitan new jersey area.the cba covered the period from through march.
in,pursuant to the cba,arnold became a member of local,and his company,mccauley,began to make contributions to the fund in amounts that were based on the number of hours worked by,or wages paid to,employees of mccauley who performed work covered by the cba.as noted above,arnold was mccauley sole employee.he worked approximately three to four days per week,and,initially,mccauley contributions to the fund on arnold behalf were based on the actual number of hours that arnold worked.
in,however,local demanded arbitration,pursuant to the cba,seeking additional contributions from mccauley on arnold behalf.following the arbitration,the arbitrator ruled that arnold,as of mccauley,was obligated to contribute to the fund on the basis of hours per month,or hours per quarter,regardless of whether the actual number of hours worked by employees of mccauley dropped below that threshold.the arbitration award was subsequently confirmed in the supreme court of the state of new york,queens county.accordingly,mccauley reimbursed the fund for all unpaid contributions on arnold behalf,retroactive to,for a total of.
from until,when arnold membership in local was terminated unilaterally,as discussed below,mccauley continued to make payments to the fund on arnold behalf.throughout,arnold maintained that a contribution based on hours per month was more than twice the minimum contribution necessary for participation in the fund.during this period,mccauley submitted monthly remittances to local in the amounts ordered in the arbitration award,and arnold received yearly updates from the fund,indicating his total pension credit.in total,mccauley contributed to the fund on arnold behalf.
sometime in,the fund apparently conducted a payroll audit of mccauley.by letter from counsel for the trustees,dated march,arnold was informed of this recent audit and that it had brought to the attention of the trustees the fact that arnold was the only individual for whom contributions were being made by mccauley to the fund.in the march letter,the trustees requested that arnold provide them with detailed information regarding his title and percentage interest in mccauley.
in a pair of letters that arnold wife wrote on his behalf to local,dated april,arnold requested information regarding the total amount of his contributions to the fund,as well as a copy of the rules and regulations of the fund and any changes thereto that may have occurred since.arnold demanded that he receive the full health and pension benefits to which he was entitled as a result of having contributed to the fund for almost years.
local response came by letter from alfred fernandez,a representative of the trustees,dated april,stating that mccauley owners,officers,and supervisors were not permitted to be members of its bargaining unit and that,for this reason,arnold was not eligible to participate in either the health plan or the pension plan collectively,the local plan maintained by the trustees.notably,fernandez also stated in the april letter that the trustees had only recently become aware that arnold was the sole proprietor and only employee of mccauley.in addition,the letter stated that arnold health and pension coverage had to be terminated effective immediately and that n o further contributions would be accepted by the fund on arnold behalf.finally,the letter informed arnold that he had a right to appeal the decision pursuant to the provisions of the local plan.two days later,by letter dated april,local informed arnold that d ue to the fact that he was not an employee as defined by the national labor relations act,his membership in local was terminated immediately.
the april letter from alfred fernandez represented the first communication from the trustees,written or otherwise,informing arnold of their position that he was not eligible to participate in the fund.as of january,arnold had accrued over years of pension credit through his contributions to the fund.
arnold sought a review of the trustees denial of benefits,but the trustees maintained that arnold was not eligible to participate in the local plan.through april the parties continued to correspond regarding their dispute over arnold pension benefits.by letter dated april,as a final effort to resolve the dispute,the trustees offered to pay mccauley the amount of representing a full return of contributions made on arnold behalf,though without any of the accumulated interest.the april letter made clear,however,that it remained the trustees position that,according to the rules and agreements governing the local plan,arnold was not eligible to receive pension benefits pursuant to that plan.
