plaintiff joshua fensterstock commenced this action asserting claims on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,alleging that defendants education finance partners efp and affiliated computer services,acs,have engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices in connection with the solicitation,consolidation,and servicing of student loans.acs appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,thomas griesa,judge,denying its motion which was joined by efp to stay the action and compel fensterstock a to submit his claims to arbitration,and b to do so on an individual basis,not a class basis,in accordance with the terms of his loan agreement with efp.the district court denied defendants motion on the ground that,under california law,the arbitration clause of the agreement is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.on appeal,acs contends principally that the arbitration clause is not unconscionable under california law,or that if it is,then california law is preempted by the federal arbitration act faa,et,under which the clause is not unconscionable.for the reasons that follow,we disagree and affirm the order of the district court.
background 
the factual assertions in the complaint and in the submissions with respect to the motion to compel arbitration,accepted as true for the purposes of this appeal,show the following.fensterstock is an attorney who graduated from law school in and was admitted to practice law in new york state in.efp,a california corporation headquartered in california,specializes in private student loans and is the holder of fensterstock consolidated loan.acs is a corporation that services loans for efp.
fensterstock loan and the allocation of his payments 
in,fensterstock responded to a solicitation from efp offering to consolidate his student loans in a single loan.fensterstock executed an efp private consolidation loan application and promissory note the note,and he received a loan in the principal amount of at a fixed rate of interest equal to per annum.the note,defining you and your to mean union bank of california,pursuant to agreements with education finance partners,and assigns,and defining i and me as the borrower note,terms and conditions statement at,provided,inter alia,that t his note will be deemed to have been made in california,and your decision on whether to lend me money will be made in california and that the provisions of this note will be governed by federal laws and the laws of the state of california,without regard to conflict of laws rules id.at.
fensterstock repayment period began on october,he was to repay the loan over a period of approximately years,with monthly payments of,each due on the of the month,for a total of including interest see complaint,plus one final payment of see id,due on october.the note stated that payments would be applied first to charges,costs and fees,next to unpaid interest,and then to principal.note,terms and conditions statement at.
beginning october,fensterstock made timely payments on the loan he was not subject to any charges,costs,or fees.through december,he had paid a total of.according to what fensterstock refers to as t he amortization schedule,complaint,a total of of that amount should have been applied to reduce the loan unpaid principal see id.after learning that only had been applied to principal see id,fensterstock inquired of acs and was informed that when his payment was rec eived prior to the day of the month in which it was due,his entire payment was treated as a payment of interest only see id.
b.the complaint and the motion to compel arbitration 
in april,fensterstock commenced the present action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,asserting claims under california law a against efp and acs for breach of contract,fraud,and unfair business practices,and b against efp for false and deceptive advertising practices.the complaint alleges that efp engaged in a scheme of deception by intentionally failing to disclose to borrowers that unless their payments were received on the precise day of the month on which they were due,efp and acs would alter the amortization schedule prescribed apportionment of the payment between interest and principal,divert ing the entire payment to themselves as interest and thereby prevent ing borrowers from paying off the principal of their loans.complaint.the complaint alleges that,through december,the amount of fensterstock payments that had been misallocated to interest totaled,and that if misallocations referred to by fensterstock as the hidden penalty or the amortization penalty,id.et continued at that rate,fensterstock would be required to make an enormous payment at the end of his repayment period,amount ing to thousands of dollars,not as stated in the note.id.premising subject matter jurisdiction on class action diversity of citizenship,see d,the complaint alleges that the value of the aggregate claims of all class members will exceed million.see complaint.
the complaint alleges that the case should be certified as a class action because,inter alia,the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable and the relatively small amount of damages suffered by each class member may make it economically impractical for class members to prosecute individual actions.see id.the complaint also alleges that although the note contains an arbitration clause stating that c laims made as part of a class action or other representative action are subject to arbitration,and the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual nonclass,basis id.quoting note,terms and conditions statement at alterations in complaint,the clause is part of a contract of adhesion and should be declared void as against public policy see,complaint.
acs,subsequently joined by efp,moved for an order staying the action and compelling fensterstock to submit his claims to arbitration and to pursue them on an individual,rather than a class,basis.it attached to its motion,inter alia,a copy of the note,whose arbitration clause begins as follows 
arbitration of disputes.please read this arbitration provision carefully.it provides that either you or i can require that any controversy or dispute be resolved by binding arbitration except for matters that are excluded from arbitration as specified below.arbitration replaces the right to go to court,including the right to a jury and the right to participate in a class action or similar proceeding.
note,terms and conditions statement at.to the extent pertinent here,the clause goes on to provide as follows 
agreement to arbitrate you and i agree that either you or i may,without the other consent,require that any claims between you and me be submitted to mandatory,binding arbitration except for certain matters excluded below.this arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,and shall be governed by,and enforceable under,the federal arbitration act the faa,et,and to the extent state law is applicable,the state law governing this transaction.
claims subject to arbitration include,but are not limited to 
claims made as part of a class action or other representative action,and the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual,basis.if you or i require arbitration of a particular claim,neither you,me sic,nor any other person may pursue the claim in any litigation,whether as a class action,private attorney general action,other representative action or otherwise.
severability,survival 
if any portion of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable,the remaining portions shall nevertheless remain in force.
id.at.defendants contended that,in light of these provisions,the faa required the court to stay the action and compel fensterstock to submit his claims,individually,rather than on a class basis,to arbitration.
defendants disputed the complaint allegations that the note was a contract of adhesion whose terms fensterstock had had no meaningful choice complaint but to accept,and disputed his contention that the arbitration clause is unconscionable and against public policy.they pointed out,inter alia,that when fensterstock entered into the loan agreement he was a practicing lawyer seeking to consolidate his existing loans,not a student whose education might be interrupted absent a loan.they also argued that fensterstock was an unusually sophisticated borrower,submitting as evidence,inter alia,a june,printout of the description of fensterstock on the internet website of the law firm with which he was associated,which stated as follows 
joshua fensterstock practices primarily in the area of real estate law including,negotiating contracts,drafting commercial leases,and representing clients at closings of purchases and sales of residential and commercial properties.joshua is also involved in the firm corporate practice.
before joining isaacs associates,joshua was employed as an associate at a firm where he represented lenders at the closings of purchases of residential and commercial properties.prior to his work in the private sector,joshua served as counsel to the nassau county comptroller.
joshua was admitted to practice law in new york dep t in and received his magna cum laude from the state university of new york at albany in,where he majored in business administration.
declaration of edward lend dated june,exhibit d see also id.june,printout of fensterstock description of himself on the linkedin website,stating that his s pecialties include diverse financing transactions including bridge loans,revolving credit facilities,and leasehold mortgage loans.
fensterstock opposed the motions,arguing principally that the arbitration clause is unconscionable.he also contended that acs lacked standing to seek arbitration because it was not a party to the note.acs,in response,argued that the nature of fensterstock claims against breach of the contract between fensterstock and him from making the standing argument.
c.the decision of the district court 
in an opinion dated march,reported at d,the district court denied defendants motions to stay the action and compel arbitration.the court noted that although the faa generally requires the court to stay a pending federal action in order to enforce an arbitration agreement between the parties,that requirement does not apply if the agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable on grounds such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.see d at.applying california law to the question of enforceability,the district court noted that the supreme court of california had 
held that when an arbitration clause requires a consumer to waive the right to bring claims on behalf of a class,that waiver is unconscionable if the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion,in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.under such circumstances,the waiver is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.it is procedurally unconscionable because it is found in a contract of adhesion,in which the party with superior bargaining power drafts the contract and requires the other party to either accept or reject the contract in full it is substantively unconscionable because such waivers are indisputably because they operate to insulate a potential defendant from liability since any one plaintiff damages will usually be too small to justify bringing an individual claim.
id.at quoting and citing discover bank superior court,cal th.the district court found that the note in the present case met all of those criteria.the district court rejected defendants contention that the note arbitration clause could not be found unconscionable given fensterstock sophistication,stating that although california courts had 
occasionally declined to find procedural unconscionability in contracts of adhesion based on the sophistication of a party and the availability of alternative contracts free of the terms claimed to be unconscionable,
d at quoting dean witter reynolds,superior court,d,dist,the sophistication of a party,alone,can not defeat a procedural unconscionability claim,d at quoting nagrampa mailcoups,cir en banc.the district court stated that defendants had made no showing here that plaintiff could have obtained a consolidation loan that did not contain a similar class action arbitration provision,d at.the court also rejected defendants contention that the damages suffered by individual class members would be sufficiently large to justify pursuit of their claims individually.see id.at.
having found the arbitration clause unconscionable,the district court saw no need to reach the question of whether acs had standing to compel arbitration.
d.the issues on this appeal 
acs has appealed.efp,although it joined acs motion in the district court,has not appealed.accordingly,there is no longer any contractual challenge to fensterstock entitlement to litigate his claims against efp in the district asserted against both efp and acs or against efp to litigate them on a class basis.
acs principally contends on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that the arbitration clause is unconscionable under california law or,alternatively,in failing to rule that the arbitration clause is not unconscionable under the faa and that the faa preempts california law.fensterstock,in addition to defending the district court holdings,contends that acs lacks standing to compel him to arbitrate his claims against acs because acs is not a party to the note.
like the district court,we need not reach the issue of standing because,even assuming that acs has standing,we conclude for the reasons that follow that the class arbitration waiver is unconscionable and unenforceable under california law according to principles that are applicable to contracts generally,and that california law is therefore not preempted by the faa.
ii.discussion 
a.the faa and the enforceability of arbitration agreements 
to the extent pertinent to this appeal,of the faa provides,in essence,that in any contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce,a written provision agreeing to submit to arbitration a controversy arising out of the contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.emphasis added.faa and provide generally that if an action is brought in federal court on an issue that is referable to arbitration under such an agreement,the court,upon a timely motion by a proper party,is to stay the action until completion of arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement,see id,and is to order that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement,id.see generally animalfeeds international corp.congress purpose in enacting the faa was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,see,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior university,volt southland keating.
t he interpretation of an arbitration agreement is generally a matter of state law.at,and the faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration,volt,at.however,
even when congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area,state law may nonetheless be to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal is,to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.section precludes state laws whether of legislative or judicial origin that invalidate arbitration provisions on any basis that is applicable only to arbitration provisions.doctor associates.casarotto,doctor associates quoting perry thomas,emphasis in doctor associates.but generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening.doctor associates,at emphases added.
applicable principles of california law 
arbitration agreements and agreements in general 
under california law see note,terms and conditions at the provisions of this note will be governed by federal laws and the laws of the state of california,without regard to conflict of laws rules,contracts that are exculpatory may be unconscionable and unenforceable.the california civil code provides as follows 
all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.
cal.west emphases added.
this principle is often a consideration in the justifications for class action lawsuits.discover bank superior court,cal th,discover bank.
frequently numerous consumers are exposed to the same dubious practice by the same seller so that proof of the prevalence of the practice as to one consumer would provide proof for all.individual actions by each of the defrauded consumers is often impracticable because the amount of individual recovery would be insufficient to justify bringing a separate action thus an unscrupulous seller retains the benefits of its wrongful conduct.a class action by consumers produces several salutary,including a therapeutic effect upon those sellers who indulge in fraudulent practices,
id.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.a company which wrongfully exacts a dollar from each of millions of customers will reap a handsome profit the class action is often the only effective way to halt and redress such exploitation.id.internal quotation marks omitted see,amchem products,windsor.
discover bank involved a class action brought by a credit card holder alleging that the issuer,discover bank or the bank,
had a practice of representing to cardholders that late payment fees would not be assessed if payment was received by a certain date,whereas in actuality they were assessed if payment was received after on that date,thereby leading to damages that were small as to individual consumers but large in the aggregate.
cal th at,at.the applicable credit card agreement provided,inter alia,that either the cardholder or the bank could elect arbitration that in the event of such an election,neither side would have the right to litigate the dispute in court and that neither could conduct arbitration as a member or representative of a class.see id.at,at.the court initially,applying delaware law,granted a motion by the bank to compel arbitration on an individual basis.upon reconsideration following the decision in szetela discover bank,d dist szetela finding a virtually identical arbitration provision unconscionable under california law,cert.denied,the court held the class action waiver clause unenforceable it concluded that the plaintiff was required to submit to arbitration but that he could seek to do so on a class basis.on appeal by the bank,the court of appeal did not rule on unconscionability but held that the california rule that class arbitration waivers are sometimes unconscionable was preempted by the faa.see generally discover bank,cal th at,at.
the california supreme court reversed the preemption ruling,noting,inter alia,that 
at least under some circumstances,the law in california is that class action waivers in consumer contracts of adhesion are unenforceable,whether the consumer is being asked to waive the right to class action litigation or the right to classwide arbitration.
id.at,at emphases added.pointing out that under faa a state court may refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement based on generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,id.at,at internal quotation marks omitted,the discover bank court noted that california law,like federal law,favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements,id.at,at internal quotation marks omitted but california law abhors contracts that are unconscionable,whether or not they involve arbitration.the court concluded that the faa did not preempt the california principle that unconscionable arbitration waiver clauses are unenforceable because 
the principle that class action waivers are,under certain circumstances,unconscionable as unlawfully exculpatory is a principle of california law that does not specifically apply to arbitration agreements,but to contracts generally.in other words,it applies equally to class action litigation waivers in contracts without arbitration agreements as it does to class arbitration waivers in contracts with such agreements.
id.at,at emphases added.
accordingly,since california law place s arbitration agreements with class action waivers on the exact same footing as contracts that bar class action litigation outside the context of arbitration,shroyer new cingular wireless services,cir shroyer emphasis in original,we reject acs contention that the faa preempts california principles as to the conscionability of class arbitration waivers.
unconscionability under california law 
we turn next to the standard by which courts determine,under california law,whether a contract clause is unconscionable.as described in discover bank,the california doctrine of unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.discover bank,cal th at,at internal quotation marks omitted.the component of surprise arises when the challenged terms are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.nyulassy lockheed martin,d,dist internal quotation marks omitted.however,surprise need not be shown w here an adhesive contract is oppressive.id.internal quotation marks omitted.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power that results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice nagrampa mailcoups,cir en banc nagrampa internal quotation marks omitted see,szetela.at,d at a clause is oppressive w hen the weaker party is presented the clause and told to take it or leave it without the opportunity for meaningful negotiation.
the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.
discover bank,cal th at,at internal quotation marks omitted.under california law,a contract of adhesion is defined as a standardized contract,imposed upon the subscribing party without an opportunity to negotiate the terms.shroyer,at internal quotation marks omitted.ordinary contracts of adhesion,although they are indispensable facts of modern life that are generally enforced,contain a degree of procedural unconscionability even without any notable surprises,and bear within them the clear danger of oppression and overreaching.gentry superior court,cal th,gentry quoting graham,cal d,cert.denied.the fact that alternative contracts were potentially available does not mean that the contract is not one of adhesion.see,szetela.at,d at a contract might be adhesive even if the weaker party could reject the terms and go elsewhere.internal quotation marks omitted.
substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.discover bank,cal th at,at internal quotation marks omitted.these include terms that are superficially.for example,although the arbitration clause in discover bank precluded the bank,as well as the cardholder,from participating in classwide arbitration or pursuing claims in a representative capacity,the court noted that 
such class action or arbitration waivers are indisputably.although styled as a mutual prohibition on representative or class actions,it is difficult to envision the circumstances under which the provision might negatively impact discover bank,because credit card companies typically do not sue their customers in class action lawsuits such,exculpatory contracts in a contract of adhesion,at least to the extent they operate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise would be imposed under california law,are generally unconscionable.
id.at,at internal quotation marks omitted see also cohen directv,d,dist a class action waiver is indisputably if the more powerful party would have no occasion to use the class action device in disputes with its customers internal quotation marks omitted.
although the california courts inquire into both procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability,the two aspects 
need not be present in the same degree.essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.williston on contracts ed,in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.
armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz emphasis added see,gentry,cal th at,at same dean witter reynolds,superior court,d,dist dean witter reynolds presumably both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present before a contract will be held unenforceable.however,a relatively larger degree of one will compensate for a relatively smaller degree of the other.
in dean witter reynolds,which involved a class action waiver provision invoked against a challenge to the legality of a fee charged by a brokerage firm for individual retirement accounts,the firm concede d for purposes of argument that some measure of substantive unconscionability might be present,that the challenged fees might be too high,d at.at.but the court concluded that the class action waiver was enforceable because there was no procedural unconscionability,stating that the oppression factor of the procedural element of unconscionability may be defeated,if the complaining party has a meaningful choice of reasonably available alternative sources of supply from which to obtain the desired goods and services free of the terms claimed to be unconscionable.id.at.at.stating that w e do not hold or suggest that any showing of competition in the market place as to the desired goods and services defeats,as a matter of law,any claim of unconscionability.at emphases in original,the court ruled that procedural unconscionability had not been shown in the case before it,given that the plaintiff was a sophisticated investor,was an attorney who specializ ed in class action litigation involving financial institutions.at,and had known of,but consciously declined to explore,potential alternatives,see id.at.at.
taking account of its dean witter reynolds decision nearly two decades later,the court in gatton usa,d,dist gatton,cert.denied,declined to rule that a finding of procedural unconscionability was precluded simply by the availability of alternatives.the gatton court acknowledged that 
w here the plaintiff is highly sophisticated and the challenged provision does not undermine important public policies,a court might be justified in denying an unconscionability claim for lack of procedural unconscionability even where the provision is within a contract of adhesion.
at,d at emphases added.but it noted that 
there are provisions so unfair or contrary to public policy that the law will not allow them to be imposed in a contract of adhesion,even if theoretically the consumer had an opportunity to discover and use an alternate provider for the good or service involved.
id.at,d at.the gatton court concluded that 
absent unusual circumstances,use of a contract of adhesion establishes a minimal degree of procedural unconscionabilitv notwithstanding the availability of market alternatives.if the challenged provision does not have a high degree of substantive unconscionability,it should be enforced.but courts are not obligated to enforce highly unfair provisions that undermine important public policies simply because there is some degree of consumer choice in the market.
d at footnote omitted emphases added.in the face of such highly unfair provisions,t he adhesive nature of the contract alone justifies scrutiny of the substantive fairness of the contractual terms.id.at,d at.in sum,
b ecause california courts employ a sliding scale in analyzing whether the entire arbitration provision is unconscionable,even if the evidence of procedural unconscionability is slight,strong evidence of substantive unconscionability will tip the scale and render the arbitration provision unconscionable.
nagrampa,at emphasis added see,armendariz,cal th at,at.
in discover bank,the court noted that c lass action and arbitration waivers are not,in the abstract,exculpatory clauses,cal th at,at,and that not all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable,id.at,at.
but when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.
cal th at,at emphases added.a provider insistence on an arbitration provision that gives it the opportunity to overcharge its customers by small amounts while denying the customers any effective way to recover violates fundamental notions of fairness and is not only substantively unconscionable,it violates public policy by granting the provider a get out of jail free card while compromising important consumer rights.id.at,at other internal quotation marks omitted.the potential for millions of customers to be overcharged small amounts without an effective method of redress can not be ignored.id.other internal quotation marks omitted.
summarizing discover bank and subsequent california appellate decisions interpreting it,the ninth circuit in shroyer has discerned a standard 
inquiry in order to determine whether a class action waiver in a consumer contract is unconscionable under this inquiry,courts are required to determine whether the agreement is a consumer contract of adhesion drafted by a party that has superior bargaining power whether the agreement occurs in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages and whether it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.
shroyer,at internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the answers to these three inquiries here lead to a conclusion of unconscionability.
the note in the present case 
in the present case,acs contends that a ruling that the note is unconscionable under california law is precluded by the facts that 
fensterstock was an attorney who specialized in complex financial transactions when he entered the note he has not alleged that there were no loans on the market that did not include a class arbitration waiver he claims enormous damages of thousands of dollars and he has not alleged that he,an attorney,was surprised by the class arbitration waiver of the note he signed.
acs brief on appeal at see,id.at.most of these proposed rationales are foreclosed by the authorities discussed in part.above.
it is true that fensterstock has not alleged that he was surprised by the class arbitration waiver clause in the note and one would surely expect that,as a practicing attorney,he would,before signing,have read the note five pages of terms and conditions,including the arbitration provision,the first paragraph of which was printed entirely in capital letters.but,as discussed
