defendants filed motions for summary judgment on october.the district court ruled on the pending motions for summary judgment in a pair of orders issued on september,one of which addressed the summary judgment motion made by christopher morano and kevin kane the state defendants,and the other of which addressed the summary judgment motion made by patrick harnett,daryl roberts,and the city of hartford the city defendants.in one order,the district court granted the state defendants summary judgment.in the other,the district court granted the city defendants summary judgment on one claim,the substantive due process claim,but it denied without prejudice their motion for summary judgment on the other claim,the supervisory liability claim against harnett.on november,the city defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on the supervisory liability claim raised against harnett,which the district court granted on august.the august,order stated that the clerk shall close this case.dist.ecf,at.on september,elliott filed a notice of appeal.that notice states 
notice is hereby given that sandra elliott,and as administratrix of the estate,plaintiffs defendants in the case,hereby appeal to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit from the final judgment from an order describing it entered in this action on the day of august.
dist.ecf footnote omitted.five days later,on september,the district court clerk of court issued judgment in favor of defendants.elliott did not seek to amend the notice of appeal.however,elliott brief on appeal challenges rulings made by the district court in its september,orders,in addition to its august,order.
discussion 
in this opinion,we consider whether elliott notice of appeal grants us jurisdiction over the september,orders,in addition to the august,order,and we conclude that it does.
a notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.app.c b.this requirement is jurisdictional.gonzalez thaler,d.however,it is well settled that courts should apply a liberal interpretation to that requirement.conway village of mount kisco,cir.further,a notice of appeal filed by a pro se litigant must be viewed liberally,and not every technical defect in a notice of appeal constitutes a jurisdictional defect.grune coughlin,cir citations omitted.our task,therefore,is to interpret the notice of appeal so as to remain faithful to the intent of the appellant,fair to the appellee,and consistent with the jurisdictional authority of this court.conway,at.accordingly,a s long as the pro se party notice of appeal evinces an intent to appeal an order or judgment of the district court and appellee has not been prejudiced or misled by the notice,the notice technical deficiencies will not bar appellate jurisdiction.grune,at.
keeping in mind this background,we hold that,in the absence of prejudice to an appellee,we read a pro se appellant appeal from an order closing the case as constituting an appeal from all prior orders.such a reading flows naturally from our precedent.in phelps kapnolas,cir,our court considered the effects of a pro se appellant merely listing the date of the final judgment in his notice of appeal.there,the district court issued an order on december,that dismissed five defendants from the case the district court issued a separate order on january,granting the remaining defendant motion to dismiss.id.at.we held that it was not crucial that the appellant pro se notice of appeal did not specify either of the orders,and infer red from the appeal of the final judgment that the appellant mean t to contest the earlier dismissal against the five defendants,as well as the dismissal against the final defendant.id.at.
conway is also instructive.there,the notice of appeal was filed by former counsel on april,and stated that an appeal was being taken from an order dated march,granting defendant martabanos motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint and from each and every part of said order.at.a prior district court order,dated january,granted the motion to dismiss made by another defendant,cerbone.id.the january,order could not be appealed until the district court disposed of the remaining claims against the remaining parties,absent a certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,which was never made.id.but the notice of appeal did not mention the january,order,only the march,order.id.observing that we are to apply a liberal interpretation to the rule c requirement,our court held that this omission is of no consequence.id.we concluded 
w e should review the dismissal of the claims against cerbone.the order dated march,dismissed the complaint in all respects.it is perfectly clear that the plaintiff had no desire to abandon the adverse disposition of her claims against cerbone h er notice of appeal reflects the intent to appeal all adversely determined dispositions from which an appeal could lawfully be taken at the time her notice of appeal was filed.
id.at footnote omitted.in support of the proposition that the appellant had no desire to abandon the adverse disposition of her claims against cerbone,id.at,we noted that this was manifest not only on inspection of her brief on appeal but her supplemental affidavit dated september,id.at.
so it is here.the first september,order addressed the motion for summary judgment by the city defendants,and granted the motion in part and denied it in part,without prejudice.the second september,order granted the motion for summary judgment by the state defendants.the august,order granted the city defendants renewed motion for summary judgment.because claims remained against the city defendants,elliott was unable to appeal either of the september,orders until after the issuance of the august,order,which granted defendants summary judgment on the remaining claims and ordered the clerk to close this case.dist.ecf,at.it is further evident from elliott brief that she intended to appeal rulings in the september,orders,in addition to the august,order,as she challenges numerous rulings made by the district court in its september orders.
finally,there is no indication that any appellee is prejudiced by our broad reading of the notice of appeal.all filed briefs defending the merits of the district court september,and august,orders.indeed,no defendant argued that we are precluded from reviewing the septembe
