plaintiff appellant gregory goodrich goodrich is an employee of defendant appellee the long island rail road company lirr.on march,he brought suit under the federal employers liability act fela,et,against his employer,the lirr,and two individual defendants,alleging claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress nied and intentional infliction of emotional distress iied against each of the three defendants.he appeals from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,granting the lirr motion to dismiss his complaint,including his iied claim against the lirr,for failure to state a claim.because we hold that the district court correctly concluded that a plaintiff bringing a claim for iied under fela is required to satisfy the zone of danger test outlined by the supreme court in consolidated rail gottshall,we affirm.
background 
in reviewing the district court grant of a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,we accept as true the nonconclusory factual allegations made by goodrich in his complaint.see fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,cir.
goodrich alleges that while he was employed by the lirr as an electrician at its facility in hillside yard,queens,new york,he suffered severe emotional distress as a result of the actions of defendants the lirr and two lirr employees,donald russell russell and an unnamed individual john doe at a pretrial conference conducted after the lirr had filed its motion to dismiss in this case,goodrich further alleged that,at the time the challenged conduct took place,he had been hiv positive for a number of years in august,he had allegedly been out of work with the flu for several days and had submitted a sick leave application in order to be compensated for the days missed while he was ill.while he was away from work,an individual,whom goodrich believes was russell,took the sick leave form from goodrich locker,added the words and hiv positive beneath the doctor flu diagnosis,and posted it on a public bulletin board at the lirr facility.goodrich alleges that in doing so,russell was acting within the scope of his employment.
goodrich filed his complaint in march,asserting subject matter jurisdiction under fela and alleging an nied claim and an iied claim against the lirr,russell,and the unknown individual john doe the lirr filed a motion to dismiss with respect to the claims against it,arguing that to state a claim either for nied or for iied under fela,goodrich was required to satisfy the zone of danger test by alleging that he had either sustained a physical impact or been placed in immediate risk of physical harm by the conduct of the lirr or its agents.goodrich subsequently withdrew his nied claim,acknowledging the need to satisfy the zone of danger test in that context,but contested the need to satisfy the same test to bring an iied claim.
the district court concluded that the zone of danger test was applicable to iied claims brought under fela,granting lirr motion to dismiss on that basis.although the individual defendants did not appear before the district court according to the lirr,russell had not been served with a summons and complaint in this proceeding,while the other individual remained unidentified the district court dismissed the action as to them as well,on the ground that a fela action can only be brought against a common carrier by railroad and not an individual.
this appeal followed.

ii.applicability of the zone of danger test to iied claims brought under fela 
the sole question presented by this appeal is whether the zone of danger test applies to iied claims brought under fela.we begin with the text of the statute.fela provides in relevant part that 
every common carrier by railroad shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier,or by reason of any defect or insufficiency,due to its negligence,in its cars,engines,appliances,machinery,track,roadbed,works,boats,wharves,or other equipment.
on its face,the statute offers little reason to conclude that its coverage extends to claims for the intentional infliction of emotional distress,in that the statute creates liability for the negligence of a common carrier by railroad resulting in injury or death to a worker.the supreme court,however,has recognized generally that the fela is a broad remedial statute,and ha s adopted a standard of liberal construction in order to accomplish congress objects in enacting it.atchison,topeka santa fe ry.buell,second alteration in original quoting urie thompson.of particular relevance to this case,despite the fact that fela text refers to injuries caused by a railroad negligence,the statute has long been understood to recognize causes of action for some intentional torts like battery as well.see id.at citing,inter alia,jamison encarnacion,see also higgins metro north,cir citing davis green,and harrison.pac.
the supreme court has only more recently addressed the question whether fela,through its use of the phrase injury or death,provides for recovery not only for physical but also purely emotional harms.in buell,confronting for the first time the question whether a purely emotional injury is cognizable under fela,the court noted that the question may not be susceptible to an yes or no answer.it found the factual record in the case before it insufficiently developed to allow it to come to a conclusion,vacating the lower court determination that such harms were cognizable and remanding for further proceedings.see id.
in gottshall,the supreme court returned to the issue,addressing in particular the question whether and to what extent a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is cognizable under fela.see at.the court structured its analysis into two inquiries.first,it considered fela itself,its purposes and background and the construction the court has given it over the years.id.second,because fela jurisprudence gleans guidance from developments,the court considered the common law treatment of the nied cause of action.see id.at quoting buell,at.
with respect to the first inquiry,the court noted that the statutory purpose of fela is clear when congress enacted fela in,its attention was focused primarily upon injuries and death resulting from accidents on interstate railroads.id.at quoting urie,at.under these circumstances,c ognizant of the physical dangers of railroading that resulted in the death or maiming of thousands of workers every year,congress sought through fela to d o away with several tort defenses that had effectively barred recovery by injured workers,thereby allowing injured workers to bring claims against their railroad employers more easily,id.
the court then proceeded to the second inquiry,the relevant common law treatment of nied claims,noting that although principles are not necessarily dispositive of questions arising under fela,unless they are expressly rejected in the text of the statute,they are entitled to great weight in our analysis.id.at.as an initial matter,it held that nied claims could be brought under fela,given the wide recognition of the claim in some form by many american jurisdictions at the time fela was passed,its recognition by the states at present,and the traditionally broad interpretation given to the term injury in the statute.id.at.
having recognized nied claims as cognizable under fela,the court next adopted the zone of danger test to define the scope of the duty fela places on employers to avoid imposing emotional distress on their employees.assessing three tests for limiting liability for nied claims,the court made clear that it was adopting the test that best reconciles the concerns of the common law with the principles underlying our fela jurisprudence.id.at.the zone of danger test,the court said,was well established when fela was passed in,id.at,is still presently in use in many states,id.at,and is consistent with fela central focus on physical perils,id.under this test,a worker within the zone of danger of physical impact will be able to recover for emotional injury caused by fear of physical injury to himself,whereas a worker outside the zone will not.id.at.in rejecting the alternative relative bystander test now widely used by many american jurisdictions,the court noted that the test developed several decades after fela enactment,such that it lacks historical support,id.at,and that in any event the court discern ed from fela and its emphasis on protecting employees from physical harms no basis to extend recovery to bystanders outside the zone of danger,id.at.thus,under the zone of danger test adopted in gottshall,recovery under fela for an nied claim is limited to those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as a result of a defendant negligent conduct,or who are placed in immediate risk of a physical harm by that conduct.id.at.
the zone of danger test was refined in metro north commuter railroad buckley.in buckley,the supreme court had to decide whether a railroad employee exposure to asbestos,resulting in alleged emotional distress but no symptoms of illness at the time of the suit,constituted a physical impact meeting the requirements of the gottshall zone of danger test.at.the court held that such exposure did not constitute a physical impact unless,and until,the railroad worker manifests symptoms of a disease.id.at.in rejecting a more expansive reading of the test,the court noted that its reading was consistent with the general common law understanding of the zone of danger test in similar contexts,with fela focus on physical harms,and with gotshall use of the term physical impact,which do es not encompass every form of physical contact.see id.at.moreover,the court noted that the general policy reasons cited in gottshall as rationales for restricting claims for recovery for emotional harm a the special difficult y for judges and juries in separating valid,important claims from those that are invalid or trivial b the threat of unlimited and unpredictable liability and c the potential for a flood of comparatively unimportant,or trivial,claims,id.at alteration in original internal citations omitted quoting gottshall,at also militate against an expansive definition of physical impact here.id.in light of these considerations,the court rejected the notion that a claim for emotional harm could be brought under fela in the circumstances alleged by the plaintiff in buckley.see id.at 
after gottshall and buckley,we examined in higgins whether an iied claim is cognizable under fela and concluded that it was,reasoning that b ecause intentional torts are recognized under fela and claims for solely emotional injury are also recognized,claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress can be brought under fela.at internal citations omitted.the majority in higgins expressly declined,however,to decide whether the zone of danger test applied by the supreme court in gottshall was also applicable in fela cases raising iied claims,as the requirement that an iied claim be based on extreme and outrageous conduct was sufficient to dispose of the case before it.see id.at.
concurring in the result,sotomayor concluded that the zone of danger test did apply and would have decided the case on that basis.in doing so,she noted that while the supreme court in gottshall considered an nied claim,its discussion extended broadly to the types of injuries compensable under fela.see id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment.analyzing the court decisions in gottshall and buckley,judge sotomayor reasoned that,while the common law focus on the extreme or outrageous nature of a defendant conduct may adequately guarantee that a claim of emotional distress is genuine,this approach takes the focus away from the core concern of fela as described in both gottshall and buckley that employees must suffer some kind of physical harm,impact,or invasion before they may recover under the act.id.at.
as an initial matter,we agree with the concurring opinion in higgins that gottshall and buckley are highly relevant to the zone of danger test applicability in the iied context,even though both decisions dealt with nied claims.as the concurrence in higgins notes,the supreme court in gottshall focused its analysis on the nature of the injury,stating that t he injury we deal with here is mental or emotional harm such as fright or anxiety that is caused by the negligence of another and that is not directly brought about by a physical injury,but that may manifest itself in physical symptoms.higgins,at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment quoting gottshall,at see also smith union pacific r,cir a close reading of gottshall reveals that the court focused on whether emotional injuries were generally compensable under fela,rather than upon the specific cause of action.language in the supreme court most recent discussion of the zone of danger test for nied claims in norfolk western railway ayers,a decision that followed higgins,only reinforces our conclusion that the focus should be on the injury involved in sum,our decisions in gottshall and buckley describe two categories emotional distress claims not provoked by any physical injury,for which recovery is sharply circumscribed by the test and emotional distress claims brought on by a physical injury,for which pain and suffering recovery is permitted.id.at.
we also agree with the concurrence in higgins that,in analyzing the question here,we properly begin with the understanding that fela core concern,see higgins,at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment,is physical harm,impact,or invasion.as the supreme court noted approvingly in gottshall,the seventh circuit has observed that fela was and is aimed at ensuring the security of the person from physical invasions or menaces.gottshall,at emphasis added quoting lancaster norfolk western ry,cir.the seventh circuit went on to hold in the same case that even in the intentional tort context,fela does not create a cause of action for tortious harms brought about by acts that lack any physical contact or threat of physical contact,lancaster,at see also ray.consol.rail,cir reaffirming lancaster.indeed,our understanding of fela is shared by all our sister circuits that have expressly considered the extent to which claims based on emotional distress may be brought under the act.see adkins seaboard,cir per curiam although buell notes that the fela has been held to apply to some intentional torts,the fela has not been applied to any intentional torts lacking any physical dimension such as assault w e have held that a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is not cognizable under the fela.internal citations omitted rivera passenger,cir in light of the historical interpretation of fela as intended to compensate for injury caused by a physical phenomenon,defamation is not properly pled as a fela claim.
it is true that the common law does not currently impose a zone of danger test on iied claims.the restatement second of torts defines the tort in these terms one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress,and if bodily harm to the other results from it,for such bodily harm.restatement second of torts.this approach has been followed by most,if not all,american jurisdictions,see restatement third of torts liability for physical emotional harm,reporter note,cmt.a tentative draft,collecting cases,albeit not without reservation in some cases,see,supervalu,johnson,t he tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is not favored in the law,because there are inherent problems in proving a claim alleging injury to the mind or emotions in the absence of accompanying physical injury.courts have noted that the restatement extreme and outrageous
