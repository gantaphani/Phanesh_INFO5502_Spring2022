in this appeal,larry matthews attempts to challenge a sentencing enhancement imposed pursuant to the armed career criminal act acca,e.we conclude that the law of the case doctrine bars the attempted challenge.
the background facts are catalogued in considerable detail in our earlier opinion in this case,see united states matthews matthews i,cir,and we assume the reader familiarity with that account.we rehearse here only those facts needed to bring the law of the case issue into focus.
in,a jury convicted the defendant on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.see g.at sentencing,the district court applied an acca enhancement,thus triggering a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years.id.e.the enhancement rested on the court subsidiary finding that the defendant had three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.this array included a conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,a conviction,and a juvenile adjudication for assault and battery.matthews i,at.the defendant conceded then and now that the first two predicates were properly counted.consequently,we concentrate on the juvenile adjudication.
with respect to the juvenile adjudication,the crucial question was whether the defendant,in committing this offense,had used a knife.the government tried to prove this point through a police report.relying on that report,the sentencing court answered the knife question in the affirmative and ruled that the juvenile adjudication qualified as an acca predicate.
in his ensuing appeal,the defendant challenged both his conviction and his sentence.see id.at.with respect to the juvenile adjudication,he argued categorically that juvenile adjudications should not be counted as acca predicates and that,in all events,the facts relating to this particular adjudication should have been proven to a jury as required by the holding in apprendi new jersey,d.he did not,however,take issue with the method by which the government had proved the facts related to the juvenile adjudication,through the use of a police report.we rejected all of the defendant arguments and,on august,affirmed his conviction and sentence.matthews i,at.
the defendant filed an untimely petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc on september.see fed.c,a.we summarily denied the late petition.the defendant then unsuccessfully sought certiorari matthews united states,d.
in,the defendant invoked the federal habeas statute,and moved to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence.after some preliminary skirmishing not relevant here,the district court granted the motion in part and convened a new sentencing hearing.the government renewed its quest for the acca enhancement but,instead of relying exclusively on the police report to prove the nature of the juvenile adjudication,introduced copies of various juvenile court documents obtained from the files of the massachusetts department of youth services.the district court admitted these exogenous documents into evidence and also allowed explanatory testimony.the court then used the juvenile adjudication along with the defendant other two convictions to ground an acca enhancement.it thereafter imposed the same mandatory minimum sentence.this timely appeal followed.
in our view,this appeal turns on an application of the law of the case doctrine.the defendant disagrees he argues that the law of the case issue is not properly before us because it is not listed in the statement of issues on appeal.see fed.a.this argument is hopeless.in the absence of a and none is needed here an appellee is not required to file a statement of issues.see fed.b.rather,an appellee may defend a favorable judgment on any ground made apparent by the record.mut.life ins.ludwig,d united states craven,cir.thus,we proceed to consider the government threshold argument.
writ large,the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.arizona california,d.this means that a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case,unchallenged in a subsequent appeal despite the existence of ample opportunity to do so,becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation.united states bell,cir.in other words,the doctrine bars a party from resurrecting issues that either were,or could have been,decided on an earlier appeal.see united states connell,cir.t he aggrieved party is deemed to have forfeited any right to challenge that particular decision at a subsequent date.bell,at.
this salutary approach safeguards the finality and efficiency of the judicial process by protecting against the agitation of settled issues.christianson colt indus.oper,d internal quotation marks omitted.the result is a sturdier,more stable decisionmaking process.see united states rivera martínez,cir see also ellis united states,cir explaining that the law of the case doctrine affords litigants a high degree of certainty as to what claims are open for adjudication.
the law of the case doctrine has two branches.the first colloquially as the mandate rule prevents relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.united states moran,cir.
the second branch of the doctrine binds a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case to honor fully the original decision.id.this branch contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation,unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.id.whether the doctrine applies in a specific instance is a question of law,engendering de novo review.negrón almeda santiago,cir harlow children,cir.
we turn now from the general to the specific.at the time of the defendant initial sentencing hearing,the supreme court had already granted certiorari in shepard united states,which involved a challenge to the method of proving acca predicate convictions.shepard by then had been briefed or argued,and the contours of the issue were clearly delineated.yet when the government sought to prove the nature of the juvenile adjudication at issue here through a police report,the defendant made no contemporaneous objection.
shortly thereafter and well before the defendant direct appeal was briefed or argued the supreme court decided shepard.see shepard united states,d.this decision clarified the method through which a predicate conviction could be proved under the acca and forbade the use of a police report for that purpose.see id.at.this decision should not have come as a surprise.beforehand and prior to the defendant sentencing several courts had expressed doubt about the use of police reports to prove predicate convictions,signaling that such a tactic would offend apprendi principles and,thus,offend the constitution.see,united states allen,cir united states sparks,cir.while this court had held to the contrary,see united states shepard,cir,rev sub,shepard united states,d that did not excuse a party wishing to preserve the issue from raising it.see,bousley united states,d united states lopéz peña,cir see also barreto barreto united states,cir.the claim of error was readily available,and the mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the factual or legal basis for a claim,or failed to raise the claim despite recognizing it is not enough to revive a defaulted claim.murray carrier.
the defendant obviously knew about the supreme court shepard decision he cited it in his opening brief in matthews i,albeit for a different proposition,but failed to mount a claim of shepard error.nor did he seek reconsideration of the sentence in the district court.his belated efforts to repair these omissions in an untimely rehearing petition and in a subsequent certiorari filing were too late and too little.see supra note.we have warned that t he law ministers to the vigilant not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.puleio vose,cir.so it is here having defaulted the claim of shepard error the first time a
