a puerto wholesale food distributor,trafon alleges that,in june,it acquired certain assets from packers provisions company of puerto rico,including an exclusive distribution agreement with butterball for whole bird and turkey part products in puerto rico soon after the deal was executed,trafon learned that butterball was selling its products to a florida wholesaler that was distributing those products to a retailer in puerto rico.on october,trafon counsel wrote to butterball expressing concerns that butterball was violating the exclusive distribution agreement.on october,butterball counsel sent a letter the letter denying trafon allegation 
t he allegation of a law violation rests on the incorrect premise that your clients acquired exclusive rights to distribute butterball products in puerto rico.for many years,butterball and its predecessors have offered butterball branded products for sale and distribution within puerto rico without entering into a written agreement or appointing an exclusive distributor w e have not located any documents corroborating your clients conclusory allegation that butterball or any predecessors,the principals granted any exclusive distribution rights in puerto rico limiting the principals right to sell directly or appoint competing distributors.if your clients have any evidence to the contrary on this issue,we would appreciate it if you would produce the same to us immediately butterball has an interest to negotiate in good faith the terms of a formal written agreement with your clients for the sale and distribution of its products in puerto rico.during this time,butterball is agreeable to continue to do business with your clients on the same terms and on a purchase order basis as has existed over the past few months.
the record does not reveal whether trafon or its counsel responded to the letter.trafon and butterball continued to do business together,and each invoice that trafon received from butterball contained the following notice 
as confirmed by way of letter dated october,any and all purchase orders for butterball branded products fulfilled by butterball llc are done so on a basis.nothing contained in this invoice,nor any act or omission to act by butterball llc,is intended to grant you with any exclusive distribution rights in puerto rico or elsewhere.
trafon alleges that,notwithstanding the letter and subsequent invoices,butterball treated trafon as an exclusive distributor.on various occasions where butterball made direct sales to puerto rico supermarkets in contravention of trafon alleged exclusive rights,butterball paid trafon commissions.for example,in,trafon consented to direct sales that butterball made to the supermarket chain selectos and received a commission of two cents per pound on the sale similarly,on multiple instances trafon suspected butterball was working directly with supermarkets in puerto rico or negotiating with different puerto distributors.rather than deny that trafon was their exclusive distributor,butterball responded to trafon queries by promising to investigate the situations.for example,after trafon saw that the retailer pueblo was selling butterball products,it informed butterball that trafon had not sold to pueblo and asserted that this sale was another violation on butterball end.butterball replied that it would investigat e where this fresh turkey sale came from and report back to you.
this relationship lasted until trafon learned that butterball made direct sales to various retailers in puerto rico without trafon knowledge in.around this time,butterball also refused to pay commissions that it allegedly promised trafon for direct sales to costco in and.trafon informed butterball that these actions violated the exclusive distribution agreement.in april,butterball responded to these allegations with a flat denial that trafon and butterball had ever entered into an exclusivity agreement 
you are,of course,aware that butterball has never recognized trafon as an exclusive distributor of butterball products a s things currently stand,butterball intends to sell to other customers in puerto rico on a basis,and trafon is welcome to purchase products from butterball on the same basis if it chooses to do so.
spurred by butterball proclamation that it intended to work with other distributors in puerto rico,trafon brought this action in the district of puerto rico in september and moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining butterball from violating the alleged exclusive distribution agreement.following a hearing,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r recommending that the motion for a preliminary injunction be denied.the magistrate judge determined that law limitations period started when trafon received the letter,and,as a result,trafon claims were.the magistrate judge also found that,even assuming trafon claims were timely,trafon had failed to show that it had ever entered into an exclusive contract with butterball.adopting the r r conclusion that trafon claims were,the district court denied the request for a preliminary injunction.it declined to reach the question of whether the parties had an exclusive distribution relationship.
the district court also entered an order for trafon to show cause as to why the case should not be dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure f a court may consider summary judgment sua sponte a fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond.in response,trafon sought reconsideration of the order denying the preliminary injunction.the district court denied the motion and entered judgment for butterball.trafon now appeals the denial of the preliminary injunction and subsequent dismissal of its case.
