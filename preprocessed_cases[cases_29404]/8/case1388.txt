plaintiff appellant linda grant williams appeals from a november,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska,dismissing her complaint and from the district court february,order denying her postjudgment motion for reargument and reconsideration of this dismissal and for leave to replead.on appeal,williams argues that the district court erred by,inter alia,dismissing the complaint without granting leave to replead,denying the postjudgment motion through which she sought leave to replead,and exercising supplemental jurisdiction to deny the remaining state law claims.we hold that the district court,in denying the postjudgment motion,applied a standard that overemphasized considerations of finality at the expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied in the federal rules of civil procedure.accordingly,we vacate the order denying the postjudgment motion and so much of the judgment as retained supplemental jurisdiction over and dismissed williams state law claims we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we set forth below the relevant facts as alleged in the complaint.williams is an attorney licensed in the state of new york who specializes in structured finance.she has developed a structure for airline special facility bonds asf bonds,which are issued by municipalities to finance the construction and renovation of airport terminals.according to williams,her structure is superior to that of existing asf bonds and would provide benefits to airlines,municipalities,bondholders,and underwriting banks if it were adopted.
defendant appellee citigroup,through its wholly owned subsidiary citigroup global markets together,citigroup,is a major underwriter of asf bonds.williams began performing legal work for citigroup while she was a partner at the law firm of thelen reid priest.at the suggestion of a citigroup employee,williams joined pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman,llp pillsbury a law firm that had a strong preexisting business relationship with citigroup as an equity partner.while at pillsbury,williams marketed her structure to citigroup.although a citigroup executive responsible for asf bond underwriting initially responded to her proposal with enthusiasm,citigroup ultimately declined to adopt williams structure.eventually,pillsbury forced williams to leave the firm.she thereafter became of counsel to greenberg traurig,llp greenberg pursuant to an employment contract.greenberg later terminated that contract.
the complaint alleges that citigroup,along with various rating agencies,airlines,and municipalities,conspired to block the use of williams structure to issue asf bonds.williams asserts that the acts in furtherance of this alleged conspiracy included,inter alia,terminating or transferring citigroup employees who supported implementing williams structure objecting to williams efforts to patent her structure demanding that williams employers sever their relationships with her pressuring another investment bank to terminate its license of williams structure and issuing new asf bonds with terms that impeded the possibility of refinancing those bonds using williams structure.williams avers that citigroup and its coconspirators took these actions to protect the profits that they derived from the existing secondary trading market for asf bonds,which she claims would disappear if her structure were adopted.
based on these allegations,williams complaint asserts eight causes of action.the first through fifth causes of action the federal claims allege that citigroup violated sections and of the sherman act,by engaging in various conspiracies to boycott her structure and by monopolizing,attempting to monopolize,and conspiring to monopolize the asf bond market.the sixth through eighth causes of action the state law claims respectively allege that citigroup violated new york donnelly act,bus.that citigroup tortiously interfered with williams employment contracts with pillsbury and greenberg and that citigroup tortiously interfered with williams business relationships with those firms.
on january,citigroup moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.it urged the court to dismiss the federal claims for failure to state a claim and then to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims or,if it elected to retain jurisdiction over those claims,to dismiss them.
by memorandum and order dated november,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.it dismissed the federal claims on the ground that williams failed to satisfy the pleading standard set forth in ashcroft iqbal,d,and bell atlantic twombly,due to the absence of factual allegations plausibly suggesting that citigroup violated the sherman act.see williams citigroup,cv lap,wl,at.notwithstanding citigroup request that the state law claims be dismissed without prejudice so as to allow reassertion in state court,the district court went on to consider whether the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims was warranted.acknowledging that the relevant factors usually point toward dismissal of state law claims without prejudice when the federal claims are dismissed before trial,the court nonetheless concluded that retention of jurisdiction was proper because the state law claims could be determined without further trial proceedings and without entanglement with any difficult issues of state law.id.at quoting brazinski amoco petroleum additives,cir.the court then dismissed the donnelly act claim based on the same deficiencies it detected in the federal claims,and dismissed the tortious interference claims for failure to allege certain elements required by new york law.id.at.on the day following the district court ruling,the clerk entered final judgment.
on november,williams timely moved for reargument and reconsideration pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure e and b and rule of the local rules of the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of new york the local rules.through this motion the postjudgment motion,williams sought to reopen the judgment and obtain leave to amend her original complaint so as to attempt to remedy the pleading defects identified in the dismissal order.williams counsel previewed the proposed amendments in a declaration accompanying the motion.
the district court denied the postjudgment motion in a brief order dated february,which reads in pertinent part 
plaintiff has not demonstrated any basis for the extraordinary remedy of reconsideration.although she submits a declaration of counsel in support of the motion an affidavit expressly prohibited by local civil rule she does not point to any matter which the court overlooked in dismissing the action.also,she fails to indicate any reason why she was justifiably ignorant of the facts set forth in counsel declaration facts which by and large reiterate matters which apparently occurred years ago.
plaintiff also does not explain why she should be granted leave to replead at this stage when she failed to request an opportunity to replead in the first instance.
accordingly,the motion for reconsideration and reargument is denied.app.citation omitted.this appeal followed.
