plaintiffs appeal from a july,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,dismissing their putative securities class action complaint for failure to state a claim.they allege material misstatements and omissions in the july prospectus and registration statement of defendant mf global,and assert claims under,a,and of the securities act.in a nutshell,the stock of mf global plummeted after the february revelation that a broker had evaded trading restrictions.of four groups of allegations,dismissal of two is not appealed.as to the claim that the prospectus and registration statement exaggerated measures,we vacate the dismissal because the district court erroneously applied the doctrine.as to the remaining claim,that the prospectus and registration statement failed to disclose deficiencies in the firm controls of client accounts,we affirm in part the district court dismissal for lack of causation,and in part vacate and remand.
in the morning hours of february,a broker at mf global,lost million speculating in wheat futures the broker,evan dooley,accumulated the losses by taking positions vastly in excess of the firm trading limits and collateral requirements.mf global was responsible for settling dooley trades at the clearinghouse,and absorbed the losses.when news reached the markets on february,mf global stock price fell it fell a further the day after,resulting in a market capitalization loss exceeding billion.
the dooley trading incident revealed to the public that mf global internal risk controls had not been applied to brokers trading for their own accounts or taking client orders by phone.mf global had controls for limiting its exposure to market risks in brokerage accounts by restricting trading and by managing margin credit with collateral and other requirements.but mf global sometimes deactivated the controls as with dooley to speed transactions.
this putative class action was filed on march,alleging,on behalf of certain purchasers of mf global stock,that the firm misrepresented and failed to disclose relevant material information in a prospectus and registration issued when the brokerage firm went public in july.until its initial public offering ipo,mf global had been the brokerage arm of man group,plc,a hedge fund.the defendants are mf global,man group,the ipo underwriters,and various mf global officers and directors.damages are sought under,a,and of the securities act,a.
in response to a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.see rubin mf global,d.the district court sorted the allegations into four groups,id.at,each of which it analyzed separately 
directional trading that the prospectus misrepresented the types of or only by mf global 
refco that the prospectus failed to disclose the lack of adjustments to mf global systems made during and after man group acquisition of refco,another brokerage firm 
risk management that the prospectus misrepresented and failed to disclose material facts relevant to the strengths and weaknesses of mf global system and 
client accounts that the prospectus failed to disclose that traders did not have limits when trading for clients,and that with the proper password anyone could access client accounts and trade in them at any time,id.at 
the court dismissed the first group of allegations on the ground that the cited statements were not false or misleading,and the second on the ground that the plaintiffs had insufficiently alleged the omission of any material fact.the plaintiffs do not appeal those specific rulings.claims premised on allegations concerning risk management were dismissed on the ground that cautionary language elsewhere in the rendered the cited statements or omissions pursuant to the doctrine.an alternative ground is discussed in note.the fourth category of allegations concerning client accounts was dismissed on the ground that alleged omissions concerning the accounts of clients could not have caused the loss alleged,which resulted from revelations concerning the accounts of 
the plaintiffs timely appealed.we review the district court order de novo,harrington county of suffolk,cir.
to prevail on a or a claim,a plaintiff must show that the relevant communication either misstated or omitted a material fact.see a.the doctrine is a corollary of the principle that a statement or omission must be considered in context.in re donald trump casino sec,cir accord,shaw digital equip,cir fecht price,cir rubinstein collins,cir.a statement accompanied by sufficient cautionary language is not actionable because no reasonable investor could have found the statement materially misleading see,stolz family daum,cir.in such circumstances,it can not be supposed by a reasonable investor that the future is settled,or unattended by contingency.for example,luce edelstein held that statements in an offering memorandum as to the potential cash and tax benefits of a partnership were because the offering memorandum made it quite clear that its projections of potential cash and tax benefits were necessarily speculative in nature.that n o assurance could be given that these projections would be realized,and that a ctual results may vary from the predictions and these variations may be material,cir.
the doctrine is one of a set of rules coping with the problem that information poses for securities disclosure laws.for decades,the disclosure of information was generally prohibited by the securities and exchange commission sec that policy changed in the to encourage disclosure of information notwithstanding certain vulnerabilities,including the tendency of predictions to be embarrassed by the passage of time regulators developed safe harbors.the sec promulgated a regulatory safe harbor in,see safe harbor rule for projections,securities act release,wl june,codified as amended at,and congress followed suit in,see private securities litigation reform act of a,stat,codified at.bespeaks caution is the courts contribution.
it is settled that the doctrine applies only to statements that are.see stolz family,at adopting explicitly a limitation to the doctrine,but acknowledging that elaborating such a distinction may be unnecessary b ecause the bespeaks caution doctrine is often defined with respect to statements.we have consistently observed that limitation.
in stolz family partnership,for example,the doctrine insulated predictions of future transactions a million or a future ipo,but not statements about the existence of an agreement to try to plan an ipo.id.at.most recently,in rombach chang,cir,we applied bespeaks caution to statements of optimism concerning the future performance of newly acquired businesses,see id.at but not to alleged omissions of information concerning existing financial and operational difficulties,see id.at.more examples are set out in the margin 
here,it is alleged for example that the prospectus failed to disclose the material fact that mf global risk management system protocols and procedures did not apply to the company employees when trading for their own accounts.that allegation specifies an omission of present fact,to which bespeaks caution does not apply the applicability of mf global system to employee accounts was ascertainable when the challenged statements were made.it was therefore error for the district court to rely on the doctrine to dismiss that claim.
the district court asked whether plaintiffs are essentially alleging that defendants failed to disclose the risk of a future negative event.rubin,d at.the doctrine then was applied to immunize any statement that the court deemed to be essentially alleging the of a risk,regardless of whether the statement looked to the future or was rooted in the known present 
the court finds that it is appropriate to apply the bespeaks caution doctrine here because plaintiffs objections to misrepresentations about specific or general shortcomings in mf global risk management system that existed at the time the prospectus was issued are,in fact,objections to defendants alleged failure to disclose the possibility that the risk management system
