this contract dispute over a flood insurance policy requires us to determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear claims involving policies issued by private insurers pursuant to the national flood insurance act nfia or the act,codified at.we hold that gives us jurisdiction to hear such claims.we further hold that prejudgment interest may not be awarded against private insurers acting as fiscal agents of the federal government under the nfia.we also find that partial summary judgment was properly granted to allstate on the question of whether palmieri could recover the full replacement cost of his damaged personal property,and to palmieri on the question of whether he was entitled to the full replacement cost of his damaged home.we therefore affirm.
background 
on october,plaintiff paul palmieri house on the south shore of long island suffered heavy flood damage in a massive that local newspapers dubbed the halloween storm.roni rabin,the shoreline slips away,newsday,at.the storm was as powerful as a hurricane but lingered longer,causing coastal flooding and erosion throughout the oceanfront communities of eastern long island.see nameless bully pummels island,newsday,at.
palmieri house was located in babylon,new york,on the waters of the great south bay,where only a few barrier islands protected it from the atlantic ocean and the full fury of the storm.palmieri house was insured under a flood insurance policy issued by allstate insurance company allstate pursuant to the nfia.as discussed in more detail below,the nfia was intended to help property owners in areas obtain flood insurance.understandably,private insurers tend to be reluctant to insure houses in areas like babylon.the nfia created a program under which the federal government bears the financial risk of flood insurance policies issued and administered by private insurance companies.
palmieri filed two claims under his policy,one for damage to his house and one for damage to its contents.allstate reimbursed palmieri in for the actual cash value of each,but on each claim it held back the depreciation value,the difference between the actual cash value and the cost of repairing or replacing the property in november,palmieri requested that allstate reimburse him for the monies held back.in september,after palmieri had submitted checks and receipts as evidence that he had actually made repairs,allstate informed palmieri by letter that it was denying both of his claims for replacement costs.
allstate refused to pay the cost of repairing palmieri house because,it said,palmieri had failed to comply with certain provisions of the policy in making his claim.allstate also refused to pay the cost of replacing the contents of palmieri house,arguing that the policy did not allow palmieri to recover the cost of replacing personal property.
palmieri filed a civil action in suffolk county supreme court seeking to recover the allstate had held back.that action was dismissed in december upon a finding by the state court that the united states district court had exclusive jurisdiction over the action pursuant to the nfia.on may,palmieri commenced the instant action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the parties consented to jurisdiction by united states magistrate judge arlene lindsay who granted partial summary judgment to both parties on march.the magistrate judge concluded that palmieri was entitled to the depreciation value of his dwelling,but was not entitled to the depreciation value of his personal property.from this judgment the parties now timely appeal and.
discussion 
the disagreements in this case primarily concern the costs of replacing palmieri house and property.the parties agree that palmieri was entitled to recover the actual cash value of the property destroyed in the flood the question is whether he could recover the additional costs of replacing it.palmieri challenges the magistrate judge refusal to allow him to recover the replacement cost of his personal property.allstate challenges the magistrate judge ruling that palmieri was entitled to the replacement cost of his home.before we reach the merits of their arguments,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the case.
jurisdiction over claims against private insurers under the national flood insurance act 
a.the national flood insurance program 
recognizing that private insurers were unlikely to provide adequate flood insurance without some federal subsidy,congress in created the nfia,codified at,to provide subsidized flood insurance through private insurers.see b m any factors have made it uneconomic for the private insurance industry alone to make flood insurance available to those in need of such protection on reasonable terms and conditions.under the act,the federal government provides flood insurance subsidies and local officials are required to adopt and enforce various management measures.see id.b,c.the national flood insurance program nfip created by the act is administered by the federal emergency management agency fema and supported by the federal treasury,which pays for claims that exceed the revenues collected by private insurers from flood insurance premiums.see van holt liberty mut.fire ins,cir.congress has authorized fema to prescribe regulations establishing the general method or methods by which proved and approved claims for losses may be adjusted and paid for any damage to or loss of property which is covered by flood insurance.the resulting regulatory scheme is set out at.
prior to the nfia enactment,few insurance companies offered flood insurance because private insurers were unable to profitably underwrite flood insurance policies,aetna cas.sur,cir.in its early years,the program was administered under what is known as part a or the industry program of the nfia.a pool of private insurance companies issued policies and shared the underwriting risk,with financial assistance from the federal government.see also downey state farm fire cas,cir citing.under part b,known as the government program,the government run s the nfip federally underwritten the potential for administrative assistance from private insurers.downey,at citing.in,the secretary of housing and urban development,who ran the nfip at the time,decided that the industry program was unworkable and ended it.he then implemented the government program,which has continued to the present.id.at.
pursuant to a,fema created the program wyop,which allows private insurers,sometimes called wyo companies,to issue and administer policies under the government program.although fema may issue policies directly under the government program,
more than are written by wyo companies.these private insurers may act as fiscal agents of the united states,a,but they are not general agents.thus they must strictly enforce the provisions set out by fema and may vary the terms of a policy only with the express written consent of the federal insurance administrator.b,d e,c d.in essence,the insurance companies serve as administrators for the federal program.it is the government,not the companies,that pays the claims.
at see also downey,at noting that under the government program,although private insurers issue the policies,fema underwrites the risk.the insurance companies handle administrative business for fema by selling policies and processing claims but do little else.suits against the fema director upon the disallowance of a claim are authorized by,and b y regulation,the wyo company may be sued in place of the fema director,at see also downey,at citing d.because allstate is acting here as a wyo company,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over such a suit.
jurisdiction under 
in their original briefs to this court,both parties asserted that gives us jurisdiction over this case recognizing that our sister circuits have rejected this view,we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the jurisdictional question.both parties have thought better of their original positions and now argue that jurisdiction exists under both and.of course,we have an independent obligation to satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction.see,bender williamsport area sch,d.we review de novo the question of whether jurisdiction exists.see hoblock albany county bd.of elections,cir.
as an initial matter,we note our agreement with the consensus among our sister circuits that does not create jurisdiction over suits against wyo companies.see van holt,at newton capital assur,cir downey,at.as the seventh circuit noted in downey,enables only claims brought under this part,the nfip as run under plan a,or the industry program.at.because the industry program stopped operating in,the seventh circuit found that the insured was years too late to take advantage of.id.we join our sister circuits in holding that,which limits its jurisdictional grant to claims brought under a program,does not give rise to jurisdiction here.
all of the circuit courts that have considered the issue agree that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits against wyo companies,but they do not agree on whether or creates it.see van holt,at finding jurisdiction under and gibson am.bankers ins,cir finding jurisdiction under downey,at finding that did not create jurisdiction,but that did newton,at finding that jurisdiction existed under and declining to consider whether it existed under studio frames standard fire ins,cir same.
section states that when the program is carried out as provided in,the director of fema shall be authorized to adjust and make payment of any claims for proved and approved losses covered by flood insurance.the statute includes the following jurisdictional language 
u pon the disallowance by the director of any such claim,or upon the refusal of the claimant to accept the amount allowed upon any such claim,the claimant,within one year after the date of mailing of notice of disallowance or partial disallowance by the director,may institute an action against the director on such claim in the united states district court 
id.this case requires us to determine whether an action against the director fiscal agent is an action against the director under.
in van holt,the third circuit held that creates jurisdiction for claims against wyo insurance companies.at.accepting the arguments of the united states as amicus curiae,see id.at,the court noted several reasons for finding a suit against a wyo company to be the functional equivalent of a suit against fema 
first,a wyo company is a fiscal agent of the united states.a.second,fema regulations require a wyo company to defend claims but assure that fema will reimburse the wyo company for defense costs.i.third,an insured flood insurance claims are ultimately paid by fema.after a wyo company depletes its net premium income,fema reimburses the company for the company claims payments.pt,app.a,art.iv a.when a wyo company proceeds from insurance premiums exceeds its current expenditures,it must pay the excess proceeds to the flood insurance administration.pt,app,art.vii b.although a wyo company collects premiums and disburses claims,only fema bears the risk under the flood insurance program.thus,a lawsuit against a wyo company is,in reality,a suit against fema.
id.at citation omitted.the court further noted the anomalous results of reading as limited to suits against the director 
because fema bears the risk and financial responsibility regardless of whether the lawsuit formally names fema or a wyo company as the defendant,it would make little sense for congress to have intended to create original exclusive jurisdiction for suits against fema but not for suits in which fema fiscal agent is the nominal defendant.
id.at.therefore,the court concluded that vests the district courts with original exclusive jurisdiction over suits by claimants against wyo companies.id.the sixth circuit adopted the reasoning of van holt in gibson,at.
in downey,the seventh circuit took a different view of whether creates jurisdiction over suits of this kind.see at.the court noted that grants original exclusive jurisdiction in the district court for actions against the director of fema,not wyo companies.id.section does not mention the wyo company or indicate that anyone other than the director may be sued under this grant of jurisdiction.id.acknowledging that the third circuit observation that a suit against a wyo company is the functional equivalent of a suit against the director was not without force,id.at,the seventh circuit concluded 
although a judgment against the insurer may come out of the federal a federal only litigants are in the private sector.because we see no good reason to disregard not only the identity of the litigants but also the fact that is limited to suits against the director,we decline to adopt van holt reasoning.
we agree that does not expressly indicate that anyone other than the director may be sued.the ambiguity in lies not in the word director,however,but in the word against,which could mean either having as defendant or opposed to.of course,this suit is against the director in the colloquial sense,because it will draw down the federal financial resources he manages.given this ambiguity,we look to the statutory context and purpose.see auburn hous.auth.martinez,cir t he preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.we conclude that a broader reading of the statute is appropriate as to suits against wyo companies because a suit against the director fiscal agent,for which the federal government bears financial responsibility,is in practical terms a suit against the director.
to hold that a suit against a wyo company is not a suit against the director would be to ignore the structure of the nfia,under which insurance companies act on behalf of the federal government,and the purpose of the government program,which is to ensure that private companies may serve as administrators for the federal program,at.the federal government exercises control over the terms of nfia contracts private insurers must strictly enforce the provisions set out by fema and may vary the terms of a policy only with the express written consent of the federal insurance administrator.id.at citing b,d e,c d.we see no reason to read the phrase against the director to allow suits against the government agency managed by the director,but not against the companies that manage the agency nfia liability under the government supervision.
the general design of the act also evidences an intent to ensure that claims involving the programs it creates are heard in the federal courts.section,which applied to the industry program,vested exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts over any action brought by an insured against a pool of private insurers.see.section similarly provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts over any action brought by an insured against the director.id.the statutory framework thus indicates not only that private insurers are to act as fiscal agents of the government in administering the federal program,but also that all claims for benefits under an nfia policy,whether issued as part of the industry program or the government program and whether sought from a private insurer or the government,are to be litigated exclusively in federal court.
accordingly,we join the third and sixth circuits in holding that gives rise to jurisdiction over claims against wyo companies.because we find jurisdiction under,we need not consider whether gives us jurisdiction over this case as a claim based on federal common law.see united states kimbell foods,d f ederal law governs questions involving the rights of the united states arising under nationwide federal programs.milwaukee,d section jurisdiction will support claims founded upon federal common law as well as those of a statutory origin.
ii.the awards of summary judgment 
we turn now to the substance of the parties arguments.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.allianz ins.lerner,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see anderson liberty lobby,d.we have articulated more specific standards applicable in contract actions 
in determining a motion for summary judgment involving the construction of contractual language,a court should accord that language its plain meaning giving due consideration to the surrounding circumstances and apparent purpose which the parties sought to accomplish.where contractual language is ambiguous and subject to varying reasonable interpretations,intent becomes an issue of fact and summary judgment is inappropriate.the mere assertion of an ambiguity does not suffice to make an issue of fact.ambiguity resides in a writing it is viewed than one meaning may reasonably be ascribed to the language used.only where the language is unambiguous may the district court construe it as a matter of law and grant summary judgment accordingly.

palmieri is entitled only to the actual cash value of his personal property 
palmieri argues that the magistrate judge erred when she concluded that the contract unambiguously limited his recovery for lost personal property to the actual cash value of that property.we agree with the magistrate judge that there is no ambiguity in the terms of the contract denying palmieri recovery for the depreciation,the difference between actual cash value and replacement his lost personal property.
the provisions of the contract authorizing recovery of replacement costs state bluntly that t hese replacement cost provisions do not apply to any mobile home or personal property contents covered under this policy,nor do they apply to any loss where insured property is abandoned and remains as debris at the property address following a loss.emphasis added.palmieri would have us read this language to apply only to the contents of mobile homes,but the contract clearly refers to any mobile home or personal property.emphasis added.even if this provision were ambiguous,all doubts would be removed by the preamble to the agreement,which states that recovery for damages to personal property is limited to actual cash value 
we insure you to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss,but not exceeding.the cost of replacing the insured building at the time of loss with material of like kind and quality and.the actual cash value of any insured personal property at the time of loss.
emphasis added.actual cash value is defined in the agreement as the replacement cost of an insured item of property at the time of the loss,less the value of physical depreciation.the language of the contract is plain.allstate reasonably denied palmieri recovery for the depreciation value of his personal property.
palmieri brief relies primarily on the text of the standard flood insurance policy sfip,a model contract that appears in the regulations interpreting the nfia.see app.a.palmieri argument is that the sfip allows him recovery of the depreciation value.but palmieri and allstate did not use the sfip,and palmieri has made no attempt to argue that allstate violated his rights by drafting its own contract,rather than adopting the sfip.see b all flood insurance made available under the program is subject t o the terms and conditions of the sfip,which shall be promulgated by the federal insurance administrator for substance and form,and which is subject to interpretation by the administrator as to scope of coverage pursuant to the applicable statutes and regulations.we therefore need not decide whether allstate acted improperly when it used a contract other than the sfip.see losacco city of middletown,cir treating an issue not raised on appeal as waived.
moreover,even if allstate violated the regulations by drafting its own contract rather than adopting the sfip,nothing in the regulations suggests that courts should respond to such a violation by holding the parties to be bound by the terms of the sfip when neither party agreed to that contract.the terms of palmieri policy could not be more clear in limiting his recovery for personal property losses to actual cash value.we therefore decline to apply the terms of the sfip rather than the unambiguous terms of the policy actually signed by the parties.
palmieri also directs this court attention to the paperwork he exchanged with allstate.palmieri filled out a proof of loss form listing the damages to the contents of his house.in a handwritten note on palmieri proof of loss form claiming damages to the contents,allstate indicated that the amount of depreciation held back due upon replacement.
it is unclear to us whether palmieri interprets this note as direct evidence of the meaning of the contract or as a waiver of some kind when he argues that the defendant can not engage in historical revisionism by retreating from admissions and representations that its own employee made.in either case,we disagree.as to the meaning of the contract,the text is plain on its face.as to the possibility of waiver,a defense based on lack of coverage is not subject to waiver under new york law.see albert schiff flack,burt rigid box travelers prop.cas,cir.the contract at issue provides that it is governed by federal common law,which generally adopts the relevant state law rule unless there is a significant conflict between the state rule and a federal interest.see boyle united techs,d.palmieri has pointed to no federal interest that would require us to displace new york rule against waiver in this context,and so we apply the new york rule and hold that allstate handwritten note is irrelevant.
in short,palmieri has shown no reason why we should disregard the plain meaning of the contract,which limits his recovery to the actual cash value of his personal property.because we agree with the magistrate judge that palmieri is entitled to no recovery for breach of contract,we also reject his claim for interest on that cause of action.
palmieri is entitled to the replacement value of his home 
allstate concerns the replacement costs of palmieri house,rather than its contents.allstate argues that the magistrate judge erroneously awarded palmieri summary judgment for the full replacement cost of the dwelling.the parties agree that the policy allowed palmieri to recover the full replacement cost of the he properly filed and supported his claim.but allstate argues that palmieri failed to claim the replacement cost within days of the loss,and thereby violated a requirement of the policy,and that palmieri proofs of loss are insufficient to support summary judgment.we disagree.
the timeliness of palmieri claim for replacement value of the dwelling 
allstate argues that the policy unambiguously required that palmieri make any claim for the replacement cost of the dwelling within days of the loss and that palmieri failed to do so.to show that palmieri was required to claim replacement value within days of the loss,allstate relies upon article vii,paragraph,one of the policy replacement cost provisions.paragraph states,you may elect to disregard this condition in making claim hereunder,but such election shall not prejudice your right to make further claim within days after loss for any additional liability brought about by these provisions.
the magistrate judge found paragraph to be unintelligible.she noted that while paragraph begins by stating that an insured may elect to disregard this condition in making a claim hereunder,the word condition is defined neither within article vii nor in any other part of the policy.allstate argues that the phrase this condition refers to paragraph,but it is not clear what in paragraph constitutes a condition that the insured might disregard further,as the magistrate judge noted,although paragraph does not appear to set forth a condition that can be disregarded,a reasonable insured is more likely to assume this condition refers to a condition in paragraph rather than paragraph.paragraph deals with which items would be counted in determining the v
