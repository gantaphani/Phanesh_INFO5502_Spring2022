we decide here whether an award of fees in bankruptcy to a debtor attorney will act as a bar under claim preclusion principles to a later suit filed by the debtor alleging professional malpractice arising from the bankruptcy representation.peter and paula iannochino,the debtors in this action,filed a malpractice suit in the massachusetts courts two years after their former attorneys,defendants carl aframe and stephen rodolakis,had received a fee award from the bankruptcy court.after their complaint was removed to the bankruptcy court,the court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment,reasoning that under the circumstances present here,the malpractice claims were barred by the principles of res judicata.the iannochinos appealed to the district court,which affirmed.they continue their appeal here,arguing that res judicata is inapplicable because none of the requirements of that doctrine are present.after having carefully considered their contentions,we affirm.
background 
as this case comes before us following summary judgment,we summarize the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the,the iannochinos.in,the iannochinos began operation of a copy center on main street in worcester,massachusetts,as franchisees of kwik kopy.despite occasional disputes,the relationship was relatively stable through.then,the iannochinos gradually fell behind on their obligations under the franchise agreement.by,the past due amount had grown to,but the iannochinos entered into an agreement with kwik kopy to resolve the issue.
during that same year,the iannochinos began to expand their business by entering into a contract with clark university to open a second copy center on the clark campus.although the written contract is silent on the issue,the iannochinos claimed that clark agreed to deal with them exclusively for all of its copying work,an arrangement the iannochinos estimated would allow the clark copy center to gross between and per year.in return,the iannochinos obligated themselves to make various payments,either to clark directly or to third parties on its behalf,for such things as royalties and rent.shortly after the execution of the written contract with clark,the iannochinos executed a second franchise agreement with kwik kopy to cover the clark copy center.
business at this center was initially good,though gross revenues did not meet the iannochinos expectations.the iannochinos blamed the poor revenues on clark,concluding that it was not abiding by the exclusivity agreement and was instead using other providers for its copying services.by,sales were so poor that the iannochinos closed the clark copy center.shortly thereafter,clark filed suit against the iannochinos,alleging that the closure of the store was a breach of contract.the iannochinos,acting through counsel answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that clark breached the exclusivity agreement.
by this time,however,the iannochinos problems were not limited to the now closed clark copy center.between june and september of,the iannochinos sought the advice of an accountant to assist them with other business problems that included cash flow difficulties at their main street store.the accountant suggested that the iannochinos consider filing for chapter bankruptcy protection.in september,the iannochinos first approached rodolakis,ostensibly for legal advice regarding the clark university lawsuit and counterclaim.at that time,rodolakis was a partner with aframe in the law firm of aframe rodolakis.the iannochinos retained rodolakis as their attorney shortly after this first meeting,granting him a security interest in their car to secure his services.
for the next three months,the iannochinos financial problems worsened.rodolakis advised the iannochinos that they could unilaterally reject their franchise agreements with kwik kopy and begin operations under a new corporate name,action press,after removing all kwik kopy signs and materials from their main street store.the iannochinos followed this advice,though it brought a quick response from kwik kopy,which informed the iannochinos in december of that it believed the act of removing its name from the store and commencing operations under a new corporation was in violation of a clause in the franchise agreement.in the same letter,kwik kopy also terminated the franchise for insolvency.
it was in this context that rodolakis advised the iannochinos to file a chapter bankruptcy petition.rodolakis informed the iannochinos that they might be able to reject the franchise in particular,the provisions of those the basis that they were executory contracts.the iannochinos agreed to file for bankruptcy,and in late december,after receiving kwik kopy letter,they filed a chapter petition.in addition to their potential liability for breach of the provision,the iannochinos also owed kwik kopy.rodolakis did not,however,initiate negotiations with kwik kopy prior to filing for bankruptcy,either to settle this past due amount or otherwise attempt to resolve the problems between the iannochinos and kwik kopy.
from the time of filing until april of,the dispute between the iannochinos and kwik kopy over the broken franchise agreement continued.kwik kopy sought to litigate the provision on several occasions,both in the state courts and in the bankruptcy court through adversary proceedings.these efforts were interspersed with settlements.in april,the iannochinos converted their case to a chapter proceeding.the dispute with kwik kopy was eventually resolved when the parties entered into an agreement allowing the iannochinos to continue operation as action press despite the provision,provided that they gave a local kwik kopy center the right of first refusal for certain jobs.
throughout this time,the clark university lawsuit was continuing.the iannochinos had originally been represented by another attorney in that matter,but that attorney withdrew and they turned to rodolakis for advice about how to continue.though rodolakis refused to represent them in that action,he advised them not to take any action in their own defense.instead,they were to ignore the lawsuit and their counterclaim and deal with an adverse judgment as with any other debt in bankruptcy.the iannochinos had reservations about this advice.they continued to believe that they had a valid counterclaim that should have,at the least,prevented the entry of judgment against them.nonetheless,the iannochinos followed rodolakis advice and a default judgment was entered against them.
by november of,the relationship between the iannochinos and rodolakis had deteriorated to the point that rodolakis petitioned the bankruptcy court for permission to withdraw as the iannochinos counsel.this motion was granted on december.in january,aframe filed an administrative fee application for compensation for services that the law firm of aframe rodolakis had provided the iannochinos.the iannochinos filed an opposition to this application,alleging,among other things,that aframe was not entitled to any fees because he was not their attorney.despite the breakdown of their relationship and their unease about some of the advice rodolakis had given them,the iannochinos never alleged that the services included within the application had been of poor quality or had caused either them or the estate harm.
in march,after a hearing that the iannochinos did not attend,the bankruptcy court allowed,in part,an award of fees to aframe.the amount awarded,in fees and in costs,represented payment for services rendered prior to april,the date of the conversion from chapter to chapter.no fees or costs for services performed after that date were allowed.eventually,and some time after this award of fees,the iannochinos again retained rodolakis in connection with the ongoing bankruptcy.
approximately two years later,the iannochinos filed the current action in massachusetts state court.this action was removed to the bankruptcy court in november of.the iannochinos complaint was grounded upon the legal services the defendants had provided during the bankruptcy and alleged that,through those services,rodolakis and aframe had committed professional malpractice and had engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of.laws ch.the defendants moved for summary judgment in.the bankruptcy court granted the motion,holding that the iannochinos claims were barred by the res judicata effect of the order on the fee application.the iannochinos appealed this judgment to the district court,which affirmed.their appeal from the district court is now before us.
ii.res judicata 
federal res judicata principles govern the res judicata effect of a judgment entered in a prior federal suit,including judgments of the bankruptcy court.see fdic express,cir in re el san juan hotel,cir.in an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy court order,the court of appeals independently reviews the bankruptcy court decision,applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact and de novo review to conclusions of law.in re spm manuf.official,unsecured creditors committee stern,cir.our direct review of the bankruptcy court judgment,as well as of the underlying question of whether res judicata applies to bar the malpractice claim,is de novo.see suarez pueblo int l,cir monarch life ins.ropes gray,cir.
a.the malpractice counterclaim 
as an initial matter,we must address whether the doctrine of res judicata applies to this case.the iannochinos argue that res judicata is inappropriate here because they have never pursued a prior remedy or suit against the defendants or engaged in multiple attempts to obtain relief.though this argument is strikingly undeveloped,it adverts to an important issue.at the time of the fee application,the iannochinos malpractice claims were counterclaims defenses to that application.the failure to interpose a counterclaim does not necessarily act as a bar to later actions.see,restatement second of judgments see also rowland harrison,refusing to find preclusion for failure to raise counterclaim under maryland permissive counterclaim rule.this principle protects putative counterclaimants from the inadvertent loss of their claim.carried too far,however,this principle would undermine the protective purpose of res judicata.see,bay state hmo,tingley,cir the policy behind res judicata is to relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits,conserve judicial resources,and,by preventing inconsistent decisions,encourage reliance on adjudication.internal quotations omitted.consequently,this principle is subject to two important exceptions that narrow its applicability and reduce the potential waste of judicial resources and costs to the parties associated with multiple suits based upon the same facts.see restatement second of judgments.
the first of these exceptions applies to compulsory counterclaims.see id.a.but for the bankruptcy setting of this case,the iannochinos malpractice counterclaims would be subject to this exception.a fee application in bankruptcy is akin to an action to recover a debt.under ordinary federal rules of civil procedure,if a counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court can not acquire jurisdiction,the counterclaim is compulsory and must be raised.a.as both the fee application and the malpractice counterclaim concern the same transaction,the counterclaim would have been subject to rule.moreover,the compulsory counterclaim rule is applicable in certain bankruptcy contexts.thus,if the fee application had changed from a contested matter to an adversary proceeding the iannochinos malpractice counterclaims would also have been compulsory and subject to res judicata.see fed.making.applicable to adversary proceedings.alternatively,the bankruptcy court could have ordered rule applicable to the fee application,again subjecting the counterclaims to res judicata under this exception.see fed.allowing the bankruptcy court at any stage in a particular contested matter to direct that one or more of the rules applicable to adversary proceedings apply.nothing in the record indicates,however,that the fee application ever became an adversary proceeding or that the bankruptcy court ever directed that rule apply.therefore,the iannochinos malpractice counterclaim to the fee application was not compulsory and can not be res judicata under this exception.
the second exception is applicable when the relationship between the counterclaim and the plaintiff claim is such that successful prosecution of the second action would nullify the initial judgment or would impair rights established in the initial action.restatement second of judgments b.in the normal course of civil litigation,the iannochinos malpractice counterclaim could not affect a prior judgment assessing fees.see rowland,at holding claim for professional malpractice against veterinarian would not nullify prior judgment establishing debt for the allegedly substandard services.in bankruptcy,however,a successful malpractice action could impair rights that aframe and rodolakis had gained from the order awarding them fees.under the relevant section of the bankruptcy code governing fee awards,a finding of malpractice would mean that the attorneys were not entitled to compensation for those services found to be substandard.see a see also in re southmark,cir it is evident that a professional dereliction of duty could transgress both explicit code responsibilities and applicable professional malpractice standards.nor does it matter that the fees may already have been awarded by the time of the malpractice judgment.and are applicable in bankruptcy,thus giving bankruptcy courts broad authority to reconsider judgments.see fed.fed.see also fed.allowing parties in interest to move for reconsideration of an order allowing or disallowing a claim against the estate.furthermore,a bankruptcy court can order professionals to disgorge fees that it had previously awarded them.see a the court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.in re hot tin roof,cir.panel upholding disgorgement for failure to disclose conflict of interest in re capgro leasing,ordering disgorgement of fees because services did not benefit the estate in any way.
the successful prosecution of the iannochinos malpractice claims in the action here has the potential,therefore,to provide the basis for a later order,following a motion to reconsider,forcing aframe and rodolakis to disgorge the fees that the bankruptcy court awarded them.thus,the second exception in section of the restatement is applicable here.see restatement second of judgments rptr.notes noting that the exception is applicable where a defendant,having failed to interpose a defense or counterclaim in a prior action which terminated in a judgment for plaintiff,now seeks in a subsequent action to obtain relief which,if granted,would permit recovery of the amount paid pursuant to that judgment on a restitution theory.the iannochinos can not escape res judicata on the ground that their malpractice claims were only counterclaims to the fee application 
b.the three requirements of res judicata 
having determined that res judicata is generally applicable in this situation,we next evaluate whether the specific res judicata requirements are present.for the fee award to bar the iannochinos malpractice claim,there must be a final judgment on the merits in an earlier suit,sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits,and sufficient identicality between the parties in the two suits.school of law american bar,cir.the iannochinos contend that each of these requirements is absent 
finality of the judgment 
the question of whether the fee award was a final or an interim judgment presents an unusual degree of difficulty because,in contrast to most other civil litigation,finality in bankruptcy is a more elusive concept.see in re am.colonial broad,cir.to be final,a bankruptcy court order need not resolve all the issues raised by the bankruptcy,though it must completely resolve all of the issues pertaining to a discrete claim,including issues as to the proper relief.in re integrated,cir emphasis in original.a bankruptcy court order must leave nothing to be done with respect to the claim except the ministerial supervision of the execution of the order.see in re am.colonial broad,at.an application for an award of fees for professional services is precisely such a discrete claim.consequently,in this context,an interim award of attorney fees under a and is not final because the order does not fully resolve the attorney claim,leaving open the possibility that the claim will later be enlarged through future fee applications.in re spillane,cir.on the other hand,a fee award that determines all of the compensation owed to an attorney under section may be considered final.see id.the determination of whether an award was or was not final,by its nature,depends upon the circumstances of the case.in re dahlquist,cir.
the iannochinos argue that aframe created a genuine issue of material fact by indicating on the fee application that he was seeking only an interim rather than a final award.the application begins with aframe assertion that he was the attorney of the debtor in the chapter bankruptcy.by this statement,the iannochinos contend,aframe admitted that he was continuing to represent them.because representation was continuing,a factfinder could reasonably conclude that there would be future requests for compensation.this conclusion is bolstered,they argue,by the reference in the application to section,which is the section of the bankruptcy code applicable solely to interim compensation.
stripped of their context,these two references in the fee application render superficial support for the iannochinos position.we can not,however,simply examine isolated fragments from a fee application to create a factual dispute if none reasonably exists when the application is viewed in its full context.after examining the full circumstances surrounding the fee application,we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could only determine that the order here was final.
in his fee application,aframe sought reimbursement for services that extended into august,even though his application was captioned chapter and the bankruptcy had been converted to chapter in april.the bankruptcy court,however,explicitly denied the application insofar as it sought fees for services provided after the conversion.this approach suggests that even if representation had continued,neither defendant would have been entitled to further fee awards.in the present case,however,representation did not continue.despite aframe assertion in the fee application that he was the attorney of the debtor,the only reasonable conclusion from the record is that aframe was not the iannochinos attorney at the time of the application.the iannochinos themselves lend support to this conclusion.their opposition to the fee application was based in part upon the assertion that they owed no fees to aframe because,though they had hired rodolakis,they never retained carl aframe as counsel.indeed,they claimed an express understanding at the time of rodolakis retention that not their attorney 
moreover,when read in context,the fee application does not indicate that aframe was continuing to represent the iannochinos.aframe asserted that he was the attorney for the debtor in this proceeding,which the caption references as the chapter bankruptcy action.the chapter action had concluded upon the conversion to chapter several months prior to the application.although aframe did seek fees for services performed after the conversion of the case,he did not seek any fees for the time after rodolakis,and by extension,his firm had withdrawn from the case.in this context,aframe recitation of his employment status is simply a statement that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees because he had been employed by the iannochinos at the time the services had been rendered.indeed,the only reasonable conclusion from the record evidence is that aframe represented the iannochinos purely through his partnership relationship with rodolakis.when rodolakis withdrew from the case,aframe professional relationship with the iannochinos also terminated.the discharge of an attorney prior to an order approving a fee application indicates that no further services will be rendered and consequently that no further applications will be made see in re spillane,at.
the mere reference to section also does not undercut the finality of the order on attorney fees.though the iannochinos are correct that section only applies to interim compensation and thus there is no reason to reference it in an application for a final award of fees,we decline to allow a mere statutory reference to determine the actual nature of the fee request,particularly when section was mentioned here in conjunction with the more general,final compensation provisions of section.see in re yermakov,cir holding fee order was final despite explicit reference in the order to future fee applications.as the bankruptcy court order determined all issues related to the defendants claim for fees,the order was final and may be given res judicata effect.
identity of the parties 
the iannochinos challenge to the identity of the parties is confined to rodolakis.they note that rodolakis had withdrawn from the case by the time of the fee application and award and that aframe applied for the fees in his name only.therefore,they contend,rodolakis was not in privity with aframe and can not now gain any benefit from whatever res judicata effect might attach to the fee award.
the record does indicate that rodolakis and aframe ceased to be law partners at some point after rodolakis stopped representing the iannochinos and withdrew from the case.though the precise date of that split is unclear,the fee application came from aframe solo practice rather than from the firm of aframe and rodolakis.we can reasonably infer,therefore,favorably to the iannochinos,that rodolakis was not a party to the fee application.this inference,however,does not stretch as far as the iannochinos urge.nonparties may gain the benefit of a prior litigation if they were in privity with a party to the previous action.see gonzalez banco central,cir.though privity is an elusive concept,we have found privity if a nonparty either substantially controlled a party involvement in the initial litigation or,conversely,permitted a party to the initial litigation to function as his de facto representative.id.at.
even drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the iannochinos,a reasonable factfinder could only conclude on this record that aframe and rodolakis were in privity because aframe was acting as rodolakis de facto representative in pursuit of the legal fees.see,in re belmont realty,in re medomak canning,cir.aframe and rodolakis were law partners during the time that the services detailed in the fee application were provided to the iannochinos.rodolakis was potentially entitled to payment from the estate for those services.see.aframe fee application,though submitted from his office,did not limit itself to a claim for the services aframe had rendered,but instead sought reimbursement for all services provided to the iannochinos,irrespective of which attorney had provided the services.the amount sought was nearly.the overwhelming majority of this work had been performed by rodolakis,who billed sixty hours to aframe six.moreover,at some point shortly after the fee application was granted in march,rodolakis had a chance meeting with the iannochinos in the bankruptcy court during which they discussed the ongoing bankruptcy peter iannochino testified in deposition that rodolakis told the iannochinos at this meeting that he was due to receive twenty percent of the compensation awarded pursuant to the fee application.this statement confirms that aframe was rodolakis de facto representative in filing the fee application.consequently,the defendants have established the identity of parties element of res judicata.
identity of the causes of action.
in determining whether causes of action are sufficiently related to support a res judicata defense,we have adopted a transactional approach.sch.of
