the plaintiffs here filed a breach of contract complaint in state court.after the only defendant was dismissed from the case by the state court,the remaining defendants removed the lawsuit to federal court,invoking diversity jurisdiction.at the time of removal,the dismissal of the defendant was not final.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand and later granted summary judgment in favor of defendant southworth milton,southworth and awarded attorneys fees.in addition to challenging the summary judgment decision and award of attorneys fees in favor of southworth,the plaintiffs argue that the case should be remanded to state court.
we hold that,despite the defendants failure to comply with the statutory removal requirements,a remand to state court is not required because complete diversity existed at the time of judgment,and plaintiffs failed to object to the statutory procedural defect in a timely manner.we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment and award of attorneys fees in favor of defendant southworth.
the plaintiffs in this action are universal truck equipment,universal new london mining manufacturing processing,llc nlm nicholas cambio,individually and as trustee of the nicholas cambio,roney malafronte and vincent cambio trust and vincent cambio collectively,the appellants or plaintiffs.they are citizens of rhode island.they brought state law contract claims against the following defendants southworth,caterpillar,caterpillar,caterpillar financial services cat financial,and several other entities and individuals collectively,the appellees or defendants.southworth is a new hampshire corporation and authorized caterpillar equipment dealer with its principal place of business in milford,massachusetts.caterpillar and cat financial are distinct delaware corporations with principal places of business in illinois and tennessee,respectively.all but one of the other defendants were not rhode island citizens.but peter agostino,a salesman at southworth,was also named as an original defendant in state court,and he was a citizen of rhode island.if agostino were a proper party to the action,his rhode island residency would have prevented diversity jurisdiction.
so far as pertinent for the present purposes,the state court action arose from an alleged oral agreement between defendants caterpillar,cat financial,and southworth,on the one hand,and plaintiff nlm,on the other.around march,nlm purchased or refinanced construction equipment from caterpillar southworth dealership for approximately million.the purchase was financed by cat financial,and nlm provided a security agreement and promissory note to cat financial.
after the national recession,nlm experienced a severe downturn in its business,and by mid,nlm was unable to make its monthly payments to cat financial.as a result,cat financial and nlm began to explore refinancing options.
around july,nlm and cat financial agreed that nlm would sell four of the purchased construction vehicles in order to reduce nlm debt to cat financial.southworth agreed to store the four vehicles on its lot for a day period while nlm attempted to sell them.the vehicles were transferred to southworth custody,if not immediately to its lot,around august.
while the four vehicles were awaiting sale,a conversation occurred,which forms the basis for the claimed oral contract.original defendant peter,a salesman at southworth,visited nlm and spoke to an nlm officer,vincent cambio,regarding the status of the refinancing negotiations.when asked cambio about the progress of the sales,cambio responded i got to tell you,you know how they going you know better than me.transcript of summary judgment hearing at,universal truck equipment,caterpillar,et,cv,ecf.then asked,so you going to get rid of some equipment id.at,to which cambio answered,yeah there no use for them.are you going to try to sell some of them for us like outright sales id.at.agostino then replied,i do what i can do,or we do what we can do.id.at.agostino,allegedly acting for southworth and other defendants,never managed to sell the equipment,and cat financial eventually repossessed and sold it.
on june,the plaintiffs filed suit in rhode island superior court.while the complaint set forth various claims,only one is relevant for present purposes.the complaint alleged that nlm entered into negotiations with caterpillar,cat financial and southworth through their agent agostino,and a s part of the oral agreement,southworth through its agent agostino agreed to act as broker of the four remaining vehicles to be marketed and sold at southworth in the ordinary course of business.complaint at,universal truck equipment,caterpillar,et,cv,ecf.the complaint alleged that cat financial repossession and sale of the vehicles constituted a breach of this oral agreement and resulted in a loss to the plaintiffs.
when plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit,it would not have been removable if agostino,a resident of rhode island,were properly named as a defendant.his presence would have defeated complete diversity.however,filed a motion to dismiss the case against him for failure to state a claim,arguing that he was not a party to the alleged contract.on october,the superior court of rhode island granted motion and dismissed him from the action.on november,before this dismissal became final and,the defendants filed a notice of removal to the united state district court for the district of rhode island,asserting that diversity jurisdiction existed as of the date was dismissed because the plaintiffs were rhode island residents and the remaining defendants were not.
the defendants asserted that removal was timely because it occurred within days after the state court dismissed all claims asserted against.the removal statute states 
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within days after receipt by the defendant of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.
on december,the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand to state court,correctly pointing out that the state court dismissal of had not become final,and arguing that therefore removal was improper.the defendants responded to this motion,arguing,for the first time,that removal was proper because was fraudulently joined,the plaintiffs having failed to articulate any basis for their claims against.defendants memorandum in support of objection to plaintiffs motion for remand at,universal truck equipment,caterpillar,et,cv,ecf.in reply to this argument,the plaintiffs simply asserted that the joinder was not fraudulent,but raised no objection as to the timeliness of a removal based on fraudulent joinder.on february,the district court denied the motion to remand to state court,agreeing with the defendants fraudulent joinder theory and finding that had not been properly joined in the lawsuit.
following the motion to remand,the parties engaged in discovery,and the defendants eventually moved for summary judgment on november,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to the plaintiffs claims,holding that no reasonable jury could find that the alleged oral agreement existed.on may,the court awarded attorneys fees to southworth on the grounds that the claims were frivolous.the district court then granted certification under rule b.rule b order,universal truck equipment,caterpillar,et,cv,july,ecf.plaintiffs appealed the judgment in favor of southworth
