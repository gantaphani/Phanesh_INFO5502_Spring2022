the class plaintiffs appeal from a september,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,district judge that denied class plaintiffs motions for class certification and bifurcation,and that directed entry of judgment in favor of metro north commuter railroad metro north.see robinson commuter,robinson ii.
the district court judgment dismissing the action is vacated.on remand,the district court is instructed to certify the class plaintiffs disparate impact claim for rule b class treatment,see.b,and consider whether the disparate treatment claim is appropriate for b certification in light of the standard we set forth herein.if the court determines that b certification of the claim is inappropriate,it shall bifurcate the claim,see.b,and certify the liability stage of the claim for b class treatment,see.c a.
background 
a.the allegations 
the background of this case is substantially detailed in caridad commuter,cir caridad reversing the denial of class certification,see robinson commuter,robinson i.only those facts relevant to this appeal are recited below.
the class plaintiffs are present and former metro north employees who are african american.they bring this putative class action against defendant metro north on behalf of all african american employees of metro north for the period from through estimated persons.caridad,at.metro north is a public benefit corporation responsible for providing commuter rail transportation between new york city and its northern suburbs.it has approximately employees in different occupations spread over departments.
the class plaintiffs assert both disparate treatment and disparate impact claims pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et.specifically,they challenge metro north policy of delegating to department supervisors discretionary authority to make employment decisions related to discipline and promotion.relying on statistical and anecdotal evidence,the class plaintiffs argue that this delegated authority has been exercised in a racially discriminatory manner and has a disparate impact on african american employees.caridad,at see robinson i,at.in their prayer for relief,the class plaintiffs seek injunctive and equitable relief for the class as a whole,including back and front pay,and also compensatory damages for individual members of the class who were allegedly the victims of individual acts of intentional discrimination.robinson ii,at.no request for punitive damages was made.
b.the earlier appeal 
in august,the district court denied an earlier request for class certification because it held that the class plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the prerequisites for a class action set out in rule a,specifically,the district court found that the class plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate commonality and typicality.see robinson i,at.
the commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs grievances share a common question of law or of fact.marisol giuliani,cir per curiam.typicality requires that the claims of the class representatives be typical of those of the class,and is satisfied when each class member claim arises from the same course of events,and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant liability.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
central to the district court finding that the class plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate commonality and typicality were the following metro north satisfied the district court that the plaintiffs statistics are inadequate to carry their burden of establishing commonality as to the class because they fail to take account of the fact that different metro north positions have materially different individual rates of discipline and of promotion associated with them and metro north overdelegation of promotion and discipline authority to supervisors is not sufficient to make out a pattern or practice of racial discrimination.robinson i,at.we disagreed and held that the statistical dueling between the class plaintiffs and metro north was not relevant to the certification determination,and that the class plaintiffs statistical report,in conjunction with the anecdotal evidence,satisfie d the class plaintiffs burden of demonstrating commonality and typicality and the delegation of discretionary authority to supervisors for discipline and promotion constitutes a policy or practice sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement.caridad,at the case was remanded for the district court to consider whether the requirements of rule b were met.id.at.
c.the district court ruling after remand 
following remand,the class plaintiffs moved in the district court for b class certifications of both the disparate treatment claim and the disparate impact claim.see.b.as an alternative to class certification of the claim in its entirety,class plaintiffs sought bifurcation of the claim between the liability and remedial stages,and b class certification of just the liability stage.see.c a permitting class certification of particular issues.
the district court denied the motions.relying on the fifth circuit recent decision in allison citgo petroleum,cir,the district court reasoned that b certification of the entire disparate treatment claim was inappropriate because the individualized compensatory damage issues would predominate over the equitable relief question,see robinson ii,at.central to the district court conclusion was its belief that 
determination of the damages suffered by individual members of the class would require individualized proof and proceedings to determine whether each such member suffered intentional discrimination on the part of his or her department manager,what injuries each such member thereby suffered,what individualized damages were appropriate to redress such injuries.
id.at.the multiple individual determinations of damages for the numerous members of the class,the district court concluded,would overwhelm classwide injunctive issues,from both the standpoint of the individual plaintiffs and the standpoint of the court.id.
with respect to the class plaintiffs alternative request that the claim be bifurcated and the liability stage certified for class treatment as a b class,the district court reasoned that the individual determinations will overwhelm the liability phase of any trial nearly as much as they would overwhelm any damages phase,once again rendering class action treatment inappropriate under rule b.id.the district court based this conclusion on its belief that the liability phase would require an individualized determination of each of the allegedly discriminatory acts of particular department managers in particular individual situations.id.
the district court did not set forth a basis for denying b certification of the disparate impact claim.
discussion 
at the outset,we observe that this appeal does not involve consideration of the merits of the case.see,eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.rather,it concerns whether the district court abused its discretion in denying class certification.see sirota solitron devices,cir.and,in particular,it requires us to consider how the passage of the civil rights act of the act,see,stat,affected the class certification analysis in employee discrimination cases.see generally daniel piar,the uncertain future of title vii class actions after the civil rights act of,byu.as we discuss below,contrary to both metro north arguments on appeal and the fifth circuit recent decision in allison,we find that the changes made by the act are not fatal to class treatment of employment discrimination claims.but see allison,at.
to understand why,it is first necessary to consider the changes brought about by the act and to review the elements and evidentiary requirements for disparate treatment claims and disparate impact claims.
i.the act and title vii claims generally 
prior to the passage of the act,a plaintiff seeking a monetary award for disparate treatment and disparate impact claims under title vii could recover only back pay and front pay.because back pay and front pay have historically been recognized as equitable relief under title vii,neither party was entitled to a jury trial both disparate treatment and disparate impact claims were tried to the bench.see,lehman nakshian,d lincoln bd.of regents of.of,cir moore sun oil of,cir slack havens,cir see also pollard du pont de nemours,d holding that front pay is an equitable remedy.but see setser novack inv,cir.holding that back pay is a legal remedy for which the right to a jury trial exists,vacated in part on other grounds,cir en banc.
the act enhanced title vii remedial scheme for disparate treatment claims.in addition to back pay and front pay,it authorized the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in disparate treatment disputes,see a,and afforded a jury trial where these additional remedies are sought,see c.the act did not alter the remedial structure for disparate impact claims.
proving title vii claims 
pattern or practice disparate treatment claims 
disparate treatment claims focus on allegations of widespread acts of intentional discrimination against individuals.to succeed on a claim,plaintiffs must prove more than sporadic acts of discrimination rather,they must establish that intentional discrimination was the defendant standard operating procedure.int l of teamsters united states,d.
generally,a suit is divided into two phases liability and remedial see id.at.at the liability stage,the plaintiffs must produce sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of a policy,pattern,or practice of intentional discrimination against the protected group.see id.at.plaintiffs have typically depended upon two kinds of circumstantial evidence to establish the existence of a policy,pattern,or practice of intentional discrimination statistical evidence aimed at establishing the defendant past treatment of the protected group,and testimony from protected class members detailing specific instances of discrimination.arthur larson et,employment discrimination,at ed see mozee am.commercial marine serv,cir.
statistics alone can make out a prima facie case of discrimination if the statistics reveal a gross disparity in the treatment of workers based on race.lopez laborers int l union,local,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also ardrey united parcel,cir since strong statistical evidence,without anecdotal evidence,may in some cases form a prima facie case,a defendant successful rebuttal of each alleged instance of discrimination weakens,but does not defeat,a plaintiff class claim.neither statistical nor anecdotal evidence is automatically entitled to reverence to the exclusion of the other.
if the plaintiffs satisfy this prima facie requirement,t he burden of production then shifts to the employer to defeat it by demonstrating that the plaintiffs proof is either inaccurate or insignificant.teamsters,at.
three basic avenues of attack are open to the defendant challenging the plaintiff s statistics,namely assault on the source,accuracy,or probative force.the defendant can present its own statistical summary treatment of the protected class and try to convince the fact finder that these numbers present a more accurate,complete,or relevant picture than the plaintiff s statistical showing.or the defendant can present anecdotal and other evidence tending to rebut the inference of discrimination.the prudent defendant will follow all three routes if possible,presenting its own version of the numbers game,attempting to undermine the plaintiff s version with specific attacks on the validity of the plaintiff s statistics,and garnering evidentiary support as well.
larson,supra,at to footnote omitted.
once the defendant introduces evidence satisfying this burden of production,the trier of fact then must consider the evidence introduced by both sides to determine whether the plaintiffs have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination.see teamsters,at.should the plaintiffs prove a pattern or practice of discrimination,the court may proceed to fashion injunctive relief.see id.at.dillon coles,cir.
if individual relief such as back pay,front pay,or compensatory recovery is sought in addition to injunctive relief,the court must conduct the remedial phase.class members enter this second phase with a presumption in their favor that any particular employment decision,during the period in which the discriminatory policy was in force,was made in pursuit of that policy.teamsters,at.
the effect of the presumption from the liability stage is to substantially lessen each class member evidentiary burden relative to that which would be required if the employee were proceeding separately with an individual disparate treatment claim under the mcdonnell douglas framework.texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d mcdonnell douglas green,d.rather than having to make out a prima facie case of discrimination and prove that the employer asserted business justification is merely a pretext for discrimination,see,scarlett seaboard coast line,cir,a class member at the remedial stage of a claim need only show that he or she suffered an adverse employment decision and therefore was a potential victim of the proved discrimination.teamsters,at.the burden of persuasion then shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the individual was subjected to the adverse employment decision for lawful reasons.id.
if the employer is unable to establish a lawful reason for an adverse employment action,the employee is entitled to individualized equitable relief,which may include back pay and front pay.class members who seek compensatory damages in addition to individualized equitable relief must then prove that the discrimination caused them emotional pain,suffering,inconvenience,mental anguish,loss of enjoyment of life,or other nonpecuniary losses.b.
disparate impact claims 
like disparate treatment claims,disparate impact claims are attacks on the systemic results of employment practices.segar smith.however,where the inquiry in a disparate treatment claim is focused on determining the existence of discriminatory intent,disparate impact claims are concerned with whether employment policies or practices that are neutral on their face and were not intended to discriminate have nevertheless had a disparate effect on the protected group.see griggs duke power,d stating that an employer good intent is irrelevant to a disparate impact claim.the doctrine seeks the removal of employment obstacles,not required by business necessity,which create headwinds and freeze out protected groups from job opportunities and advancement.eeoc joe stone crab,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
disparate impact claims involve three stages of proof.the first is the prima facie showing of disparate impact.it requires plaintiffs to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.k a i.to make this showing,a plaintiff must identify a policy or practice,demonstrate that a disparity exists,and establish a causal relationship between the two.see byrnie town of cromwell,bd.of,cir.allegations which contend only that there is a bottom line racial imbalance in the work force are insufficient.brown coach stores,cir see,wards cove packing atonio,d holding that the challenged employment practice caused the disparity.
as with the liability phase of a disparate treatment claim,statistical proof almost always occupies center stage in a prima facie showing of a disparate impact claim.see hill.state employment,cir per curiam rose wells fargo,cir.see generally larson,supra,to,at to.the statistics must reveal that the disparity is substantial or significant.bouman block,cir quoting clady county of,cir see eeoc joint apprenticeship,cir.moreover,the statistics must be of a kind and degree sufficient to reveal a causal relationship between the challenged practice and the disparity.see watson fort worth bank trust,d mems city of paul,cir.
if the plaintiffs succeed in their prima facie showing,the burden of persuasion then shifts to the employer to demonstrate one of two things.the first option is to challenge the plaintiffs statistical proof.this may be done by introducing evidence to show that either no statistically significant disparity in fact exists or the challenged practice did not cause the disparity.see,in re employment discrimination,cir.to successfully contest the plaintiffs statistical evidence,however,the employer has to convince the factfinder that its numerical picture is more accurate,valid,or reliable than the plaintiff s evidence.larson,supra,at.if the employer is able to do so,it prevails and the case ends.
assuming the employer is unable to successfully contest the plaintiffs statistics,a second route is for the employer to demonstrate that the challenged practice or policy is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.k a i.for example,i n order to sustain a subjective promotion practice that is having a disparate effect on minorities,the would have to establish that something about the particular position requires the selector to make a subjective evaluation of the applicant abilities.mozee,at see,zahorik cornell,cir.
if the employer fails to demonstrate a business justification for the policy or practice,see k a i,m,then the plaintiffs prevail.if the employer succeeds in establishing a business justification,however,the disparate impact claim proceeds to a third stage.see joe stone crab,at.at this third stage,the burden of persuasion shifts back to the plaintiffs to establish the availability of an alternative policy or practice that would also satisfy the asserted business necessity,but would do so without producing the disparate effect.see k a ii,c joe stone crab,at.see generally larson,supra,to,at to.
should the plaintiffs succeed in establishing a title vii disparate impact violation,the court may order prospective injunctive relief.see in re employment discrimination,at.still,in order for an employee to obtain individual relief,back or front pay,an inquiry similar to the remedial stage of a disparate treatment claim is generally required see larson,supra,at.each class member must show that he or she was among those adversely affected by the challenged policy or practice.if this showing is made,the class member is entitled to individual relief unless the employer in turn can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a legitimate reason existed for the particular adverse action.see,stephen pga sheraton resort,cir.
ii.standard of review 
district courts are afforded substantial leeway in deciding issues of class certification.a decision will only be overturned if it constitutes an abuse of discretion.lundquist sec.pac.auto.fin.servs,cir per curiam citation and internal quotation marks omitted.however,the failure to follow the proper legal standards in certifying a class is an abuse of discretion.blyden mancusi,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.and,our deference is noticeably less when a district court has denied class status than when it has certified a class.caridad,at quoting lundquist,at.
having now set forth the elements and evidentiary requirements for title vii claims and our standard of review for the denial of class certification,we turn to the class plaintiffs contentions on appeal.
iii.certification of the pattern or practice claim 
with respect to the district court denial of class certification of the disparate treatment claim,the class plaintiffs argue that the court abused its discretion by applying an erroneous standard to decide whether to certify the claim under rule b or,alternatively,in failing to sever and certify under rule b at least the liability phase of the claim 
claim certification 
the class plaintiffs contend that the district court utilized an unduly stringent standard in refusing b certification of the claim.we agree.
standards for assessing predominance a or ad hoc approach 
the b class action is intended for cases where broad,injunctive or declaratory relief is necessary to redress a injury.the text of rule b is silent as to what at relief may also be sought.the advisory committee note to rule contemplates b class certification of at least some claims for monetary recovery 
this subdivision is intended to reach situations where a party has taken action or refused to take action with respect to a class,and final relief of an injunctive nature or of a corresponding declaratory nature,settling the legality of the behavior with respect to the class as a whole,is appropriate the subdivision does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.
b,advisory committee note emphasis added.
to date,our circuit precedent has provided no guidance to lower courts faced with assessing whether final relief relates predominantly to money damages to preclude b class treatment.see eisen carlisle jacquelin,cir subsection b is only applicable where the relief sought is exclusively or predominantly injunctive or declaratory,vacated on other grounds,d.without a clear standard discernible from either the text of rule b or our circuit precedent,the district court applied a standard recently set forth by the fifth circuit in allison,at.this standard,the incidental damages approach,provides that 
i n any such action in which both injunctive and monetary relief are sought,the inherently individualized nature of the determination of damages render s it predominant,and thereby make s class action status under rule b inappropriate,except in those rare incidences in which the request for monetary relief is wholly incidental to the requested injunctive relief.
robinson ii,at.the district court went on to state that incidental damages 
should at least be capable of computation by means of objective standards and not dependent in any significant way on the intangible,subjective differences of each class member circumstances.liability for incidental damages should not require additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual case it should neither introduce new and substantial legal or factual issues,nor entail complex individualized determinations.
id.at quoting allison,at.
by limiting b certification to claims involving no more than incidental damages,the standard utilized by the district court forecloses b class certification of all claims that include compensatory damages or punitive damages even if the injunctive relief is the form of relief in which the plaintiffs are primarily interested.hoffman honda of am,see allison,at dennis,dissenting stating that the majority decrees that if compensatory or punitive damages are prayed for,the case is automatically classified as predominantly related to money damages and therefore not certifiable under b.this prohibition follows from the fact that t he very nature of compensatory damages,compensating plaintiffs for emotional and other intangible injuries,necessarily implicates the subjective differences of each plaintiff circumstances allison,at see,rutstein avis,cir,cert.denied,d.by definition,however,incidental damages must be susceptible to computation by means of objective standards and not dependent in any significant way on the class members intangible,subjective differences,which compensatory damages clearly are.robinson ii,at quoting allison,at see smith texaco,cir c onsidering allison and rule b formulation,the instant claims could not have been certified under that paragraph,because compensatory and punitive damages predominate over relief.emphasis added.
thus,the question we must decide is whether this bar to b class treatment of all claims for compensatory damages and other damages,punitive damages is appropriate.for the reasons we discuss below,we believe that it is not and therefore decline to adopt the incidental damages approach set out by the fifth circuit in allison and followed by the district court below.rather,we hold that when presented with a motion for b class certification of a claim seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages,a district court must consider the evidence presented at a class certification hearing and the arguments of counsel,and then assess whether b certification is appropriate in light of the relative importance of the remedies sought,given all of the facts and circumstances of the case.hoffman,at.the district court may allow b certification if it finds in its informed,sound judicial discretion that the positive weight or value to the plaintiffs of the injunctive or declaratory relief sought is predominant even though compensatory or punitive damages are also claimed,allison,at dennis,dissenting,and class treatment would be efficient and manageable,thereby achieving an appreciable measure of judicial economy.
although the assessment of whether injunctive or declaratory relief predominates will require an ad hoc balancing that will vary from case to case,before allowing b certification a district court should,at a minimum,satisfy itself of the following even in the absence of a possible monetary recovery,reasonable plaintiffs would bring the suit to obtain the injunctive or declaratory relief sought and the injunctive or declaratory relief sought would be both reasonably necessary and appropriate were the plaintiffs to succeed on the merits.insignificant or sham requests for injunctive relief should not provide cover for b certification of claims that are brought essentially for monetary recovery.see,in re sch.asbestos,cir.
considerations supporting the ad hoc approach 
several considerations inform our decision to adopt this ad hoc approach over the incidental damages standard with its absolute bar to claims seeking compensatory and punitive damages.
foremost among these is the fact that rule has historically been understood to vest district courts with the authority to determine whether,in their informed discretion,based on the particulars of the case,the certification prerequisites have been satisfied.allison,at dennis,dissenting.we see no basis for the imposition of a rule such as the incidental damages standard that would plainly nullif y the district court legislatively granted discretion in making certification determinations.id.at dennis,dissenting see also herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions,at ed.no clear standards have been or could be developed in this area so pregnant with judicial discretion.sumitomo copper litig.credit lyonnais rouse,cir noting that the district court is often in the best position to assess the propriety of the class.
additionally,we find that an ad hoc approach satisfies the very concerns that have led other courts to adopt the incidental damages,achieving judicial efficiency,and ensuring due process for absent class members.see allison,at.with respect to the former concern,permitting district courts to assess issues of judicial economy and class manageability on a basis is superior to the approach of the incidental damages standard.as for the latter concern,as we discuss below,options other than the adoption of the incidental damages approach exist to eradicate the due process risks posed by b class certification of claims for damages,robinson sears,roebuck,d.
where injunctive or declaratory relief is sought in a b class action for an alleged group harm,there is a presumption of cohesion and unity between absent class members and the class representatives such that adequate representation will generally safeguard absent class members interests and thereby satisfy the strictures of due process.see,johnson motors,cir when only equitable relief is sought in a class action involving a cohesive plaintiff group such as a class of black employees at an assembly plant,the due process interests of absent members will usually be safeguarded by adequate representation alone.this presumption of cohesion and unity continues where incidental damages are also sought because entitlement to such damages does not vary based on the subjective considerations of each class member claim,but flow s directly from a finding of liability on the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.allison,at.
in contrast,where monetary relief such as compensatory damages are involved,due process may require the enhanced procedural protections of notice and opt out for absent class members.this is because entitlement to damages may vary among class members depending on the circumstances and merits of each claim the presumption of class homogeneity and cohesion falters,and thus,adequate representation alone may prove insufficient to protect absent class members interests.see,lemon int l union of operating eng rs,cir jefferson ingersoll int l,cir johnson,at see also ortiz fibreboard,d thomas albright.absent class members may therefore need notice that their claims are being pursued in the class action and the opportunity either to opt out and pursue their claims separately or to intervene,should they conclude such active participation would better protect their individual interests.
however,certification of a claim for damages under rule b poses a due process risk because this provision does not expressly afford the procedural protections of notice and opt out.compare.b,with.b see also.c.the prohibition of b class treatment for claims seeking damages eliminates this risk.it ensures that claims presenting individual specific damage issues that might require heightened due process protections are not certified under b.but,any due process risk posed by b class certification of a claim for damages can be eliminated by the district court simply affording notice and opt out rights to absent class members for those portions of the proceedings where the presumption of class cohesion,the damages phase of the proceedings see johnson,at see also kyriazi,cir.a district court acting under its rule d discretionary power may require that an right and notice thereof be given should it believe that such a right is desirable to protect the interests of the absent class members.holmes cont l can,cir internal quotation marks omitted see.d,see,eubanks billington,county of suffolk long island lighting.
to recap,we hold that the district court erred in applying the incidental damages standard to deny the class plaintiffs request for b certification of the disparate treatment claim.on remand,the district court should reconsider the propriety of b certification in light of the standard that we adopt in this opinion.however,because we recognize that,even under the discretionary standard we endorse,the district court may still conclude that b certification of the entire disparate treatment claim is inappropriate,we turn to consider the class plaintiffs alternate contention that the district court erred in denying partial certification of the claim.
partial certification 
the class plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in refusing to bifurcate the claim and certify the liability stage of the claim for b class treatment.see.c.we agree see,morgan united parcel serv.of,d,vaszlavik storage tech,butler home depot,no,wl,at,morgan united parcel serv.of,eeoc mcdonnell douglas.
rule c a provides that an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.c a.district courts should take full advantage of th is provision to certify separate issues in order to reduce the range of disputed issues in complex litigation and achieve judicial efficiencies.cent.wesleyan coll.grace,cir quoting in re robins,cir accord hilao estate of marcos,cir williams,cir.see generally edward sherman,class actions and duplicative litigation,arguing that a class action should not be found unmanageable without first exploring the procedural devices available for bringing it in line.these include subclassing and trial of subclass issues separately,bifurcating liability and damages,and appointing a special master for difficult evidentiary matters footnotes omitted.
here,litigating the liability phase for the class as a whole would both reduce the range of issues in dispute and promote judicial economy.for example,if the class should succeed and,even assuming that the remedial stage is ultimately resolved on a basis,the issues and evidence relevant to these individual adjudications would be substantially narrowed 
by proving that the defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination,not only is the plaintiff class eligibility for appropriate prospective relief established,a prima facie case with regard to the remedial phase of the suit,in which relief for individuals is considered,is also made out.thus,the court presumes that the employer unlawfully discriminated against individual class members.in pattern or practice cases,however,the presumption shifts to the employer not only the burden of production,but also the burden of persuading the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the employer did not unlawfully discriminate against the individual.
craik.state,cir internal citation omitted.if,on the other hand,metro north succeeds at the liability stage,the question of whether it engaged in a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination that injured its african american employees would be completely and finally determined,thereby eliminating entirely the need for a remedial stage inquiry on behalf of each class member.
in denying partial certification,the district court apparently did not appreciate these potential benefits because the court had misapprehended the nature of the proof required at the liability stage.specifically,the district court believed that discriminatory acts of particular department managers in particular individual situations would have to be tried and that this would overwhelm the liability phase.robinson ii,at.
however,as we have discussed,see supra part i b,the liability phase is largely preoccupied with statistical evidence directed at establishing an overall pattern or practice of intentional discrimination.see allison,at dennis,dissenting.to the extent that evidence regarding specific instances of alleged discrimination is relevant during the liability stage,it simply provides texture to the statistics.such anecdotal evidence is not introduced to establish that the particular instances of discrimination actually occurred nor that the particular employees were in fact victims of discrimination.see price waterhouse hopkins,d,superseded by statute on other grounds.indeed,to ensure that the liability phase remains manageable,the district court may limit the anecdotal evidence as it deems appropriate.see.
accordingly,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in not certifying the liability stage of the disparate treatment claim for b class treatment 
iv.certification of the disparate impact claim 
the class plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion in declining to certify the disparate impact claim for b class treatment.here again,we agree.
in considering the propriety of the district court decision to deny b certification,we are mindful that,prior to the enactment of the civil rights act of,title vii discrimination claims seeking both injunctive and equitable monetary relief,like the disparate impact claim here,were routinely certified as b classes.see,eubanks,at probe state teachers ret,cir holmes,at alexander aero lodge,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds sperry rand larson,cir rich martin marietta,cir wetzel liberty mut.ins,cir pettway am.cast iron pipe,cir newberg conte,supra,at to see also allison,at observing that back pay could be sought in a b class action because,as an equitable remedy similar to other forms of affirmative injunctive relief permitted in b class actions,it was an integral component of title vii make whole remedial scheme.
given that the act did not alter the general remedial structure of disparate impact claims,we think it plain that b certification of disparate impact claims seeking both injunctive and equitable monetary relief remains appropriate.
argues that in the instant case we should depart from this general practice because b class certification of the disparate impact claim would violate the seventh amendment trial by jury clause.we are unpersuaded.
the trial by jury clause provides that i n suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.const.amend.vii.it requires that when an issue is common to both legal and equitable claims in the same proceeding,the legal claim must be tried first to a jury.jack friedenthal,mary kay kane arthur miller,civil procedure,at ed see dairy queen,wood,d.this is because,once the right to a jury trial attaches to a claim,it extends to all factual issues necessary to resolving that claim.where a legal and equitable claim in a suit share a common factual issue,trial of the equitable claim first to a judge would foreclose the later presentation of the common issue to a jury,and thereby violate the guarantee.see beacon theatres,westover,d.thus,when as here,a claim seeking compensatory damages is pled with a disparate impact claim,the claim must be tried first to a jury if there are common factual issues necessary to the resolution of each claim.
we believe class plaintiffs opportunity to proceed to a jury trial first on the liability phase of the claim avoids the possibility of an infringement of the guarantee.should the class plaintiffs prevail at the liability stage of the claim,the court can order injunctive relief and proceed to the remedial phase.trial of the disparate impact claim could then be put off until the remedial phase is resolved,thus ensuring that any overlapping factual issues between the two claims will have first been tried to a jury in accordance with the seventh amendment.if,however,the class plaintiffs should prove unsuccessful at the liability stage with respect to the disparate treatment claim,the district court can proceed with a bench trial of the disparate impact claim,relying on answers to special interrogatories from the jury for any common factual issues.
adequacy of representation 
as a final challenge to class certification,argues that the class plaintiffs are unlikely to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class as required by rule a.see.a.
two factors generally inform whether class representatives satisfy the rule a requirement absence of conflict and assurance of vigorous prosecution.newberg conte,supra,at amchem,windsor,d a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.does not contend that a conflict exists between the class plaintiffs and the putative class.rather,it argues that the class plaintiffs may lack an incentive to vigorously pursue the individual relief phases of the claims.
bases this contention on the fact that,as part of a settlement and stipulation with,the class plaintiffs agreed only to participate as named plaintiffs class representatives in support of the class claims to receive any injunctive relief,but not to seek individual relief of any kind,including monetary relief.robinson ii,at.metro north argues that e ven if some or all of the remaining class plaintiffs are suitable representatives for purposes of prosecuting the claims for liability,they plainly are unsuited to serve as representatives for class claims for monetary relief,since none of them are entitled to any additional monetary relief.the district court agreed with metro north,reasoning that t he net effect of the settlement and stipulation is that the class plaintiffs have little or no continued interest in pursuing damages on behalf of their fellow class members.id.at.
we think it significant that has not suggested,nor did the district court find,that the class plaintiffs are inadequate representatives to pursue injunctive relief.indeed,the settlement stipulation makes clear that the class plaintiffs stand to benefit from any injunctive relief that may be ordered.the class plaintiffs,therefore,plainly have an interest in fairly and vigorously pursuing the liability stage of the claim and the aspects of the disparate impact claim because the successful prosecution of one of these portions is a prerequisite for the issuance of injunctive relief.
contention that the class plaintiffs may thereafter fail to vigorously pursue the individual relief stages is both speculative and premature,and,we believe,is an insufficient basis for rejecting class certificatio
