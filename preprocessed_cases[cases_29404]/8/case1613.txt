background 
the defendant westchester county health care corporation wchcc is a public benefit corporation created by the state of new york in to perform the essential public and governmental function of operating the westchester county medical center wmc,a hospital in valhalla,new york.see pub.auth.law et.wchcc enabling statute endowed it with broad and comprehensive powers,as well as the flexibility to provide health and medical services for the public either directly or by agreement with other entities or individuals,and to determine its own internal policies,including those governing the practice of medicine within wmc.id.
the defendants steven lansman,and david spielvogel,are cardiothoracic and transplant surgeons whose professional corporation is defendant new york cardiothoracic group nycg collectively referred to hereinafter as the private defendants.in december,the private defendants entered into an exclusive professional services agreement with wchcc for the provision of cardiothoracic surgery services at wmc.defendant lansman is also the director of the department of cardiothoracic surgery at wmc.
plaintiffs rocco lafaro,and arlen fleisher,are also cardiothoracic surgeons,whose professional services corporation is the cardiac surgery group csg.lafaro and fleisher had cardiothoracic privileges at wmc prior to the effective date of wchcc contract with the private defendants.that contract includes a provision grandfathering lafaro and fleisher,that is,excepting them from the exclusivity granted to the private defendants 
the plaintiffs allege in their complaint that wchcc grant of an exclusivity agreement to the private defendants violated the sherman act,and state law.the factual allegations in the complaint include that lansman,after the execution of the exclusivity agreement,directed the scheduling of access to operating rooms,assignment of staff,and availability of equipment for heart and lung surgery at wmc to cause maximum disadvantage to the plaintiffs and their patients and to give preference to lansman and spielvogel,and that the private defendants blocked csg effort to hire a physician assistant to provide operating room support.in a decision dated september,the district court granted the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint for the reason that state action immunity applied to all defendants.
discussion 
standard of review 
the decision of the district court granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed de novo.pierce underwood,d see also city of new york beretta,cir citing miller wolpoff abramson,cir,demuria hawkes,cir noting that the legal standards of review for motions to dismiss and motions for judgment on the pleadings are indistinguishable.on a motion to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings we must accept all allegations in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in the party favor.miller,at quoting patel contemporary classics of beverly hills,cir.we are not bound to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations.ashcroft iqbal,d citing bell atlantic twombly,d.only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.id.at.
because the district court dismissed the case on the single basis of state action immunity,our only task with regard to the plaintiffs claims and the defendants affirmative defenses is to evaluate the district court conclusion that all the defendants are immune from suit,based on the allegations in those pleadings.
state action immunity 
parker brown,first established that action by a state acting in its sovereign capacity is not subject to federal antitrust law.however,a state subdivision such as a municipality or public corporation does not enjoy the complete deference due a state as sovereign.the state subdivision is entitled to state action immunity only when it acts pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy that authorizes its actions.city of lafayette.power light,d see also town of hallie city of eau claire,d.the requisite showing of authority has two components first,the subdivision must have authority to regulate second,it must have authority to suppress competition.inspectors,village of hills,cir quoting city of columbia omni outdoor,d.so long as the subdivision anticompetitive activities are a foreseeable consequence of the state delegation,the clear articulation standard has been met.cine theater nederlander,cir citing town of hallie,at.
state action immunity may also extend to private entities,when their particular anticompetitive acts are authorized by the state and further state regulatory policies.patrick burget,d.the test for extending state action immunity to a private party is commonly referred to as the midcal test,following its articulation in california retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d.in addition to a clearly articulated state policy,a private party seeking state action immunity under midcal must show active supervision of its anticompetitive conduct by the state.cine theater,at citing motor carriers rate conference,united states,d.the requirement of active state supervision is one way of ensuring that the actor is engaging in the challenged conduct pursuant to state policy.town of hallie,at.this requirement exists because absent supervision,there is no realistic assurance that a private party anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy,rather than merely the party individual interests.patrick,at.in midcal,the supreme court stated that the active state supervision requirement was necessary 
to prevent a state from circumventing the sherman act proscriptions by casting a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private arrangement.at.at.where a private party is engaging in the anticompetitive activity,there is a real danger that he is acting to further his own interests,rather than the governmental interests of the state.
town of hallie,at.thus,the objective of the midcal test second prong is to ensure that the state itself,rather than a private party,is the effective decision maker.fed.trade comm ticor title ins,d.
this court stated that governmental entities which are immune from antitrust activity must be permitted to enter into contracts with private entities without suffering tangential attacks on their authorized,anticompetitive practices via suits against the private parties.see cine theater,at,inspectors,at citing automated salvage,wheelabrator envtl,cir.in both cine theater and wheelabrator,active supervision was not required of the private entity because the only anticompetitive actions allegedly taken by the defendants were those of contracting with the entity.inspectors,at.we held that under those limited circumstances,subjecting the defendants to antitrust liability would effectively block the state entity efforts to carry out its mandate through contracts with private parties.inspectors,at citing wheelabrator original brackets omitted.
this case presents us with an opportunity to again recognize the immunity for private parties identified by hallie and cine theater,but at the same time reaffirm the important purpose of midcal active supervision requirement,which is to ensure that the state itself,rather than a private party,is the effective decision maker.the latter requires that a governmental entity,if it wishes to extend antitrust immunity to the private parties with whom it contracts,must actively supervise decisions of these private parties in order to ensure that they further the interests of the state.
application 
wchcc and wmc 
we agree with the district court that wchcc is entitled to the same status,for purposes of the state action immunity analysis,as a municipality.cine theater,at.the district court also correctly concluded that the type of anticompetitive behavior by wchcc that is at issue in this case was a foreseeable consequence of the authorizations in wchcc enabling statute.wchcc enabling statute created wchcc for the express purpose of operating a hospital in the public interest.pub.auth.law.this statute also granted wchcc broad powers to ensure that it would have t
