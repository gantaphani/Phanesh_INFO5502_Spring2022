the management of complex litigation presents challenges that test the mettle of even the most able trial judge.given the rigors of this task,we have ceded substantial discretion to the district courts with respect to case management decisions.but that discretion,though wide,is not boundless.
in the case at hand,two case management orders crossed this line an order that totally denied plaintiffs counsel access to their own clients and an order that prevented the plaintiffs from seeking plainly relevant discovery.accordingly,we vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the background facts are set out in exegetic detail in a prior opinion of this court and in the opinion of the court below.see sam ex rel.elliott carcieri,cir cassie ex rel.irons chafee cassie iii,d.we assume the reader familiarity with those narratives and rehearse here only the events that bear directly on the issues sub judice.
this putative class action was brought on behalf of ten foster children in the custody of the rhode island department of children,youth and families dcyf.because the plaintiffs were minors,the initiators of the suit sought to appear as their next friends under federal rule of civil procedure.
the complaint designated as defendants,in their official capacities,a coterie of state officials collectively,the state.it sought certification of a class of all minor children who were in or might enter dcyf custody based on a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect.invoking,the complaint prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the putative class.
the gravamen of the complaint was the allegation that dcyf failings expose foster children in its custody to an unreasonable risk of harm in violation of their substantive due process rights.relatedly,the complaint averred that the state had failed to comply in various respects with the adoption assistance and child welfare act of.
the state moved to dismiss the complaint,and the district court obliged.the court principal rationale was that the proposed next friends did not satisfy rule requirements see sam ex rel.elliott carcieri,d.on appeal,we deemed it fitting that foster children be afforded access to a federal forum to seek redress against their custodian.see sam,at.after evaluating the qualifications of the proposed next friends,we concluded that they were suitable representatives.see id.at.
on remand,the case was transferred to a different trier.see b.the state again moved to dismiss,this time invoking federal rule of civil procedure b.although the district court dismissed as moot the claims of five more plaintiffs,it allowed the case to proceed.see sam ex rel.elliott chafee,d.the court then invited the parties to submit updated briefing on the plaintiffs motion for class certification which had been filed with the complaint.later,however,the court advised the parties that it would not address class certification until it had decided dispositive motions on the individual claims.
concerned about the ravages of mootness,the district court allowed the filing of an amended complaint adding five new plaintiffs.the court then denied without prejudice the motion for class certification.
pretrial discovery frequently proved contentious,taxing the patience of the district judge and the magistrate judge.although their efforts bordered on the heroic,we eschew a account and,instead,through seven months of discovery to october.on that date with an array of unfulfilled discovery requests and motions to compel pending the state moved for a protective order aimed at limiting the scope of discovery.its principal thesis was that the plaintiffs were entitled only to information pertaining directly to the named plaintiffs.for example,it objected to many of the plaintiffs discovery requests on the ground that the information sought went beyond the case files of the individual plaintiffs and,therefore,was not relevant.
the district judge referred the motion to the magistrate judge,who allowed the protective order in part.see cassie ex rel.irons chafee cassie i,slip op.at,unpublished.his rescript explained that,in light of the district judge plan to address the claims of the individual plaintiffs on summary judgment before addressing class certification,discovery should be limited to information bearing upon those claims.see id.at.no separate order was entered delineating the modified scope of discovery,but the magistrate judge directed the parties to confer in an attempt to narrow their disputes in light of his decision.as a result,the plaintiffs provisionally withdrew portions of their motions to compel.
the plaintiffs appealed the protective order to the district judge,who upheld it.see.a.thereafter,the magistrate judge ruled on a number of lingering discovery issues.his decision confirmed that the protective order effectively precluded the plaintiffs from seeking policy or practice discovery.cassie ex rel.irons chafee cassie ii,wl,at.this depiction was consistent with the way in which the plaintiffs had characterized the protective order in their appeal to the district judge.
another development transpired while the parties were sparring over the scope of discovery.on february,the plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification.they argued that the district judge reluctance to decide the class certification issue was causing substantial prejudice because the claims of ten plaintiffs already had become moot and several more plaintiffs would soon age out of dcyf custody.following procedural skirmishing not relevant here,the district judge again declined to address class certification and allowed the state to delay a response to the class certification motion until fourteen days after any summary judgment decision.
on july,the district judge performed an.at a status conference,the judge voiced concerns about how long it was taking to bring the case to a head.she suggested that the most efficient course of action would be to dispense with dispositive motions and proceed directly to trial.acting on her own suggestion,the judge declared that she would set the case for trial on the individual claims without awaiting summary judgment motions.
the plaintiffs objected and moved for various kinds of relief.pertinently,they implored the district judge to postpone any trial,take up the issue of class certification,and reopen discovery so that they could obtain the policy and custom evidence that had been foreclosed by the protective order.the judge rejected these importunings.citing the fact that the plaintiffs had been able to depose certain dcyf policymakers,she stated that she believe d that the plaintiffs had an opportunity and have received evidence and discovery on the question of dcyf policies,procedures,and customs.in regard to her unwillingness to address class certification,the judge noted that the plaintiffs were required to prove that their constitutional and statutory rights were being violated and reasoned that such a determination could more expeditiously be made in the context of their individual claims before allowing discovery.
with an unwanted trial looming,plaintiffs counsel asked the state to facilitate meetings with their clients.the state demurred,making plain that it would not provide any contact information without a court order.on august,the plaintiffs moved to compel the state to allow plaintiffs counsel and the next friends to meet with the plaintiffs for purposes of trial preparation the state objected.
at the ensuing hearing,the district judge stated that she viewed the motion for access as a veiled attempt to obtain fact discovery beyond the discovery deadline.when the judge asked whether the named plaintiffs would be called as witnesses,counsel replied that they could not make that determination without meeting with their clients.the judge proceeded to deny the motion,effectively preventing plaintiffs counsel from speaking with their clients in advance of trial.
by the time that the trial commenced on november,the claims of all but two of the named plaintiffs danny and cassie m.had been rendered moot through aging or adoption.when the plaintiffs rested,the state moved for judgment on partial findings.see.c.the district judge took the matter under advisement and,after receiving briefing,concluded that the plaintiffs had presented insufficient evidence to establish that dcyf policies and customs had either harmed them or exposed them to an unreasonable risk of harm.see cassie iii,d at.the judge likewise concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to carry their burden of proof with respect to their statutory causes of action.see id.at.judgment entered,and this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
the plaintiffs advance a compendium of claims of error.two of these claims,which relate to pretrial proceedings,are front and center that the district court i prevented the plaintiffs without sufficient reason from meeting with their lawyers and ii improvidently pretermitted discovery relating to dcyf policies and customs.because we conclude that the district court abused its discretion both when it denied plaintiffs counsel access to their clients and when it refused to allow discovery essential to the plaintiffs claims,we are constrained to vacate the judgment.the tale follows.
access to counsel.
the plaintiffs submit that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to allow their lawyers to meet with them we have not yet had occasion to consider the standard of review applicable to decisions anent a minor access to her lawyers.nor do we need to cross that bridge today the parties agree that we should review this decision for abuse of discretion,and we accept that agreement.see united states ramirez rivera,cir borden paul revere life ins,cir holding that federal court sitting in diversity may accept parties reasonable agreement concerning choice of law.
the district court is responsible for safeguarding the interests of those minors who appear as litigants before it.see noe true,cir.the situation is complicated where,as here,the minors are foster children who are suing the state.as we previously noted,the state has a structural conflict of interest when it comes to decisions concerning the legal representation of such plaintiffs.see sam,at n.this conflict is exacerbated because plaintiffs counsel can not even gain access to their own clients without the state cooperation.
the claim of error here tests the way in which the district court handled this conflict.a fundamental principle guides our analysis.civil litigants have a constitutional right,rooted in the due process clause,to retain the services of counsel.see gray new eng,cir potashnick port city constr,cir.this right safeguards a litigant interest in communicating freely with counsel both in preparation for and during trial.see doe district of columbia,potashnick,at.after all,the right to retain counsel would be drained of meaning if a litigant could not speak openly with her lawyer about her case and how best to prosecute it.see denius dunlap,cir doe,at.while this right is not absolute courts surely can insist upon reasonable rules of practice that affect the relationship a court must give great weight to this valued interest even in areas committed to its discretion.see,doe,at requiring protective order limiting counsel discussion of discovery materials with client to be narrowly drawn potashnick,at reversing judgment where court unreasonably barred attorney from speaking to client during breaks in testimony.
resolving this appeal does not require us to explore all of the circumstances that might justify limiting communications between a minor plaintiff and her lawyer.suffice it to say that a court may not restrain a litigant access to counsel without some substantial justification,and any such restraint should be narrowly tailored to respond to the concern that prompted it.see doe,at in re,gulf oil bernard,d discussing restrictions on communications with potential class members,and requiring that such orders be carefully drawn and limit speech as little as possible.an order that effectively precludes any pretrial communication between a minor and her attorney must satisfy these criteria.
no substantial justification is apparent here.the record reveals no indication that the court below accorded any weight to the plaintiffs interest in communicating with counsel.goaded by the state,the court seemed to assume that the next friends access to counsel was a sufficient substitute for the plaintiffs access,reasoning that for purposes of trial strategy sessions,that what the next friends are for.but this reasoning does not hold water even if a next friend access to counsel sometimes may assuage due process concerns,that would not be true when,as in this case,the next friend was also denied access to the client.
the district court gave two other reasons in support of its preclusive ruling.first,the court posited that the motion for access was untimely because it was filed after the close of discovery.this assumed,of course,that the purpose of the requested meetings was to obtain discoverable information.but that assumption was not grounded in anything that plaintiffs counsel said or wrote.rather,plaintiffs counsel advised the court that the purpose of the proposed meetings was to prepare for trial and to determine whether their clients wished to testify 
at any rate,the plaintiffs interest in speaking with their counsel plainly persisted beyond the close of discovery.even though there was a legitimate concern that counsel might obtain and attempt to introduce new information in derogation of the discovery deadline,the district court had the ability to prevent the use of such new information without resorting to a total denial of access.there is no need to use an elephant gun to slay a mouse,and the court could have allowed the meetings to proceed and simply excluded any newly discovered matter if and when the plaintiffs attempted to use it at trial.see.f b a ii.
the district court second rationale relates to its allowance of a motion by plaintiffs counsel to have their chosen psychologist interview the plaintiffs in advance of trial.the court theorized that since it was allowing the psychologist to examine the plaintiffs,plaintiffs counsel would have the benefit of the psychologist report and would have no need to meet personally with their clients.we do not agree.
the psychological examinations served an entirely different purpose than the requested meetings.those examinations did not provide counsel an opportunity to explain the litigation,determine how the children would fit into a trial strategy,or ascertain the desirability of having them testify.if more were needed and we doubt that it is the psychological examinations were videotaped and by court order delivered to opposing counsel.manifestly,then,any privileged communication was impossible.that the court allowed the psychological examinations to go forward was irrelevant to whether the state was justified in blocking the lawyers access to their clients.
in an effort to catch lightning in a bottle,the state tries to justify the denial of access on the ground that meetings might not have been in the plaintiffs best interests.but this is pie in the sky the state offered no evidence that the plaintiffs might suffer any harm from such meetings dancing around this point,the state says without meaningful citation to the record that the district court denied access,at least in part,out of such a concern.but the district judge,who ably articulated her views at every stage of this complex case,neither expressed any such concern nor made any finding that harm was likely to ensue should the lawyers meet with their clients consequently,we decline the state invitation to impute this reasoning to the court below.
the short of the matter is that the denial of access rests on insupportable findings,which are not strengthened by the state conjectural hypotheses.there is simply not enough here to justify the total denial of a litigant right to consult with her lawyer.sam,at disapproving state attempt to oppose appointment of next friends based on a general assertion that other relatives might be suitable representatives.
let us be perfectly clear.we do not hold that a
