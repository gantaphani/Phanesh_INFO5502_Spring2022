in november,the national marine fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service collectively,the services issued a final decision designating atlantic salmon in an area comprised of seven maine rivers to be an endangered species under the endangered species act.supp.iv.several weeks later,the state of maine and business group plaintiffs sued to have the decision set aside.the united states appeared to defend the services.several conservation groups,defenders of wildlife,biodiversity foundation,conservation action project,forest ecology network,and coastal waters project collectively,defenders,sought to intervene,also attempting to defend the designation of the atlantic salmon as an endangered species.defenders chief argument was that the services had recently been their adversaries in earlier litigation,which defenders had brought to force the services to protect the salmon,and this meant the united states did not and could not adequately represent the conservation groups interests.no party opposed the intervention.
the district court nonetheless denied the intervention,but did say it would allow defenders to participate in the litigation on an status.maine norton,no.civ,wl,at.as,defenders have the right to submit briefs including arguments not presented by the government,a limited right to call and witnesses,and a right to receive notice and service of all documents and events as if they were parties in the case.defenders appealed from the denial of intervention.the plaintiff business interests appeared to defend the district court order as within its discretion.the state of maine has not taken a position on the appeal.
with a caveat,we affirm the order as within the trial court discretion.in doing so,we decline to adopt a per se rule,urged by defenders,that the inadequacy of representation test of.a is automatically met where the litigation challenges governmental action which the government defends and the proposed intervenor had earlier sued the government trying to bring about a similar action.rather,the inadequacy test must be looked at in context of the facts of the specific case.that context leads to the caveat should,in the course of this litigation,the trial court conclude that the government appears not to represent adequately the interest of defenders,then it should reconsider afresh,on application,the matter of intervention.
legend has it that salmon were once so plentiful in the great rivers of maine that workers along the kennebec river negotiated as a term of employment that they would not be fed salmon for breakfast,lunch,and dinner.bunting,a day work.in the year,by contrast,very few wild adult salmon returned to the seven maine rivers at issue in this case the dennys,east machias,machias,pleasant,narraguagus,ducktrap,and sheepscot rivers.me.atl.salmon comm n,trap catch statistics,at http last modified.this is significant because the atlantic salmon spawns in freshwater rivers.young salmon live in those rivers for one to three years before they undergo changes which enable them to live in saltwater.the salmon then migrate to the atlantic ocean.in reproducing,they return to the streams where they were born,where the female salmon delivers the eggs.
concerned about the decline in salmon population,in one of the conservation groups petitioned the services to list the salmon as an endangered species under the endangered species act esa.see g c requiring written notice.at providing a history of previous federal action concerning the salmon.
endangered species is a legal term of art that signifies any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.it is contrasted with threatened species,which signifies any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future.id.the esa requires the secretary of the interior to determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of any of the following factors a the present or threatened destruction,modification,or curtailment of its habitat or range b overutilization for commercial,recreational,scientific,or educational purposes c disease or predation d the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms or e other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.id.a.the secretary must classify species as endangered or threatened solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts,if any,being made by any state to protect such species.id.b a.
the purpose of such classification is to conserve the endangered or threatened species.see id.b.but there are differences between the two classifications.while the esa requires the secretary to issue regulations to provide for the conservation of threatened species,id.d,it also prohibits the import,export,or taking of endangered species,id.a.when making either the threatened or endangered determination,the secretary must take state efforts to protect the species into account.id.b a.if the secretary enters into a cooperative agreement with a state to protect a threatened species,regulations to protect that species,with the exception of regulations prohibiting the taking of that species,apply only to the extent that the state has adopted them.id.d.
this legislative framework sets the stage for the regulatory history,which is essential to understanding defenders argument.
in,in response to the petition to list the atlantic salmon under the esa,the services published a notice in the federal register indicating that such a listing was potentially warranted.in,the services concluded that the requested listing was not warranted because the salmon as they had been described in the earlier petition did not meet the esa definition of a species.in this same notice,the services concluded that the atlantic salmon in seven maine rivers did meet the esa criteria for a species because they were found to be evolutionarily significant and reproductively isolated from other populations belonging to the same species.id.at.
in,the services published a proposed rule listing the gulf of maine distinct population segment dps of the atlantic salmon as threatened under the esa.but in,the services withdrew the proposed rule because of scientific data bearing on the health of the dps and ongoing and planned actions to protect the atlantic salmon,including federal conservation efforts and the state of maine development of the atlantic salmon conservation plan for seven maine rivers.at.
maine conservation plan addresses both ongoing and proposed actions to reduce threats to the atlantic salmon.id.at.the stated intent of the conservation plan is to minimize human impacts on the atlantic salmon and restore the species id.the maine plan identifies five categories of threats to the salmon agriculture,aquaculture,forestry,recreational fishing,and other natural and human related threats.id.at.for each category of threat,the plan describes ongoing and planned future actions to protect the salmon.id.
when deciding whether to classify a species as threatened or endangered under the esa,the secretary must consider the status of the species after accounting for any state efforts to protect the species.b a.after doing so,the services in concluded that ongoing actions had substantially reduced threats to the species and that the dps was not likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future and so listing was not warranted at the time.at.
in,the proposed intervenors filed suit in the district court for the district of columbia,challenging the services withdrawal of the proposed rule.while the litigation was underway,the services in november proposed a new rule that listed the gulf of maine salmon as endangered,not merely threatened.once a proposed listing rule is promulgated,the services ordinarily have one year to make a final decision.b a i.
on june,the parties in the litigation entered into a stipulation agreeing to stay that litigation pending the services decision to promulgate or withdraw the proposed endangered species rule by november.in entering the stipulation,the services were modifying their unilateral ability to extend the review process by six months,see b b.the stipulation did provide that a party could ask the court to modify the terms of the agreement.eventually,the litigation concluded and judgment entered.the services complied with the stipulation by deciding within the stipulated time frame of one year.
the services issued a final rule listing the gulf of maine atlantic salmon as an endangered species.to be codified at pts.and.in their justification for listing the atlantic salmon as endangered,the services considered,among other factors,the low number of returning adult salmon.at,the escalating threat of disease,id.at,and threats to the salmon from existing aquaculture practices,id.at.
the state of maine,the maine state chamber of commerce,and various maine businesses and business associations challenged the regulation.they alleged,pursuant to the administrative procedure act,that the services designation of the maine atlantic salmon as endangered was arbitrary and capricious and should therefore be set aside.see a.their complaint included allegations that the services failed to base their listing decision on the best available data ignored maine plan to protect and restore the salmon unlawfully agreed to restrict their own ability to extend the statutory deadline for regulating and acted inconsistently with their prior decision not to list the salmon as threatened or endangered.
we start with defenders challenge to the district court denial of their motion for intervention of right.intervention of right,in the absence of a federal statute granting intervention,is governed by.a,which states 
upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
this suit largely turns on the clause unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
the appellate standard of review in this circuit is that w e will reverse the denial of a motion to intervene as of right if the court fails to apply the general standard provided by the text of rule a,or if the court reaches a decision that so fails to comport with the standard as to indicate an abuse of discretion.public serv.of patch,cir quoting international paper town of jay,cir.as we have said,abuse of discretion may be a misleading phrase.decisions on abstract issues of law are always reviewed de novo and the extent of deference on law application issues tends to vary with the circumstances.cotter.ass of minority law enforcement officers,cir,cert.denied,d.despite its nomenclature,intervention as of right usually turns on judgment calls and fact assessments that a reviewing court is unlikely to disturb except for clear mistakes i n practice,the district court enjoys a reasonable measure of latitude daggett comm on governmental ethics and election practices,cir 
some burden of showing inadequacy is placed on the proposed intervenor.see id.at not deciding whether burden is one of production or persuasion.the general alignment of interest of the services and defenders in upholding the designation is.this case is not an instance of the government having to make a regulatory choice which may be adverse to the proposed intervenors the government has made the choice to designate the species as endangered,and the result is what the proposed intervenors wanted.there is no inadequacy immediately apparent in such a situation.
defenders make two arguments as to intervention of right,only one of which has any substance.the primary argument is that the services,formerly defenders antagonists,can not be trusted to defend fully the endangered species designation because they will not make an argument which defenders would make.the argument the services are unlikely to make is that the services should have protected the atlantic salmon earlier,that they were wrong when they failed to do so,particularly in deferring to maine state plan in,and that the designation corrected an earlier mistake.indeed,the issue on which defenders focus is in the case as a result of plaintiffs pleadings.plaintiffs complaints claim that the change in the government position between and is evidence of the arbitrariness of the services designation.more specifically,defenders say that the argument they would make is different in kind from the other arguments because it is an argument under step one of chevron that as a matter of law,the services could not in have deferred to the maine conservation plan.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.that is because,in their view,that plan was not an existing regulatory mechanism under a d.
the services,having not opposed intervention below,have not appeared in this appeal,but we assume that they are not likely to confess any error as to the withdrawal of the threatened species designation.rather,they will likely say that the sum of information available to them justified the designation.
defenders argue that the supreme court has said that applicants for intervention need only make a minimal showing that representation may be inadequate.trbovich united mine workers,d.from this defenders make a stab at an argument that the district court made an error of law,reviewed de novo,by holding them to the test of demonstrating that the services will fail to adequately protect their claimed interest.norton,wl at.will fail,they say,is a harsher standard than may be inadequate.this argument,which relies on a single phrase plucked out of a lengthy opinion,is not a fair reading of what the district court did.the court applied trbovich and this circuit law and there is no serious argument that the court misapprehended the legal standard in its careful analysis.in addition,this case is meaningfully different from trbovich.in trbovich,the court doubts about the adequacy of the government representation stemmed from the labor secretary statutory duty to represent the two distinct interests of the individual union members and the general public.at.here there is no statutorily imposed conflict and the services interests are closely aligned with defenders interests.
this case presents a recurring situation a group with recognized interests wishes to intervene and defend an action of the government which the government is itself defending.trbovich is such a case,as are several of our decisions in the area,cotter,minority police officers and massachusetts association of minority law enforcement officers sought to intervene to defend police department promotion of minority officers.food ass.alcoholic beverages control comm n,cir trade associations sought to intervene to defend massachusetts liquor regulation,cert.denied,d daggett,parties intending to run for office sought to intervene to defend maine clean election act patch,industry and consumer groups sought to intervene to defend new hampshire electric utility restructuring plan united nuclear cannon,cir conservation law foundation sought to intervene to defend rhode island nuclear power regulation.
generally,our decisions have proceeded on the assumption,subject to evidence to the contrary,that the government will adequately defend its actions,at least where its interests appear to be aligned with those of the proposed intervenor.food ass n,at.indeed,our cases use the language of presumption,id.at daggett,at.although the bar is raised higher for proposed intervenors in this situation,there is danger in a mechanistic application of such language.presumption means no more in this context than calling for an adequate explanation as to why what is,adequate not so.see.mccormick on evidence at john strong et,ed.the facts of these cases vary greatly and whether the proposed intervenors explanation of inadequacy suffices must be determined in keeping with a commonsense view of the overall litigation.
