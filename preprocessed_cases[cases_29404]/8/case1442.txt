background 
halebian complaint 
on may,john halebian,a holder of shares in one of six separate investment funds the funds within citifunds trust iii the trust,a massachusetts business trust,filed a complaint raising three claims in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against members of the trust board of trustees the board.the suit arose in connection with the june,corporate sale the transaction of subsidiary companies that advised the six funds.pursuant to the transaction,citigroup,which owned the adviser subsidiaries,sold substantially all of its business to legg mason,automatically terminating,under federal law,the funds existing contracts.following the sale and contract termination,the trust board approved new agreements the new agreements between the trust and legg mason and then issued a proxy statement to trust shareholders recommending that they vote to approve the new agreements.
in his complaint,halebian challenges two principal aspects of the transaction.first,he questions the new agreements authorization of the payment of soft dollars,which permitted legg mason to hire that also perform research services a combination that often results in higher commissions for the chosen than those paid to standard.second,he challenges shareholder voting procedures permitting echo voting,which in this case allows service agents,as record holders of certain shares of the funds,to vote their total number of shares in proportion to the votes they received from the shares beneficial owners,even if the service agents had not received voting instructions from all of their customers.halebian asserts,in sum,that the defendants failed to avail themselves of the opportunity to negotiate lower fees or seek competing bids from other qualified investment advisers and utterly ignored their obligations of loyalty and good faith to cititrust and its beneficiaries.complaint,halebian berv,civ.may.
halebian claim one,presented as a derivative claim on behalf of the trust,alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the trust in considering the t ransaction and in recommending the new advisory agreements.id.claims two and three,styled as direct claims,allege that the defendants violated federal and state law by issuing materially false and misleading statements and by omitting material information from the proxy statement as part of an effort to induce their shareholders to approve the trust new agreements with legg mason.id.
the defendants motion to dismiss 
on october,the defendants counsel moved to dismiss halebian complaint pursuant to,inter alia,federal rule of civil procedure b.regarding claims two and three,the defendants asserted that federal rules b and,and various provisions of the investment company act the ica,u.a a,required dismissal of the two claims because these claims were derivative in nature,not direct,and as such failed as a matter of law.specifically addressing their requested dismissal of claim one,the defendants relied in part on a enacted provision of massachusetts law codifying the rule permitting a corporation directors to move to dismiss a derivative lawsuit as to the prosecution of which the leadership concluded would not be in the corporation best interest see.gen laws ch,a.
our prior panel opinion 
in halebian ii,we agreed with the defendants and the district court,classifying the second and third claims asserted in the plaintiff complaint as derivative by looking to massachusetts law,which all agree is applicable.halebian ii,at.we saw the gravamen of the second and third claims as halebian challenge to the use of echo voting.we then reasoned 
there is no indication that the alleged unlawfulness of echo voting under section a of the ica or massachusetts law was called to the attention of the board by halebian or anyone else prior to the institution of this lawsuit.and the board has consistently and strenuously denied that echo voting violates these laws.since the board was apparently not of the view,nor had it been told,that using a citigroupaffiliated service agent other than a to echo vote shares violated the ica or massachusetts law,or indeed any law,its failure to inform shareholders to the contrary does not appear to us to have been potentially false and misleading so as to be cognizable under massachusetts or federal law.
id.footnotes omitted.we thus expressed our inclination to affirm the judgment of the district court naomi reice buchwald,judge dismissing halebian second and third claims,but declined to resolve them at that time.we reserved decision on those claims so that we could consider any commentary or analysis that the supreme judicial court of massachusetts might offer in answering our certified question regarding halebian first claim.id.
as to halebian undisputedly derivative first claim,which alleges a breach of fiduciary duty for failure to investigate alternatives to the new agreements between the trust and legg mason,we first rejected the district court reliance on federal rule of civil procedure in dismissing the claim.we were of the view that halebian complaint satisfied this federal pleading rule for derivative claims and,accordingly,that the claim thus stands or falls on whether it was properly dismissed pursuant to massachusetts substantive law.id.at.on the question,the district court had ruled that despite language in the state dismissal provision indicating that it applies only to derivative proceedings commenced after the rejection of a demand.laws ch,a emphasis added,the defendants could rely on the provision irrespective of the fact that the plaintiff had filed suit before the board rejection of the demand,provided they rejected the plaintiff demand after a good faith review.halebian i,d at.
proffering an alternative reading but declin ing to resolve the issue in the first instance,halebian ii,at,we certified to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts the following question under massachusetts law,can the business judgment rule,established under.laws ch,be applied to dismiss a derivative complaint filed timely under section but prior to a corporation rejection of the demand that serves as the basis for the suit id.at.
supreme judicial court response 
on august,the supreme judicial court issued an opinion answering our certified question in the affirmative.halebian iii,at,at.the court reasoned,inter alia 
if we were to adopt the plaintiff assertion that the legislature inclusion of the phrase,commenced after rejection of a demand,was intended to deny a corporation the benefit of the business judgment doctrine where it failed to reject a shareholder demand before the filing of a derivative complaint,we would be giving an interpretation that would be in direct conflict with other language in the same section and that would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme embodied in the act and reflected in the commentary of its drafters.for these reasons,despite the statute unfortunate inclusion of a phrase that,when read in isolation,would suggest that a was intended to limit dismissals under the business judgment doctrine to derivative proceedings commenced after rejection of a demand,we conclude that the legislature did not intend such a limitation.rather,we conclude that the legislature intended that a derivative action must be dismissed under following a corporation independent determination,made in good faith and after reasonable inquiry,that maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation,regardless whether the derivative complaint has been filed before or after the corporation rejection of the shareholder demand.
we now resolve the instant appeal in light of the careful opinion of the supreme judicial court of massachusetts in response to our certified question.
discussion 
claims two and three 
because the supreme judicial court said nothing in halebian iii that affects our analysis of halebian second and third claims as set forth in halebian ii,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing those claims for the reasons set forth in our prior opinion.see halebian ii,at.
ii.claim one 
the supreme judicial court,in agreement with the district court in this case,ruled that a defendant in a derivative suit governed by massachusetts law may employ the business judgment rule,codified at.laws ch,to dismiss a shareholder complaint that is filed prior to a corporation rejection of the demand that serves as the basis for the suit.halebian iii,at,at.it does not follow,however,that we can affirm the district court judgment in its present form.
operation of section 
as stated by the supreme judicial court,the business judgment rule embodied in section protects a corporation decision that prosecution of a claim demanded by a shareholder is not in the best interests of the corporation where the decision is made in good faith by independent decision makers after reasonable inquiry.id.at,at.as applicable to this case after certification,section provides that a derivative proceeding commenced either before or after rejection of a demand shall be dismissed by the court on motion by the corporation if the court finds that a majority vote of independent directors present at a meeting of the board of directors has determined in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based that the maintenance of the proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation.laws ch,a,b emphases added.upon filing its motion to dismiss,the corporation must show by a written filing with the court setting forth facts that the corporation has established independence,good faith,and the conduct of a reasonable inquiry.id.d.the court shall then dismiss the suit unless the plaintiff has alleged with particularity facts in its complaint or an amended complaint or in a written filing to the court rebutting the corporation filing.id.emphasis added.the statute further provides that if the independence requirement in subsection a is met,the plaintiff bears the burden of proving a lack of good faith and reasonable inquiry on the part of the directors by contrast,if the independence requirement is not satisfied,the corporation must prove that those two elements are present.id.e.
in ruling on claim one,the district court adverted to the fact that the plaintiff did not plead or otherwise proffer any reason why the board decision to reject the demand was illegitimate.halebian i,d at.but we think that relying solely on the failure of the plaintiff to contest the corporation filing omits a crucial statutory step.the statute requires a court to find that various conditions have been satisfied that the board is independent,and that it in good faith determined after a reasonable inquiry that the plaintiff suit was not in the corporation best interests.laws ch,d.the latter component the existence of a,reasonable inquiry into the corporation best interests the plaintiff suit is subject to the provisions of subsection e.see id.e.however,that such turns on the independence of the decision maker unambiguously demonstrates that the court evaluation of independence is a prerequisite to the operation of the dismissal statute in toto 
we see no such finding of independence in halebian though the court factual summary and legal discussion appear to assume the board independence,see id.at,the statute by its own terms requires more,see.laws ch,a.supporting this reading of the statutory text,the massachusetts superior court in two of only four opinions of which we are aware to discuss the statute at issue here,three of which are part of the same lawsuit determined that in evaluating a motion to dismiss under section,the court must begin with an evaluation of the independence of the board or committee charged with responding to a shareholder demand.blake friendly ice cream,wl,at.lexis,at super.hampden county may,see also pinchuck state,wl,at.lexis,at super.suffolk county.the blake court then embarked upon a lengthy consideration of the corporation factual submissions purporting to demonstrate the independence of the members of its special litigation committee slc as well as the propriety of the committee formation,evaluating their sufficiency against massachusetts law.see blake,wl,at.lexis,at see also pinchuck,wl,at.lexis,at conducting a factual inquiry into the independence of the special committee that rejected the plaintiffs demand.having rejected the slc assertion of independence based on the court evidentiary review,the blake court next assessed the slc burden under section e of proving that its determination was in good faith and after a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions were based.blake,wl,at.lexis,at see also pinchuck,wl,at.lexis,at.
in light of the requirement that a deciding court,in ruling on a motion brought under section to dismiss a derivative suit,must evaluate the movant evidentiary submissions to determine whether the corporate entity rejecting a plaintiff demand is independent,and because the district court did not do so in evaluating the defendants motion under federal rule of civil procedure b,we vacate the court judgment as to claim one.
relationship between section and rule b 
in halebian ii,we noted that the plaintiff also pressed the argument that even assuming section did apply to the facts of this case a question the supreme judicial court has now settled definitively in the affirmative the district court erred by failing to convert the board motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and in barring the plaintiff from seeking discovery before deciding such a motion.halebian ii,at.we now conclude that,under the circumstances presented here,the dictates of section are sufficiently in conflict with the contours of federal rule of civil procedure b as to require the district court to complete its evaluation of this matter on remand by converting the defendants motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.
as we have noted,section sets forth both substantive standards for adjudicating the effectiveness of a board rejection of a demand and instructions regarding the procedure by which that rejection must be communicated to and its validity established before a court.the dismissal procedure requires a defendant to submit various extrinsic evidentiary materials that the plaintiff may not have referenced or included within his complaint.see.laws ch,d.
by contrast,the purpose of federal rule of civil procedure b is to test,in a streamlined fashion,the formal sufficiency of the plaintiff statement of a claim for relief without resolving a contest regarding its substantive merits.global network commc ns,city of new york,cir emphasis omitted accord labounty adler,cir.the court therefore does not ordinarily look beyond the complaint and attached documents in deciding a motion to dismiss brought under the rule.staehr hartford fin.servs,cir.
on the other hand,of course,on a motion for summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure,the parties test the substantive merits of the claim or claims and their evidentiary support based on additional supporting material in their possession or obtained during discovery.chambers time warner,cir see global network commc ns,at although rule b assesses the legal feasibility of the complaint,it does not weigh the evidence that might be offered to support it.when matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under rule.d,in order to ensure that the party against whom the motion to dismiss is made may respond.cortec,sum holding,cir,cert.denied.
the procedure contemplated by section of the massachusetts statute does not easily fit within the constraints of rule b,even as it has been broadened by occasional judicial glosses on its terms while a dismissal pursuant to rule b is,at bottom,a declaration that the plaintiff complaint and incorporated materials are insufficient as a matter of law to support a claim upon which relief may be granted,see cortec,at,massachusetts section provides a procedure by which a defendant must introduce extraneous material in order to secure dismissal.the massachusetts statute imposes an initial burden on the corporation to come forward with facts to show it is entitled to the section protection.laws ch,cmt.to avail itself of section,the corporation is required to present to the court a filing containing facts justifying application of the business judgment rule.see id.d see also blake,wl,at.lexis,at concluding that the party moving to dismiss under section has an initial hurdle of showing that the board committee which decided to reject the plaintiff demand was properly constituted and also bears the burden of submitting a written filing with the court setting forth facts to show that a majority of the board was independent when the independent directors made their determination,and that the independent directors made the determination in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based.
according to the statute,then,the corporation first must file its motion to dismiss and make a written filing with the court setting forth facts to show whether a majority of the board of directors was independent at the time of the determination by the independent directors.id.d.if,as discussed in part ii a,above,the trial court determines that the board is independent,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the independent directors did not make the determination in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which their conclusions are based.id.d,e.in this scenario,the court shall dismiss the suit unless the plaintiff has alleged with particularity facts rebutting the corporation filing in its complaint or an amended complaint or in a written filing with the court.id.thus the state statute explicitly contemplates an additional opportunity for the plaintiff to rebut if he or she has not done so in the original complaint the defendant factual showings of independence,good faith,and reasonable inquiry,either through an amended complaint or some other written filing with the court.see blake,wl,at.lexis,at if the slc satisfies this burden of setting forth such facts regarding independence and the plaintiff alleges with particularity facts rebutting the slc written filing under d,the court assesses the evidence as to whether or not the slc was independent and whether it determined in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based that maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation.section d also requires that discovery be stayed upon the filing of the motion to dismiss and the required supporting materials until the court rules on the motion,unless a motion for discovery is made and good cause shown for specified discovery.laws ch,d.
insofar as the section procedure encourages or requires the parties to submit,and under which it is expected that the court will review,evidentiary materials outside the scope of what the plaintiff has already included or incorporated into his or her complaint,the section procedure appears to be incompatible with a federal court limited powers to grant a rule b motion to dismiss.although we can not foreclose the possibility that there may be cases in which the two regimes would not conflict this is not one of them.the materials submitted by the defendants to comply with section fall outside the bounds of what a federal court may properly consider on a rule b motion,and the district court must examine those materials in order to make the findings mandated by section as a prerequisite to dismissal.because of these unique circumstances,we instruct the district court,on remand,to adjudicate the claim within the framework of summary judgment by converting the defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d.see fagin gilmartin,cir discussing a new jersey state procedural rule applicable in shareholder derivative cases and concluding that it would be better for the d istrict c ourt to consider the sufficiency of the board rejection of a shareholder demand on summary judgment,rather than on a motion to dismiss.
although halebian contended in the district court,and does so again on appeal,that he should have been afforded the opportunity to conduct additional discovery in order to rebut the board filing,under both federal rule and section,the availability of further discovery is a matter within the district court discretion.fagin,at noting that the appellate panel remanding to the district court for resolution by summary judgment d id not intrude on the district c ourt discretion as to the extent of discovery it needs to decide the issue.while we decline to decide the question,the district court may well have acted within its discretion in denying the plaintiff request for discovery,particularly in light of the defendants submission of thousands of pages detailing the backgrounds of the directors at issue,as well as the extensive efforts made by the independent counsel in preparing its review of the demand for the committee and the board.halebian i,d at.we nonetheless think that a reevaluation of any such application by the plaintiff for more discovery in light of rule case law and procedures would be advisable on remand.
in rejecting the plaintiffs discovery request,the district court wrote absent a specific allegation in the complaint as to why the board was not disinterested,nor why the demand was refused,and absent a specific argument from plaintiff as to what more discovery would yield,we decline to allow plaintiff to avail himself of a premature opening of the floodgates to discovery in an effort to cure the deficiencies in the complaint.halebian i,d at.in addition,the district court suggested that the plaintiff even though filing his complaint before the board rejection might have anticipated that he would have to make allegations about independence,and therefore could have done so in the original filing but we do not see how the plaintiff can be expected to have made specific allegation s in the complaint as to why the demand was refused when the board had not yet taken final action on the plaintiff demand at the time his complaint was filed.and the statute does not require the plaintiff to predict the content of the defendants submissions on its motion to dismiss and preemptively rebut those submissions in its complaint.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing claims two and three of the complaint.we vacate that portion of the district court judgment dismissing claim one under rule b and remand this matter to the district court for its resolution of claim one in a manner consistent with this opinion.
the nominal defendant in this action is a business trust,not a corporation.however,as the supreme judicial court explained,b ecause a business trust in practical effect is in many respects similar to a corporation,the statute regulating derivative actions applies to a shareholder bringing such a claim against a corporation or a business trust.halebian iii,at,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in our previous opinion,we expressed skepticism about the district court approach and conclusion,first noting that it is a principle of massachusetts law that when the language of the statute is clear,we must enforce it according to its own terms.halebian ii,at quoting town of milford boyd,internal quotation marks omitted in original.though we recognized that context matters,we were unconvinced that the statutory context required the district court to take the path that it did.id.at.in light of commentary in the legislative record that clearly an
