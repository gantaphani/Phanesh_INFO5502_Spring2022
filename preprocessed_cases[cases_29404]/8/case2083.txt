vincent dudley,et.dudley moved to dismiss as untimely the appeal of insurance.as is sometimes the case,the procedural background of this case in the district court somewhat complicates the simple and straightforward answer to dudley motion.our path to the simple solution also is obscured by dudley citation to our decision in hodge hodge,cir per curiam,which seems to support its position even though that result would be in direct contravention of the federal rules of appellate procedure.in the end,however,simplicity prevails,the rules are plain,and we deny dudley motion.
background 
on october,dudley filed a lawsuit in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.dudley alleged that failed to pay it pursuant to a new york state court judgment entered against insured,a bar called solid gold.in the underlying state court lawsuit,dudley sued solid gold,which defaulted,and the bar insurer,improperly disclaimed liability.as a result,dudley alleged that was liable for payment of the judgment in the amount of,plus the appropriate statutory interest calculated from august.in the complaint request for relief,plaintiff again asked the court to award plus accrued interest and costs.
answered the federal complaint and defended the lawsuit.on december,dudley moved for summary judgment.in the notice of motion for summary judgment,plaintiff asked the court to find,among other things,that was liable for payment of the underlying state court judgment and interest accrued on that judgment from august.in a written decision and order,the district court granted plaintiff motion and held that plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment because failed to comply with new york state insurance law in disclaiming liability.the district court entered judgment on august,the original judgment.did not file a notice of appeal at that time.however,fewer than business days later,on september,dudley filed a motion for summary judgment and entry of money judgment in which it asked the district court i n furtherance of its prior decision,to enter a money judgment against in the amount of the underlying judgment plus new york statutory prejudgment interest through august,of plus additional statutory prejudgment interest of for those days elapsing between august,and the date of entry of judgment.dudley motion did not cite the procedural rule under which plaintiff sought relief.although asked for additional time to respond to the motion,it failed to do so.
in a written decision dated september,the district court granted dudley motion in its entirety.it considered the motion as one filed pursuant to.a to correct a clerical mistake arising from oversight or omission.importantly,the district court held that i t was the court clear intention at the time it filed its decision and order granting plaintiffs summary judgment,that all of the relief sought by plaintiffs,including that the court find that the disclaimer letter was invalid that was liable for payment of the judgment as entered in the new york state supreme court and that was liable for interest accrued on said judgment from august,be granted.the district court directed the clerk of the court to amend the final judgment in the case to include the entry of a money judgment against.
the clerk entered the order to amend the judgment on september,the amended judgment but never entered a separate amended judgment.then filed a notice of appeal on october,from the district court august,decision and order,the original judgment,and the amended judgment.subsequently posted a supersedeas bond in the district court.on october,filed an amended notice of appeal to include the district court order awarding dudley in costs.
by a notice of motion filed on december,dudley moved in this court to dismiss appeal as untimely because defendant filed its notice of appeal in district court more than days after entry of the district court original judgment.opposed the motion,which we considered on submission.
discussion 
dudley contends that we lack jurisdiction to hear appeal because filed its notice of appeal more than days after the entry of the original judgment and d efendant time for filing a notice of appeal was not extended pursuant to fed.a,nor otherwise.specifically,dudley argues that because the amended judgment made no substantive changes to nor resolved any genuine ambiguities in the original judgment,it was a clerical correction with no tolling effect on the time for filing a notice of appeal.dudley relies on our decision in hodge hodge,cir.
responds that the district court erred in characterizing the amended judgment as having made a clerical correction under rule a because it contained substantive changes requiring factual determinations and affecting the parties rights in its award of a money judgment and prejudgment interest.claims that the district court should have treated dudley motion under.e,which concerns motions to alter or amend judgments.notes,however,that regardless of whether dudley motion was under rule e or rule a,fed.a a iv or vi extended time to file a notice of appeal.
we conclude that the plain language of the federal rules of appellate procedure compels us to find that notice of appeal was timely.in general,a party must file its notice of appeal within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.however,some motions have the effect of tolling this period.under fed.a a,i f a party timely files in the district court any of the following motions under the federal rules of civil procedure,the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.the rule then lists six kinds of motions.relevant to this appeal is subsection iv,which concerns a motion to alter or amend the judgment under rule,and subsection vi,which concerns a motion for relief under rule if the motion is filed no later than days after the judgment is entered.subsection vi calculates the period pursuant to.a,which excludes weekends and legal holidays for counting periods of fewer than days.
there is no dispute that dudley filed its motion within business days of the entry of the original judgment.dudley did not indicate under what rule of civil procedure it moved,but the district court construed it as a rule a motion.because dudley made this rule a motion within business days of the entry of the original judgment,subsection vi applied to toll the time for filing a notice of appeal until the district court disposed of dudley motion,which occurred with the entry of the amended judgment on september.thus,had days from september in which to file a notice of appeal,and its october,notice of appeal was timely.
we hold that the district court correctly construed dudley motion as one made pursuant to rule a.the amended judgment did not affect substantive rights.it merely corrected a judicial oversight,namely the district court failure to include the monetary award in the original judgment.dudley federal complaint was based exclusively on an insurance contract and sought only damages in a liquidated amount of the new york state court prejudgment interest,to which plaintiff was entitled as a matter of right pursuant to.calculation of prejudgment interest was purely mechanical because new york law set the interest rate and the time period.b.moreover,dudley pleadings and summary judgment motion papers consistently requested that monetary relief.therefore,when the district court granted dudley summary judgment,it necessarily held that dudley was entitled to damages in the amount of plus prejudgment interest at the statutory rate.the district court made this previously held intention explicit in its order granting dudley motion 
thus,this is not a case like paddington partners bouchard,cir,where we held that the district court could not use rule a to award prejudgment interest when there was no prior argument regarding a party right to the interest and the district court was unaware of any request for interest.here,we have a situation where the absence of an award of interest in a judgement fail ed to reflect the actual intention of the court,so it properly is correctable under rule a.id.citing in re frigitemp,cir.we need look no further than dudley consistent,detailed requests for prejudgment interest,the fact that he was entitled to it as a matter of law,and the district court own words that it intended to include the award in its original judgment as justification for our conclusion.see frigitemp,at noting that rule a is the proper vehicle for correcting a judgment in order to provide an award of prejudgment interest where,among other things,governing law would make the interest award automatic or the district court clearly intended to make the interest award in its prior order.
we note that it makes no practical difference in this case whether the district court construed dudley motion under rule a,as it of course did,or under rule e as seeking an alteration or amendment to a judgment,or under rule b as seeking relief from a mistaken judgment.frigitemp,at noting that while plaintiff motion for an amended judgment to add prejudgment interest was improper under rule a based on the facts,it successfully could have moved under rule e or rule b.dudley motion met the time constraints of each provision.a timely motion under any of these provisions that also meets applicable time constraints of rule resets the time to file a notice of appeal to run from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.fed.a a.the clear and plain language of the rule specifically lists motions to alter or amend the judgment under rule,id.a a iv,or motions for relief under rule,id.a a vi,as motions that reset the time within which to appeal.moreover,it makes no distinction between rule a and rule b motions.
finally,we must reconcile the plain and clear language of fed.a a vi with our statement in hodge that a motion under rule a does not start anew the time for filing a notice of appeal.hodge,at.hodge was a case about the effect of a rule a motion on the timeliness of postjudgment motions,not notices of appeal.moreover,the cases hodge cited in support of its broad statement about the effect of a rule a motion on the time for filing a notice of appeal concerned situations that did not conflict with the plain language of fed.a a vi.
in cody,town of woodbury,cir per curiam,we simply held that a district court could not issue a second,identical judgment for the purpose of restarting a party time for filing an appeal.importantly,cody involved a rule b motion filed more than days after entry of judgment,and cody explicitly acknowledged that the appellant could have taken advantage of the tolling mechanism in fed.if it had filed its motion within days.id.at.in farkas rumore,cir per curiam,we held that a second judgment that was identical in its dismissal of two counts but merely sought to restore the case number to the docket for an unrelated reason did not restart the time for filing a notice of appeal.no rule motion was involved.the general proposition that subsequent judgments do not start anew the time for filing a notice of appeal does not override the specific language of fed.a a vi,which only concerns rule motions filed within days of an original judgment.thus,the language in hodge that dudley quoted to support its position lacks force on the facts before us,and that case does not purport to overrule the federal rules of appellate procedure.
conclusion 
for the forgoing reasons,we deny dudley motion to dismiss as untimely the appeal of insurance.
the majority today undertakes to decide an important issue of appellate procedure which,in my opinion,is neither appropriate nor necessary to decide.having undertaken that task,moreover,they have,in my view,decided the question incorrectly.therefore,although i agree that the instant appeal is timely and that the majority has correctly denied the motion to dismiss,i concur only in the judgment.
the important issue improvidently decided today by the majority is that a motion under.a serves to toll the time for filing a notice of appeal under fed.a.not only is the language of rule far from plain in dictating this result,but the history of the rule and the logical consequences of the majority reading dictate precisely the opposite result.
the reason that the majority step is neither appropriate nor necessary is that the original order entered on august,the august order which stated only that failure to comply with the provisions of new york state insurance law section d constitutes waiver of the liquor liability exclusion and plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment neither constituted a final judgment for purposes of appellate jurisdiction nor satisfied the rule of.indeed,it is questionable whether rule has yet been satisfied.it is thus inappropriate to decide whether the time for filing the notice of appeal was tolled by the request for the money judgment because that time did not begin to run,if at all,until the entry of the court order on september the september order,which directed the clerk to amend the final judgment in this case to include the entry of money judgment against defendant insurance company in the amount of.moreover,even if these requirements for beginning the appeals clock had been satisfied in august,the district court september order can not possibly be considered a mere clerical adjustment to its august one because the district court had not rendered a judgment with respect to prejudgment interest in august.thus,whatever the plaintiffs motion for entry of money judgment may have been,it is clear that it was not a motion under rule a.it is therefore unnecessary to decide whether such a motion is a rule tolling motion.
time to file a notice of appeal 
fed.a specifies that the or time period for filing a civil appeal runs from the time the judgment or order appealed from is entered.in the interest of simplicity,i will refer only to judgments rather than any other type of appealable decision,as only the former are at issue in this case.entry of judgment entails two separate acts,one judicial and one ministerial.first,the court must render a final,appealable judgment.second,that judgment must be set out in a separate document and entered on the court docket.neither of these conditions had been satisfied in august of,and therefore the time for filing a notice of appeal had not yet begun to run when the plaintiffs filed their september motion for a money judgment.
the first the court render a final a necessary predicate for invoking our jurisdiction under.where,as here,a plaintiff seeks relief other than purely declaratory,a decision as to the defendant liability that makes no award of relief monetary,injunctive,attorney fees,is not appealable under.see liberty mut.ins.wetzel,d see also cooper salomon,cir where only liability has been determined with no assessment of damages,decision is not final for purposes of eeoc joint apprenticeship,cir order not final under where it addressed only the issue of liability and did not fully adjudicate the claims in the case.see also franklin district of columbia,in damage and injunction actions,a final judgment in a plaintiff favor declares not only liability but also the consequences of,if anything,the defendants must do as a result.the determination of whether a final judgment has been rendered is made by examining the record of the case both for the necessary elements of such a judgment,an award of relief and for the court intent that its ruling represent the final disposition of the case.see bankers trust mallis,d decision is final where the district court clearly evidenced its intent that the opinion and order from which an appeal was taken would represent the final decision in the case united states schaefer brewing,d while an opinion may embody a final decision,the question whether it does so depends upon whether the judge has or has not clearly declared his intention in this respect in his opinion.therefore,when,as here,the action is for money only it is necessary to determine whether the language of the opinion embodies the essential elements of a judgment for money and clearly evidences the judge intention that it shall be his final act in the case.
no such evidence of a final decision is present in the record in this case.there is nothing in the district court summary judgment order which states that it is awarding money damages,and no mention of the amount beyond a reference in the factual recitation to the judgment.nor even assuming the foregoing would suffice is there anything in the record which indicates,as of the august order,that the court had expressed its intention that granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs would necessarily mean an award of money damages or any particular amount.moreover,it is clear that the who are moving to dismiss this appeal did not think the court had rendered a final judgment counsel for plaintiffs submitted an affidavit in support of their motion for a money judgment which stated that the original summary judgment motion had sought a declaration with regard to the applicability of a policy of insurance and that the relief requested herein simply awards a money judgment consistent with the declaratory relief previously awarded,and results in a full and final decision which defendant may appeal,should it wish to do so.
the fact that the district court,in its subsequent award of a money judgment,stated that i t was the court clear intention at the time it filed its decision and order granting plaintiffs summary judgment,that all of the relief sought by plaintiffs,including declaratory relief,money damages,and prejudgment interest be granted,does not change this conclusion.while it is certainly true that we accord great deference to a district court interpretation of its own orders,see truskoski espn,cir,that deference does not permit the district court,post hoc,to add provisions to an order that simply were not there originally.see county of suffolk alcorn,cir.
nor do i understand the district court to be interpreting its prior order the more plausible reading of the language from the september order is that the court intended to award money damages in its august order but,by implication,did not.rendition of judgment,however,is not accomplished merely by the district judge unstated intentions.a court renders judgment by pronouncing that intention or otherwise making it evident in the record.see bankers trust,at.finding a final decision where the district court clearly evidenced its intent the washington,cir rendition of judgment means the annunciation or declaring of the decision of the court.whatever the district court intended with respect to money damages,it not only failed to make that intent clear,it gave no indication of that intent whatsoever.accordingly,as the plaintiffs recognized at the time,the august order was not a final,appealable judgment.
even if it were,the second requirement for beginning the time to file a notice of appeal was not satisfied.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that e very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document and that a judgment is effective only when so set forth the purpose of the rule,first enacted in,is to clarify when the time for appeal begins to run,bankers trust,at,and to eliminate the considerable uncertainty over what actions of the district court would constitute an entry of judgment,and occasional grief to litigants as a result of this uncertainty,united states indrelunas,d.we have consistently held that the time for appeal does not start running until this separate document is entered.selletti carey,cir quoting cooper town of east hampton,cir.
by its terms,the rule requires that the judgment be laid out in a document that is separate from any judicial memorandum or opinion.cooper,at quoting axel johnson,arthur andersen,cir.in addition,the rule in this circuit is that this document must be labeled a judgment.id.unquestionably,the august judgment filed in the district court satisfied both of these requirements.
just as unquestionably,however,not every piece of paper labeled a judgment satisfies rule.although this circuit has not specifically addressed the question,the generally accepted view as to the minimum requirement for a judgment is that i t must be a document,saying who has won and what relief has been awarded,but omitting the reasons for this disposition,which should appear in the court opinion.otis city of chicago,cir see also am.interinsurance exch.occidental fire cas.of,cir under.the judgment must be and complete.it must describe the relief to which the prevailing party is entitled and not simply record that a motion has been granted.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure ed.on the better view,the separate judgment required by the amendment should be and should not merely incorporate other documents by reference.
consistent with this view,i believe the rule requires that one be able to discern the elements of a final,appealable judgment from the face of the separate document labeled judgment,without reference to any court papers or pleadings.as indicated earlier,to satisfy this requirement,a judgment therefore must indicate the disposition of the plaintiff claims for relief including,in the appropriate case,a statement that the plaintiff shall take nothing.kidd district of columbia,rule satisfied by a single document that disposes of all remaining claims.applying that standard in the instant case,it is indisputable that the august judgment said nothing whatsoever about the plaintiffs claim for money damages,or any type of relief for that matter except perhaps declaratory.in my view,therefore,the rule was not satisfied,and the time for filing a notice of appeal had not begun to run.
in fact,there is an open question as to whether this requirement has ever been satisfied in this case.the district court,in response to the plaintiffs motion for a money judgment,issued an order explaining in some detail its previous order and its decision with respect to prejudgment interest.the order concluded by directing the clerk to amend the judgment to reflect the total amount due the plaintiffs from the defendant.however,there has yet to be any separate document entered on the court docket which indicates this relief.it is my view,therefore,that the time for filing a notice of appeal may still not have begun to run.because it is clear from the record,however,that as of the september order the requirements for a final,appealable order had been met,and because the parties are free to waive the requirement,see bankers trust,at.we are not deprived of jurisdiction to hear this case.see selletti,at.
ii.the scope of rule a 
the majority appears to assume that,because the august order granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment indicates that the plaintiffs were seeking money damages in the amount of the underlying judgment,it is reasonable to infer from the district court grant of summary judgment that this necessarily entailed a grant of money damages in that amount.as stated above,i disagree with that conclusion.however,even were i to accept that assumption,along with the further assumption that i am incorrect about the rule requiring a judgment which indicates the relief to be awarded without reference to any other document,the majority still errs by suggesting that the plaintiffs motion for a money judgment was a motion for a clerical correction under.a.that is because the august order granting summary judgment not only made no award of prejudgment interest,it did not even contain the information necessary to make the determination of how much if any prejudgment interest should be awarded 
a motion to correct a clerical error under rule a must seek to conform the written judgment to the judgment actually rendered by the court it can not seek to alter the substantive rights of the parties.see paddington partners bouchard,cir an error in a judgment that accurately reflects the decision of the court or jury as rendered is not clerical within the terms of rule a.bernstein lefrak in re frigitemp,cir correction under rule a available where the judgment simply has not accurately reflected the way in which the rights and obligations of the parties have in fact been adjudicated.a rule a motion is directed to errors or omissions in the essentially ministerial act of transcribing the court rendered judgment into writing it can not serve to correct errors or omissions in the judicial act of rendering that judgment.
an award of prejudgment interest can not be in any sense a ministerial act the award must be rendered by the court.this is so because it entails a decision on several factual and legal questions.first among these is the question of what law governs.the answer to this question certainly can not be gleaned from the record in this case as of the august order.it is found neither in that order which refers only to the plaintiffs claim for accrued interest nor in the complaint which refers only to the appropriate statutory interest.in this case,the district court ultimately in its september order decided that new york law clearly new york law does not govern prejudgment interest in every case.in other words,this determination required the court to decide a legal question,and there is absolutely no indication in the record prior to its september order what the answer to that question would be.
likewise,the decision that prejudgment interest should be awarded under new york on the ground that the damages awarded represented a sum awarded because of a breach of performance of a contract,cplr a was a legal decision not apparent in the record in this case nor is there any indication in the record of what interest rate would apply before the september order.
finally,and most importantly,the district court was required to determine the date from which interest would accrue,and on this point the record prior to the september order could have yielded several answers.the complaint asks for interest from august,which was the date up to which interest on the underlying tort judgment had been awarded by the state court.as the district court august order indicated,however,the actual judgment was not entered until august.moreover,the defendant insurer was not served with notice of the judgment until september,and further as acknowledged by the district court,the plaintiffs cause of action under ins.a did not give the plaintiffs a right to proceed against the insurer until the expiration of thirty days from the serving of notice of entry of judgment upon the attorney for the insured,or upon the insured,october.given cplr b direction that i nterest shall be computed from the earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed,which of these four dates qualifies even in the september order,it is unclear what the district court decided it first stated that it had intended its august order to award interest from august,then proceeded to calculate it from august.
i assume that the majority would grant that,if the district court had issued a final judgment in august awarding prejudgment interest from october,and then the plaintiffs filed a motion asking that the interest be awarded from august,that motion would not be a clerical correction under rule a.clearly such a motion would be seeking to change the substantive rights of the parties.can it be that the fact that the august order gave no indication of the date from which interest would be calculated somehow transforms that hypothetical motion into one that does not alter those substantive rights such a contention would be untenable.
the point here is not to question the merits of the district court decisions regarding prejudgment interest,but rather to point out that they were decisions the amount of prejudgment interest depended upon those decisions and these decisions were not remotely evident on the record as it existed prior to september.that these decisions may have been relatively easy although,as indicated,that is by no means clear,or even uncontested,does not mean that they were ministerial or that they had been made as of the august order.
the majority distinguishing of our decision in paddington partners is not convincing.we held in that case that,even though the had included a claim for prejudgment interest in his,the failure of the district court to award prejudgment interest in its award of damages on summary judgment was not a clerical error correctable under rule a,because the lack of the award was an accurate reflection of the district court intentions at the time the summary judgment motions were decided.paddington partners,at.we there noted the absence of any argument on summary judgment for prejudgment interest,an indication that supported the conclusion that the district court simply had overlooked the issue.although i do not believe that this was crucial to our holding in paddington that,even if prejudgment interest had been argued for in that case,such argument could not have overcome the district court failure to pronounce anything on that issue in the fact is that there was likewise in the instant case no mention of prejudgment interest in the summary judgment arguments.
the majority distinguishes paddington partners with the rather conclusory statement that h ere,we have a situation where the absence of an award of interest in a judgment failed to reflect the actual intention of the court ante,at.the majority bases this conclusion,first,on the alleged presence of dudley consistent,detailed requests for prejudgment interest.id.other than the complaint request for interest at the appropriate statutory rate,however,i see no other such requests,and certainly none that were detailed in the sense that they indicated an interest rate or a date from which the interest would run.at least,there is no such date mentioned in the plaintiffs papers which is consistent with the date from which the district court finally determined interest should run.with respect to the majority reliance upon the district court own words that it intended to include the award in its original judgment,i find the district court interpretation of its august order no more convincing on this point than i do on the issue of money damages.
regardless of the merits of the foregoing arguments,however,paddington partners is clear,and indistinguishable,on the failure of the district court to specify in its august order the date from which prejudgment interest would run.in paddington,the district court likewise failed to specify this crucial date,and we likewise noted there that the date was far from clear,because it was uncertain when the underlying cause of action had accrued.at.we ultimately concluded that the absence of an award of interest in the original judgments was not a clerical error within the terms of rule a,because it could not be corrected without a finding of fact regarding the dates from which such interest should run.id.at.this statement is fully applicable to the district court august order here.consequently,the plaintiffs motion for a money judgment,at least insofar as it sought an award of prejudgment interest,sought to alter the substantive rights of the parties as they existed as of the august order and therefore could not have been a motion under rule a.
iii.a and fed.a 
although,as already explained,i would not have reached the question of the tolling effect of a rule a motion,the majority today decides otherwise,holding that such a motion,if filed within ten days of entry of judgment,serves to postpone the start of the or time period for filing a notice of appeal until after the district court has disposed of the motion.this holding is neither compelled by indeed,runs contrary to the better reading of the language of the rules nor consistent with the case law which the amendments to appellate rule sought to codify.moreover,this holding is unwise as a policy matter and has,i fear,great potential for mischief and abuse.
before turning to the analysis of the language and history of rule,however,i pause briefly to address the effect of our statement in hodge hodge,cir,that this court has held that a motion under rule a does not start anew the time for filing a notice of appeal.id.at.i fully agree with the majority that this statement was a mischaracterization of our holdings in cody,town of woodbury,cir,and farkas rumore,cir,both of which dealt with the effect of clerical changes to judgments rather than changes made in response to a motion i further agree that this statement was dictum and does not control the result her
