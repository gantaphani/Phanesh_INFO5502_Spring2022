petitioner krupski sought compensation for injuries she suffered on a cruise ship.her passenger ticket,which was issued by costa cruise lines,identified respondent costa crociere as the carrier required an injured party to submit to the carrier or its agent written notice of a claim required any lawsuit to be filed within one year of the injury and designated a specific federal district court as the exclusive forum for lawsuits such as krupski.the front of the ticket listed costa cruise florida address and made references to costa cruises.after krupski attorney notified costa cruise of her claims but did not reach a settlement,krupski filed a diversity negligence action against costa cruise.over the next several months after the limitations period had expired costa cruise brought costa crociere existence to krupski attention three times,including in its motion for summary judgment,in which it stated that costa crociere was the proper defendant.krupski responded and moved to amend her complaint to add costa crociere as a defendant.the district court denied costa cruise summary judgment motion without prejudice and granted krupski leave to amend.after she served costa crociere with an amended complaint,the court dismissed costa cruise from the case.thereafter,costa crociere represented by the same counsel as costa cruise moved to dismiss,contending that the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure c,which governs when an amended pleading relates back to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus timely even though it was filed outside an applicable limitations period.the rule requires,inter alia,that within the rule m period for service after a complaint is filed,the newly named defendant knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.rule c c ii.the district court found this condition fatal to krupski attempt to relate back.it concluded that she had not made a mistake about the proper party identity because,although costa cruise had disclosed costa crociere role in several court filings,she nonetheless delayed for months filing an amended complaint.the eleventh circuit affirmed,finding that krupski either knew or should have known of costa crociere identity as a potential party because she furnished the ticket identifying it to her counsel well before the limitations period ended.it was therefore appropriate to treat her as having chosen to sue one potential party over another.additionally,the court held that relation back was not appropriate because of krupski undue delay in seeking to amend the complaint.
held relation back under rule c c depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known,not on the amending party knowledge or timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.
a the rule text does not support the eleventh circuit decision to rely on the plaintiff knowledge in denying relation back.the question under rule c c ii is not whether krupski knew or should have known costa crociere identity as the proper defendant,but whether costa crociere knew or should have known during the rule m period that it would have been named as the defendant but for an error.the plaintiff information is relevant only if it bears on the defendant understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party identity.it would be error to conflate knowledge of a party existence with the absence of mistake.that a plaintiff knows of a party existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to that party identity.making a deliberate choice to sue one party over another while understanding the factual and legal differences between the two parties may be the antithesis of making a mistake,but that does not mean that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one,the proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plaintiff made no mistake.a plaintiff might know that the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless choose to sue a different defendant based on a misunderstanding about the proper party identity.that kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not foreclose a finding that rule c c ii has been satisfied.this reading is consistent with relation back purpose of balancing the defendant interests protected by the statute of limitations with the preference of the federal rules of civil procedure in general,and rule in particular,for resolving disputes on their merits.it is also consistent with the history of rule c c.and it is not foreclosed by nelson adams usa.
b the eleventh circuit also erred in ruling that krupski undue delay in seeking to file,and in eventually filing,an amended complaint justified its denial of relation back under rule c c.the rule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation back,and the plaintiff diligence is not among them.moreover,it mandates relation back once its requirements are satisfied it does not leave that decision to the district court equitable discretion.its mandatory nature is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry under rule a,which gives a district court discretion to decide whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading before trial.see foman davis.rule c c permits a court to examine a plaintiff conduct during the rule m period,but only to the extent the plaintiff postfiling conduct informs the prospective defendant understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a mistake concerning the proper party identity.the plaintiff postfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the question.
c under these principles,the courts below erred in denying relation back.because the original complaint of which costa crociere had constructive notice made clear that krupski meant to sue the company that owned,operated,managed,supervised and controlled the ship on which she was injured and also indicated mistakenly that costa cruise performed those roles,costa crociere should have known that it avoided suit within the limitations period only because of krupski misunderstanding about which costa entity was in charge of the ship clearly a mistake concerning the proper party identity.that krupski may have known the ticket contents does not foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the two companies identities.especially because the face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,respondent contention that it was entitled to think she made no mistake is not persuasive.moreover,respondent has articulated no strategy that it could reasonably have thought krupski was pursuing in suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief.nothing in krupski conduct during the rule m period suggests that she failed to name costa crociere because of anything other than a mistake.the interrelationship between costa cruise and costa crociere and their similar names heighten the expectation that costa crociere should suspect a mistake when costa cruise is named in a complaint actually describing costa crociere activities.in addition,costa crociere own actions contributed to passenger confusion over the proper party the front of the ticket advertises that costa cruises has achieved a certification of quality without clarifying which costa company is meant.and as shown in similar lawsuits,costa crociere is evidently well aware that the difference between it and costa cruise can be confusing for passengers.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure governs when an amended pleading relates back to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus itself timely even though it was filed outside an applicable statute of limitations.where an amended pleading changes a party or a party name,the rule requires,among other things,that the party to be brought in by amendment knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.rule c c.in this case,the court of appeals held that rule c was not satisfied because the plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper defendant before filing her original complaint.the court also held that relation back was not appropriate because the plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend.we hold that relation back under rule c c depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known,not on the amending party knowledge or its timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.
on february,petitioner,wanda krupski,tripped over a cable and fractured her femur while she was on board the cruise ship costa magica.upon her return home,she acquired counsel and began the process of seeking compensation for her injuries.krupski passenger ticket which explained that it was the sole contract between each passenger and the carrier,app.to pet.for cert.included a variety of requirements for obtaining damages for an injury suffered on board one of the carrier ships.the ticket identified the carrier as 
costa crociere,an italian corporation,and all vessels and other ships owned,chartered,operated,marketed or provided by costa crociere,and all officers,staff members,crew members,independent contractors,medical providers,concessionaires,pilots,suppliers,agents and assigns onboard said vessels,and the manufacturers of said vessels and all their component parts.at.
the ticket required an injured party to submit written notice of the claim with full particulars to the carrier or its duly authorized agent within days after the date of injury.at.the ticket further required any lawsuit to be filed within one year after the date of injury and to be served upon the carrier within days after filing.ibid.for cases arising from voyages departing from or returning to a united states port in which the amount in controversy exceeded,the ticket designated the united states district court for the southern district of florida in broward county,florida,as the exclusive forum for a lawsuit,at.the ticket extended the defenses,limitations and exceptions that may be invoked by the carrier to all persons who may act on behalf of the carrier or on whose behalf the carrier may act,including the carrier parents,subsidiaries,affiliates,successors,assigns,representatives,agents,employees,servants,concessionaires and contractors as well as costa cruise lines,identified as the sales and marketing agent for the carrier and the issuer of this passage ticket contract.at.the front of the ticket listed costa cruise lines address in florida and stated that an entity called costa cruises was the first cruise company in the world to obtain a certain certification of quality,at.
on july,krupski counsel notified costa cruise lines of krupski claims.app.on july,the claims administrator for costa cruise requested additional information from krupski i n order to facilitate our future attempts to achieve a settlement.app.to pet.for cert.the parties were unable to reach a settlement,however,and on february,three weeks before the limitations period expired krupski filed a negligence action against costa cruise,invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the federal district court for the southern district of florida.the complaint alleged that costa cruise owned,operated,managed,supervised and controlled the ship on which krupski had injured herself that costa cruise had extended to its passengers an invitation to enter onto the ship and that costa cruise owed krupski a duty of care,which it breached by failing to take steps that would have prevented her accident.app.the complaint further stated that venue was proper under the passenger ticket forum selection clause and averred that,by the july notice of her claims,krupski had complied with the ticket presuit requirements,at.krupski served costa cruise on february.
over the next several months after the limitations period had expired costa cruise brought costa crociere existence to krupski attention three times.first,on february,costa cruise filed its answer,asserting that it was not the proper defendant,as it was merely the north american sales and marketing agent for costa crociere,which was the actual carrier and vessel operator,at.second,on march,costa cruise listed costa crociere as an interested party in its corporate disclosure statement.app.to pet.for cert.finally,on may,costa cruise moved for summary judgment,again stating that costa crociere was the proper defendant.app.
on june,krupski responded to costa cruise motion for summary judgment,arguing for limited discovery to determine whether costa cruise should be dismissed.according to krupski,the following sources of information led her to believe costa cruise was the responsible party the travel documents prominently identified costa cruise and gave its florida address costa cruise web site listed costa cruise in florida as the united states office for the italian company costa crociere and the web site of the florida department of state listed costa cruise as the only costa company registered to do business in that state,at.krupski also observed that costa cruise claims administrator had responded to her claims notification without indicating that costa cruise was not a responsible party,at.with her response,krupski simultaneously moved to amend her complaint to add costa crociere as a defendant,at.
on july,after oral argument,the district court denied costa cruise motion for summary judgment without prejudice and granted krupski leave to amend,ordering that krupski effect proper service on costa crociere by september,at.complying with the court deadline,krupski filed an amended complaint on july,and served costa crociere on august,at.on that same date,the district court issued an order dismissing costa cruise from the case pursuant to the parties joint stipulation,krupski apparently having concluded that costa cruise was correct that it bore no responsibility for her injuries,at.
shortly thereafter,costa crociere represented by the same counsel who had represented costa cruise,compare,at,with,at moved to dismiss,contending that the amended complaint did not relate back under rule c and was therefore untimely.the district court agreed.app.to pet.for cert.rule c,the court explained,imposes three requirements before an amended complaint against a newly named defendant can relate back to the original complaint.first,the claim against the newly named defendant must have arisen out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set out or attempted to be set out in the original pleading.fed.rules civ.proc.c b,c.second,within the period provided by rule m for serving the summons and complaint which is ordinarily days from when the complaint is filed,see rule m,the newly named defendant must have received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.rule c c i.finally,the plaintiff must show that,within the rule m period,the newly named defendant knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.rule c c ii.
the first two conditions posed no problem,the court explained the claim against costa crociere clearly involved the same occurrence as the original claim against costa cruise,and costa crociere had constructive notice of the action and had not shown that any unfair prejudice would result from relation back.app.to pet.for cert.but the court found the third condition fatal to krupski attempt to relate back,concluding that krupski had not made a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party,at.relying on eleventh circuit precedent,the court explained that the word mistake should not be construed to encompass a deliberate decision not to sue a party whose identity the plaintiff knew before the statute of limitations had run.because costa cruise informed krupski that costa crociere was the proper defendant in its answer,corporate disclosure statement,and motion for summary judgment,and yet krupski delayed for months in moving to amend and then in filing an amended complaint,the court concluded that krupski knew of the proper defendant and made no mistake.
the eleventh circuit affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion.krupski costa cruise lines,llc,fed.appx.rather than relying on the information contained in costa cruise filings,all of which were made after the statute of limitations had expired,as evidence that krupski did not make a mistake,the court of appeals noted that the relevant information was located within krupski passenger ticket,which she had furnished to her counsel well before the end of the limitations period.because the ticket clearly identified costa crociere as the carrier,the court stated,krupski either knew or should have known of costa crociere identity as a potential party it was therefore appropriate to treat krupski as having chosen to sue one potential party over another.alternatively,even assuming that she first learned of costa crociere identity as the correct party from costa cruise answer,the court of appeals observed that krupski waited days from the time she filed her original complaint to seek leave to amend and did not file an amended complaint for another month after that.in light of this delay,the court of appeals concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relation back.
we granted certiorari to resolve tension among the circuits over the breadth of rule c c ii,and we now reverse.
under the federal rules of civil procedure,an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when 
a the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back b the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set out or attempted to be set out in the original pleading or c the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted,if rule c b is satisfied and if,within the period provided by rule m for serving the summons and complaint,the party to be brought in by amendment i received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits and ii knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.rule c.
in our view,neither of the court of appeals reasons for denying relation back under rule c c ii finds support in the text of the rule.we consider each reason in turn.
the court of appeals first decided that krupski either knew or should have known of the proper party identity and thus determined that she had made a deliberate choice instead of a mistake in not naming costa crociere as a party in her original pleading.fed,at.by focusing on krupski knowledge,the court of appeals chose the wrong starting point.the question under rule c c ii is not whether krupski knew or should have known the identity of costa crociere as the proper defendant,but whether costa crociere knew or should have known that it would have been named as a defendant but for an error.rule c c ii asks what the prospective defendant knew or should have known during the rule m period,not what the plaintiff knew or should have known at the time of filing her original complaint 
information in the plaintiff possession is relevant only if it bears on the defendant understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party identity.for purposes of that inquiry,it would be error to conflate knowledge of a party existence with the absence of mistake.a mistake is a n error,misconception,or misunderstanding an erroneous belief.black law dictionary ed.see also webster third new international dictionary defining mistake as a misunderstanding of the meaning or implication of something a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment,inadequate knowledge,or inattention an erroneous belief or a state of mind not in accordance with the facts that a plaintiff knows of a party existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to that party identity.a plaintiff may know that a prospective defendant call him party a exists,while erroneously believing him to have the status of party similarly,a plaintiff may know generally what party a does while misunderstanding the roles that party a and party b played in the conduct,transaction,or occurrence giving rise to her claim.if the plaintiff sues party b instead of party a under these circumstances,she has made a mistake concerning the proper party identity notwithstanding her knowledge of the existence of both parties.the only question under rule c c ii,then,is whether party a knew or should have known that,absent some mistake,the action would have been brought against him.
respondent urges that the key issue under rule c c ii is whether the plaintiff made a deliberate choice to sue one party over another.brief for respondent.we agree that making a deliberate choice to sue one party instead of another while fully understanding the factual and legal differences between the two parties is the antithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper party identity.we disagree,however,with respondent position that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one,the proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plaintiff made no mistake.the reasonableness of the mistake is not itself at issue.as noted,a plaintiff might know that the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless harbor a misunderstanding about his status or role in the events giving rise to the claim at issue,and she may mistakenly choose to sue a different defendant based on that misimpression.that kind of deliberate but mistaken choice does not foreclose a finding that rule c c ii has been satisfied.
this reading is consistent with the purpose of relation back to balance the interests of the defendant protected by the statute of limitations with the preference expressed in the federal rules of civil procedure in general,and rule in particular,for resolving disputes on their merits.see,advisory committee notes moore federal practice,a ed.a prospective defendant who legitimately believed that the limitations period had passed without any attempt to sue him has a strong interest in repose.but repose would be a windfall for a prospective defendant who understood,or who should have understood,that he escaped suit during the limitations period only because the plaintiff misunderstood a crucial fact about his identity.because a plaintiff knowledge of the existence of a party does not foreclose the possibility that she has made a mistake of identity about which that party should have been aware,such knowledge does not support that party interest in repose.
our reading is also consistent with the history of rule c c.that provision was added in to respond to a recurring problem in suits against the federal government,particularly in the social security context.advisory committee notes.individuals who had filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative denial of benefits often failed to name the party identified in the statute as the proper defendant the current secretary of what was then the department of health,education,and welfare and named instead the united states the department of health,education,and welfare itself the nonexistent federal security administration or a secretary who had recently retired from office.ibid.by the time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes,the statute of limitations in many cases had expired,and the district courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the ground that the amended complaints would not relate back.rule c was therefore amplified to provide a general solution to this problem.ibid.it is conceivable that the social security litigants knew or reasonably should have known the identity of the proper defendant either because of documents in their administrative cases or
