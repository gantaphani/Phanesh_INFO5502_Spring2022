in this appeal,we are asked to decide whether,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,a district court may issue a supplemental judgment awarding a party an undisputed sum certain as part of an arbitral award,if that sum was contemplated by the arbitral award,and the district court previously confirmed the arbitral award in full but omitted mention of that sum in its confirmatory order.we hold that such an action by the district court is permissible under the limited circumstances here,and we affirm the district court order below.
