plaintiffs,representing a putative class of persons that purchased the stock of warnaco group,warnaco,appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cedarbaum,dismissing their securities fraud claim against warnaco outside accountant,deloitte touche llp deloitte,under.b.defendant warnaco has settled.plaintiffs allege that deloitte made numerous misstatements regarding warnaco financial condition and failed to correct previous misstatements that the risk of warnaco financial collapse was thereby concealed and that plaintiffs lost the value of their shares when warnaco filed for bankruptcy on june.
in a thorough and opinion,the district court concluded that 
i deloitte was not liable for warnaco quarterly statements,which it did not audit 
ii deloitte had no duty during the class period to correct statements or misstatements made by deloitte prior to the class period and 
iii plaintiffs inadequately alleged loss causation in connection with the statements that deloitte made during the class period.
for the following reasons,we reach the same conclusions as the district court.
in the months leading up to its june,bankruptcy filing,warnaco had defaulted on its credit agreements,had failed to obtain waivers from its creditors,and had seen its stock price plunge to almost zero.am.class action compl.hereinafter compl.plaintiffs represent a putative class of persons that purchased warnaco common stock between august,and june,the class period.throughout the class period,deloitte served as warnaco outside accountant,a role it had filled since november.
in reviewing a dismissal pursuant to.b,we assume plaintiffs allegations to be true.lentell merrill lynch,cir.we therefore recount the allegations of deloitte misstatements and failures to correct contained in plaintiffs complaint.
the allegations as to the form 
warnaco initial form for the year was filed on march.amended forms were filed on april,and may,collectively,the.each of these filings contained deloitte statement that it had audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of warnaco in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in our opinion,the consolidated financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of warnaco as of january.compl.
the allegation as to the is that total shareholder equity tse was stated as million instead of million.of the million overstatement,million was attributed to warnaco failure to properly account for resulting from the return of goods by retailers in the period from to.deloitte allegedly became aware of the improper accounting in february,but did not correct warnaco financial statements until march the restatement.
the remaining million net overstatement was attributed to erroneous accounting between warnaco and its subsidiary designer holdings including an understatement of accounts payable by million,which presumably was offset somehow in arriving at the million net overstatement.according to plaintiffs,these misstatements occurred when samuel batraki,deloitte senior auditor of warnaco,became employed by warnaco as a controller of designer holdings in may id.c,although it appears that the was filed before batraki joined warnaco.deloitte allegedly became aware of the errors in the designer holdings accounting sometime in fall,but did not correct warnaco financial statements until august,after warnaco was already in bankruptcy designer holdings restatement.
the allegations as to quarterly statements 
warnaco filed three quarterly statements during the class period the august,form august the november,form november and the may,form may.
the allegation as to the august is that tse was stated as million instead of million error.as in the,million of this overstatement was attributed to the errors that were later corrected in the restatement.another million was attributed to the accounting errors later corrected in the designer holdings restatement.additionally,plaintiffs estimate that million of inventory claimed by warnaco in the august was actually worthless and unsaleable.warnaco subsequently conceded a million inventory overvaluation in an amended form a the april restatement the remaining million has not been conceded by warnaco or been the subject of restatement.it is alleged that deloitte knew of the errors reflected in the april restatement by at least november,the filing of the august but before the filing of the november,discussed below.
the first allegation as to the november is that tse was stated as million instead of million error.as with the august,million was attributed to the restatement and million was attributed to worthless inventory,which included million attributed to the april restatement.the designer holdings restatement accounted for the remaining million discrepancy.
the second allegation as to the november is that the figures for warnaco debt and cash were misstated to fake compliance with warnaco debt covenants.two weeks before the november was filed,warnaco issued a press release stating that its debt was billion and its tse was million including million cash.according to plaintiffs,this ratio of over violated warnaco debt covenants.however,in the november,warnaco cash and debt figures were each reduced by million,leaving the difference unaltered,but changing the ratio to an acceptable,thus concealing warnaco with its covenants.plaintiffs allege that deloitte was aware of the correct debt and equity information in advance of warnaco november press release,and therefore knew that the information in the november was false.
the allegation as to the may is that tse was stated as million instead of million in the million error.the entire discrepancy was attributed to the accounting that was later corrected in the designer holdings restatement.
these quarterly statements unlike the were not audited by deloitte,and were not accompanied by an audit opinion.however,federal securities regulations required that deloitte review the statements,see d,and plaintiffs allege that deloitte did.
the allegations as to the form 
on april,warnaco filed its form for the year the.the stated tse as million instead of million net discrepancy attributed to the accounting corrected by the designer holdings restatement,which later conceded that the understated accounts payable and liabilities by million and overstated inventories by million.the like the contained deloitte statement that it had audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of warnaco in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in our opinion,the consolidated financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of warnaco as of december.compl.
this audit opinion also delivered a going concern warning that warnaco was not in compliance with certain covenants of its debt agreements as of december,as a result of losses in,and warnaco has a working capital deficiency as of december.these matters raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.allaire okumus,cir.plaintiffs assert two claims against deloitte i violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule,and ii breach of common law fiduciary duty.
to state a claim under b and rule,plaintiffs must allege that deloitte made misstatements or omissions of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities upon which plaintiffs relied and that plaintiffs reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.in re ibm sec,cir.on this appeal,the decisive questions are whether deloitte made an actionable misstatement and whether any such misstatement was the proximate cause of plaintiffs losses.
plaintiffs allege that each of warnaco filings discussed above was a misstatement by deloitte,either because deloitte made a false statement in connection with the filing or because deloitte was silent despite a duty to correct a false statement.deloitte argues that i the contained no statements by deloitte within the scope of b because they were unaudited and ii deloitte is not liable to plaintiffs for any alleged misstatements in the because it was filed before the class period.
the starting point for analysis is central bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d,which held that b imposes liability only on a person who makes a material misstatement or omission,and that there is therefore no liability for aiding and abetting.id.at see also shapiro cantor,cir.accordingly,to state a b claim against an issuer accountant,a plaintiff must allege a misstatement that is attributed to the accountant at the time of its dissemination,and can not rely on the accountant alleged assistance in the drafting or compilation of a filing.wright ernst young llp,cir.
the allegations concerning the easily satisfy the standard the filing contained an audit opinion,attributed to deloitte,attesting to the accuracy of the allegedly false financial information.however,a defendant is liable only for those statements made during the class period,ibm,at,and the latest was filed on may,months before the start of the class period.
to surmount this hurdle,plaintiffs invoke wright ernst young for the proposition that accountants have a duty to correct misstatements in prior financial filings,the breach of which can constitute a false or misleading statement within the meaning of b and rule.at.thus,plaintiffs argue that deloitte breached a duty to correct warnaco misstatements in the,and that this breach extended into the class period.even assuming that wright says so much,deloitte statement was made if at all when a duty to correct arose,that is,when deloitte learned that its prior statement in the form of the audit opinion was untrue.otherwise,if an accountant breach of a duty to correct were not fixed at a point in time,little would be left of the limitation that a defendant is liable only for those statements made during the class period.ibm,at see also in re the warnaco group.sec,d,recognizing that if we were to adopt plaintiffs endless breach argument,all knowing misstatements made before the class period,which remain uncorrected,would be actionable within the class period on an omission theory.
it is alleged that deloitte became aware of errors in the in february as to the errors related to the restatement and in fall as to the errors related to the designer holdings restatement.thus deloitte silence as to the restatement would have become a false or misleading statement in february since february predates the class period,it can not be said that deloitte failure to correct constituted a statement made during the class period.
deloitte alleged duty to correct the errors related to the designer holdings restatement arose in fall,which is within the class period however,we need not decide if deloitte failure to correct the in fall was a statement for purposes of b and rule because,as we explain below,plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged that these errors caused their loss.
the quarterly statements 
warnaco quarterly statements the august,the november,and the may were filed within the class period,but they did not purport to be audited by deloitte,did not contain an audit opinion by deloitte,and were not attributed to deloitte when they were disseminated.see wright,at.under central bank,deloitte is not liable for merely assisting in the drafting and filing of the quarterly statements.plaintiffs argue that deloitte regulatory obligation to review warnaco quarterly statements entails a duty to correct,and that the failure to correct amounts to a statement by deloitte that warnaco statements are correct.
absent an audit opinion,the existence of a duty to correct can not by itself translate deloitte silence regarding the into an actionable misstatement.i f an accountant does not issue a public opinion about a company,it is not responsible for the company public statements merely because the accountant may know those statements are likely untrue.shapiro,at.the accountant duty extends only to correct an earlier financial statement which the accountant had audited it self and upon which the accountant had issued its certificate.united states natelli,cir see also iit cornfeld,cir an accountant has no independent duty to see to the correction of the portions of the prospectus other than the financial statement it prepared.
plaintiffs accurately observe that a federal regulation required deloitte,as warnaco outside accountant,to conduct a review of warnaco quarterly statements.plaintiffs thereby argue that an investor understanding deloitte regulatory obligation would construe deloitte silence as its imprimatur.this argument rests on d 
prior to filing,interim financial statements included in quarterly reports on form must be reviewed by an independent public accountant using professional standards and procedures for conducting such reviews,as established by generally accepted auditing standards if,in any filing,the company states that interim financial statements have been reviewed by an independent public accountant,a report of the accountant on the review must be filed with the interim financial statements.
it is alleged that deloitte mandated review of warnaco quarterly statements associated deloitte with those statements to such a degree that they became deloitte statements,or that the review created a regulatory duty to correct,the breach of which qualifies as a statement under b.we disagree.
wright declined to adopt a substantial participation test for liability under b,instead holding that a party can incur liability only if a misstatement is attributed to it at the time of dissemination.at.in so holding,we twice cited approvingly to in re kendall square research.sec,for the proposition that an accountant review and approval of a company financial statement are insufficient to support the imposition of liability on the accountant.wright,at.
as plaintiffs contend,a requirement that an issuer accountant review interim financial statements supports an understanding among the investing public that such reviews are in fact conducted.wright declined to impose accountant liability under b notwithstanding public awareness of an accountant review of its client statements.true,d is a federal regulation promulgated by the sec.as plaintiffs admit,however,that regulation is merely a codification of prior accounting standards,which would have supported the same public understanding.
the plaintiffs in wright claimed that the market understood the company allegedly false press release as an implied assertion of accuracy by the defendant accountant.id.at.that argument failed because,notwithstanding what the public may have understood,the accountant assurances were never communicated to the public.id.public understanding that an accountant is at work behind the scenes does not create an exception to the requirement that an actionable misstatement be made by the accountant.see central bank,at.unless the public understanding is based on the accountant articulated statement,the source for that it be a regulation,an accounting practice,or something not matter.
alternatively,plaintiffs argue that d imposes on accountants an actionable duty under b to correct unaudited interim financial statements,that the regulation required deloitte to review warnaco quarterly statements that this review implies a duty to correct the statements if they are false and that a breach of the duty to correct amounts to a statement for purposes of b.we reject this argument.
the private right of action under b and rule is a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.it is inconsistent with settled methodology in b cases to extend liability beyond the scope of conduct prohibited by the statutory text.central bank,at.
when filing an interim financial report,d affords a company two options i it can affirmatively state that the filing was reviewed by its accountant in accordance with the regulation,and include a report from the accountant or ii it can omit mention of the mandated review,in which event no accountant report is required.this binary choice is consistent with the emphasis that central bank and wright place on attribution
