background 
park avenue alleged practices 
smith wollensky restaurant group,smith wollensky,is a delaware corporation with its headquarters in new york city.smith wollensky owned and managed park avenue restaurant in midtown manhattan.defendant fourth walls restaurants llc park avenue restaurant is a limited liability corporation with its headquarters in new york and owns and manages park avenue restaurant.each plaintiff was employed by park avenue at the park avenue restaurant as a front within three years of the filing of the complaint.
plaintiffs have alleged that park avenue practices concerning tips violate federal and state law.park avenue compensates servers pursuant to state and federal tip credits that permit restaurant employers to pay tipped a lower minimum wage as long as the employees earn a certain amount in tips.see m regs.tit,tip allowance for food service worker the flsa permits employers to take a tip credit up to of the minimum wage except that the credit may not exceed the value of the tips actually received by the employee.m.under new york labor law,as of january,however,employers are entitled to a tip credit of only.regs.tit,effective,tip credits.
under the flsa an employer may not avail itself of the tip credit if it requires tipped employees to share their tips with employees who do not customarily and regularly receive tips.m stating that the tip credit shall not apply with respect to any tipped employee unless such employee has been informed by the employer of the provisions of this subsection,and all tips received by such employee have been retained by the employee,except that this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the pooling of tips among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips.thus,an employer loses its entitlement to the tip credit where it requires tipped employees to share tips with employees who do not provide direct customer service or managers,myers.copper cellar,cir noting its precedent that a host or hostess qualifies as a tipped employee because his or her work entails sufficient customer interaction and table attendance duties but concluding that a salad maker was not a tipped employee because a salad maker had no direct intercourse with diners,worked entirely outside the view of restaurant patrons,and solely performed duties traditionally classified as food preparation or kitchen support work chung new silver palace,d,finding that it violates the flsa for an employer to use a tip credit while requiring tipped employees to share tips with managers.
new york law similarly prohibits employers from requiring tipped employees to share tips with employees or managers.labor law d d mckinney gratuities provides 
no employer or his agent or an officer or agent of any corporation,or any other person shall demand or accept,directly or indirectly,any part of the gratuities,received by an employee,or retain any part of a gratuity or of any charge purported to be a gratuity for an employee nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting the sharing of tips by a waiter with a busboy or similar employee.
by its plain terms,d bars employers from requiring tipped employees to share tips with employees who do not perform direct customer service,employees who are not busboy s or similar employee s and employees who are managers or agent s of the employer.see chan triple palace,chan ii,civ,dist.lexis,at,noting that plaintiffs may establish a violation of d by showing that they were required to share tips with individuals who were either employers,owners,or managers or simply not waiters,busboys,or similar employees see also ayres restaurant,d,while is not per se illegal,labor law d prohibits any employer or his agent from demand ing or accept ing,directly or indirectly,any part of the gratuities,received by an employee,or retain ing any part of a gratuity or of any charge purported to be a gratuity for an employee.an employer includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.d.internal citation omitted alternations in original tandoor,comm r of labor,no.pr industrial bd.of app,finding that defendant restaurant violated d by requiring service employees to share tips with managers and with clerical and kitchen staff who did not engage in any meaningful aspect of direct service to customers.
thus,m and d bar the same types of tipping practices,and actions that violate the tip pooling provision of m may also violate plaintiffs contend that park avenue tipping practices violate both m and d.according to the plaintiffs,park avenue required servers to share their tips with expediters,dishwashers,silver polishers,and coffee makers.plaintiffs allege that none of these employees had any direct contact with customers.these employees worked in the kitchen,which was on a floor of the restaurant to which customers did not have access.according to the plaintiffs,at the park avenue restaurant,expediters work in the kitchen relaying food orders to the cooks and making sure that food runners take the correct orders out of the kitchen dishwashers wash dishes and various other service items coffee makers prepare coffee and silver polishers polish silverware and glassware.
beginning in or around may,park avenue also required servers to share tips with a person who plaintiffs contend was a manager whose primary duties included supervising employees,interviewing job applicants,disciplining employees,running daily meetings for servers,and scheduling employees.plaintiffs claim that,because of the nature of a tip sharing policy,the inclusion of a single employee in that pool is a violation with respect to all waiters because every waiter would have shared tips with that ineligible employee.plaintiffs contend that their claims brought under the flsa and d depend on whether,given their job duties,expediters,dishwashers,silver polishers,coffee makers,and managers lawfully could be included in park avenue tip pool and tip sharing scheme.because all servers were required to share their tips with the same people,plaintiffs contend that once factual findings are made in the district court as to the duties of the positions in question,park avenue will either be liable or not liable to all servers under the flsa and section d of the new york labor law 
plaintiffs also contend that park avenue violated new york spread of hours provision.that provision required employers to pay servers an extra hour pay at the regular minimum wage for each day they work more than ten hours.regs.tit,on each day in which the spread of hours exceeds,an employee shall receive one hour pay at the basic minimum hourly wage rate before allowances,in addition to the minimum wages otherwise required in this part.
ii.prior proceedings 
on january,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court.on july,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging claims of failure to pay minimum wage and overtime in violation of the flsa claims one and two claims of failure to pay minimum wage and overtime in violation of the new york state minimum wage act,new york labor law,mckinney claims three and four illegal pay deductions and deductions from gratuities in violation of new york labor law,d,b mckinney claim five and violation of the new york labor law spread of hours requirement,regs.tit,claim six 
following joinder of issue,plaintiffs filed a november,motion seeking an order from the district court certifying the class of plaintiffs,as to their state law claims,pursuant to rule.in support of their motion for class certification,plaintiffs submitted declarations,deposition testimony,and documentary evidence that related to the entire period of time covered by the underlying action.the plaintiffs submitted the evidence to demonstrate that all purported class members were subject to the same tipping practices the expediters,dishwashers,silver polishers,and coffee makers with whom servers were required to share tips provided no direct customer service servers were required to share tips with a manager and park avenue did not provide spread of hours pay to servers.
at a hearing in the district court on january,the court certified the class and explained its reasoning from the bench.as an initial matter,the court retained supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claims,noting its concern with the prospect of plaintiffs having to refile their state claims in state court given the statute of limitations period.specifically,the court stated that it would not dismiss the state law claims unless i know that the plaintiffs can do the same thing in state court that they can do here.moreover,in allowing the state law class claims to coexist with the federal claims,the court also stated that there is an interesting policy question involved but that it was too late in this case and too close to trial to decline supplemental jurisdiction.
second,the court turned to class certification under rule.the court noted that sufficient numerosity existed in this case,as a class of is numerous enough.a.next,the court accepted plaintiffs argument that there were no individual issues that predominate over the class issues and that t he class issues are one and the same,thereby finding that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.a,b,and that the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a.
park avenue filed a petition for leave to appeal pursuant to rule f on february,seeking permission to appeal the district court order granting plaintiffs motion for class certification a panel of this court granted that petition on may,
on appeal,park avenue challenges the district court decision granting class certification.park avenue contends that the court abused its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs new york state labor law claims erred in its determination that the plaintiffs evidence sufficed to meet the standards for class certification under rule and failed to make a ruling with respect to each requirement for rule class certification.
supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law class claims 
before turning to the question of whether rule class certification was proper,we first must examine whether the district court properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs parallel state law class claims.we review a district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion.see valley disposal,central vermont solid waste mgmt,cir a district court may,in its discretion,exercise supplemental jurisdiction.
the flsa was designed to protect workers and ensure that they are not subjected to working conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general.a.new york similarly enacted minimum wage standards to remedy the practice of persons working at wages insufficient to provide adequate maintenance for themselves and their families,lab.law mckinney,and it created standards regarding tipping in order to ensure that service employees receive all monies given as gratuities to them.see samiento world yacht.victims of wage and hour violations therefore often have parallel claims under both the flsa and the new york labor law nyll.
under the flsa,a plaintiff may bring a collective action for his or her flsa claims.collective actions under the flsa are actions that allow employees to sue on behalf of themselves and other employees who are similarly situated.b.the flsa requires,however,that an employee affirmatively consent to join a collective action in order to assert a claim.id.an action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be maintained against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.
thus,an employee fearful of retaliation or of being blackballed in his or her industry may choose not to assert his or her flsa rights.damassia duane reade,indeed,it may be that in the wage claim context,the nature of a class action is a valuable feature lacking in an flsa collective action,insofar as many employees will be reluctant to participate in the action due to fears of retaliation.internal citations omitted scott aetna services,noting the evidence that potential class members failed to join the flsa class action because they feared reprisal.see generally sanft winnebago,compiling cases holding rule numerosity requirement satisfied because,where some class members are still employed by the defendant,concern regarding employer retaliation or reprisal renders individual joinder less practicable.
the nyll,on the other hand,does not have a provision for collective actions.instead,plaintiffs may pursue a traditional class action through class certification for their state law claims.a class action under the nyll allows employees to recover lost wages without the risks attendant to asserting affirmatively an flsa claim.see,damassia,at.because flsa and nyll claims usually revolve around the same set of facts,plaintiffs frequently bring both types of claims together in a single action using the procedural mechanisms available under b to pursue the flsa claims as a collective action and under rule to pursue the nyll claims as a class action under the district court supplemental jurisdiction.this is what has occurred in this case.at issue before us is whether the district court properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs nyll claims such that the plaintiffs may proceed simultaneously with both their class action and collective action in federal court.
park avenue contends that it was an abuse of the district court discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,arguing that congress intent in requiring that employees affirmatively to flsa collective actions is undermined when employees bring a lawsuit alleging both a flsa collective action and a rule class action,an class action alleging state labor law claims.park avenue asserts that the inherent conflict between the two types of actions stems from the fact that the number of employees in the class will likely be much larger than the number in the collective action.park avenue claims that the dual actions are impractical,unfair,and offensive to the structure of the flsa because those employees who do not to the flsa collective action could very well have their flsa cause of action extinguished as their flsa claims will be adjudicated by the dual state action.we disagree.
a district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is governed by section.subsection a of section provides 
a except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution 
a.for purposes of section a,claims form part of the same case or controversy if they derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.briarpatch,phoenix pictures,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the nyll and flsa actions clearly derive from such a common nucleus of operative facts since they arise out of the same compensation policies and practices of park avenue.see,treglia town of manlius,cir exercise of supplemental jurisdiction was proper where plaintiff state and federal claims arose out of approximately the same set of events.where section a is satisfied,the discretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction is available only if founded upon an enumerated category of subsection c.itar tass russian news agency russian kurier,cir emphasis supplied.in addition,we have stated that 
where at least one of the subsection c factors is applicable,a district court should not decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction unless it also determines that doing so would not promote the values articulated in united mine workers of america gibbs,economy,convenience,fairness,and comity.
jones ford motor credit,cir.
subsection c of provides 
c the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection a if 
the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law,
the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,
the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction,or 
in exceptional circumstances,there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
in providing that a district court may decline to exercise such jurisdiction,section c is permissive rather than mandatory.valencia ex rel.franco lee,cir citing marcus v.at t,cir nowak ironworkers local pension fund,cir.as the supreme court stated in discussing predecessor judicial doctrine of pendent jurisdiction,however,this is traditionally a doctrine of discretion,not of plaintiff right.kolari new york presbyterian,cir quoting united mine workers gibbs.subsection c of confirms the discretionary nature of supplemental jurisdiction by enumerating the circumstances in which district courts can refuse its exercise.id.quoting city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons.
having concluded that the nyll and flsa claims form part of the same case or controversy,our analysis proceeds to section c,where the critical inquiry becomes whether one or more of the section c factors is applicable,in which case the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction could be an abuse of discretion.
first,as to section c,plaintiffs nyll claims based on pay and purported illegal deductions from tips do not appear to raise a novel or complex issue of s tate law.rather,the spread of hours claim will likely hinge on factual findings of whether class members had workdays lasting more than ten hours and whether park avenue paid class members an extra hour pay at the new york minimum wage when their workdays lasted more than ten hours.see regs.tit.plaintiffs claim for illegal deductions from tips is also straightforward.that claim will turn on whether servers were required to share or pool tips with agents of their employer such as the plaintiffs manager with employees who were not waiters,busboys,or similar employees such as expediters,silver polishers,dishwashers,and coffee makers who allegedly provided no direct customer service.see labor law d mckinney see also regs.tit,e ligible employees must perform,or assist in performing,personal service to patrons at a level that is a principal and regular part of their duties and is not merely occasional or incidental.accordingly,we conclude that plaintiffs claims do not raise complicated or novel issues of state law for purposes of c.
section c requires that a state law claim substantially predominate over a federal claim before a district court has discretion to refuse supplemental jurisdiction.see itar tass russian news agency,at.in adjudicating the federal claims,the district court likely will determine whether the plaintiffs were under the flsa.because the flsa and the nyll use a similar standard for making such a determination,and because each set of claims arise from the same set of operative facts,a determination as to the flsa claims may decide the plaintiffs nyll claim as well.see m new york labor law d mckinney.
moreover,we agree with our sister circuits that the fact that there are more class members in the state law class action than those in the flsa collective action should not lead a court to the conclusion that a state claim substantially predominates over the flsa action,as section c uses that phrase.ervin os rest,cir.predomination under section generally goes to the type of claim,not the number of parties involved.id.quoting de asencio tyson foods,cir see also ervin,at t he disparity between the number of flsa plaintiffs and the number of plaintiffs is not enough to affect the supplemental jurisdiction analysis.in the majority of cases,it would undermine the efficiency rationale of supplemental jurisdiction if two separate forums were required to adjudicate precisely the same issues because there was a different number of plaintiffs participating in each claim.accord wang chinese daily news,cir although the number of claimants and amount of potential damages in the state law claim may have been higher p redomination under section c relates to the type of claim and here the state law claims essentially replicate the flsa claims they plainly do not predominate.emphasis and alteration in original.indeed,any addition of plaintiffs in the certified state law class action does not change the factual determinations and claims made with regard to park avenue practices.accordingly,we conclude that the plaintiffs state law claims do not substantially predominate over their federal claims,over which the district court has original jurisdiction,for purposes of c.
third,section c is not applicable here because the district court did not dismiss any claims over which it had original jurisdiction.
fourth,as to whether there is a compelling reason under section c for the district court to decline supplemental jurisdiction over the nyll claims,park avenue argues that class certification should have been denied because of an inherent conflict between collective actions under flsa and class actions under nyll.we reject this argument for several reasons.first,nothing in the language of the flsa prevents the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law wage claims.section b of the fsla provides that 
a ny employer who violates the provisions of section or section of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages,or their unpaid overtime compensation,as the case may be,and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.any employer who violates the provisions of section a of this title shall be liable for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of section a of this title,including without limitation employment,reinstatement,promotion,and the payment of wages lost and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.an action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be maintained against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.
b.this section explicitly authorizes employees,on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated,to bring,under the flsa,minimum wage,overtime,and claims.section b also provides that the flsa consent requirement applies only to wage claims brought under the substantive provisions of the flsa and does not apply to wage claims generally.damassia,at.accordingly,we do not read the plain language of b as restraining any remedies available to employees under state law or as affecting a federal court ability to obtain supplemental jurisdiction over state employment actions.see ervin,at t he procedures in the flsa do not operate to limit expressly or impliedly a district court supplemental jurisdiction to only those claims that also involve procedures.
second,the flsa savings clause makes clear that states may enact wage laws that are more protective than those that are provided in the act no provision of this chapter or of any order thereunder shall excuse noncompliance with any federal or state law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this chapter a.we have held that this clause demonstrates congress intent to allow state wage laws to with the flsa by permitting explicitly,for example,states to mandate greater overtime benefits than the flsa.see overnite transp.tianti,cir rejecting the argument that the flsa preempts state wage laws see also ervin,at same williamson dynamics,cir stating that section a indicates that the flsa is not the exclusive remedy for wage payment claims.further,interpreting the above provisions of the flsa to bar employees access to federal courts to seek remedies for alleged substandard working conditions detrimental to their health,efficiency,and general.a,would be inconsistent with the stated purpose of the flsa.
third,the legislative history surrounding the flsa provision also provides no support for precluding joint prosecution of flsa and state law wage claims in the same federal action.originally,b permitted an employee to bring a collective class action on behalf of similarly situated employees but did not expressly require unnamed plaintiffs to to the action.see fair labor standards act of,stat.then,in congress added the provision through passage of the portal to portal act the portal act.see portal act,stat.the portal act made clear that the requirement shall be applicable only with respect to actions commenced under the fsla of.id.b,stat.at.however,the portal act contains no suggestion of any intent to prevent class certification or any prohibition of the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over state wage law class claims.see regulating the recovery of portal to portal pay,and for other purposes.exempting employers from liability for portal to portal wages in certain cases.portal to portal act of,conf.we do not view congress creation of the provision for flsa collective actions as a choice against,or a rejection of,rule process for state law class actions.see ervin,at there is ample evidence that a combined action is consistent with the regime congress has established in the flsa.
finally,our sister circuits in the seventh,ninth,and district of columbia circuits all have determined that supplemental jurisdiction is appropriate over state labor law class claims in an action where the court has federal question jurisdiction over flsa claims in a collective action.see ervin,at,looking to the plain language of the flsa and concluding that there is no categorical rule against certifying a rule b class action in a proceeding that also includes a collective action brought under the flsa and if these actions were to proceed separately the flsa in federal court and the class action in state court an entirely different and potentially worse problem of confusion would arise,with uncoordinated notices from separate courts peppering the employees.wang,at concluding that it was within the district court discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law class claim because t he state claim does not pose novel questions of state law akin to those present in de asencio see also lindsay gov t employees ins,holding that the collective action provision of flsa did not expressly prohibit the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the new york minimum wage act claims of class members and,therefore,that the district court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the new york minimum wage act claims of class members.
accordingly,we agree with the seventh circuit that while there may in some cases be exceptional circumstances or compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction,the conflict between the procedure under the flsa and the procedure under rule is not a proper reason to decline jurisdiction under section c.ervin,at.
the only circuit court decision declining supplemental jurisdiction over state labor law class claims in an action where the court has federal question jurisdiction over flsa claims was the third circuit decision in de asencio tyson foods.in de asencio,employees at plants brought a representative action in the district court alleging that their employer violated minimum wage and overtime provisions of the flsa as well as the pennsylvania wage payment and collection law wpcl.see id.at.the district court granted class certification to the employees for their state labor law wpcl claims.see id.at.
on appeal,the third circuit held that although the district court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that flsa and wpcl actions arose from same controversy and shared a common nucleus of operative facts,a,the district court should not have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the wpcl claim,which presented novel and complex questions of state law and which substantially predominated over the flsa claim within the meaning of c,c.see de asencio,at generally,a district court will find substantial predomination where a state claim constitutes the real body of a case,to which the federal claim is only an appendage only where permitting litigation of all claims in the district court can accurately be described as allowing a federal tail to wag what is in substance a state dog.internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,the third circuit explained that 
certain issues of state law presented in the wpcl action also weigh heavily,tilting the balance against the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.pennsylvania courts have not addressed two novel and complex questions of state law squarely presented here whether a wpcl action may rest on an implied employment contract that relies on alleged oral representations by tyson managers and whether the wpcl pertains to at will,bargaining employees.the need to resolve these issues,which are better left to the pennsylvania state courts,weighs in favor of declining supplemental jurisdiction.c.
de asencio,at.
we conclude that de asencio is distinguishable from this case and the other circuit cases that have dealt with the dual action question in that de asencio involved a complex question of state law rendering supplemental jurisdiction inappropriate under section c.its rationale was premised on a analysis of supplemental jurisdiction rather than on a general prohibition of exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state labor law class claims in an flsa action accordingly,de asencio represents only a application of rules,not a rigid rule abo
