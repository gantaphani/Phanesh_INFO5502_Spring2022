in these appeals that were consolidated for argument,holders of unredeemed consumer gift cards issued by the former book retailer bgi,borders group,and its affiliates borders or debtors seek to vacate a may,judgment of the district court andrew carter,judge dismissing as equitably moot appellants challenges to three bankruptcy court orders.
in the three challenged orders,the bankruptcy court martin glenn,bankruptcy judge denied motions filed by appellants after borders which had earlier filed for protection under chapter obtained confirmation of its liquidation plan the plan.in those orders,the bankruptcy court found that the plan was substantially consummated,and denied the motion of appellants eric beeman and jane freij for leave to file untimely proofs of claim rejected and discharged appellant robert traktman untimely proof of claim and denied as moot the motion for class certification pursued by all three appellants,none of whom appeared in the case until after the plan was confirmed.see in re bgi,bgi i joint appendix ja.
on review,the district court accepted the bankruptcy court determination that the plan was substantially consummated and accordingly found appellants subject to a presumption that their appeals were equitably moot.concluding further that appellants had failed to overcome that presumption,the district court dismissed the appeals.see in re bgi,civ.alc,civ.alc,civ.alc,dist.lexis may,bgi ii.
we affirm the district court ruling.at the threshold,we hold that the analysis outlined in fritolay,ltv steel in re chateaugay,cir chateaugay ii which governs our circuit equitable mootness analysis in chapter reorganizations also governs our mootness analysis in chapter liquidations.we then conclude that appellants are subject to the presumption of mootness created by the liquidation plan substantial consummation,and have failed to satisfy the five chateaugay factors,as would be necessary to rebut that presumption.accordingly,we hold that the district court acted within its discretion in dismissing these appeals as equitably moot.
background 
we recite only those facts necessary to this appeal.a full recitation of the facts may be found in the bankruptcy court and district court opinions.bgi i,at bgi ii,dist.lexis,at.
each appellant holds an unused consumer gift card issued by borders,the retail bookstore chain.in february,borders and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief through reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.in april,the bankruptcy court entered an order the bar date order establishing june,the bar date,as the deadline for claims to be filed by purported creditors of borders on debts arising before borders filed its bankruptcy petition the prepetition creditors.pursuant to bankruptcy rule the bar date order required borders to notify potential prepetition creditors of the bankruptcy proceedings in several ways,including by publishing notice of the bar date in the national edition of the new york times at least days before the bar date,and by serving notice of the bar date via mail to,among others,all known creditors and other known holders of claims.no appeal was taken from the bar date order.
after filing its february petition,borders attempted to reorganize as a going concern,but those efforts were unsuccessful,and in july,the bankruptcy court authorized borders to proceed under chapter to liquidate substantially all of its assets and completely close the chain of stores on september,borders closed the last of its retail branches.one week later,it stopped accepting gift cards and conducting on its website.gift card redemptions constituted nearly one hundred percent of borders net sales in the last month of the chain operations.
with its goal changing from reorganization to liquidation,in november borders filed a chapter liquidation plan under section of the bankruptcy code,together with the required disclosure statement,which is designed to permit interested parties to evaluate the proposed plan.b.the bankruptcy court approved borders proposals for soliciting votes on the plan,disseminating the disclosure statement,and giving notice of the plan confirmation hearing the bankruptcy court also required borders to provide notice of the confirmation hearing to all other interested parties via publication in the new york times.this notice was published on november.the hearing was scheduled for december.
no appellant filed an objection to the plan before the confirmation hearing and none appeared at the hearing,which took place as scheduled,on december.on the day after the hearing,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the plan and directing that the plan be put into effect on january,the confirmation order 
two weeks after the hearing on january,appellants beeman and freij moved the bankruptcy court for authorization to file untimely proofs of claim the late claims motion,arguing that they had not received adequate notice of the bankruptcy proceedings or the bar date.then,joined by appellant traktman who had simply filed a late claim without authorization,they asked the court to certify a class of all holders of borders gift cards issued prepetition the class certification motion.appellees bgi creditors liquidating trust the trust and the liquidating trustee objected to both motions.neither beeman,freij,nor traktman moved for a stay of the plan in tandem with their efforts to file late claims and certify a class 
in august,the bankruptcy court denied the late claims and class certification motions.in its memorandum opinion,the court first considered whether,under bankruptcy rule,gift card holders were individually entitled to actual notice of the bar date.answering no,the court explained that known creditors of a chapter debtor a group that includes both claimant s whose identity is actually known to the debtor and claimant s whose identity is reasonably ascertainable must be afforded actual written notice of the bankruptcy filing and the bar date.bgi i,at internal quotation marks omitted.by contrast,unknown creditors whose identity is not reasonably ascertainable by the debtor are entitled only to constructive notice,which may be provided through notice by publication.id.determining that gift card holders were unknown creditors because their status as possible creditors was not known or reasonably ascertainable,the court held that publication of the bar date once in the new york times provided appellants all the notice to which they were entitled.id.at.
the court reasoned that because beeman and freij failed to establish any entitlement to actual notice of the bar date,their neglect in failing to file timely proofs of claim was not excusable under bankruptcy rule b id.at.its conclusion rested in part on its determination that the plan had been substantially consummated.the court noted that as of august,the trust had already made distributions of approximately million to holders of allowed administrative and priority claims,and it concluded that allowing beeman and freij to file late claims and certifying a class of gift card holders would have a disastrous effect on the remainder of the debtors estates and the final distributions of the plan.id.at.
accordingly,the court denied their motion to file untimely claims.id.at.it then denied as moot the motion for class certification.id.at.the bankruptcy court similarly disallowed and expunged traktman untimely claim.
appellants timely sought district court review of these orders.in an opinion issued in may,the district court dismissed all three appeals as equitably moot.this appeal followed.
discussion 
equitable mootness is a prudential doctrine under which a district court may in its discretion dismiss a bankruptcy appeal when,even though effective relief could conceivably be fashioned,implementation of that relief would be inequitable.in re charter commc ns,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine requires the district court to carefully balance the importance of finality in bankruptcy proceedings against the appellant right to review and relief.id.we review a district court dismissal on grounds of equitable mootness for abuse of discretion,id.at,under which we examine conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error,see highmark allcare health mgmt,d.
equitable mootness in the context of chapter liquidation proceedings 
as an initial matter,we conclude that the doctrine of equitable mootness applies to appeals arising from chapter liquidation proceedings,as well as appeals from chapter reorganization proceedings at oral argument,appellants appeared to abandon the position advanced in their briefs that the doctrine of equitable mootness does not apply in this context.because the question has not yet been decided by our court,however,we address it briefly here.
the doctrine of equitable mootness provides an analytical basis for dismissing certain appeals from bankruptcy court orders.it was developed judicially in response to the particular problems presented by the consummation of plans of reorganization under chapter,in which the need for finality,and the need for third parties to rely on that finality,is of paramount importance.tnb,james parker interests in re grimland,cir explaining that the need for the doctrine normally arises where a chapter reorganization plan is at issue.
equitable mootness is a pragmatic doctrine,one that is grounded in the notion that,with the passage of time after a judgment in equity and implementation of that judgment,effective relief on appeal becomes impractical,imprudent,and therefore inequitable.deutsche bank ag metromedia fiber network,in re metromedia fiber network,cir quoting mac panel.panel,cir.it admits of considerable flexibility,and its application depends on,and varies according to,the specific factors presented in a particular case.see mac panel,at the doctrine application does not employ rigid rules.
in our circuit,a bankruptcy appeal is presumed equitably moot when the debtor reorganization plan has been substantially consummated.in re charter commc ns,at.substantial consummation,as defined by section of the bankruptcy code,requires a transfer of all or substantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred b assumption by the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of the business or of the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the plan and,finally,c commencement of distribution under the plan.
the presumption of equitable mootness created by a plan substantial consummation can be overcome by an objector,however,if the five factors set out in our decision in fritolay,ltv steel in re chateaugay,cir chateaugay ii,are satisfied as stated there,these factors are 
the court can still order some effective relief 
such relief will not affect the of the debtor as a revitalized corporate entity 
such relief will not unravel intricate transactions so as to knock the props out from under the authorization for every transaction that has taken place and create an unmanageable,uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court 
the parties who would be adversely affected by the modification have notice of the appeal and an opportunity to participate in the proceedings and 
the appellant pursued with diligence all available remedies to obtain a stay of execution of the objectionable order,if the failure to do so creates a situation rendering it inequitable to reverse the orders appealed from.
id.at internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.an analysis of these factors requires a court to examine the actual effects of the requested relief,in re charter commc ns,at,and accounts for aspects of a given bankruptcy,see chateaugay ii,at.
we see no principled reason,in a chapter liquidation proceeding,for denying a court discretion to apply the doctrine of equitable mootness and the corresponding chateaugay analysis.in such a liquidation,affected parties may have devoted months of time and resources toward developing an acceptable plan creditors with urgent needs may have been stayed from accessing assets and funds to which they are entitled and extensive judicial resources may have been consumed.in liquidation as in reorganization,substantial interests may counsel in favor of preventing tardy disruption of a duly developed,confirmed,and substantially consummated plan.
appellants have pointed to no persuasive precedent to support the contention that equitable mootness should not apply in the context of chapter liquidation proceedings.indeed,to the contrary several of our sister circuits have applied the doctrine in the liquidation setting and did so with no more than cursory discussion district courts in our circuit have also applied the doctrine in chapter liquidations and,in several unpublished summary orders,our court has already endorsed the doctrine application in a range of contexts these cases suggest that the doctrine of equitable mootness has already been accorded broad reach,without apparent ill effect.see captain hani alsohaibi arcapita bank c in re arcapita bank.c,civ.sas,civ.sas,wl,at,explaining that the doctrine of equitable mootness has been applied in a variety of contexts footnotes omitted cadle company ii,pc liquidation in re pc liquidation,civ sjf,wl,explaining that equitable mootness is not limited to appeals of orders confirming reorganization plans and collecting cases.
accordingly,we now hold that the doctrine of equitable mootness and the corresponding chateaugay analysis apply in assessing appeals related to chapter liquidation proceedings as well as chapter reorganizations 
application 
having determined that the equitable mootness doctrine applies in the setting now before us,we have little difficulty in concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing appellants appeals as equitably moot.
here,the bankruptcy court found that,as of august,the plan had been substantially consummated.its finding rested on the observation that,as of the plan effective date,borders transferred its relevant property to the trust,and the trust began administering timely filed claims and making distributions to holders of allowed administrative and priority claims,in an amount totaling at least million.bgi i,at.we discern no clear error in this determination see collier on bankruptcy resnick sommer et,ed.determining whether a plan has been substantially consummated is a question of fact babitt vebeliunas in re vebeliunas,cir we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact only for clear error.
as noted above,if an appellant satisfies the five factors outlined in chateaugay ii,at,he may override the presumption of equitable mootness that is created by a plan substantial consummation.only if all five chateaugay factors are met,and if the appellant prevails on the merits of its legal claims,will relief be granted.in re charter commc ns,at.
here,we agree with the district court that appellants failed to satisfy at least the fourth and fifth chateaugay factors,ensuring adequate process for parties who would be adversely affected,and demonstrating their own diligence in obtaining a stay as to the fourth factor,appellants did not establish that the general unsecured creditors who could be stripped of their entire recovery if the proposed class was certified,bgi ii,dist.lexis,at received notice of their appeal to the district court.as to the fifth factor,appellants did not pursue their claims with all diligence they did not appear at the plan confirmation hearing,filed no objections to the plan,and neither appealed the confirmation order nor sought a stay of the plan effective date see id.at the fact that no stay of distributions was sought by appellants until almost a year after they entered the bankruptcy litigation and the plan was confirmed indicates the lack of diligence with which appellants moved.see also in re metromedia fiber,at relying on a failure to seek a stay of the confirmation order and a failure to seek expedited review of the order to uphold the district court finding of equitable mootness 
accordingly,we see no basis for concluding that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the appeals as equitably moot 
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that the distric
