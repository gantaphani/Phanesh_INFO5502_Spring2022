applied industrial materials corporation aimcor appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york patterson,denying its petition to confirm an arbitration award and granting appellees motion to vacate it.in the underlying arbitration,ovalar makine ticaret ve sanayi,ovalar,a turkish corporation,and ural ataman,its chairman,were found liable to aimcor for having breached a contract to deliver petroleum coke.we agree with the district court that one of the three arbitrators,whose vote was dispositive,acted with evident partiality by failing to either investigate what he knew to be a potential business relationship between his corporation and one of the parties or inform them that he had walled himself off from learning more.see a.
background 
in,aimcor and ovalar entered into a joint venture in which aimcor purchased and transported petroleum coke a chemical created during oil refinery to ovalar,which then distributed the coke in turkey.the contract provided that any disputes would be settled by arbitration in new york.
in,a dispute arose over the distribution of profits under the joint venture,and the parties resorted to arbitration.the arbitration agreement provided that each party would select an arbitrator,and the two arbitrators would then select a third,presiding arbitrator.section of the agreement provided 
prior to the first hearing or initial submissions,all the arbitrators are required to disclose any circumstance which could impair their ability to render an unbiased award based solely upon an objective and impartial consideration of the evidence presented to the panel 
no arbitrator shall accept an appointment or sit on a panel,where the arbitrator or the arbitrator current employer has a direct or indirect interest in the outcome of the arbitration.
all such disclosed relationships,experience interests must be objected to by the parties at or before the first procedural hearing,or they shall be deemed waived as creating a bias,prejudice or conflict of interest which would warrant overturning the final award in this matter.
although the agreement did not specifically address whether the arbitrators were required to make additional disclosures after commencement of the arbitration,section provided that n o person shall serve as an arbitrator who has or has had a financial or personal interest in the outcome of the arbitration or who has acquired from an interested source detailed prior knowledge of the matter in dispute.emphasis added.
ovalar and aimcor each selected one arbitrator,and the parties selected charles fabrikant as the third arbitrator and chairman of the panel.he was the chairman,president and ceo of seacor holdings,a dollar company with offices in countries.
on september,before the hearings started,the arbitrators were advised that aimcor was being sold to oxbow industries and that the transaction might be relevant to the disclosure issue.each arbitrator submitted a disclosure statement.fabrikant statement,dated september,indicated that he ha d had no personal or business relationship with any of the parties to this proceeding,or their affiliates,and would reserve the right to amend or add to this disclosure should future circumstances warrant it.
at a hearing on march,the parties agreed to bifurcate the arbitration proceedings into liability and damage phases.the liability phase commenced soon thereafter.on april,fabrikant sent an email to the parties 
gentlemen it came to my attention yesterday,or day before yesterday that my louis office,which runs our barge operation under the name scf,has recently been engaged with of palm beach.the subject of conversation is a contract for the carriage of petroleum coke.i had no knowledge of such conversations taking place prior to the past week.i do not participate in contract negotiations or get involved in day to day operations of scf.
i would like to amend my prior disclosures.at that time i did ask if there had been contacts between my group and these parties and there were none.
i do not plan to become involved in discussions between scf and,should there be further conversations between them.
i do not feel my ability to decide this case on the merits is impaired.
there were no further disclosures or reactions from the parties before the arbitration panel decision on liability five months later on september.the panel,in a decision in which fabrikant cast the deciding vote,found ovalar liable to aimcor for breach of contract.following its loss,ovalar secured new counsel.
two months later,on november,with the issue of damages still to be decided,ovalar counsel wrote to fabrikant asking him to withdraw.since the time of the liability award,ovalar had conducted an investigation and concluded that a previously existing,inadequately disclosed commercial relationship existed between scf,a division of fabrikant company,and oxbow,the parent of aimcor.ovalar claim was that since before the liability had been transporting petroleum coke for oxbow,and that this relationship generated approximately in revenue.
on december,fabrikant responded to ovalar request,stating that i see no reason to withdraw from the panel.he revealed that when he was initially informed that scf was engaged in discussions with oxbow,he told scf president that he wished to know nothing about scf conversations,or be a party to information about our activities with oxbow or be consulted concerning any business with them.having erected a chinese wall to prevent his learning of any agreements between his company and oxbow,fabrikant concluded that he was unaware of the relationship until he received the letter from ovalar.
in february,when aimcor moved to confirm the partial arbitration award,ovalar and ataman moved to vacate the award on the grounds that fabrikant failure to recuse himself violated the federal arbitration act,a.the district court agreed with ovalar and ataman.the court decision focused on several things,including the disclosure requirements in the arbitration agreement,fabrikant initial statement that,subject to later clarification,no conflict existed,and fabrikant later disclosure that talks were occurring between oxbow and scf but that he did not know about them or intend to get involved.the court found that these events gave rise to a reasonable expectation on the part of the parties that they would be notified of any contractual relationship between seacor and oxbow.the court held that by insulating himself from learning about any such relationship,and failing to tell the parties that he had done so,fabrikant created an appearance of partiality when a nontrivial commercial relationship surfaced that the april email.
citing the standards of the american arbitration code of ethics for arbitrators and the international bar association guidelines on conflicts of interest in international arbitration,the district court found that r eason dictates that there must be a continuous obligation on the part of the arbitrator to avoid partiality or the appearance of partiality.the court observed that the arbitrator failure to investigate the status of scf negotiations with oxbow and his subsequent lack of knowledge do not excuse his lack of disclosure.accordingly,the district court vacated the award.this appeal followed.
