this appeal arises from the latest in a series of lawsuits by opponents of a proposed wind power generation facility in nantucket sound.plaintiffs who include the town of barnstable,a advocacy group named alliance to protect nantucket sound,and businesses and individuals residing near the proposed sought an injunction and a declaratory judgment in federal district court against officials of the massachusetts department of public utilities dpu and the massachusetts department of energy resources doer together,the state defendants and two private parties,cape wind associates,llc and nstar electric company whose contract to buy wind power dpu approved.the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss after determining that the eleventh amendment precluded the assertion of federal court jurisdiction.for the reasons explained below,we disagree that the eleventh amendment bars the assertion of federal court jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims,and we remand for resolution of the case status and the possible need to resolve a litany of other issues concerning the viability of the complaint.
cape wind has pursued development of offshore wind power in nantucket sound since at least.see alliance to protect nantucket sound,dep t of the army,d.the company has faced a series of challenges against its attempts to acquire the necessary permits and approvals for a planned turbine,square mile facility in the sound.see town of barnstable berwick,d.
cape wind efforts at convincing electric utilities also known as electric distribution companies to purchase its wind energy received a boost in,when the massachusetts legislature enacted the green communities act the gca.acts ch.an act relative to green communities.section of the gca requires each massachusetts electric utility to solicit proposals from renewable energy developers and enter into contracts with such developers for up to three percent of the total energy demand in the utility service territory.id.at.section further provides that t he timetable and method for solicitation and execution of such contracts shall be proposed by the distribution company in consultation with doer and shall be subject to review and approval by dpu.id.
as originally enacted,section permitted massachusetts utilities to fulfill their renewable energy obligation only by entering into contracts for power generated within the jurisdictional boundaries of the commonwealth,including state waters,or in adjacent federal waters.id.in,while that geographic limitation was still in place,cape wind entered into negotiations with national grid a competitor of nstar operating in massachusetts for national grid purchase of fifty percent of the wind energy generated by cape wind proposed facility.cape wind and national grid later executed a contract,which they called a power purchase agreement ppa.according to plaintiffs complaint,t he national grid contract prices were significantly above the market price for electricity and above the price of other renewable energy generation.
in,a canadian energy generator named transcanada power marketing sued dpu,alleging that section geographic limitation unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause.dpu settled the suit by suspending the geographic and directing utilities such as nstar to reopen bidding opportunities to generators.dpu did not,however,require national grid to back out of its agreement with cape wind.dpu instead approved the cape wind national grid ppa in dpu order see dpu order,final order.
nstar,for its part,subsequently received bids from renewable energy developers and entered contracts with three wind generators,one located and two.according to the complaint,nstar contracted to buy energy with those three companies at half the initial price cape wind was charging national grid pursuant to the cape wind national grid ppa.
later in,nstar filed an application with dpu requesting that it approve nstar proposed merger with northeast utilities,a electric utility distribution company at the time,dpu applied a no net harm standard in assessing merger applications,meaning that mergers would be approved so long as the public interest would be at least as well served by approval of a proposal as by its denial.see order,interlocutory order on standard of review.cape wind and doer,among others,intervened in the dpu proceeding.doer proposed a more stringent substantial net benefit standard that would take into account the advancement of clean energy goals established by the gca and the global warming solutions act gwsa.doer also asked dpu to require nstar to purchase wind energy as a condition for approving the merger with northeast utilities.
after taking the parties and intervenors positions under advisement,dpu chose to adopt a net benefit standard for electric utility mergers,which was more demanding than the existing no net harm standard but less stringent than the substantial net benefit standard that doer requested.dpu justified the new standard in part by pointing out that this was its first opportunity to consider a merger of electric utilities since the massachusetts legislature enacted the gca,which specifically provided that dpu,in reviewing a merger transaction,must consider whether the merger will contribute to a reliable,cost effective energy delivery system.acts ch,amending.laws ch,and the gwsa,which required that all massachusetts state agencies consider reasonably foreseeable climate change impacts in issuing administrative approvals and decisions.acts ch,amending.laws ch.dpu reasoned that these legislative changes required it to put more emphasis on the benefits side of the equation than it had in the past.
doer then moved for a stay of the merger proceeding,ostensibly so that it could determine the effect the merger would have on consumers utility rates.nstar and northeast utilities contested the stay,informing dpu that the delay jeopardized the merger agreement due to the agreement internal deadlines and evolving circumstances that could affect the financial underpinnings of the transaction.the complaint alleges that the foregoing actions of doer represented an implicit threat to scuttle the merger unless nstar entered into a contract with cape wind.
of course,it was dpu,not doer,that got to decide whether and on what terms the merger would be approved.nevertheless,the theory of the complaint is that doer politically potent advocacy was enough of a threat to cause nstar to enter into secret negotiations with the massachusetts governor administration in order to win the administration support for nstar merger with northeast utilities.those negotiations culminated on february,with a settlement agreement between nstar and doer.
the settlement agreement included,among other provisions,a clause that nstar would purchase of cape wind output under a proposed power purchase agreement the ppa,and a clause stating that doer agreed that the merger is consistent with the public interest.under the settlement agreement,cape wind and nstar contract would contain terms substantially the same as the terms of the cape wind national grid ppa.performance of that contract would cause nstar renewable energy usage to rise from to of its total production portfolio,thus exceeding section statutory threshold.the proposed contract was contingent upon,among other things,cape wind timely procurement of financing and building permits,dpu approval of the ppa itself,and ferc approval of the ppa rates.on february,after entering the settlement agreement,nstar,cape wind,and doer submitted a memorandum of understanding mou to dpu seeking approval of a method and timetable for negotiating the cape wind nstar ppa.dpu approved the mou but not yet the ppa itself on march,see dpu order,final order,and cape wind and nstar executed the ppa the next day.on april,dpu approved nstar merger with national grid.see dpu order b,final order.
after three public comment hearings and two evidentiary hearings,dpu issued a final decision on november,approving the cape wind nstar ppa.see dpu order,final order hereinafter order.pursuant to order,dpu has an ongoing responsibility to review nstar recovery of costs in its annual reconciliation filings.according to the ppa itself,dpu will also serve as the arbiter for determining when physical construction of the nantucket sound facility commences under the ppa.the ppa provides that if cape wind fails to begin physical construction prior to december,nstar shall terminate the ppa on that date.
plaintiffs declined to appeal order directly to the massachusetts supreme judicial court,as was their right under.laws ch.and instead filed this action in federal district court fourteen months later,claiming that they would incur higher electricity rates under the ppa and suffer negative impacts to the environment,regional economy,historic and cultural resources,public safety,and recreational opportunities.
plaintiffs complaint sought a declaration that the commonwealth of massachusetts violated both the dormant commerce clause and the supremacy clause when it used its influence over nstar merger request to bring about nstar entry into an wholesale electricity contract with cape wind,and appropriate injunctive relief to remedy the constitutional violation and invalidate the contract that massachusetts compelled nstar to enter.more specifically,count of the complaint alleged that by requiring nstar to enter the ppa with a particular party at a particular price instead of allowing nstar to freely negotiate the contract,doer violated federal law and policy which requires wholesale electric energy prices to be set pursuant to market transactions.count alleged that b y conditioning its approval of the merger on the execution of a ppa between nstar and cape wind,doer prevented generation facilities from competing with cape wind,and t herefore,doer actions had a discriminatory effect on business and violated the dormant commerce clause.
the state defendants collectively,cape wind,and nstar each submitted their own motions seeking dismissal on grounds of sovereign immunity,preclusion,lack of ripeness,and plaintiffs failure to state a plausible claim under either the supremacy or commerce clause.the district court,in an opinion we describe in more detail below,determined that the debate begins and ends with the eleventh amendment,and held that sovereign immunity barred the court jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claims.in a series of footnotes,the district court also expressed doubts about whether plaintiffs had standing to press their claims and the merits of their underlying substantive allegations.this timely appeal from the district court dismissal with prejudice followed

sovereign immunity 
the applicable law

in verizon maryland,public service commission of maryland,d,where,as here,plaintiffs sued a state regulatory commission for issuing an order that was allegedly preempted by federal law,the supreme court articulated the sovereign immunity inquiry as follows in determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the court reasoned that a request that state officials be restrained from enforcing an order in contravention of controlling federal law clearly satisfies our straightforward inquiry.verizon,at.moreover,a declaration of the past,as well as the future,ineffectiveness of the state commission action was not barred because it did not impose upon the state a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials.id.quoting edelman,at.
critically for our decision in this case,the supreme court in verizon also expressly rejected the fourth circuit suggestion that the claim could not be brought due to the latter view that the state commission order was probably not inconsistent with federal law after all.id.the court responded by stating that the inquiry into whether suit lies under ex parte young does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.id.citing idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d an allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law is ordinarily sufficient to invoke ex parte young.
this straightforward inquiry is not always so straightforward.see verizon,at kennedy,concurring calling the verizon test deceptively simple.rather,the difference between the type of relief barred by the eleventh amendment and that permitted under ex parte young will not in many instances be that between day and night.edelman,at.also,there are certain types of cases that formally meet the ex parte young requirements of a state official acting inconsistently with federal law but that stretch that case too far and would upset the balance of federal and state interests that it embodies.papasan allain,d.
with the foregoing as our guide,we examine plaintiffs complaint,with special attention to the ongoing nature of the alleged offense and the type of relief sought.
application of that law to this case 
the complaint first asks the court to e njoin the dpu from enforcing its order approving the ppa a contract that is enforceable purely due to dpu allegedly unconstitutional order.and it requests a declaratory judgment that dpu order,which plaintiffs say is in effect forc ing nstar to purchase power pursuant to the cape wind nstar contract,be nullified.as pled by plaintiffs,the continued enforceability of the ppa represents an ongoing violation of federal law because order binds the parties to abide by the ppa allegedly unconstitutional terms.the relief requested is properly categorized as prospective because it is trained at preventing future contract performance and avoiding damages that plaintiffs have yet to incur.verizon,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court did not claim that plaintiffs sought damages from the state treasury.it also implicitly recognized that a claim for money damages is not a sine qua non for finding a lack of federal court jurisdiction.see coggeshall.bd.of registration of psychologists,cir we do not imply that the eleventh amendment bars claims only for money damages.that is not the case.in this manner,the district court correctly reached the key question is the requested relief properly characterized as prospective.office for prot.advocacy stewart,d quoting verizon,at internal quotation marks omitted.in answering this question in the negative,the district court found that 
t he effect of a declaration that massachusetts had illegally compelled nstar and cape wind to enter an price contract for wind energy would inevitably lead to restitutionary claims against the commonwealth by nstar and cape wind,while an injunction ordering dpu to cease enforcement of the ppa and to take remedial measures for the alleged constitutional harms would restrain the state from acting by frustrating its efforts to implement the policies enunciated in the gca and the gwsa,while further bleeding the treasury.
footnote omitted.we agree with plaintiffs that the district court erred in this crucial finding.
first,the hypothetical future restitutionary claims the district court forecasts are both conjectural and capable of being addressed on their own terms.as plaintiffs persuasively argue,even if nstar or cape wind could identify some plausible claim for damages against the state and were thereupon to file suit,that suit could then be dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity,and the state treasury would be undisturbed.so,whether a future suit by plaintiffs,nstar,or someone else that would in fact bleed the treasury may be barred by the commonwealth sovereign immunity,we need not decide in this case.
second,a conclusion that the requested equitable relief would restrain the state from acting by frustrating its efforts to implement the policies enunciated in the gca and the gwsa does not resolve the sovereign immunity inquiry.the ex parte young doctrine very existence means that a plaintiff may frustrate the efforts of a state policy when those efforts violate or imminently threaten to violate the plaintiff constitutional rights and the plaintiff confines its request to the proper form of relief.
defendants also argue that dpu has no ongoing role in enforcing the ppa,and that therefore there can be no ongoing violation of federal law under verizon.they reiterate the district court observation that the complaint itself does not refer to any future actions the state defendants must take with respect to the contract.thus,defendants say,the relief plaintiffs seek is entirely retrospective and falls outside of the ex parte young doctrine.
on this point,too,plaintiffs have a persuasive response.dpu does in fact possess an ongoing responsibility with respect to the ppa,because order states that dpu will review nstar electric recovery of costs in its annual reconciliation filings to ensure that nstar recovers such costs in a manner approved by dpu.the ppa itself,which dpu approved,also provides that upon petition by nstar,dpu shall determine whether physical construction has commenced by december,and if it has not commenced,nstar shall terminate the ppa as of said date the fact that order occurred in the past therefore does not itself push the complaint outside the confines of the ex parte young doctrine.logic supports this conclusion most unconstitutional agency determinations will have occurred in the past by the time a lawsuit is brought sovereign immunity does not necessarily prevent suits against such state actions when the alleged violation they spur is ongoing and no raid on the state treasury will result.see verizon,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that the relief sought by plaintiffs is retroactive and thus outside the reach of the ex parte young exception.
alternative arguments for affirmance 
anticipating the possibility that we would reverse the sovereign immunity holding,defendants point us to several other alternative arguments for affirming a judgment of dismissal,all of which were advanced in the district court,but not addressed by the court other than signaling that it tended to find at least some of those grounds for dismissal persuasive.our precedent gives us the discretion whether to reach those arguments in the first instance,or to remand.see,united states ex rel.estate of cunningham millennium labs.of,cir remanding for a determination of whether relator claims were under.b and b after finding error in the district court decision that it lacked jurisdiction aguilar immigration customs enforcement,cir assessing the viability of petitioners claims on the merits after finding that the district court erroneously dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds.our exercise of that discretion in this instance is guided by developments that occurred after briefing was complete.
on december,a week before we heard oral arguments in this case,cape wind notified nstar that it had failed to timely meet certain financing deadlines critical milestones defined in the ppa.nstar then sent a letter dated january,to cape wind,stating that nstar was invoking its right to terminate the ppa due to that default,in accordance with the rights reserved to nstar by the ppa remedies provisions.on the next day,nstar filed a letter with this court notifying us of the termination and opining that the termination mooted this appeal.we responded by instructing the parties to submit supplemental briefing to explain what had occurred and to set forth any arguments about the mootness or ripeness of the appeal following nstar purported termination.predictably,the parties disagree about whether nstar termination is valid under the contract,whether cape wind has taken the steps necessary to preserve the contract in the face of nstar attempted termination,and whether cape wind has a plausible defense to nstar termination under the ppa force majeure clause.
the parties also advance different views on the issue nstar argues that the appeal is both moot and unripe plaintiffs argue that the appeal is unripe but not moot cape wind says it is neither and the state defendants take no position on the issue.
the supreme court has placed the heavy burden of persuasion with respect to mootness on the party advocating for it.united states concentrated phosphate exp.ass n,d accord adarand constructors,slater,d.the court has used strong limiting language to describe the mootness inquiry intervening events must have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the parties conduct in order for a case to be deemed moot.cnty.of los angeles davis,d accord knox serv.emps.int l union,local,d a s long as the parties have a concrete interest,however small,in the outcome of the litigation,the case is not moot.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
if cape wind agreed that nstar termination of the ppa was valid,we would have little difficulty determining that the case was moot.there would be no legally binding contract enforcement to enjoin,and a declaration of the defunct ppa illegality would be merely advisory.am.civil liberties union of conference of catholic bishops,cir the expiration of a contract on its own terms constitutes a mooting event.lake coal,roberts schaefer,d per curiam complete,uncontested settlement moots appeal.
