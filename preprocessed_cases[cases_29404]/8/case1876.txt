reiter agreed to accept that amount and the parties agreed to permit a magistrate judge to determine attorneys fees in the light of reiter success and nycta offer.this task required the magistrate judge to compare the monetary relief with the equitable relief reiter secured.after that comparison,the magistrate judge concluded that the equitable relief did not have any significant value and that the final monetary award was less than the offer.the court then awarded reiter only attorneys fees.since this conclusion was clearly erroneous,we reverse.we also remand so the court can consider additional factors related to the calculation of attorneys fees.
background 
the nycta provides public transportation in new york and is comprised of several departments,including the capital program management cpm department,which is responsible for major architectural and engineering projects.in,reiter was employed by nycta as deputy vice president of engineering services dvp engineering,making him the head of the engineering services department.that department,which was part of the cpm,was responsible for major nycta engineering projects.as dvp engineering,reiter was one of thirteen executives who reported directly to the senior vice president and chief engineer of cpm,and the position required reiter to be a licensed engineer or architect.the department had an annual budget in excess of one billion dollars.
as dvp engineering,reiter earned around per year.eight senior executives reported directly to him and he exercised supervisory responsibility over employees.as a perquisite of the position,reiter had a large,prominent corner office on the seventh floor near his staff with a front view of manhattan and a confidential secretary who was among the most experienced secretaries in the organization.the nycta salary and compensation structures are based on the hay points system,which ranks the importance and difficulty of various positions.hay points are essentially an objective measure of a position value in terms of responsibility,complexity and salary.in his position,reiter was given hay relatively large reflect his responsibilities and salary.
in january,reiter received a negative annual performance review and was rated as a marginal employee.reiter disagreed with the evaluation and filed several complaints through the internal appeals process and with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that he received the negative evaluation as retaliation because his wife,who also worked for the nycta,had filed separate eeoc charges alleging discrimination and harassment.
in june,reiter was demoted.he was transferred to the position of deputy vice president of technical services dvp technical.the technical services department was responsible for working with the customers of cpm on the acceptance of capital projects.its role was to ensure that capital projects built by engineering services could be used by customers and were capable of being maintained by engineering services over time.reiter contended that the transfer was both retaliatory and a substantial demotion.
he pointed out that as dvp engineering,he had supervisory responsibility for employees and eight executives directly reported to him.as dvp technical,he had no staff and no direct reports.while engineering services was the largest department within cpm,with roughly of its workforce,technical services was one of the smallest departments,with approximately ten employees.moreover,reiter testified that in his new position he had no specifically assigned responsibilities or functions and did not have enough projects to fill his work day.while engineering services oversaw the development and implementation of large capital projects,technical services essentially ensured that the projects completed by engineering services were used and maintained.moreover,in his new position,reiter reported to the of technical services,not to senior management of cpm as he done as dvp engineering.the new position did not require that reiter be a licensed architect or an engineer.in addition,reiter demotion resulted in the loss of a number of substantial perquisites.he lost his confidential secretary,was moved from his large corner office on the seventh floor with a front view of broadway to a small,less desirable one on the second floor with a view of an alley,and lost all of his hay points.
in april,reiter sued the nycta.his complaint alleged that he was subject to the form of verbal reprimands,negative performance reviews,and filing his initial eeoc charge in march.by way of relief,reiter sought compensatory damages as well as equitable relief.specifically,he alleged that he was entitled to return to his prior position,along with all of the benefits of that position.
in july,defendants made an offer of judgment under rule.in it they proposed allowing judgment to be taken against them in the amount of,together with costs and reasonable attorneys fees accrued in this litigation to date.the rule offer ignored the relief reiter had sought.reiter did not accept the offer and the case proceeded to trial with the jury deciding liability and compensatory damages and the court addressing equitable relief.
following a trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of reiter,finding that nycta unlawfully retaliated against him for filing an eeoc complaint and awarded him in compensatory damages for emotional suffering.after the verdict,the nycta moved to vacate the award on the ground that reiter had failed to present sufficient evidence of emotional distress.see.in the alternative,the nycta moved for a new trial or for a remittitur reducing the award to.see.a e.
while opposing these motions,reiter continued to pursue equitable relief,seeking,among other things,reinstatement to his former position with the restoration of various perquisites of his job and an injunction against future retaliation.reiter also sought back pay,front pay,and pre and interest.
ultimately,the court denied the defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law but agreed to a new trial unless reiter accepted.reiter accepted the remittitur and ultimately received that amount.judge koeltl granted reiter equitable relief.he ordered reiter reinstated to his former position of dvp engineering,with an office comparable to the one he had prior to the demotion,the return of a confidential secretary and the restoration of lost hay points.the parties then consented to have reiter request for attorneys fees resolved by a magistrate judge.
before the magistrate judge,reiter sought substantial attorneys fees at a rate of per hour for two attorneys and per hour for one attorney and court costs.nycta,on the other hand,contended that its offer cut off attorneys fees and costs incurred after the offer.
ultimately,the magistrate judge agreed with the nycta and denied reiter fees and costs incurred after the rule offer.reiter metro.transp.he noted that the monetary award was less than the amount in the offer and then proceeded to completely discount the equitable relief that judge koeltl had awarded on the ground that none of the various injunctive elements of the final judgment had any significant value.id.at.specifically,the court concluded that reiter reinstatement to his former position,responsibilities,and status,was of limited value,and the restoration of hay points had no practical or economic significance.id.at.the court also concluded that the value of a confidential secretary and desirable office space was minimal,if anything.id.at.based on plaintiff failure to accept nycta more favorable monetary offer of,the magistrate judge ruled that reiter was foreclosed from attorneys fees and costs.he summarized his thinking as follows 
while the court has discussed the value of each element of the final judgment separately,rule requires a comparison of the entire final judgment against the entire offer.but stripped of the vindication value that might be attributed to reiter gratification in having obtained what he sought in a final judgment,the equitable elements of the final judgment together are of such limited value that the court can only conclude that they would not be considered more favorable by an objective,reasonable person than a cash payment.as a result,reiter must bear any costs or fees he incurred after the making of the offer.
having found that reiter could not recover fees incurred subsequent to the offer,the magistrate judge proceeded to calculate attorneys fees and costs as.id.reiter counsel sought compensation at per hour for senior counsel and per hour for junior counsel,arguing that these were the prevailing rates for experienced title vii lawyers in the southern district of new york.the court relied primarily on the retainer agreement rate,rather than prevailing current market rates,concluding that the amount actually charged by counsel was a dispositive indicator of a reasonable rate.since reiter retainer agreement called for per hour for work and for work,the district court awarded per hour to reiter two lead attorneys.reiter metro.transp,wl,at.the court decreased the retainer rate to per hour for reiter third attorney because she was less experienced.id.at.
reiter moved for reconsideration,arguing that higher hourly rates should apply based on the current market rates.the court based its determination on the plaintiff rate and rejected counsel contention that he had not had a fair opportunity to prove customary rates.according to the magistrate judge reasoning,judge koeltl ruling that counsel provide to nycta only a copy of plaintiff retainer agreement did not mean that its terms would be dispositive and in no way prevented plaintiff counsel from providing evidence of their customary rate in support of the attorney fees application.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
reiter principally raises two issues on appeal.first,he contends that the court below improperly denied attorneys fees incurred after the offer.second,to the extent it awarded fees,he claims the court erred by not applying prevailing market rates.we review de novo a district court interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure,unicorn tales,banerjee,cir,and review for clear error any findings of fact.id.further,we review a court decision to award or deny attorneys fees for abuse of discretion and its calculation of those damages de novo.harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins,cir.
first,reiter contends that the district court erred when it denied attorneys fees and costs incurred after the offer because the equitable relief he obtained,along with the monetary award,was more favorable than the offer.we agree.rule is a rule designed to encourage settlements without the burdens of additional litigation.rule provides if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.the rule thus requires a court to compare the offer to the judgment and decide which is more favorable.the magistrate judge,undertaking that exercise,concluded that the offer was more favorable than the judgment.the principal basis for this result was his conclusion that none of the equitable relief judge koeltl granted to reiter had any significant value and that no reasonable person would value the relief more than a cash payment.reiter,at.this conclusion is clearly erroneous.its most conspicuous shortcomings are that it fails to appreciate the significance of equitable relief in civil rights litigation,and draws indefensible conclusions about the worthlessness of the equitable relief reiter obtained.
turning to the question of whether reiter reinstatement had any value,we note that equitable relief lies at the core of title vii,which expressly provides for relief such as reinstatement and hiring.g.in albemarle paper moody,d,the supreme court commented that 
the purpose of title vii is to make persons whole for injuries suffered this is shown by the very fact that congress took care to arm the courts with full equitable powers.for it is the historic purpose of equity to secure complete justice where federally protected rights have been invaded,it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.

under title vii,equitable relief is not incidental to monetary relief.we,as well as other circuits,have repeatedly emphasized the importance of equitable relief in employment cases.see brooks travelers ins,cir noting that under title vii reinstatement has been interpreted as the first choice allen autauga county bd.of,cir reinstatement required except in extraordinary cases williams city of valdosta,cir reinstatement is a remedy to which plaintiff is normally entitled absent special circumstances jackson city of albuquerque,cir reinstatement is ordinarily to be granted emphasis omitted.under title vii,the best choice is to reinstate the plaintiff,because this accomplishes the dual goals of providing relief for a prevailing plaintiff and deterring future unlawful conduct.brooks,at citing selgas amer.airlines,cir.see also che.bay transp,cir we have recognized that reinstatement is an important remedy because it most efficiently advances the goals of title vii by making plaintiffs whole while also deterring future discriminatory conduct by employers.internal quotation marks omitted.by misapprehending the significance of the equitable relief reiter obtained,the magistrate judge significantly what reiter lost and what he was able to recover in litigation.as the eleventh circuit has noted in an analogous context 
when a person loses his job,it is at best disingenuous to say that money damages can suffice to make that person whole.the psychological benefits of work are intangible,yet they are real and can not be ignored we also note that reinstatement is an effective deterrent in preventing employer retaliation against employees who exercise their constitutional rights.if an employer best efforts to remove an employee for unconstitutional reasons are presumptively unlikely to succeed,there is,of course,less incentive to use employment decisions to chill the exercise of constitutional rights.
allen,at.these factors underpin the overarching preference in employment discrimination cases for reinstatement.see nlrb thalbo,cir finding the responsibility of a court that finds a title vii violation is to fashion equitable relief to make the claimant whole see also northcross bd.of educ.of the memphis city,d construing attorney fees provisions in civil rights statutes to be justified where plaintiffs injured by discrimination are successful in obtaining injunctive relief.reinstatement advances the policy goals of relief and deterrence in a way which money damages can not.squires bonser,cir.
having rather easily concluded that the equitable relief reiter secured was of considerable importance under title vii overall remedial framework,we now turn to the more difficult issue of whether that return of his old worth more than.we recognize that it is difficult to compare monetary relief with relief.charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure,ed.justice brennan described this problem best by stating i f a plaintiff recovers less money than was offered before trial but obtains potentially injunct
