the securities and exchange commission sec filed this action against michael berger in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that berger violated numerous provisions of the federal securities laws.the district court denise cote,judge granted summary judgment in favor of the sec.on appeal,berger challenges only the district court ruling that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against him.the sec asserts that berger,who has fled the united states and is now a fugitive from justice,should be estopped from bringing the instant appeal by the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.
background 
we assume familiarity with the district court opinion,which sets forth the factual background in detail.sec berger,d.accordingly,we need only restate those facts particularly relevant to this appeal.
defendant michael berger,along with two close friends as partners,formed an offshore investment company known as the manhattan investment fund,the fund,which was organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and commenced trading operations in the spring of.the fund was designed for foreign investors and domestic investors its investment objective was to achieve capital appreciation by investing primarily in securities.berger is the fund only active director.
at the time the complaint was filed,the fund had approximately investors,only a small percentage having addresses in the united states.manhattan capital management,mcm served as the investment advisor to the fund and was paid an annual management fee of of the fund net asset value as well as an incentive fee equal to of the fund net gains.at all relevant times,berger was the sole officer of and shareholder in mcm,a delaware corporation headquartered in new york.
the fund maintained a brokerage account at financial asset management,fam,a located in columbus,ohio.fam cleared all of its transactions through bear stearns securities corporation bear stearns,which is located in new york city.at all relevant times,the majority of the fund assets and securities were held in the bear stearns account.
berger invested the fund assets in stocks on domestic securities exchanges,employing the risky strategy of short selling.using this strategy,the fund suffered in excess of million in losses between and.rather than reporting these losses,berger,working in new york,created fraudulent account statements that vastly overstated the market value of the fund holdings.these statements were forwarded from new york by berger,acting on behalf of mcm,to fund administration services the fund administrator in bermuda every month for months.although the fund administrator also received accurate account statements directly from bear stearns,berger instructed the administrator to ignore the bear stearns statements,claiming that they did not fully and accurately reflect the fund entire portfolio.accordingly,the fund administrator relied upon the fraudulent statements created by berger in new york to calculate the net asset value of the fund each month.these overstated calculations were reflected in the fund monthly account statements,which the fund administrator sent from bermuda to investors,and in the fund annual financial statements,which were created at mcm offices in new york and made available for potential investors to review.berger also arranged for these false reports to be sent to the fund auditors,deloitte touche,which issued unqualified opinions on the fund as a result of these false statements.
in telephone calls to the fund administrator on january and,berger revealed that he had made serious mistakes,that his calculations were based on misrepresentations,and that the fund had suffered substantial losses.on january,berger sent a letter to all shareholders in the fund,stating that the financial statements of the fund that have been distributed over the last several years have been inaccurate and that the fund actual net assets are substantially less than those previously reported.
four days later,on january,the sec brought this civil action against berger,mcm,and the fund,alleging violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws,including section a of the securities act of,a section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,and section and of the investment advisers act of.
in august,a criminal proceeding was commenced against berger in the southern district of new york,and on november,berger pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges under section and rule.during the plea allocution,berger admitted to the relevant misconduct described above.specifically,he stated under oath 
b etween and,i was the sole principal of manhattan capital management,which acted as investment manager for an offshore fund called manhattan investment fund.the fund had a contrarian strategy and was buying and selling short stocks.i believed,starting in late,that the market and in particular technology stocks and stocks were grossly overvalued,and at this point,the market turned against me and caused the fund to incur significant losses.
for a variety of reasons,i was unable and not capable to admit the amount of those losses,and caused others to issue misleading statements to investors.
tr.of plea allocution,at.when asked by the district court whether some of these acts were committed by him here in new york or in the southern district,or were caused to be committed by him in this district,berger replied,t hey were caused to be committed by me in this district,yes.id.at.at the plea hearing,the assistant united states attorney stated that,if the case went to trial,
t he government would show that berger ran a hedge fund called the manhattan investment fund,primarily through an investment company called manhattan capital management,which was located in manhattan.
he started selling shares in the hedge fund in or about april of and over the years received over million from investors,nearly all of whom were overseas individuals or entities.
after a few months,in,however,berger began losing large sums of money in the market,primarily by pursuing a strategy of technology and stocks.
in or about september of,berger began falsifying the hedge fund in information that he provided to the administrator and auditor to conceal the fund losses.he caused false statements to be sent to the administrator and auditors,and the investors in return received statements from the administrator that falsely represented the value of their shares in the fund.
id.at.when berger was asked by the court whether he agree d with what the government has said with regard to the evidence that it would produce at a trial against him,he replied y es.id.at.on september,berger filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea,which the district court victor marrero,judge subsequently denied.see united states berger,d.
based largely on the facts stipulated to by berger under oath during his plea allocution,the sec filed a motion for summary judgment in the instant case on july.in opposing the motion,berger argued,among other things,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the civil action because it involved extraterritorial conduct that did not directly result from acts occurring within the united states and that did not have an effect on residents or markets.
the district court granted the sec motion for summary judgment on november.as an initial matter,the court determined that it had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.berger,d at.the court reasoned 
although the fund operated as a qualified offshore investment fund,and substantial activities for the marketing efforts,administration and conducted outside of the united states,the fraud was run from the united states and the decisions made in the united states were directly responsible for investor losses.specifically,the fraud was conceived and executed in new york by berger,who implemented the scheme through his company,mcm,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york.the offer memo advertises the fund to entities subject to the employee retirement income security act of,as amended erisa or other entities exempt from tax,among others.berger investment strategy principally involved the concentrated short selling on american exchanges of securities of united states technology companies.the fund securities transactions were cleared in new york by bear stearns and the fund assets were in baer stearns custody in new york.berger prepared the fictitious financial statements in new york.these statements were then sent offshore to the fund administrators,and then calculations based on these statements were back into this country and abroad to prospective investors,current shareholders,and their agents.
id.at footnote omitted.based on the conduct described above,the district court concluded that the complaint address es a fraud conceived and executed in new york,and therefore that it had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.id.at.
after determining that it had jurisdiction,the court granted the sec motion for summary judgment,holding that e ither through berger plea allocution or through other documentary and testimonial evidence,the sec has offered sufficient evidence of berger liability.id.at.this timely appeal followed.
immediately after berger filed the instant appeal,but prior to his sentencing in the criminal matter,berger fled the united states.he is still a fugitive from justice.see paul tharp,fugitive fund crook sighted in caribbean,new york post,at.
discussion 
on appeal,berger does not challenge the district court ultimate determination that the record established his liability.instead,he challenges only the district court conclusion that it had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the instant action.we review a district court ruling on subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see,moser pollin,cir.
fugitive disentitlement doctrine 
the sec argues that we need not address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.instead,it asks us to dismiss this appeal pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.
it is that federal courts have authority to dismiss an appeal or writ of certiorari if the party seeking relief is a fugitive while the matter is pending.degen united states,d.we have applied this equitable doctrine to dismiss fugitives appeals in civil as well as criminal cases,as long as there is some nexus between the fugitive status and the course of appellate proceedings.see empire blue cross blue shield finkelstein,cir citing united states,d.a sufficient nexus exists when the defendant is a fugitive during his ongoing appeal and his absence frustrates a civil judgment against him.see,at.united states morgan,cir finkelstein,at.
in the past,we advanced four independent grounds for disentitling fugitives assuring the enforceability of any decision that may be rendered against the fugitive imposing a penalty for flouting the judicial process discouraging flights from justice and promoting the efficient operation of the courts and avoiding prejudice to the other side caused by the defendant escape.see,united states dep t of justice,ins,cir quoting united states persico,cir.in degen united states,however,the supreme court called into question the validity of the second and third of these justifications,holding that,with respect to t he need to redress the indignity visited upon the district court by the defendant absence from the criminal proceeding,and the need to deter flight from criminal prosecution by the defendant and others,disentitlement would be an arbitrary response to the conduct it is supposed to redress or discourage.at.the court explained further that t here would be a measure of rough justice in saying that the defendant must take the bitter with the sweet,and participate in the legal process either for all purposes or none.but the justice would be too rough.id.at.
although degen does not expressly preclude consideration of these two factors in determining whether a fugitive should be disentitled,in light of the supreme court discussion in degen,the most persuasive justifications for disentitlement are now the inability to enforce a decision rendered by the appellate court,and the need to avoid prejudice to the other party resulting from the defendant fugitive status.with respect to the latter factor,there can be no doubt that berger absence has not prejudiced the sec.berger has already admitted to all the facts necessary to prove the sec case,and he does not contest these facts on appeal.the sec urges us,however,to dismiss the appeal because any decision we may render would not be enforceable while berger is at large.in particular,the sec notes that berger does not have sufficient assets in the united states that could be attached in order to cover the monetary sanctions against him,and that the sec can not bring a contempt proceeding against berger for his failure to pay without first locating him.
berger suggests that he owns two houses in the united states that might allow the sec to enforce part of its judgment against him despite his fugitive status.we can not resolve the disentitlement issue on this basis because berger asserts it for the first time on appeal without any factual support in the record.were these facts necessary to our disposition of the appeal,we would remand for factual findings or instruct the parties to submit affidavits directly to this court.finkelstein,at.such action is unnecessary,however,because berger appeal is without merit.accordingly,in the interests of judicial economy,we exercise our discretion to reach the jurisdictional question,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
subject matter jurisdiction 
although title of the united states code,which sets forth the various statutes governing securities exchanges,is silent as to the extraterritorial application of these statutes,we have recognized that subject matter jurisdiction may extend to claims involving transnational securities frauds.see,alfadda fenn,cir citing.to provide guidance on this topic,we have stated that,where a court is confronted with transactions that on any view are predominantly foreign,it must seek to determine whether congress would have wished the precious resources of united states courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted to them rather than to leave the problem to foreign countries.bersch drexel firestone,cir.in applying this standard,we have consistently looked at two factors whether the wrongful conduct occurred in the united states,and whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the united states or upon united states citizens.see,europe overseas commodity traders,banque paribas london,cir itoba lep group plc,cir psimenos hutton,cir.in evaluating these two factors,we apply what are known respectively as the conduct test and the effects test.
in considering the conduct test,we have held that jurisdiction exists only when substantial acts in furtherance of the fraud were committed within the united states,psimenos,at citing iit vencap,cir,and that the test is met whenever the defendant activities in the united states were more than merely preparatory to a securities fraud conducted elsewhere and the activities or culpable failures to act within the united states directly caused the claimed losses.itoba,at citations omitted.
berger argues that we lack subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the conduct test because his actions in new york did not directly cause the perpetration of the fraud.more specifically,he maintains that the inaccurate monthly account statements,prepared and mailed to investors by the fund administrator in bermuda,constitute the heart of the fraud,and that his own activities in new york were therefore merely preparatory,rather than a direct cause of harm to the investors.def.br.at.
in response,the sec first contends that,where securities fraud litigation is brought by the sec rather than by private plaintiffs,there need not be a direct causal connection between the actions in the united states and the claimed losses resulting from the fraud in order for jurisdiction to exist.the sec notes that,unlike private plaintiffs,it may bring securities fraud actions prophylactically in order to prevent loss to the public before
