this is an appeal from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york spatt,dismissing for failure to state a claim the complaint in a federal securities fraud class action filed against bear stearns securities and its corporate parent,bear stearns,collectively,bear stearns.see in re sterling foster.sec,d levitt.the putative plaintiff class consists of members of the public who purchased securities of ml direct,ml direct from the long island brokerage firm of sterling foster,sterling foster during the approximately months following ml direct initial public offering ipo.id.at.the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is that bear stearns knowingly and actively participated in a stock fraud scheme perpetrated by sterling foster involving the ml direct ipo.
the district court determined that plaintiffs claim was time barred.specifically,the district court found,as a matter of law,that there were sufficient storm warnings that would have caused a reasonably prudent investor to discover bear stearns alleged role in the sterling foster scheme at least one year before plaintiffs filed their class action complaint.id.at.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the district court conclusion is not supported by the facts contained in the pleadings,when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the facts alleged in the class action complaint filed by plaintiffs are based in large part on a federal indictment filed in the southern district of new york against two officers of sterling foster,a civil action filed in the southern district of new york by the securities and exchange commission sec against sterling foster,and testimony taken during a arbitration brought against bear stearns before the national association of securities dealers nasd.
sterling foster market manipulation scheme 
on september,the registration statement for the ml direct ipo became effective for the sale of million shares.id.at.the original issue was sold to the public at a price of per unit,with each unit consisting of two shares of common stock and one warrant for the purchase of a share of common stock at a fixed price in the future,so that the price per share was slightly less than per share.id.the ipo was underwritten by patterson travis.id.
when the registration statement became available,it disclosed the fact that a preregistered but delayed as a shelf been piggybacked onto the ipo.this shelf registration pertained to million additional shares of ml direct common stock owned by certain insider selling shareholders the selling insiders.these shares were subject to a lockup,they could not be sold for twelve months after the ipo,although the lockup could be waived by the underwriter,patterson travis.id.in particular,the ipo registration statement and prospectus stated that patterson travis had no agreements or understandings with any of the selling insiders with respect to release of the selling insiders shares prior to the expiration of the lockup period and ha d no present intention of releasing any or all of such securities prior to the expiration of the lockup period.id.
on september,first day that ml direct stock was publicly foster bought up the majority of the ml direct shares,driving the price to per share at the close of trading.id.during the first two days of trading,sterling foster sold over million shares of ml direct.since there were only million shares for sale in the ipo,sterling foster had sold approximately million shares more than it actually owned.this situation,known in the securities industry as taking a short position or selling short,posed a problem only insofar as the only other available ml direct shares were the shares that had been registered for the selling insiders,which were subject to the lockup.id.the september settlement date for the shares sold by sterling foster on september came and went without sterling foster delivering to bear stearns the shares required to cover its short position.id.however,patterson travis had agreed to waive the lockup on the selling insiders shares as of september,so that sterling foster was able on september and to deliver to bear stearns shares that it had secretly purchased from certain of the selling insiders for per share.id.thus,when it covered its short position,sterling foster made a profit consisting of the difference between the price at which it sold the shares to the public to per share and the price it paid to the selling insiders per share,a total of approximately million.id.at.
this market manipulation scheme,along with the misrepresentations in the offering documents that patterson travis had made no prior agreements with the selling insiders concerning the sale of their shares before the expiration of the lockup period,caused the investing public to believe that only million shares of ml direct were being offered.id.in fact,three times that number of shares were being sold,most via short sales at inflated prices.id.indeed,the investing public believed that the market had set the price of to per share when,in fact,that price had been artificially created by sterling foster,which was at the same time purchasing shares from the selling insiders at only per share.id.
ii.bear stearns alleged role in sterling foster scheme 
bear stearns acted as the clearing agency for sterling foster.at the center of the securities industry,clearing firms provide the necessary services and capital typically needed by small brokerage houses to complete a securities transaction,most importantly,the clearing function.daphna abrams,note,a second look at clearing firm liability,brook,abrams footnote omitted.a clearing firm clears trades,completes transactions by delivering securities to the purchasing and by making money payments to the selling.id.footnote omitted.clearing responsibilities include receiving or delivering funds from or to the customer maintaining records that reflect the transaction and safeguarding the funds in the customer account.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a clearing firm is also responsible for maintaining records of all trades made by the customer,including sending confirmations,monthly statements,and dividends to the.id.additional clearing services include the extension of credit for the purchase of securities on margin.id.at.small brokerage firms,commonly referred to as introducing firms,typically lack sufficient capital,back office technology and personnel to self clear.id.at footnotes omitted.as a result,they enter into carrying agreements with clearing firms to out source clearing and other services.id.in addition to performing clearing functions,on occasion,the clearing firm executes transactions,thereby limiting the role of the introducing broker to simply soliciting investor sales.id.at.the clearing firm also provides name recognition for the introducing firm,frequently inflating the image of a small,unknown introducing firm.the name bear stearns,for example,lends credibility,stability,business savvy,and expertise to unknown introducing firms.id.finally,because clearing firms are relatively well capitalized,they become deep pocket litigation targets.id.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting henry minnerop,the role and regulation of clearing brokers,bus.law.
plaintiffs alleged that sterling foster effectively acted as an underwriter with respect to the selling insiders ml direct shares.bear stearns allegedly required that,before it would agree to clear transactions for introducing brokers such as sterling foster acting as underwriters,the introducing brokers had to request permission from bear stearns.levitt,d at.consequently,prior to august,sterling foster purportedly requested that bear stearns permit sterling foster to underwrite the sale of the selling insiders shares.id.at the time of this request,officers at bear stearns allegedly knew that sterling foster intended to sell a lot of shares after the effective date of the ml direct ipo and to take a substantial short position of approximately million shares in its bear stearns trading account.id.officers at bear stearns also allegedly were aware that this short position would not be covered by the settlement date,but that it would later be covered from shares to be received from the selling insiders.id.
prior to the ipo,bear stearns officers requested and received a copy of the ml direct ipo preliminary prospectus,which contained the language discussed above.id.thus,these officers allegedly knew that the representations made concerning the lock up were false.id.
prior to september,bear stearns agreed to act as a clearing agent for the underwriting of the selling insiders shares but required that sterling foster deposit another million with bear stearns and that sterling foster president provide a personal guarantee for any losses bear stearns might incur.id.bear stearns also allegedly knew,on or before september,that sterling foster covered its short sales with the selling insiders shares and made a profit of approximately.bear stearns is charged with this knowledge because i the money was paid out by bear stearns to the selling insiders from the sterling foster trading account ii officials at bear stearns received documents disclosing the number of shares being delivered and the price to be paid for those shares and iii there was information related to these sales in records maintained by bear stearns in its capacity as clearing agent.id.
on september,when sterling foster trading account was short approximately million shares,bear stearns extended credit to sterling foster.id.moreover,during the two to three days when sterling foster settlement account at bear stearns was delinquent,bear stearns became an unsecured creditor of sterling foster for more than million,but did not charge sterling foster any interest on this amount.id.
finally,bear stearns sent purchasers of ml direct stock,sterling foster brokerage customers confirmations stating your broker makes a market in this security,and acted as principal.id.at.this statement was allegedly false because it implied that these purchases were market transactions,when bear stearns allegedly knew that the real purchaser of these shares was sterling foster,which was making a profit on the transactions.id.bear stearns received dollars for each trade of ml direct by sterling foster that it cleared.id.
iii.other proceedings 
as noted above,in drafting their complaint,plaintiffs relied on several other proceedings that had been initiated in.we briefly summarize three of those proceedings below.
sec proceeding 
in february,the sec filed a civil action against sterling foster and certain of its shareholders,officers,and employees,alleging securities fraud in connection with several ipos underwritten or brokered by sterling foster,including the ml direct ipo.id.at.
nasd arbitration 
the following month,howard greenberg,who was represented by plaintiffs counsel,initiated an nasd arbitration proceeding against bear stearns alleging fraud and market manipulation with respect to the latter conduct as clearing agent in several transactions,including the ml direct ipo.id.the statement of claim filed in that arbitration alleged that bear stearns 
fail ed to comply with applicable law and was a joint venturer with sterling foster in that it knowingly facilitated and made possible sterling foster fraud by allowing sterling foster to perform transactions without meeting the requirements of the relevant laws,rules,and regulations and by allowing sterling foster to take positions which were in direct and gross conflict with that of its customers.
thus,w ithout bear stearns knowing participation,sterling foster could not have successfully committed the fraud and manipulated the market as it did.see id.at.
in support of these allegations,the statement of claim alleged facts that were also alleged by plaintiffs here.those facts were that 
bear stearns knew that the ml direct ipo registered only shares but that,as of the close of business on september,sterling foster was short million shares 
bear stearns became an unsecured creditor of sterling foster as of september,by failing to have sterling foster deposit a security,in violation of securities regulations 
bear stearns failed to require sterling foster to deposit shares to cover its short position by the settlement date of september,in violation of securities regulations 
bear stearns knew,or should have known,of the profit made by sterling foster and 
bear stearns and its employees secretly profited from sterling foster fraudulent scheme.
missing from the statement of claim and present in the complaint filed in the district court were allegations that 
a prior to september,the effective date of the ml direct ipo,bear stearns required sterling foster to seek its consent to act as an underwriter 
b prior to september,bear stearns knew about the agreement and that sterling foster had permission from patterson travis to do an end run around it and 
c bear stearns knew that the language quoted in the confirmations sent by bear stearns to purchasers of ml direct stock was false.
plaintiffs assert that the facts supporting these allegations did not come to light until the arbitration hearing.the arbitrators dismissed greenberg claim grounded in bear stearns purported failure to send him a prospectus and ultimately dismissed his remaining claims.on march,the arbitrators issued a written award confirming their decision to dismiss.see greenberg bear,stearns,cir.in january,greenberg brought an action in the southern district of new york to vacate the arbitration award,which judge martin declined to vacate in a decision dated august.this court affirmed that decision in august of.see id.
texas litigation 
in august,one joe price who was not represented by plaintiffs counsel commenced an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against sterling foster and bear stearns,alleging violations of the federal securities laws.see levitt,d at.the excerpts from the complaint reproduced in the record do not indicate whether price was someone who had purchased or sold ml direct shares during the period that was the subject of plaintiffs complaint.nevertheless,he did allege that 
t he monthly statements sent out by bear stearns reflected unrealistic valuations of the securities based only on the prices of the market maker s 
since the market maker was sterling foster,bear stearns was assisting in the fraudulent practice by reflecting unreliable monthly valuations and 
bear stearns,as clearing agent for sterling foster,acted recklessly in failing to discover sterling foster fraudulent practices and assisted sterling foster in carrying out said practices.
although the record does not indicate what became of this action,we take judicial notice of the facts that on march,the case was transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml to the district court and on the same date that the district court dismissed the present action,it dismissed price action against bear stearns,pursuant to rule b,for failure to state a claim.see in re sterling foster.sec,d,price.
iv.proceedings in the district court 
plaintiffs commenced this action in february by filing a complaint in the southern district of new york against bear stearns alleging federal causes of action for securities fraud and market manipulation and a cause of action for fraud.levitt,d at.in april,the jpml transferred the case to the eastern district of new york as a to ten other class actions involving sterling foster that had been consolidated there.id.at.in august,bear stearns moved to dismiss the case,pursuant to.b,on the ground,inter alia,that the federal securities claims were time barred.id.in a published opinion and order dated june,judge spatt granted bear stearns motion to dismiss.id.at.essentially,the district court found that the federal claims were barred by the statute of limitations because a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence exercising reasonable diligence would have discovered the allegations in the complaint prior to february,one year before the complaint was filed.id.at.the distric
