before instituting these administrative proceedings,the parents all retained counsel to represent them.two lawyers,todd silverblatt and michael hampden,associated with legal services for children lsc,a legal services organization that specializes in,inter alia,education law,represented,and the lsc plaintiffs in their administrative hearings.lsc did not charge the lsc plaintiffs legal fees.instead,the lsc plaintiffs assigned to lsc their rights to recover from the doe under the provisions of the idea.that is how lsc obtains a good portion of its funding.ex rel.city bd.of,civ,civ,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.gary mayerson represented and in their idea hearing,ex rel.bd.of educ,d,for which representation he charged them legal fees.

thereafter,the parents filed complaints in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming that they had been denied attorneys fees to which they were entitled under the idea.on april,after the lsc plaintiffs cases were consolidated,they moved for summary judgment,seeking a total award of,of which represented legal services rendered in the course of the administrative representation of the lsc plaintiffs and reflected lawyers fees for the district court litigation for attorneys fees itself.together with their summary judgment motion,the lsc plaintiffs included affidavits supporting their assertion that per hour was the hourly rate prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.i c.in response,the doe argued,inter alia,that the appropriate rate should be between and per hour and submitted affidavits supporting that contention.the doe also asserted that and were not prevailing parties as that term is used in the idea because they did not succeed on the merits in their administrative hearings.the doe argued further that and were not prevailing parties by virtue of the ihos their settlement agreements because,the doe contended,the ihos did not retain enforcement jurisdiction over the agreements or have the authority to the agreements in the first place.on november,judge motley granted the lsc plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,awarding them in fees,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on october,in a separate proceeding before judge scheindlin,and filed a motion for attorneys fees,requesting fees for mayerson services at a rate of to per hour.the doe did not contest that and were prevailing parties as a result of the relief granted them in their administrative proceedings.the doe asserted,however,that the fees sought were not reasonable,and that a rate of to per hour was proper for the services provided.
on february,the district court granted and in attorneys fees and related expenses for their administrative hearings.relying in part on the award of attorneys fees to the lsc plaintiffs in their action,the court found that per hour was a reasonable rate for mayerson legal representation during the administrative proceedings,d at.the court also found that mayerson spent a total of hours in connection with the administrative proceedings but reduced this figure slightly because it found that some of the relevant time records were vague or incomplete.id.at.the court also determined that mayerson spent hours on the fee application process in the district court and that,because mayerson expertise had increased since he represented and in their administrative proceedings in,the reasonable rate for these services was per hour.id.at.the court awarded the plaintiffs in attorneys fees and related costs in connection with the fee application.id.at.
the doe appeals from both district court decisions.because of the similarities of the appeals,we heard argument in them together and now decide them together.
discussion 
i.the idea 
the idea aims to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.d a.to achieve this goal,t he idea requires that states that receive certain federal funds offer parents of a disabled student an array of procedural safeguards designed to help ensure the education of their child.polera bd.of,cir see also lillbask ex rel.mauclaire.dep t of,cir.under the idea,a parent may present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.b.t he parents involved in such complaint shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing,id.f,which,under applicable provisions of new york state law,is conducted by an iho.see educ.
to further ensure that children with disabilities receive free appropriate public education s the idea provides that i n any action or proceeding brought under the idea,a court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.i b.such fees shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.id.i c.
ii.the doe position on appeal 
the doe challenges the district court awards of attorneys fees in four respects.first,the doe contends that and are not prevailing parties eligible for attorneys fees because they did not obtain decisions on the merits in their administrative hearings and because the settlement agreements,over which the ihos did not retain enforcement jurisdiction,did not constitute consent decrees.second,the doe argues that the community for determining the appropriate hourly rate for attorneys fees should be the community of practitioners who appear before the doe for idea hearings,rather than the community of practitioners in the federal district in which the fee application was commenced.third,the doe argues that the district court abused its discretion in determining that rates of to per hour were reasonable for the parents counsel representation with respect to administrative hearings,because such representation is simply of a different kind and quality than the more sophisticated legal services required to vindicate statutory or constitutional rights in a federal forum.appellant br.at,ex rel.city dep t of see also appellant br.at,ex rel.bd.of educ.finally,the doe asserts that fee disputes in federal court are ancillary to the underlying administrative proceedings,and,consequently,the district court erred in awarding and fees at a higher rate for their fee application in the district court than for representation during administrative proceedings.

iv.are the parents prevailing parties 
buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources 
the idea,as noted,contains a provision under which a prevailing party may recover attorneys fees from the party against which it prevailed.see i b.the first question we must address,then,is whether the parents were prevailing parties in the proceedings before the ihos.
provisions in federal statutes are not uncommon n umerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney fees.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d until the supreme court decision in buckhannon,this court and most other united states courts of appeals,in interpreting those statutes,often employed the catalyst theory,id.at.roberson giuliani,cir,which posits that a plaintiff is a prevailing party if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct,buckhannon,at.under the catalyst theory,a court could award attorneys fees based solely upon a private agreement among the parties settling their dispute,even though no legal relief such as a consent decree had been obtained.coalition fed.transit,cir.
the buckhannon court addressed the validity of the catalyst theory in the context of an award made pursuant to provisions of the fair housing amendments act of fhaa,c t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee and costs,and the americans with disabilities act of ada,t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee,including litigation expenses,and costs.buckhannon,at.the court observed that judgments on the merits for a plaintiff in a judicial action governed by such statutes rendered the plaintiff a prevailing party and that settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree may also serve as the basis for an award of attorney fees.id.at.the court explained that enforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees create the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.id.at.quoting.state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.the court held,however,that the catalyst theory was not a valid basis for awarding attorney fees because i t allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.private settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.id.at.
a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term prevailing party authorizes an award of attorney fees without a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.
id.at.emphasis in original.
application of buckhannon to fees under the idea 
we begin our analysis of the application of buckhannon to the idea on substantial common ground.
buckhannon application to idea fees.first,the parties recognize that we interpret the idea fee provisions in consonance with those of other civil rights statutes.ex rel.city dep t of,cir per curiam accord roberson,at reg l sch.dist,bd.of,cir.hence,the standards used to interpret the term prevailing party under any given statute are generally applicable in all cases in which congress has authorized an award of fees to a prevailing party.id.at quoting hensley eckerhart,d.
those standards include the requirements set forth in buckannon.as we observed in,buckhannon concerned the provisions of the americans with disabilities act of,and the fair housing amendments act of,c,but the decision expressly signaled its wider applicability.id.we concluded in that buckhannon applies to the idea.id.at accord alegria ex rel.alegria dist.of columbia,doe boston pub,cir.
fees where an iho orders relief on the merits.second,the parties agree,as do we,that a plaintiff who receives relief on the merits in an idea administrative proceeding is a prevailing party.he or she may therefore be entitled to payment of attorneys fees under the idea provisions.
the statute itself requires this conclusion.the idea permits a court to award reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party i n any action or proceeding brought under the statute.i b emphasis added.in the context of the idea,proceeding refers to,or at least includes,an administrative proceeding.see,i d i attorneys fees may not be awarded in any action or proceeding under this section for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent if inter alia the offer is made in the case of an administrative proceeding,at any time more than days before the proceeding begins and the court or administrative hearing officer makes specified findings emphasis added i d ii referring to attorneys fees awarded for meetings convened as a result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action emphasis added.we have so read the statute.see vultaggio bd.of,cir per curiam noting that the impartial due process hearing is a proceeding brought under for purposes of under i b.
we agree,then,with the doe that 
i t is well settled that attorney s fees are available to parents who prevail at an impartial due process hearing.this court implicitly so ruled in vultaggio board of education other circuits have explicitly held that attorney s fees are available for appearances at an idea due process hearing.
doe supplemental letter br.of may,at,ex rel.city dep t of educ.citations omitted.
we recognize that the situation before us differs from the one confronted by the supreme court in buckhannon the application of the fhaa and ada provisions to plaintiffs who had brought suit in federal court.here,by contrast,we consider the operation of the idea provisions when applied to administrative proceedings.buckhannon language in this regard therefore does not map perfectly onto the meaning of prevailing party as used in the context of idea administrative proceedings.
concepts of relief on the merits,buckhannon,at,material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,id.at.quoting.state teachers ass n,at,and consent decree,for example,have an obvious meaning when applied to both judicial actions as in buckhannon and the administrative proceedings before us.but the buckhannon court also referred to judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties,id.at.emphasis added,judicial imprimatur,id.emphasis added,and judicial approval and oversight,id.at.emphasis added,as hallmarks of actions that may give rise to prevailing party status.because of their reference to judicial action,these factors can not serve literally as part of a test for differentiating between those outcomes of purely administrative idea proceedings that give rise to a plaintiff prevailing party status and those that do not.
but an iho decision on the merits in an idea proceeding does constitute administrative imprimatur.although not judicial,such an order changes the legal relationship between the parties its terms are enforceable,if not by the iho itself,then by a court,including through an action under.see,sjb city dep t of,civ,wl,dist.lexis july,see also jeremy mount lebanon sch,cir polera bd.of,cir.in order to give effect to the idea intent to permit awards to winning parties in administrative proceedings even where there has been no judicial involvement,as the parties agree that we must,we conclude that the combination of administrative imprimatur,the change in the legal relationship of the parties arising from it,and subsequent judicial enforceability,render such a winning party a prevailing party under buckhannon principles 
the catalyst theory in the context of idea fee awards.third,to paraphrase a passage in buckhannon where an administrative proceeding results in a purely private settlement,a defendant change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve,lacks the necessary administrative imprimatur on the change in the legal relationship between the parties.see buckhannon,at.we therefore think it plain,and the parties agree,that under buckhannon,a settlement of an idea administrative proceeding between the parties,followed by a dismissal of the not render the plaintiff a prevailing party for statutory purposes no matter how favorable the settlement is to the plaintiff interests.to permit such a fee award would be to reinstate the use of the now forbidden catalyst theory.because of the absence of administrative imprimatur,such an award falls on the other side of the line,that separates such a settlement from orders that give rise to prevailing party status.
and and administrative proceedings 
administrative hearing and and administrative hearing each resulted in an order in favor of the parent or parents and against the doe.the doe does not contest the district court determination that those parents were prevailing parties.
and administrative proceedings 
based on the foregoing analysis,we agree with the parents position that and are also entitled to prevailing party status in the iho proceedings in connection with which they each obtained an administrative analog of a consent decree.we perceive no reason to distinguish the outcomes of those proceedings from those obtained by and and in theirs.we do not think that the fact that the terms of the and orders arose out of an agreement between the parties,rather than out of the wisdom of the iho,matters 
buckhannon established,in the context of judicial proceedings,that consent decrees create the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.at.the and orders were,in substance,administrative consent decrees.see charles koch,administrative law and practice,at ed.we think that they evidence the same combination of administrative imprimatur,change in the legal relationship of the parties,and judicial enforceability that renders the winner on the merits in an iho decision,such as and and,a prevailing party under the idea and buckhannon.
by contrast,had the agreements between and the doe,and and the doe,been purely by the proceedings but not ordered by the and would not have been prevailing parties.to hold otherwise would be to give effect to the catalyst theory disapproved in buckhannon.had the ihos done no more than dismiss the cases following settlement,their involvement to that extent would not be enough.but they did more they incorporated the terms of the settlements in dispositive administrative orders 
our view of buckhannon teaching is buttressed by the supreme court previous decision in kokkonen guardian life insurance of america,d.the kokkonen court confronted a related issue whether a court maintains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement when it does no more than a stipulation and order of dismissal that dismisses the complaint after settlement without so much as refer ing to the settlement agreement.id.at.kokkonen held that it does not.id.at.but,the court noted,
t he situation would be quite different if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of by separate provision or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.in that event,a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order,and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.
the question before us is,similarly,whether a settlement of an administrative proceeding is the equivalent of an administrative decree on the merits.no,kokkonen suggests,if it is followed only by a dismissal of the administrative proceeding.the power and authority of the administrative agency do not underlie the private settlement agreement,which may only be enforced by a new and separate proceeding by one party against another.but yes,kokkonen implies,if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement ha s been made part of the order of by separate provision or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.id.that seems to us to be a fair general description of what the ihos did in the course of the and hearings in which they agreed to endorse the agreements,and in the endorsement of those agreements themselves 
we conclude that and were prevailing parties entitled to attorneys fees under i b.
calculation of attorneys fees 
the idea provides that the fees that district courts award must be reasonable and based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.i b c.to calculate such attorneys fees,courts apply the lodestar method,whereby an attorney fee award is derived by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.new britain bd.of,cir quoting blanchard bergeron,d.t here is a strong presumption that the lodestar figure represents a reasonable fee.id.quoting quaratino tiffany,cir omission in original accord ex rel.city dep t of,cir per curiam.
community in which the action or proceeding arose 
the doe complains that the district judges wrongly looked to the legal community of the southern district of new york,where they sit,rather than to the community of all practitioners appearing before the doe in idea administrative actions,to measure the level of legal fees to be awarded to the parents counsel 
the community to which the idea fee calculation provision refers is typically measured by the geographic area in which the action was commenced and litigated.arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,cir per curiam analyzing similar provision in voting rights act of.where the legal dispute has been pursued through an action in federal court,n ormally a district court,awarding attorney fees under a statute,will consider the prevailing rates in the district in which the court sits.polk state dep t of corr,cir analyzing award of attorney fees under in action brought under accord cruz local union of int l of workers,cir.
the disputes in the cases before us were pursued through idea administrative proceedings,not the district court.the doe exercises jurisdiction over public schooling in the five boroughs of the city of new york,three of which lie within the jurisdiction of one united states district court and two of which are in another.the students involved in these proceedings attended schools in bronx and new york counties,both in the southern district of new york administrative hearings were held there as well as in kings county,which is in the eastern district.the parents lawyers have their offices in new york county,in the southern district.our case law does not provide us with a litmus test for determining,in these circumstances,the community in which the proceedings for which the parents were awarded legal fees arose.see,at considering issue of whether fees under idea should reflect rates for general litigation or for representations in administrative hearings only,without addressing choice of community,at remanding for determination of fees under idea without discussing the community the district court should consider in determining fees.
the parents urge us to affirm the district court fee awards because the awards comply with the typical rule.they suggest that the cases arose entirely or principally in the southern district of new york and contend that the district court therefore properly treated the rates prevailing in the southern district as the fee structure against which the attorneys fees here should be measured.the doe contends to the contrary that the relevant community must be with the group of lawyers who bring idea actions against the doe in other words,that the district court must refer to rates across the five boroughs of the city of new york in determining a reasonable rate for representation in idea hearings.
the text of section i c does not appear to compel either conclusion.the requirement that the relevant community be that in which the action or proceeding arose does not tell us whether a proceeding arises where it is held in this case,the southern and eastern districts or where the events that gave rise to the hearings occurred here,the southern district.nor can we conclude from the fact that the proceedings undeniably arose in the city of new york as a whole that they can not also be said to have arisen in the southern district of new york or that the community of lawyers throughout the city of new york,those lawyers appearing before the doe,is necessarily the only group whose fees provide the yardstick by which to measure the fee award.
the doe expresses a concern that,under what it sees as the district court approach,the same lawyer may be paid at different hourly rates for services rendered in similar proceedings against the same defendant depending upon the happenstance of where in new york city,and therefore in which federal district,the action or proceeding against the doe arose.but such distinctions are inherent in any approach that distinguishes between the level of legal payments in different districts when setting the rate at which legal fees are to be awarded the same lawyer may be paid at different rates with respect to otherwise identical legal services provided in cases heard in the southern district of new york new york county manhattan,bronx county,and points north from those at which he or she is paid with respect to legal services provided in cases heard in the eastern district of new york richmond county staten island,kings county brooklyn,queens county,and points east.so long as the law provides for or permits fee awards based on geographic markets for services,a lawyer may be paid at different rates for otherwise indistinguishable services.as the district of columbia circuit observed,this approach provides 
a neutral rule which will not work to any clear advantage for either those seeking attorneys fees or those paying them.attorneys coming into a jurisdiction in which market rates are lower will have to accept those lower rates for litigation performed there.similarly,some attorneys may receive fees based on rates higher than they normally command if those higher rates are the norm for the jurisdiction in which the suit was litigated.
donnell united states,cert.denied,d 
we acknowledge,on the other side of the ledger,that there is good reason for a district court not to be wed to the rates in its own community.if they are lower than those in another district,skilled lawyers from such other district will be dissuaded from taking meritorious cases in the district with lower rates.if lawyers are paid for their participation in idea proceedings that clearly arise in queens at a rate considerably lower than what they are paid for representation in proceedings that clearly arise in manhattan,experienced,lawyers like hampden,silverblatt,and mayerson may decide to devote their time and expertise to idea cases that arise in manhattan rather than those cases in which parents are equally needful of their services,but that arise in queens 
but we need not arrive at a crisp rule that a district court must employ to make this determination.we have held in somewhat comparable circumstances that the district court has be sure,discretion that may not be determine the relevant community for calculating attorneys fees where the case was not commenced and litigated in a single federal district.see polk state dep t of corr,cir concluding,where the case was justifiably commenced in the southern district but later transferred to the northern district for improper venue,that the district court had discretion to award a fee based on either the southern district or northern district.
similarly here,there is more than one community that the district court might reasonably have considered in determining fees.but the contacts between the administrative proceedings and the southern district,which is the place where the clients reside,where the facts giving rise to their successful claims occurred,and where the lawyers who represented them hang their shingles,appear clearly to predominate.by comparison,the fact that the doe held hearings on the other side of an bridge provides minimal support for treating the place where the proceedings were held as that in which they arose on the facts of these cases.although none of this means that the district court was required to reach the result that it did,it does confirm that the court did not abuse its discretion in treating the southern district as the community in which the proceeding arose,and therefore in relying primarily on the level of legal fees charged by comparable lawyers in comparable circumstances in the southern district of new york in setting legal fees for the plaintiffs under the idea.
reasonableness of the rate 
fees in,and cases.as we have noted,the district court credited the affidavits submitted on behalf of,and in which special education lawyers represented that they charged fees of to per hour in the southern district,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also observed that in,the southern district awarded attorneys fees at an hourly rate of for representation at an idea hearing and subsequent litigation in federal court,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing x state educ.dep t,d.it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to credit evidence submitted by the plaintiffs instead of countervailing evidence submitted by the defendant.see ex rel.city dep t of,cir per curiam.
the district court found unpersuasive the affidavits and arguments submitted by the doe indicating that the prevailing rate should be to per hour.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.similarly,the district court found irrelevant the two lawyers declarations supporting the doe assertion that a lower hourly rate was appropriate.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court also found unpersuasive the doe records of the amounts that it previously paid to lawyers for representation at idea administrative hearings.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court noted that these figures did not accurately represent market figures because many of these payments involved settlements for amounts substantially less than the requested attorneys fees.see id.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined,based on the evidence before it,that a range of to was reasonable for representation at the administrative hearings.
nor did the district court abuse its discretion in awarding the lsc lawyers fees at the top end of this range based on their experience even though much of the lawyers careers was spent practicing in areas other than education law,their overall legal experience merited a higher hourly rate because most important legal skills are transferrable,at.indeed,we have observed that hampden,who is one of the lawyers in the instant case,possesses considerable experience in education law despite having spent much of his career focusing on different kinds of law.id.
