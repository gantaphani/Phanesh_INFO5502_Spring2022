this appeal and concern the pension benefits owed to plaintiff carlo novella,a retired carpenter,and members of a class he purports to represent.during novella career,he performed jobs for which his employers were obligated,under collective bargaining agreements,to pay into the defendant pension fund on his behalf.but there were from to during which novella did not perform any work requiring his employer to make such a contribution.in,when novella was nearing his birthday,he became disabled as a result of injuries sustained while he was on the job.he applied for,and received,a pension disability pension however,he was disappointed to learn that his benefits were not calculated using the pension rate in effect in,but rather using two different rates for novella two periods of service.the rate applicable in was applied to benefits for work performed between and,and the lower rate in effect in was applied to benefits for work performed between and.the use of the rate for the earlier period resulted in a lower aggregate monthly pension payment.
after unsuccessfully seeking administrative redress from the pension fund,novella filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of pensioners whose benefits also were allegedly miscalculated.he asserted that the fund was guilty of seven violations of the employee retirement income security act erisa and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.on for summary judgment,the district court agreed with novella that the defendants the pension fund and its trustees had erred in calculating his disability pension at two different rates.the court did not reach novella other claims.
novella then moved to certify a class action on behalf of either of two classes one including recipients of various types of pensions whose benefits were calculated using multiple rates,and the other limited to disability pensioners whose benefits were affected by the same practice.the district court concluded that in light of novella success on his individual claims,only the narrower class of disability pensioners was eligible for certification.the court determined that the statute of limitations for the absent class members claims did not accrue until each class member affirmatively challenged the defendants benefit calculation,and was rebuffed.the court found putative class members whose claims were timely and determined that this number met the numerosity requirement of rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.finding the other requirements of rule a and b to have been met,the court certified this narrower class of disability pensioners.
the parties then for summary judgment on the class claims,which motions the district court referred to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge recommended granting the plaintiff class motion on the merits and denying the defendants,the latter of which the magistrate judge characterized as an untimely motion for reconsideration of the decision certifying the class.the district court reviewed the magistrate judge recommendation,adopted it,and entered judgment in favor of the class.the court also awarded prejudgment interest at the fund assumed annual rate of return to both novella and the members of the plaintiff class.both parties appealed.
we agree with the district court that the defendants use of two rates in calculating disability pensions finds no support in the language of the fund controlling documents the summary plan description and the rules of the pension plan.we therefore affirm the district court judgment in novella favor on his individual claims.we also affirm its award of prejudgment interest to novella,and its setting of the rate and date of accrual for the award.however,we conclude that the district court erred in identifying the time at which a claim for miscalculation of benefits accrues.in light of our view that such a claim accrues when the pensioner knew or should have known that his benefits were miscalculated,we vacate the certification of the class,the judgment in favor of the class,and the award of prejudgment interest to the class members,and remand the case for further proceedings before the district court.these proceedings may include a inquiry into when each putative class member knew or had sufficient information so that he should have known that the defendants were using two different rates to calculate his pension.
background 
factual history 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.
the plaintiff,carlo novella,is a year old former carpenter.from through,he worked in westchester county,new york,and in new york city,and participated in both the defendant westchester county,new york carpenters pension fund the westchester fund or the fund which is administered by the defendant board of trustees of the fund and the new york city district council of carpenters pension plan.it is novella pension under the westchester fund which is an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of erisa,see a that is at issue in this appeal.novella pension benefits under the fund are determined by the pension fund rules the plan and summary plan description the spd,which have been in effect and unchanged since january.the plan creates six classes of benefits,four of which are allowances regular pension benefits,governed by sections of the plan early retirement pension benefits,governed by sections of the plan deferred pension benefits,dictated by sections of the plan and disability pension benefits,as set forth in sections of the plan see each participant is entitled to only one type of benefit,except that a disability pensioner who recovers from his disabling injury may be entitled to a different type of pension.id.at.
fund participants earn pension credits based on the number of hours they serve in jobs that are covered by the plan.a job constitutes covered employment if the employer is obligated by its collective bargaining agreement to contribute to the fund on behalf of the relevant plan participant.id.at.novella has had two periods of covered employment from through during which time he earned pension credits,and from to,during which time he earned an additional pension credits in the years between and,novella performed work in new york city,which was covered by the new york city a party to this action but he did not perform any work covered by the defendant westchester fund.
on march,novella,then years old,suffered a disabling accident while at work,for which he immediately began to receive workers compensation.he also applied to the fund for pension benefits.to calculate the amount of novella monthly pension,the defendants used two different rates they applied a rate of per credit to the pension credits novella earned between and,and a second rate of per credit for the credits he earned between and.
immediately after receiving notice in fall that his pension would be calculated using two different rates,novella asked the fund trustees for an explanation of his benefits.the defendants explained to him that the calculation was appropriate because of the break in his covered service from through,during which time he performed no work covered under the westchester plan.
the defendants denied novella repeated appeals from the rate calculation,referring novella to section of the westchester plan,which applies to deferred pensions by letter dated august,the defendants explained that under that section of the plan,
a deferred pension is calculated based on the rate in effect on the last day you worked in covered employment prior to the accumulation of three one year breaks in service since each of the years you were not working in covered employment was a break in service,the credits you had accumulated up to when you left covered employment under the plan were calculated at the rate.
section also provides that if any additional credits were earned after the break in service,the benefit amount for the additional credits shall be calculated on the rate that was in effect at the time of termination.the credits you earned after the break in service were calculated at the rate in effect when you terminated.
although novella was awarded a disability pension,not a deferred pension,the letter did not cite the sections of the plan governing disability pensions sections to.the letter also failed to cite section of the plan,entitled application to benefit increases,on which the defendants would later rely in this litigation.id.at.section provides that a fund participant is entitled to a pension in an amount to be determined under the terms of the plan and at the benefit level as in effect at the time the participant last separates from covered employment.id.under section,a plan p articipant shall be deemed to have last separated from covered employment on the last day of work which is followed by three consecutive calendar years of less than hours of covered employment in each year.id.
procedural history 
on march,having contested the calculation through the fund administrative review process and having failed to obtain relief,novella filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the defendant fund and its board of trustees,asserting violations of erisa,and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief he filed an amended complaint on october.his suit was brought on behalf of himself and a class of a ll others s imilarly s ituated.
the amended complaint asserted seven claims falling into two categories claims one and two challenged the defendants failure to accord novella credit for the workers compensation hours he received claims three through seven contested the defendants calculation of novella and the class members pensions using two different rates because of a break in service.as relevant to this appeal,claim six asserted that the defendants practice of applying section of the plan,which governs deferred pensions,to recipients of disability pensions violated the plan terms,and claim seven alleged that because the plan does not contain any provision describing the application of two benefit rates when a participant suffers a interruption in service,the defendants had violated erisa in calculating novella pension using two rates.id.at.
in early,before moving for class certification,novella moved for summary judgment on his individual claims.the defendants for the same.the district court michael mukasey,judge granted novella motion in part.the court dismissed as novella claims styled as claims one and two regarding the defendants refusal to credit him with hours of service,and therefore pension credits,during the time he received workers compensation benefits.novella westchester county,carpenters pension fund novella i,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,see id.at,dist.lexis,at.
with regard to novella challenge to the pension calculation claim six,the court concluded that the defendants had acted arbitrarily and by using two different rates to calculate novella pension because their decision was based on an interpretation of the westchester plan that is inconsistent with the plain words of that plan.id.at,dist.lexis,at.citing sections and of the plan,the court reasoned that the plan plainly provides that a participant who collects a disability pension should be entitled to the amount of a regular pension,which is calculated at one benefit rate,dist.lexis,at.the court rejected the defendants argument that they were entitled to rely on the provisions governing deferred pensions section because,at the time of his disability,novella was not eligible for a regular pension as a result of his break in service.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court concluded instead that n othing in the section of the plan describ ing the eligibility requirements for a disability pension states that a p lan participant must satisfy the eligibility requirements for a regular pension in order to collect a disability pension,dist.lexis,at.the court explained that section use of the word eligible in the phrase the regular pension amount for which the employee would have been eligible,refer red to a regular pension amount,rather than simply to a regular pension.id.emphasis in novella i quoting the plan.
the court also addressed the defendants theory,raised for the first time after commencement of this lawsuit,that section of the plan supported their decision to use two different rates because it authorizes p lan administrators to apply multiple benefit levels when calculating the pension of a p lan participant who has had a break in service.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court concluded that the defendants reliance on section was misplaced because that section does not reasonably allow for the interpretation urged by the defendants.id.in sum,the court rejected each of the defendants arguments,concluding that the defendants were not entitled under the terms of the plan to use two different rates to calculate novella disability pension.
having granted novella motion on the basis of his challenge to the calculation,the district court dismissed as moot novella other claims regarding the amount of his disability pension claims three,four,five,and seven,which were argued in the alternative,and were premised on the assumption that the terms of the plan support the defendants decision.id.at,dist.lexis,at.although the district court granted summary judgment to novella on the merits of claim six,it did not award final relief at that time.
following the district court decision in novella favor on his individual claims,novella moved for class certification under rules b and of the federal rules of civil procedure,seeking certification of a class to include recipients of various types of pensions calculated using two rates,or,in the alternative,a narrower class of disability pensioners injured by the same practice the district court first determined that the only class for which novella potentially could serve as class representative was the more limited class of disability pensioners affected by the defendants practice of applying section of the plan which pertains to deferred pensions and permits the use of multiple rates to disability pensions.novella westchester county,carpenters pension fund novella ii,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.turning to the requirements of rule a,the district court concluded that the commonality,typicality,and prongs were met,but that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine whether the numerosity prong was satisfied.id.at,dist.lexis,at.and,although the court had not yet decided whether novella could satisfy rule a,it concluded that,should the class be numerous enough to satisfy rule a,the class action could be maintained under rule b because r eformation of the defendants practice in calculating these disability pensions will result in pensions amounts being due to all these class members that is,relief.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
on august,after conducting the evidentiary hearing,the district court certified the class of disability pension recipients.see novella westchester county,carpenters pension fund novella iii,d.the court concluded that the proposed class of disability pensioners whose pensions were calculated using more than one rate due to a break in service met the numerosity requirement of rule a id.at.the court determination turned on its view of the event necessary to start the running of the statute of limitations for an erisa claim.the defendants had argued that the statute of limitations applicable to each class member claim accrued as soon as the putative class member pension was calculated,and that only eight of the pensioners had begun receiving pensions within six years before novella filed his complaint.id.novella asserted to the contrary that the court should adopt a approach to the statute of limitations,under which each month pension check would begin a new limitations period.id.at.the district court chose a third alternative,concluding that 
t he relevant date for fixing the accrual of the putative class members claim s is when a plaintiff was put on notice that the defendants believed the method used to calculate his disability pension was correct.thus,the claim does not begin to run until a prospective class member inquires about the calculation of his benefits and the plan rejects his claim that the benefits were miscalculated.
id.emphasis added.
applying this rule,the court found novella claim timely.id.with regard to the other putative class members,the court determined that,b ecause the defendants ha d presented no evidence that they confirmed the correctness of the benefits calculation s more than six years before the filing of this lawsuit,th e court could not find that the statute of limitations ha d run on the claims of any of the proposed class members.id.at.the court therefore concluded that the class consisted of disability pensioners with timely claims and therefore was sufficiently large to satisfy rule,and certified it.see id.at.
after the class was certified,both parties again moved for summary judgment,this time to resolve the claims.the district court barbara jones,referred the motions to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.on september,magistrate judge james francis iv issued a report recommendation the r r recommending that the district court grant the plaintiff motion and deny the defendants.see novella westchester county,carpenters pension fund novella iv,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the r r first addressed the defendants motion,in which the defendants renew ed their argument that fifteen of the pensioners claims are.id.at,dist.lexis,at.as a preliminary matter,the magistrate judge construed the motion for summary judgment as an untimely application for reconsideration of the district court ruling in novella iii determining the accrual of the statute of limitations and certifying the class.id.the magistrate judge further concluded that e ven if the defendants motion were timely,there is no basis for reconsideration,dist.lexis,at,because t he law of the case doctrine requires a court to adhere to its own decision at an earlier stage of the litigation absent cogent or compelling reasons not to,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks omitted,and the defendants had not shown that they would suffer any injustice if the court adhered to judge mukasey prior decisions,id.at,dist.lexis,at.the magistrate judge rejected the defendants argument that novella iii would wreak havoc on taft hartley funds,such as the defendant fund,which rely on actuarial soundness for their very continued existence.id.quoting defs.mem.of law in support of summ.finally,the magistrate judge refused to credit the defendants contention that the class members claims were not tolled by the filing of novella suit because,based on the holding of novella iii,their individual claims never accrued in the first instance.id.at,dist.lexis,at quoting defs.mem.of law in support of summ.in the magistrate judge view,the absent class members claims accrued once novella filed his complaint challenging the fund practice of applying two benefit rates,dist.lexis,at.
the magistrate judge then turned to novella motion for summary judgment on behalf of the class,agreeing with novella that the defendants argument denying liability for the class members claims was based exclusively on the theory of accrual that judge mukasey previously rejected.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the magistrate judge therefore recommended granting summary judgment to the class on the issue of liability with respect to the entire plaintiff class.id.with regard to novella request for prejudgment interest for himself and for the class members,the magistrate judge decided that such an award was appropriate.id.at,dist.lexis,at.analogizing novella and the class claims to those based upon latent injuries,he set the interest accrual date,for novella,as the date that the fund denied his claim,id.at,dist.lexis,at,and,for the absent class members,as the date of the filing of the complaint,id.lastly,the magistrate judge recommended setting the interest rate at the fund assumed return of seven and percent,which the magistrate judge found to be more equitable than either new york statutory rate of percent or the federal rate.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
over both parties objections and on de novo review,see.b,the district court barbara jones,judge adopted the r r in its entirety.see novella westchester county,carpenters pension fund novella v,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the parties each appeal the defendants appeal from the summary judgment in favor of novella individually,from the certification of the class,from the summary judgment in favor of the class,and from the awards of prejudgment interest to novella and the class members.novella challenges the district court refusal to certify a broader class and its decision to award prejudgment interest to the class members only from the date that the complaint was filed.

here,the district court did not decide which of the two standards of review should apply,because it concluded that the defendants interpretation of the plan could not be sustained under either standard.however,in their briefing to this court,the parties appear to agree that the standard applies in this case.see br.hereinafter appellants br.br,hereinafter appellee br.we therefore address the defendants interpretation of the plan only under that deferential standard,although,like the district court,we think that the outcome under the other,less deferential option de novo review would be no different.
b.the merits 
the question before us is whether the defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously in interpreting the plan to permit them to calculate disability pensions using two different rates if the pensioner had a break in service.the district court held that doing so was arbitrary and capricious because n othing in the provisions of the plan provides that a disability pension may be calculated using two different benefit rates when a participant has had a break in service.novella i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we agree.
disability pensions are governed by section of the plan,which provides in relevant part that t he disability pension amount shall be equal to the regular pension amount for which the employee would have been eligible if he had been age when he became disabled if the participant had or more units of credit at the time of his disability.section sets forth the means of calculating the regular pension amount.it authorizes calculation of that amount by reference to the number of credits a pensioner earned during the period during which the employer is obligated to contribute to the fund on behalf of the pensioner.see id.at.the defendants offer four arguments in support of their contentions that this plan language permits a benefit calculation for recipients of disability pensions,and that the district court erred in concluding to the contrary.
first,the defendants assert that the trustees awarded novella the full benefit amount to which he was entitled because,although novella was only years old at the time of his disability,they treated him as if he were years old when he became disabled as required by section,the plan section governing disability pensions.they did not apply the reduction that would otherwise have been permissible under section,which is entitled early retirement pension amount.id.at.the defendants contend that they therefore complied with section requirements.
although it is correct that,had novella received an early retirement pension,the pension amount would have been reduced to reflect his age,the argument is irrelevant.throughout this lengthy dispute,novella has never contended that his pension was reduced because of his age at retirement,nor has any party argued that he should have been awarded an early retirement pension instead of a disability pension.novella grievance,and these judicial proceedings,have focused entirely on whether the defendants use of two different rates to calculate novella disability pension was improper.
second,under section of the plan,to qualify for a regular pension,a pensioner employment and consequently,employer contributions on his behalf must have been more or less continuous to his retirement date.id.at.the plan provisions explain that,in this context,more or less continuous means that there must be no period of three or more consecutive years without his performing at least a small,specified,amount of covered work.id.the defendants argue that because novella employment was not more or less continuous to his retirement date,novella was not eligible for the single accrual rate regular pension.appellants br.
the defendants may be correct that novella is ineligible for a regular pension,but any such eligibility is not material to this dispute in light of the fact that he was awarded a disability pension.we agree with the district court that nothing in the plan provisions governing disability pensions requires that a disability pensioner actually be eligible for another type of pension as a prerequisite to receipt of his disability pension.see novella i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.section reference to the regular pension amount for which novella would have been eligible if he had been age when he became disabled,emphases added,establishes not an eligibility requirement for a disability pension but a reference point for determining the proper amount of such a pension.
moreover,were we to endorse a reading of the plan requiring a disability pension recipient also to be eligible for a regular pension,we would render the plan inclusion of a disability pension meaningless,inasmuch as any person who qualified for a disability pension would also be eligible for a regular pension.it would appear likely that the plan drafters established both disability pensions and regular assigned different eligibility requirements to they contemplated that plan participants might become disabled before they become eligible for a regular pension,and did not want to bar such participants from receiving pension benefits.
third,the defendants contend that because novella did not meet the eligibility requirements for a regular pension due to his failure to perform covered work from to,his pension benefit amount was calculated pursuant to the only other methodology,section,which governs deferred pensions for calculating a pension where there was a break in service.appellants br.section states that when a pensioner has a break in service that lasts at least three years,his pension shall be calculated using two rates compensation for all credits earned before the break in service is based on the benefit level that was in effect on the last day the pensioner w orked prior to the break,while the benefit amount for any additional units of credit earned after a break in service is based on the benefit level in effect when the additional units were earned.the defendants argue that because novella break in covered employment spanned more than three years,they are permitted to us e two separate benefit accrual rates.appellant br.
the defendants argument is fatally flawed.the quoted section,section,explicitly applies to deferred pensions however,novella was awarded a disability pension,not a deferred pension.nothing in the plan permits the defendants to apply a section controlling one specific type of pension to a pension of a different kind.in other words,the fact that the disability pension provisions do not include language permitting a calculation does not entitle the defendants to search for authorization to do so elsewhere in the plan.indeed following both the presumption of consistent usage and meaningful variation,and the textual canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,see cordiano metacon gun club,cir the presence of that provision applicable to one type of pension makes clear that the omission of that provision in the part of the plan governing another type of plan was deliberate.to permit the defendants to pick and choose language from disparate sections of the plan would subvert the intention of the plan drafters and the reasonable expectations of plan participants.
finally,the defendants argue that section,which is entitled application to benefit increases,justifies a method for calculating disability pensions.that section provides the pension to which a participant is entitled shall be determined under the terms of the plan and the benefit level as in effect at the time the participant last separates from covered employment.id.the plan defines a last separat ion from covered employment as the last day of covered work which is followed by three consecutive calendar years of less than hours of covered employment in each year.id.the defendants argue that a person can last separate from employment more than once,and that novella did so in and again in,thus permitting the defendants to calculate a pension using multiple benefit levels.
it is apparent from the record,however,that the defendants did not use section to calculate novella pension in the first instance.as the district court noted,the defendants identified this section as justification for their calculation of novella pension for the first time in litigation.novella i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.they did not cite this section of the plan in their letters to novella explaining the calculation of his benefits.see letters between novella and the fund.nor did they indicate to novella at any point during his administrative appeals that their calculation relied in any way on section.to permit them to assert this newly coined rationale in litigation despite their failure to rely upon it during the internal fund proceedings that preceded this lawsuit would subvert some of the chief purposes of erisa exhaustion to uphold congress s desire that erisa trustees be responsible for their actions,not the federal courts,and to provide a sufficiently clear record of administrative action should litigation ensue.paese hartford life accident ins,cir quoting kennedy empire blue cross blue shield,cir.it would also clearly be inequitable.see id.at equitably estopping the defendant from arguing that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust an issue because a letter from the defendant had misled the plaintiff into thinking that he had no other administrative remedies to pursue 
because we agree with the district court determination that the defendants calculation of novella disability pension was arbitrary and capricious,we affirm its entry of summary judgment in favor of novella individually.however,for the reasons discussed below,we nonetheless decline to affirm the summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff class.
ii.statute of limitations and class certification 
standards of review 
we review the question of the application of the relevant statute of limitations as we do all questions of law de novo.united states domino sugar,cir.however,a district court certification of a class under rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion,provided that the court applied the proper legal standard.brown kelly,cir.this standard applies both to the district court ultimate decision on class certification and to its rulings as to the individual rule requirements.id.
b.the merits 
accrual of the statute of limitations.the federal rules of civil procedure permit maintenance of a class action only if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a.this numerosity requirement does not mandate that joinder of all parties be that the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class make use of the class action appropriate.cent.states se.sw.areas health welfare fund merck medco managed care,cir.determination of practicability depends on all the circumstances surrounding a case,not on mere numbers.robidoux celani,cir.nonetheless,several district courts in our circuit have suggested that courts are likely to conclude that the numerosity requirement is satisfied when the class comprises or more members and unlikely to be satisfied when the class comprises or fewer.ansari.
in this case,the question of whether the certified class was sufficiently large to satisfy rule hinges on whether the statute of limitations for each class member claim began to run upon receipt of his first pension payment,as the defendants contend,or upon a class member first inquiry to the fund regarding the amount of his benefits and the fund rejection of his request that his pension be calculated using one rate,as the district court concluded and as novella urges on appeal.
the parties agree that a statute of limitations governs erisa claims and that t he relevant date for fixing the accrual of a miscalculation claim is when a plaintiff was put on notice that the defendants believed the method used to calculate his disability pension was correct.appellants br.brackets omitted quoting novella iii,d at see also id.at the fund agrees with the sentence quoted above.it makes perfect sense for a claim to accrue when the participant is put on notice that the fund believed the method used to calculate his disability pension was correct.appellees br.asserting that federal courts generally apply a discovery rule for the purposes of triggering the statute of limitations on an erisa benefit claim.the parties dispute,however,the time at which a pensioner can be considered to have been put on such notice.the issue is undecided in this circuit 
the defendants urge us to reject the district court determination that the statute of limitations on a class member claim does not begin to run until a prospective class member inquires about the calculation of his benefits and the plan rejects his claim that the benefits were miscalculated,novella iii,d at,and the court consequent finding that the existence of class members whose claims were therefore timely meant that the class was numerous enough to meet the requirement of rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.they argue that we should instead adopt a strict approach under which the statute of limitations for a miscalculation claim would begin to run when the pensioner receives his first check.
in support,the defendants point to miller fortis benefits insurance,cir,in which the third circuit concluded that the statute of limitations on a claim that benefits have been miscalculated starts to run when the calculation or repudiation is both clear and made known to the beneficiary.id.at.the miller court observed that this ordinarily will be when the beneficiary first receives his miscalculated benefit award because a t that point,the beneficiary should be aware that he has been underpaid and that his right to a greater award has been repudiated.id.the court explicitly reject ed the rule proposed by the plaintiff in that case,which would have required a formal denial of benefits to trigger the statute of limitations.id.at.the court did,however,require that a fund repudiation of the benefits be clear and be made known to the beneficiary in order for the limitations period to begin running.id.at emphasis in original.the court explained that it consider ed the clear repudiation concept to be useful,as it represents a refinement of the federal discovery rule in the context of erisa claims for benefits.id.at.the defendants rely on miller to support their contention that the third circuit has adopted a strict test for the accrual of the statute of limitations in erisa miscalculation claims,and argue that we should follow suit.
some other courts,however,including the district court in this case,have required that an erisa fund provide a formal denial of a plaintiff application for the adjustment of benefits to trigger the running of the statute of limitations.in miele pension plan of new york state teamsters conference pension retirement fund,d,for example,the court considered the argument that a miscalculation claim accrues on the date that a plaintiff is clearly and unequivocally informed of the amount of his benefit.id.at.the court noted the logic and appeal of such a rule,which would be easily enforced and would correspond directly to the rule that a clear and unequivocal denial of benefits commences the statute of limitations period.id.emphasis added.but,mindful of the fact that a miscalculation generally involves an award of benefits rather than a denial of benefits and thus is less likely to put a plaintiff on notice of a possible claim,the miele court applied the rule adopted by the district court here that a miscalculation claim does not accrue until a plaintiff inquires about the amount of benefits and is told that those benefits were correctly computed.id.brackets and ellipses omitted quoting kiefer ceridian.
still other courts have applied a theory to the accrual of a claim in similar circumstances.see meagher int l ass of machinists aerospace workers pension plan,cir.under this theory,each payment based upon an alleged miscalculation constitutes a fresh breach by the defendants of their duty to administer the pension plan in accordance with erisa,gives rise to a separate cause of action,and starts the running of a new limitations period for each cause of action.id.at.many courts have,however,expressly rejected this approach.see,miller,at collecting third circuit cases declining to apply a approach to claim accrual edes.verizon commc ns,cir rejecting a theory where the wrongful conduct was the defendant single misclassification of plaintiffs as employees pisciotta teledyne,cir although the plaintiffs now contend that each and every time that they were entitled to a reimbursement payment it constituted a new and separate breach of erisa,the applicable fouryear statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury that is the basis of the action.phillips alaska hotel rest.emps.pension fund,cir declining to apply a approach,cert.denied.
we do not adopt the theory.we think that approach is appropriate in erisa cases,as elsewhere,only where separate violations of the same type,or character,are repeated over time.head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau county,d.usually,t hese cases are marked by repeated,of the same character,by the fiduciaries.id.but it is not as clear a fit in cases where,as here,the plaintiff claims are based on a single decision that results in lasting negative effects.id.at see also schultz texaco,d,t he mere fact that the effects of a single,wrongful act continue to be felt over a period of time does not render that single,wrongful act a single continuing violation.miele,d at rejecting application of the theory of accrual because a pension fund has no obligation to continually reassess claim denials or benefit underpayments on a monthly basis.
we also decline,however,to accept either of the approaches urged by the parties.the defendants approach is too harsh in that it places the burden on the pensioner a party less likely to have a clear understanding of the terms of the pension plan and their application to his case to confirm the correctness of his pension award immediately upon the first payment of benefits,regardless of the complexity of the calculations,or of the adequacy of the defendants explanation of the basis for the calculation.indeed,this case illustrates the hazards of the defendants approach.the spd the document provided to all plan participants,including novella and the plaintiff class,to explain the rules of the pension silent on the underlying issue of multiple benefit calculation rates for disability pensions.and,unlike the simple percentage calculation at issue in miller,see miller,at young verizon bell atl.cash balance plan,cir finding a claim timely because the payment the plaintiff received more than six years before was not so inconsistent with her current claim for additional benefits as to serve as a clear repudiation,cert.denied,the determination of a disability pension award under the defendants plan may have required more than a simple multiplication of two static numbers 
the district court and novella approach in which a limitations period does not begin to run until a prospective class member inquires about the calculation of his benefits and the plan rejects his claim,novella iii,d at also poses problems.under that approach,a pensioner could collect benefit checks for twenty or thirty years without any obligation to inquire as to the correctness of the calculations underlying the benefit payments and could still thereafter assert a timely claim for miscalculation.indeed,as the defendants point out,at least one class member is long dead.see appellants br.allowing that class member survivors to pursue his claim,the defendants say,despite the fact that he collected his benefits for years before passing away,would undermine the purpose of a statute of limitations.see,order of telegraphers ry.express agency,statutes of limitation in their conclusive effects are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared.carey int l of workers local pension plan,cir statutes of limitation serve several important policies,including rapid resolution of disputes,repose for those against whom a claim could be brought,and avoidance of litigation involving lost evidence or distorted testimony of witnesses.to the extent that the defendants could show that the deceased class member or his survivors had information available to them by which they reasonably could have discovered the alleged miscalculation,the district court might well agree with the defendants that permitting his survivors to assert a claim more than six years after receiving such information would be inequitable.
having rejected each party views,we choose a third approach we conclude that notice of a miscalculation can be imputed to a pensioner and the statute of limitations will start to run when there is enough information available to the pensioner to assure that he knows or reasonably should know of the miscalculation.we think this approach best balances a pension plan legitimate interest in predictability and finality with a pensioner equally legitimate interest in having a fair opportunity to challenge a miscalculation of benefits once it becomes known or should have become him.stated another way,this reasonableness inquiry mitigates some of the harshness of the defendants proffered approach,while better respecting the defendants interests in finality and repose than the district court and novella chosen method 
we think this method is consistent with the third circuit reasoning in miller,which we read to endorse not a strict theory such as that urged by the defendants but rather a similar reasonableness approach.indeed,in miller,the third circuit appeared to contemplate that its clear repudiation rule would vary in its application to the facts of any individual case.see miller,at rejecting the plaintiff proposed application of the clear repudiation rule,which would have required an explicit demand and refusal,and concluding that a court should ask when a beneficiary knows or should know he has a cause of action emphasis added see also fletcher comcast comprehensive health and welfare plan,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,noting that miller does not stand for the proposition that every erroneously calculated benefit award automatically serves as a clear repudiation,and holding that a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that communications between the plan and the plaintiff beneficiary did not suffice to alert plaintiff that his benefits were being repudiated.
turning to the present case in light of the standard we adopt,on the factual record before us,we are unable to determine whether,and if so when,each class member had information by which he knew or should have known of the miscalculation.we note that,based on the foregoing discussion,simply receiving a lower pension payment is not enough to put a pensioner on notice of a miscalculation.conversely,actual notice to a pensioner that a double rate method was used would put him on notice.similarly,informing a pensioner of the correct calculation,so that any difference between the putative calculation and the actual amount of the check would be obvious,is also probably enough.however,we can not yet tell how many of the class members claims are timely.we therefore can not,at this stage of the proceedings,confirm the district court conclusion that the class is sufficiently large to satisfy rule a numerosity requirement.
we therefore vacate the class certification and remand to the district court for further factfinding regarding when each plaintiff class member knew or should have known that the fund had miscalculated his disability pension payments,and for consideration of whether there are enough class members with timely claims to merit certification.we therefore also vacate the summary judgment in favor of the class.
finally on this score,we note that the approach we adopt may in some cases require a,inquiry to determine when a pensioner knew or reasonably should have known that his benefits were miscalculated.and this inquiry into each pensioner accrual date may in turn lessen the value,and indeed the availability,of class actions in this kind of litigation.however,that sort of problem is not unique to this context.see,avila willits envt l remediation trust,cir.concluding that material issues of fact precluded summary judgment regarding whether certain class members in class action knew or should have known of their injuries,cert.denied,wl,lexis,in re brooklyn navy yard asbestos,cir differentiating between joint trials which are not questioned by plaintiffs or defendants in mass tort cases from the issue of the propriety of class actions in such cases.
moreover,the nature of our reasonableness approach could make it difficult for a potential class representative to meet the typicality requirement of.a.but the case law on the effect of an individualized evaluation on a proposed class ability to meet the typicality requirement,if any,is sparse,see chiang veneman.cir ruppert alliant energy cash balance pension plan,and we decline to address whether that requirement is satisfied on the record before us.we note,however,the rule that a plaintiff must satisfy all of the requirements of rule,by a preponderance of the evidence,to obtain class certification,see teamsters local freight div.pension fund bombardier,cir in re initial pub.offerings sec,cir,including the numerosity and typicality requirements of rule a,see marisol giuliani,cir citing comer cisneros,cir.
novella cross appeal.we find no merit in novella contention,asserted in his,that the certified class was too narrow inasmuch as the district court should not have limited it to persons receiving disability pensions.
novella amended complaint asserted claims relating both to the calculation for disability pensioners and to the plan accrued benefit provisions.see.the district court granted summary judgment to novella on his individual disability pension claims and did not reach the other accrued benefit claims,but rather dismissed them as moot in light of the fact that the other claims would entitle novella to no further relief.when novella su
