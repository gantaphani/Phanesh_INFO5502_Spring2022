background 
we present the procedural history of this litigation in some detail,as it supports the district court refusal to grant relief from judgment.
on november,plaintiffs filed this medical malpractice claim in bayamón superior court,a puerto rico court of first instance.josé méndez,of the law firm of méndez méndez,was counsel of record.the firm address was listed with the court as tropical,muñoz rivera,guaynabo,puerto rico.on july,josé méndez filed an informative motion in the puerto rico court noting changes to the firm street and mailing addresses on november,susana schwartz removed the case to federal district court pursuant to a,d,and the notice of removal was served to josé méndez at his former address,tropical.
although the case had been removed to federal court and dismissed from the puerto rico courts,josé méndez filed a second informative motion in bayamón superior court on january,noting another change in the mailing address of méndez méndez,to box,san juan,puerto rico.counsel for defendants were also served with notice of the new address.on january,the bayamón superior court issued a notice of judgment to the correct box address,informing josé méndez that judgment had issued,and the case dismissed from the bayamón court,as of december.the december,dismissal order clearly stated that the case was dismissed under,the federal removal statute.as appellants concede that josé méndez received the notice of judgment from the bayamón superior court on january,he was on notice as of that date that the case had been dismissed from the puerto rico courts because it had been removed to federal district court.
also on january,the united states was substituted as defendant for schwartz pursuant to.notice of this substitution was sent by mail to josé méndez at his former address,tropical.on february,the united states submitted a responsive pleading,which was again sent to the incorrect tropical address.on february and february,the united states sent interrogatories and filed a request for the production of documents,again to the wrong address.there is no evidence,for the most part,that these documents ever arrived at méndez méndez 
because josé méndez was not admitted to practice before the federal court,at some point in january or february of,he contacted attorney enrique mendoza about the possibility of referring the case.the record shows only that mendoza solicited research on a relevant legal issue from a third attorney on february,mendoza faxed the results of this research to josé méndez.there is no evidence in the record that mendoza accepted the referral,and no motion was filed informing the district court of a change of counsel.josé méndez also did not inform the district court at this point that he was not admitted to the federal bar.
on april,josé méndez died suddenly and unexpectedly.upon his death,roberto méndez assumed responsibility for all of his current cases.roberto méndez was also not admitted to practice before the federal court.
on june,the district court issued a scheduling order providing that the pleadings be finalized by july,that discovery be completed by october,and that any dispositive motion be filed prior to november.a pretrial conference was scheduled for december.it is unclear from the record whether the order was sent to méndez méndez at the tropical address or at the correct box address 
on october,the united states filed a motion requesting dismissal for want of prosecution,noting that its interrogatories and requests for document production,propounded in february of,had gone unanswered,and that the time for discovery set forth in the scheduling order had elapsed.this motion was later joined by escuela de medicina.both motions were noticed to the josé méndez at his tropical address.counsel for escuela de medicina also submitted an affidavit stating that he had left more than a dozen phone messages for roberto méndez both upon the june receipt of the scheduling order and in the days prior to the december conference that had gone unreturned.on december,the motion for dismissal was granted.judgment was entered as of december.
between josé méndez death on april,and december,roberto méndez took no action regarding this case.on december,he forwarded a complaint to mendoza.the same day,mendoza responded that he really had no interest in participating in this case.on december,a day after the district court had entered judgment,roberto méndez asked the court for a thirty day extension in order to find new representation for plaintiffs.in his request,méndez claimed that until receiving mendoza december fax disclaiming any responsibility for the litigation,it had been his understanding that mendoza had assumed representation prior to josé méndez death.
new counsel for plaintiffs sought relief from judgment on this basis in a rule b motion filed january.the district court denied the motion in an opinion and order dated march.in particular,the court noted that i roberto méndez had inexplicably failed to notify the district court of the death of josé méndez ii instead of making the incorrect assumption that enrique mendoza had assumed responsibility for the case,roberto méndez should have assured himself of this fact iii the multiple messages left by defendants with the secretary at méndez méndez should have alerted roberto méndez to the imminent expiration of the time for discovery iv although the rule b petition focused on the incorrect address used by defendants and perhaps the court,at no point did appellants counsel affirmatively state that méndez méndez had failed to receive the relevant motions and notices at the firm new address and v josé méndez should have filed a change of address form with the federal court after receiving notice of removal.a subsequent request for reconsideration was denied on may.this appeal followed.
discussion 
federal rule of civil procedure b allows the court to relieve a party from a final judgment for mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.as motions brought under rule b are committed to the court sound discretion,we review here only to determine if the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant appellants motion.torre continental ins,cir.although many courts have indicated that rule b motions should be granted liberally this circuit has taken a harsher tack.because rule b is a vehicle for extraordinary relief,motions invoking the rule should be granted only under exceptional circumstances.id.quoting lepore vidockler,cir.the rule must be applied so as to recognize the desirability of deciding disputes on their merits,while also considering the importance of finality as applied to court judgments.teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union,local superline transp,cir.although these authorities must now be read with the gloss supplied by the supreme court in pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d,they still remain instructive 
appellants argue that josé méndez death,roberto méndez belief that the case had been transferred to enrique mendoza,and the fact that many of the motions and notices were sent to the incorrect address make their failure to prosecute excusable neglect.our evaluation of what constitutes excusable neglect is an equitable determination,taking into account the entire facts and circumstances surrounding the party omission,including factors such as the danger of prejudice to the,the length of the delay,the reason for the delay,and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.at.after considering the facts at issue here,we conclude that the neglect by josé méndez before his death and by roberto méndez fairly be termed inexcusable,and therefore that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the rule b motion.see,cir changes in counsel do not relieve litigant from liability for previous counsel inexcusable neglect.
first,before his death,josé méndez inexcusably failed to communicate with the federal district court,or keep the court appraised of the status of the case.he had,since at least january,been on notice that the case had been removed from the puerto rico courts to the federal district court.at no point after that date did méndez inform the court that he was not admitted to federal practice.although he was aware that his second change of address,to box,had been filed with the bayamón court after that court had dismissed the case,he failed to inform the federal court of his new address.josé méndez also failed to respond to interrogatories and discovery requests sent in february of although it is possible that he never received these requests,or did not receive them in a timely fashion,due to the incorrect address used by defendants.
in short,between the time he received notice of the removal of this case in january and his death in april,josé méndez did virtually nothing to indicate his active prosecution of the case,other than contact mendoza about the possibility of referral.an attorney has a duty of diligence to inquire about the status of a case.pryor united states postal,cir.moreover,it is an attorney responsibility to alert the court as to scheduling conflicts,and to explain absences or failures to appear in a timely fashion.kagan caterpillar tractor,cir.the failure to do so need not be excused under rule b.torre,at litigant failure to take simple step of alerting court to ongoing negotiations and request postponement of imminent deadlines was inexcusable neglect.
appellants make little or no attempt to explain the neglect on the part of josé méndez,other than noting that he was not notified of the removal to federal district court until approximately two months after it was filed,and that defendants sent notices to the wrong address.these two facts do not automatically excuse his inexplicable refusal to conduct ordinary communication with the federal court.certainly,the correspondence between josé méndez and enrique mendoza,dated february,makes it evident that josé méndez was by february fully aware that the case had been removed to federal court,and that he had received at least the january,notice originally sent to the incorrect address that the united states had substituted as a party 
second,roberto méndez incorrect assumption that enrique mendoza had assumed responsibility for the representation was inexcusable negligence.we sympathize with the fact that josé méndez death was an undoubtedly disruptive event at méndez méndez as well a difficult personal loss for roberto méndez.however,a lawyer duty of diligence transcends both upheaval at work and personal tragedy.see pioneer,at.in assessing the culpability of respondents counsel,we give little weight to the fact that counsel was experiencing upheaval in his law practice at the time of the bar date.miranda am.airlines,personal problems of counsel do not constitute excusable neglect.again,an attorney has an ongoing responsibility to inquire into the status of a case.pryor,at.roberto méndez was not relieved of this responsibility because the case came to him after his brother untimely death if anything,his lack of familiarity with the litigation indicated a greater duty to ensure no deadlines were missed.finally,having examined the record,we note that méndez claimed assumption was not a particularly reasonable one the fact that mendoza had relayed a memorandum of law to josé méndez suggests that méndez méndez still bore some responsibility for the litigation the case file remained at the firm there was no documentation of a change in counsel and there was no record that josé méndez had informed the district court of any change in representation.
appellants reliance on the incorrect address used by defendants and perhaps by the district court is unavailing for several reasons.first,as we explained above,josé méndez failure to communicate with the district court or alert defendants that they were using the incorrect address is at least partly to blame for defendants continued use of tropical.second,appellants do not challenge the representation that defendants had made over a dozen phone calls to roberto méndez office regarding the failure to respond to discovery.méndez admitted that he returned only one phone call because it was difficult for him to return phone calls during business hours.third,as the district court noted,dávila alvarez,civ.jaf,at,appellants assertion that méndez méndez did not receive notices in a timely manner if at all is not entirely credible.the record supports the inference that josé méndez received at least the united states motion to substitute as a defendant.furthermore,at no point has any lawyer associated with méndez méndez stated in an affidavit that the firm never received the relevant documents.although appellants claim,truthfully,that there is no evidence in the record that the documents were received,if any such evidence existed,it would be in the care of méndez méndez.
even if méndez méndez never received many of the relevant motions or notices from either defendants or the district court,we think the facts in this case support the district court holding.first,the record compels the conclusion that josé méndez was on notice of the removal of the case to federal court by january.second,once so informed,the confusion as to the correct firm address did not relieve either méndez brother of his responsibility to inform the district court of the correct address and the fact that he was not admitted to the federal bar.upon his brother death,roberto méndez had a duty to make appropriate inquiries as to the status of the case,either by ensuring that replacement representation was in place or by finding such representation.and at the very least,roberto méndez should have returned the phone calls of opposing counsel.in short,josé méndez failed to undertake ordinary matters of diligent representation and roberto méndez ignored the case for almost eight months based on an incorrect and unreasonable assumption such overt neglect is hardly excusable even if a lawyer is preoccupied with other matters.torre,at piñero schroeder fed.mortgage ass n,cir attorneys must organize their work so as to meet the time requirements of the matters they are handling.
the other equitable factors do not point in appellants favor.this is not a case where a litigant missed deadlines by hours or days.denman shubow,cir counsel overslept and missed trial,but acted promptly to remedy the situation.roberto méndez missed every discovery deadline and ignored the existence of a conference.furthermore,almost eight months passed between josé méndez death and roberto méndez attempts to remedy the situation.finally,roberto méndez failure to perform simple acts of courtesy such as returning opposing counsel phone calls in a timely fashion calls his good faith seriously into question.
appellants make a final plea that to dismiss the case based on counsel inexcusable conduct would work an unjust penalty on the litigants.the supreme court has clearly disavowed such an argument 
there is certainly no merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioner claim because of his counsel unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client.petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action,and he can not now
