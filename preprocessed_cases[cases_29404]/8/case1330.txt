in this case,the district court found that aries arditi claims against lighthouse international lighthouse were preempted by the employee retirement income security act erisa because they arose under lighthouse pension plan the plan and not separately and independently out of arditi written employment agreement the agreement.the district court denied arditi motion to remand the case to state court,holding that arditi claims were preempted by erisa and that his suit was therefore properly removed to federal court.the district court then dismissed the action for failure to state a claim because arditi had not stated any basis for challenging lighthouse authority to amend the plan.
on appeal,arditi argues that the additional benefits he seeks are based on a promise separate and independent from the plan.we disagree.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of arditi motion to remand the case to state court and dismissal of the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
statement of the case 
the following facts are undisputed.
from to,arditi was employed by lighthouse as a vision scientist.during this time,under the plan,arditi accrued years of service credit.
in,arditi left lighthouse,accepting employment elsewhere.after his departure,lighthouse amended the plan,adding a rule of,which entitled any qualified employee to retire and collect her pension benefits before the age of if the sum of the employee age and years of vested service were equal to or greater than the plan also reserved lighthouse right to amend the plan,stating lighthouse reserves the right at any time,by action of the board,to modify or amend the plan in whole or in part.barr,ex.b.
on july,arditi returned to lighthouse,in part to take advantage of the rule of amendment.the agreement,which was dated june,and signed by both parties,read as follows 
with respect to the plan,in which you are already fully vested,your new employment here will result in reinstatement as a plan member.you now have credited service for purposes of pension calculation of years of previous service and the amount of time you work here in the future will be added.
our retirement plan has now added a rule of provision that provides an unreduced benefit to employees whose age plus years equal or more.as you are now age,your age plus your years of service is approximately years.assuming you continue to work at the lighthouse for another eight years,your age then,and years of service then,would equal.at that time if you opt to retire you will receive an unreduced pension benefit.

on may,lighthouse notified plan members,including arditi,that the plan would be frozen.indeed,on june,before arditi age and years of service reached a total of,the plan was frozen.the freeze stopped the accrual of service time for all plan members.
on march,arditi retired.because of the freeze,lighthouse did not credit arditi for nearly three years of service from july,the date lighthouse froze the plan to march,the date arditi retired.
proceedings below 
on september,arditi filed a lawsuit against lighthouse in state court,seeking a declaratory judgment and asserting two causes of action for breach of contract.the complaint expressly referred to the plan and sought benefits under the plan.lighthouse removed the action to federal court.arditi promptly and voluntarily discontinued the action.

motion to remand 
applicable.removal 
a ny civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant to federal court.a.district courts have original jurisdiction over federal question cases,or cases arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.to determine if a case involves a federal question,courts generally turn to the complaint rule that is,courts examine what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses that the defendant may interpose.aetna health davila,quoting taylor anderson,internal quotation marks omitted.
federal preemption provides one exception to the complaint rule.see id.when a federal statute wholly displaces the cause of action through complete,the state claim can be removed to federal court.id.quoting beneficial nat.bank anderson,internal quotation marks omitted.erisa is one of these statutes.id.at.this is so because when the federal statute completely the cause of action,even if pleaded in terms of state law,it is in reality based on federal law.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.this exception also prevents plaintiffs from avoid ing removal to federal court by declining to plead necessary federal questions.romano kazacos,cir quoting rivet regions bank,internal quotation marks omitted.
erisa preemption 
congress enacted erisa to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by setting out substantive regulatory requirements for employee benefit plans and to provid e for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.davila,at quoting b.section a b of erisa provides participants or beneficiaries with a civil remedy to recover benefits due under their plans,to enforce rights under their plans,or to clarify rights to future benefits under their plans.erisa a b,a.
to establish a uniform regulatory regime over employee benefit plans,and to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation is exclusively a federal concern,erisa includes expansive provisions.davila,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see erisa.erisa provides that it shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.erisa.
under the supreme court test in davila,erisa preempts a cause of action where an individual,at some point in time,could have brought his or her claim under erisa a b and no other independent legal duty is implicated by a defendant actions.davila,at see montefiore med.ctr.teamsters local,cir applying the davila conjunctive test.to avoid potential confusion under the first prong of davila,this court has further clarified that the plaintiff must show that a he is the type of party who can bring a claim pursuant to a b of erisa and b the actual claim asserted can be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to a b.montefiore,at.
application 
erisa preemption 
first,in this case,davila first prong is satisfied because arditi could have brought his claim under erisa.see davila,at.indeed,he did so in his complaint in the first action.under montefiore,arditi is the type of party who can bring an erisa claim because he is a plan participant and he is seeking benefits under the plan and,specifically,under the rule of provision.see montefiore,at.additionally,arditi actual claims asserted seek enforcement of specific provisions of the plan,implicate coverage and benefits established by the terms of the erisa benefit plan,and can be construed as colorable claim s for benefits pursuant to a b.id.
second,davila second prong is also satisfied because no other independent legal duty is implicated by lighthouse actions.see davila,at montefiore,at.lighthouse obligations under the plan are inextricably intertwined with the interpretation of plan coverage and benefits and do not create a sufficiently independent duty under davila.see montefiore,at.
to avoid erisa preemption,arditi argues that he is not seeking benefits under the plan.instead,arditi claims that he is seeking damages for breach of a promise separate and independent from the plan and set forth in the agreement,using the plan merely as a benchmark for damages.
the argument fails because arditi was in fact a participant in the plan and his pension rights arose under the plan.when arditi rejoined lighthouse,the agreement stated with respect to the lighthouse international pension plan,in which you are already fully vested,your new employment here will result in reinstatement as a plan member.greenberg,ex.a at emphasis added.the agreement further described lighthouse rule of provision as a new addition to o ur retirement plan.greenberg,ex.a at.hence,the language of the agreement makes clear that arditi was being reinstate d into the plan,and that the rule of provision had been added to the plan.id.the agreement described the benefits that arditi would acquire upon his return to the plan and made clear that arditi benefits arose from,and were governed by,the terms of the plan.the plan provided more than a mere benchmark for calculating damages indeed,it was the basis for the claimed benefits.thus,as the district court correctly held,the agreement did not establish a separate and independent promise rather,arditi claims derived directly from the plan.
the dissent argues that a lthough arditi was a participant in the plan and entitled to receive a reduced benefit under it,he raises at least a colorable claim that his right in general to receive an unreduced pension benefit upon retirement that is,a different benefit from that payable under the plan arises under the express terms of his employment agreement.dissent op.at emphasis in dissenting opinion quoting greenberg,ex.a at.the phrase unreduced pension benefit appears in the last sentence of the second paragraph of the second page of the agreement.greenberg,ex.a at.that paragraph,however,begins as follows our retirement plan has now added a rule of provision that provides an unreduced benefit to employees whose age plus years equal or more.greenberg,ex.a at emphases added.in context,then,it is clear that the unreduced pension benefits arose from the plan and not the agreement.
further,stevenson,the case on which arditi relies,is easily distinguishable.there,the plaintiff left the employ of the defendant bank.at.the bank nonetheless promised to maintain the plaintiff benefits under its pension plan,even though pension beneficiaries would normally lose coverage upon ending their employment with the bank.id.this court held that the plaintiff complaint did not derive from the particular rights and obligations established by any benefit plan but rather,from a separate promise that references various benefit plans.id.at quoting davila,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
here,there is nothing in the agreement that is comparable to the promises made in stevenson.see id.at.in stevenson,an agreement separate and independent from the pension plan governed the plaintiff benefits because the plaintiff was no longer in the bank employ and was no longer a participant in the bank plan.id.at.whatever rights the plaintiff had arose not from the bank plan,but from the independent agreement that gave him benefits even though he had no right to them under the plan.here,the agreement expressly referred to arditi reinstatement into the plan as a lighthouse employee and described arditi benefits under the plan upon his return to lighthouse.the agreement merely described the benefits arditi would receive as a plan member it made no promises of benefits separate and independent from the benefits under the plan.
accordingly,we agree with the district court that arditi claims are preempted by erisa.
the district court properly denied arditi motion to remand the case to state court because arditi state law claims are preempted by erisa.the suit was properly removed to federal court,the district court had federal jurisdiction over the case,and remand to state court was not warranted.see,a.
ii.motion to dismiss 
to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
here,the district court properly dismissed arditi complaint because he failed to state a claim for relief that was plausible on its face.see id.arditi did not challenge lighthouse authority to amend the plan indeed,arditi conceded that lighthouse had the authority to freeze the plan.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed arditi action for failure to state a plausible claim.id.
conclusion 
we have considered arditi remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.for the reasons set forth above,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the majority decision today reaches beyond the squarely presented question of whether arditi claims are preempted by erisa and in so doing effectively reaches the merits of his underlying state law contract claim against lighthouse.because the proper forum for resolving the underlying contract claim is the state court and the majority holding eviscerates any distinction between the federal preemption and state law merits questions,i respectfully dissent.
as the majority notes,in determining whether a case involves a federal question such that remand to a state court would be inappropriate,courts look to the complaint examining what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses that the defendant may interpose.aetna health davila,quoting taylor anderson,internal quotation marks omitted.for the policy reasons described by the majority,erisa serves as an exception to this rule because it wholly displaces the cause of action through complete.id.quoting beneficial bank anderson,internal quotation marks omitted.this exception does,as the majority suggests,prevent plaintiffs from avoid ing removal to federal court by declining to plead necessary federal questions.romano kazacos,cir quoting rivet regions bank.
erisa preemption does not occur,however,solely because a state law claim may alternatively be a colorable claim under the erisa statute.under the supreme court test in davila,erisa preempts a cause of action where an individual,at some point in time,could have brought his or her claim under erisa a b and no other independent legal duty is implicated by a defendant actions.davila,at.this court has clarified that the first prong of davila is satisfied where a a plaintiff is the type of party who can bring a claim pursuant to a b of erisa and b the actual claim asserted can be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to a b.see montefiore med.ctr.teamsters local,cir.the majority concludes that the first prong of the davila test is satisfied because arditi could have brought his claim under erisa and because arditi is the type of party who can bring an erisa claim as a plan participant seeking benefits under the rule of provision.see majority opinion majority op.at.though it is not at all clear to me that arditi could make a colorable claim for his specific requested relief under the plan rule of provision as the plan was validly amended to exclude this benef
