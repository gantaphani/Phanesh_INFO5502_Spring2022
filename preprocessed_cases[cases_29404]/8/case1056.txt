background 
intercity provided janitorial services to women and infants hospital women infants and blue shield blue cross in providence,rhode island,since and,respectively.beginning in late,local,acting through its director of organizing,coleman,and his assistant,lima,made repeated attempts to persuade intercity to unionize its eighty employees and let local be their collective bargaining representative.intercity president michael bouthillette rebuffed these overtures,refusing to sign the proposed collective bargaining agreement because,he said,it was up to his workers,not him,to decide whether to unionize.
in january and february,lima repeatedly warned bouthillette to sign the collective bargaining agreement,or else local would drive intercity out of business by picketing in front of its two major customers,women infants and blue cross on march,coleman reiterated this threat to blue cross attorney gary peter,who testified that coleman had told him he would throw up a picket line in front of blue cross whether it illegal or not.
on march,coleman sent two letters to blue cross director of facilities management,john leite,who was in charge of procuring janitorial services.the first letter,addressed to bouthillette and copied to leite,accused intercity of violating federal and state laws and regulations in handling hazardous substances,and demanded information about blue cross ventilation system.the second letter,sent the same day directly to leite,requested the same information from blue cross.
on may,blue cross put its cleaning services contract out to bid,and intercity lost it to a unionized bidder.bouthillette testified that the bid intercity submitted,per month,was the same price it had charged since when it first started the blue cross account.bouthillette also testified that leite had told him we going to go with the union contractor,and if you can resolve things with local,there a good chance you get the contract back,but if not if you do,there not much of a chance.at one point,lima told bouthillette that local no longer wanted to organize his workers it just wanted to drive intercity out of business.by august,intercity was no longer servicing blue cross.
local did not limit its interference with intercity customers to blue cross.on march,local began a picket line outside of women infants,distributing printed handbills that contained grave accusations,including false references to intercity not providing health insurance or holiday pay to its employees and paying less than the prevailing wage.in fact,intercity did provide those benefits and paid its employees more than the union wage contemplated in the proposed collective bargaining agreement.bouthillette testified that his contact at women infants,mark neal,told him on the day picketing started,we ca have this here we do what we have to do,but this does look very good for you in the future.nearly two years later,in,intercity lost the contract for three buildings at women infants,but continued to perform services at seven others.
the original complaint,filed in,alleged the lmra claim along with state tort causes of action and was amended in to add separate counts for defamation involving blue cross count iv and women infants count v.as we have noted,only the lmra claim against local,and the defamation claims against local and coleman,went to trial.
at trial,bouthillette testified that intercity suffered pecuniary damage not only from losing the accounts,but also from defendants besmirching its reputation,which diverted bouthillette from developing new business due to the inordinate amount of time he spent reassuring customers that they would not be targeted for picketing.plaintiff also introduced into evidence an accounting report,which quantified intercity loss from the blue cross account at roughly per year.
in a bench ruling issued at the close of the plaintiff evidence,the court granted defendants rule motion on all three claims.it held the evidence in support of intercity lmra claim insufficient as a matter of law because,even if local actions were proscribed illegal secondary activity which was assumed for purposes of the decision,intercity failed to show how that activity caused it to lose the blue cross and women infants accounts.as for the two defamation counts,the court held that,although the evidence of knowing or reckless false statements was overwhelming,intercity presented no evidence that the plaintiff lost business at blue cross or at women infants as a result of the defamation.
appellant argues that it presented sufficient evidence on both fronts to reach the jury.on the lmra claim,appellant asserts that the jury should have been afforded an opportunity to find that intercity lost both the blue cross and women infants accounts due to local illegal interference.on the defamation claims,appellant argues that it did not need to present evidence to prove damages and,even if it did,its proof on damages was sufficient.it also assigns error to the court refusal to admit evidence of local assets in support of a claim for punitive damages.
we review rule challenges to the sufficiency of evidence presented at trial de novo,affirming entry of judgment as a matter of law only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party.tang rhode island dep t of elderly affairs,cir quoting.a.when judgment is entered before the jury is called upon to render its verdict,we examine the legal sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,and require more than a mere scintilla of evidence or speculation to justify the submission of an issue to the jury.id.and,of course,we must ensure that the trial court has refrained from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.
discussion 
appellant challenges the court rule judgment,arguing that its claims of unlawful secondary activity and defamation should have gone to the jury.we agree,in part.as for the lmra claim,we conclude that the evidence linking intercity loss of the blue cross account to local interference was sufficient to merit consideration by a fact finder,but the evidence of losses attendant to the union activities at women infants was inadequate as a matter of law,particularly because that account was not terminated until almost two years later.as for the defamation claims,intercity failed to introduce more than a scintilla of evidence of reputational harm or other specific damages.accordingly,we remand the lmra claim for trial,limited to liability for,and damages stemming from,intercity loss of the blue cross account,and affirm the district court judgment on the defa
