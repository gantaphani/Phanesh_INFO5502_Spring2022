thomas guilbert plaintiff appeals from an order of the district court jones,granting the summary judgment motion of charles gardner iii,douglas gardner,and marianne gardner moving defendants on plaintiff claims under the employee retirement income security act erisa or the act,west supp as well as his claims for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and fraud.plaintiff also appeals that portion of the district court order denying his motion for default judgment against defendants charles gardner,charles gardner associates,and charles gardner associates defendants and dismissing plaintiff remaining state law claims without prejudice.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
for purposes of this appeal from summary judgment,we accept as true the following facts and allegations.in december,charles gardner charles and his sons douglas gardner douglas and charles gardner iii charles iii approached plaintiff,a former and family friend,about joining their new print brokerage business.plaintiff later met with defendants to discuss the details of plaintiff prospective employment.plaintiff informed defendants that he had accumulated approximately in pension funds at his present job.charles allegedly told plaintiff that if he joined the company,in addition to his salary,defendants would establish a pension fund for him with an initial deposit of and subsequent annual deposits of.
plaintiff accepted the terms of the agreement the employment agreement and began work in january of.he worked for the company until it collapsed in.in early,plaintiff alleges that charles wrote down the terms of the pension on a legal writing pad.this document has not been produced in discovery.in the summer of,and on a number of occasions thereafter,plaintiff requested documentation of his pension,but none was provided.plaintiff alleges that defendants orally assured him on numerous occasions that they had taken care of his pension benefits.
on august,august,and september,defendants tendered three checks,each in the amount of,to plaintiff as part of his salary.in addition,on august,defendants tendered a check for as reimbursement for plaintiff car lease.each of these checks bounced.in september,it became clear to plaintiff that defendants were not going to pay his past salary and had not established pension benefits for him.
plaintiff brought this action in august of.plaintiff amended complaint set forth nine causes of action.plaintiff first cause of action alleged that defendants were liable to him for his pension benefits under erisa,a.the second cause of action alleged that defendants failed to comply with plaintiff request for information pursuant to c and failed to meet the notice requirements of c.as a result,plaintiff claimed that defendants were liable to him in such an amount as the court determined,up to per day beginning on the date of each violation.plaintiff third,fourth,and fifth causes of action alleged breach of contract,promissory estoppel and fraud respectively.pursuant to new york labor law,plaintiff sixth claim sought in unpaid wages,as reimbursement for a loan payment,as well as unpaid pension benefits.the seventh and eight causes of action alleged,inter alia,that charles,transferred funds to charles iii,douglas,and marianne gardner in order to defraud and defeat creditors claims and hide defendants assets.plaintiff urged that these funds be set aside and held for seizure by plaintiff in satisfaction of his claims pursuant to new york debtor and creditor law and.the ninth cause of action set forth a claim for wages,expenses,and pension benefits under new york business corporation law.
moving defendants filed for summary judgment.plaintiff sought default judgment against defendants due to those defendants failure to appear.in an opinion entered february,the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants.first,the district court rejected plaintiff erisa claims.the court found there were no surrounding circumstances other than defendants alleged oral assurances from which a reasonable person could ascertain that defendants intended to set up the pension fund for plaintiff.the district court held that oral assurances of a plan existence are unenforceable and that therefore defendants had not established or maintained a pension program within the meaning of a.
the district court next dismissed plaintiff breach of contract claim as untimely.because of its determination that no erisa plan existed,the court applied new york law to the breach of contract claim and held that the statute of limitations was six years pursuant to.the court also held that under new york law,when a contract does not specify a time for performance,the law implies a reasonable time for performance.the district court found that a reasonable time for performance would have been within a year of plaintiff january start date and that therefore defendants breached and the cause of action accrued in january of.
the court rejected plaintiff argument that the cause of action accrued in september when plaintiff became aware defendants were not going to provide him pension benefits.the court held that defendants alleged assurances about the pension were insufficient to the statute of limitations because,under new york law,a promise to perform a previously breached contract must be in writing in order to start the statute of limitations running anew.
the district court next granted summary judgment on the promissory estoppel claim.the court determined that under new york law promissory estoppel is not a valid cause of action in the employment context.the district court further granted summary judgment on the fraud claim.the court held that under f,a claim for fraud must be commenced within six years from the commission of the fraud or within two years from the date that the fraud was discovered,or could have reasonably been discovered,whichever is longer.the court concluded that plaintiff reasonably could have discovered the alleged fraud before and his action was therefore.in a footnote,the district court rejected plaintiff assertion that the statute of limitations for the breach of contract and fraud claims should be equitably tolled.
finally,the district court held that there was no legally cognizable claim under which the defendants could be held liable and therefore granted summary judgment to nonmoving defendants sua sponte.the court dismissed plaintiff motion for default judgment against defendants as moot.the district court held that plaintiff remaining state law claims failed to meet the amount in controversy requirement of and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction the court therefore dismissed those claims without prejudice.plaintiff timely appealed.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.harlen incorp.vill.of mineola,cir.summary judgment must be granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue exists for summary judgment purposes where the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,is such that a reasonable jury could decide in that party favor.harlen,at nabisco,cir.although all inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party,mere speculation and conjecture is insufficient to preclude the granting of the motion.harlen,at citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d western world ins.stack oil,cir.
discussion 
erisa claims 
plaintiff first contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his erisa claims.we are unpersuaded.erisa covers any employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained by any employer engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce.a west supp in a case involving an alleged employee welfare benefit plan,this court held that a plan,fund,or program under erisa is established if from the surrounding circumstances a reasonable person can ascertain the intended benefits,a class of beneficiaries,the source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits.grimo blue shield of vermont,cir quoting donovan dillingham,cir in banc.a plan need not be a formal written document,however.id.citing donovan,at see also a erisa covers any employee benefit plan emphasis added.
in donovan,the eleventh circuit rejected the proposition that the term establish means no more than an ultimate decision by an employer to provide the type of benefits described in erisa.donovan,at.the court held that a decision to extend benefits is not the establishment of a plan or program.id.at.instead,a cts or events that record,exemplify or implement the decision can be introduced as direct or circumstantial evidence that the decision has become reality.id.the court emphasized that it is the reality of a plan,fund or program and not the decision to extend certain benefits that is determinative.see also scott gulf oil,cir we agree with donovan that a mere allegation that an employer or employee organization ultimately decided to provide an employee welfare benefit is not enough to invoke erisa coverage.such an allegation fails to allege the establishment of a plan.something more is needed.internal citation omitted.although neither donovan nor scott is binding on this court,their logic is persuasive.we therefore look to whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the reality of an employee pension benefit plan.
in support of his claim that defendants established an employee pension benefit plan covered by erisa,plaintiff presented his own deposition testimony to the following effect.charles promised him a pension fund with an initial deposit of and annual contributions of thereafter.in early,charles wrote the terms of the pension plan on a legal pad and told plaintiff it would be filed in the company records.on numerous occasions defendants assured him that the pension plan was established.plaintiff also submitted deposition testimony from two other employees stating that plaintiff was owed money other than his salary.finally,plaintiff submitted the company tax returns indicating the company took certain tax deductions for employee benefit programs.viewing,as we must,this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,we conclude that no reasonable fact finder could find that defendants established or maintained a pension plan under erisa.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment on the erisa claims is affirmed 
plaintiff further contends that the district court erred in holding that his fraud claim was because there are material issues of fact as to when plaintiff could have reasonably discovered the alleged fraud and to the extent plaintiff claim arises from misrepresentations occurring within six years of commencement of the action,the claim is timely.we affirm for substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court.
under new york law,a claim for fraud must be commenced either within six years from the commission of the fraud or within two years from the date that the fraud was discovered,or could reasonably have been discovered,whichever is later.g,see also siler lutheran soc,julian carroll,hillman city of new york.the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the fraud could not have been discovered before the period prior to the commencement of the action,siler,at julian,at hillman,at.w here the circumstances are such as to suggest to a person of ordinary intelligence the probability that he has been defrauded,a duty of inquiry arises,and if he omits that inquiry when it would have developed the truth,and shuts his eyes to the facts which call for investigation,knowledge of the fraud will be imputed to him.armstrong mcalpin,cir quoting higgins crouse.
in his amended complaint,plaintiff alleged that a s an inducement to leave his job defendants promised they would provide him with an annual pension benefit of and that they would fund the pension with an initial deposit of if he joined their company.although he requested documentation of his pension plan in the summer of,and on occasions thereafter,defendants never provided this information.defendants,however,continuously acknowledge d their pension obligation to plaintiff and assured him that the pension had been and would be taken care of.thus,plaintiff amended complaint alleged that defendants made misrepresentations more than six years before he commenced this action in august of.to the extent his fraud claim rests on alleged misrepresentations occurring prior to august,the claim is unless plaintiff can establish that he reasonably could not have discovered the fraud before the period prior to august.see g,siler,at julian,at hillman,at.aside from the legal pad,plaintiff does not claim to have seen any documentation of his pension plan whatsoever.given the number of years he worked for the company,this dearth of documents alone should have suggested to him that something was awry.moreover,each of plaintiff repeated requests for documentary evidence of the plan was fruitless.this too should have raised suspicion.under these circumstances,we conclude that plaintiff reasonably could have discovered the fraud sometime before the time period prior to august.
yet plaintiff amended complaint also alleged that t hroughout the period of his employment plaintiff received assurances that he had received,and was on an ongoing basis receiving,the pension benefits that were promised to him.according to plaintiff,defendants told him on numerous occasions that the pension had been taken care of when,in fact,defendants knew this to be false.we construe these portions of the amended complaint to allege that defendants made misrepresentations after.to the extent that plaintiff fraud claim rests on these later misrepresentations,the claim would be timely under.the amended complaint,however,fails to support a claim of fraud under new york law because it is duplicative of the breach of contract claim.see recovery credit serv,cir holding that plaintiff did not maintain a claim for fraud because plaintiff failed to i demonstrate a legal duty separate from the duty to perform under the contract,or ii demonstrate a fraudulent misrepresentation collateral or extraneous to the contract,or iii seek special damages that are caused by the misrepresentation and unrecoverable as contract damages internal citations omitted,long island,affirming dismissal of negligence claims where plaintiff has not alleged the violation of a legal duty independent of the contract brown brown,holding that plaintiff fraud claim is precluded by the fact that a simple breach of contract claim may not be considered a tort unless a legal duty independent of the,one arising out of circumstances extraneous to,and not constituting elements of,the contract been violated mckernin fanny farmer candy shops,holding that a fraud claim does not lie where it is premised upon an alleged breach of contractual duties and the supporting allegations do not concern representations which are collateral or extraneous to the terms of the parties agreement.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the fraud claim.
iii.breach of contract 
statute of limitations 
plaintiff argues that the district court erred when it determined that the breach of contract claim accrued when defendants failed to establish the plan within the imputed timeframe.according to plaintiff,the claim instead accrued when defendants rejected his claim for benefits.plaintiff maintains that i n a pension case,the limitation period begins to run when there has been repudiation by the fiduciary which is clear and made known to the beneficiaries.
plaintiff asserts that miles new york state teamsters,cir supports this proposition.not so.in miles,plaintiffs brought an action under erisa to determine their eligibility for pension benefits.miles,at.this court held there was no statute of limitations under the applicable erisa provision and therefore applied the most applicable state limitations statute the limitations period prescribed by.id.at.we then held that a plaintiff erisa cause of action accrues,and the limitations period begins to run,when there has been a repudiation by the fiduciary which is clear and made known to the benefic
