the chabad lubavitch of litchfield county,chabad,a connecticut membership corporation founded and currently presided over by rabbi joseph eisenbach rabbi eisenbach,purchased property in the borough of litchfield historic district with the intention of expanding the existing building on the property to accommodate the chabad religious mission.pursuant to connecticut state law,the chabad applied to the borough of litchfield historic district commission hdc for leave to undertake its desired modifications.however,following multiple meetings on and amendments to the chabad proposal,the hdc denied the application with leave to submit an amended proposal consistent with enumerated conditions.in this ensuing suit,the chabad and rabbi eisenbach collectively,the plaintiffs assert that the borough of litchfield,the hdc,and hdc members glenn hillman hillman and kathleen crawford crawford collectively,the defendants abridged their rights under,and the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,et and connecticut state law by denying the application they seek damages,injunctive and declaratory relief,attorneys fees,and the appointment of a federal monitor.
on the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court hall,dismissed rabbi eisenbach claims for lack of standing,citing the rabbi want of a sufficient property interest under rluipa and his failure to distinguish his claims from the chabad under federal and state law.chabad lubavitch of litchfield,borough of litchfield,d,hereinafter chabad i.subsequently,following the chabad motion for partial summary judgment and the defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the defendants.significantly,the district court concluded that connecticut statutory scheme governing historic districts is neutral and generally applicable and,consequently,that the hdc denial of the chabad application could not as a matter of law impose a substantial burden on the chabad religious exercise under rluipa substantial burden provision.chabad lubavitch of litchfield,borough of litchfield,d,hereinafter chabad ii.the district court also held that the chabad failure to identify a religious institution that was more favorably treated than and identical in all relevant respects to the chabad barred the chabad claim under rluipa nondiscrimination provision.chabad ii,d at.
on appeal,we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing rabbi eisenbach rluipa claims for lack of standing.accordingly,we vacate the district court june,ruling insofar as it concerns rabbi eisenbach standing under rluipa and remand for consideration,instead,whether rabbi eisenbach failed to state a claim under rluipa.we affirm the remainder of that judgment due to rabbi eisenbach failure to brief his remaining claims.additionally,we conclude that the hdc review of the chabad application was an individual assessment subject to rluipa substantial burden provision and that the chabad need not cite an identical comparator to establish a claim under rluipa nondiscriminaton provision.accordingly,we vacate the district court february,judgment insofar as it concerned these rluipa claims and remand for consideration whether these claims survive summary judgment under an analysis consistent with this opinion.we affirm the remainder of the district court february,judgment,albeit largely due to the chabad failure to brief most of its remaining claims.
background 
the chabad,a connecticut membership corporation,and rabbi eisenbach,president of the chabad,offer weekly religious and other services to its orthodox hasidic parishioners in the litchfield area.prior to the events at issue,the chabad rented space to provide these services,at a cost of thousands of dollars per year.deeming the rented space inadequate to practice its faith and accommodate its religious mission,the chabad in purchased a property at west street in the borough of litchfield to serve as its new place of worship.the property,located in the litchfield historic district once deemed to be p robably the finest surviving example of a typical late century new england town boasts a,victorian residence constructed in the encompassing square feet and a basement.known as the deming house,the building was constructed as a residence by the grandson of a prominent revolutionary litchfield resident but,by the time of the chabad purchase,had been altered to accommodate a commercial establishment.
in accordance with connecticut statutory scheme governing development in historic districts,the chabad sought leave to alter west street to meet its needs.specifically,connecticut general statutes a directs that n o building or structure shall be erected or altered within an historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to the historic district commission and approved by said commission.the hdc,established in pursuant to this scheme,reviews such applications for the litchfield historic district.the connecticut general statutes empower the hdc to approve or deny applications following notice and a public hearing,see id,and direct that,when weighing applications to alter exterior architectural features,the hdc consider,in addition to any other pertinent factors,the historical and architectural value and significance,architectural style,scale,general design,arrangement,texture and material of the architectural features involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other buildings and structures in the immediate neighborhood,id.a.
the hdc first considered the chabad application at a meeting on september.the defendants assert that the chabad proposed modifications called for a square foot addition to be built at west street,including administrative offices,classrooms,a nearly square foot residence for rabbi eisenbach and his family,an indoor swimming pool,guest accommodations,kitchens,and a ritual bath.though the chabad disputes the defendants characterization of its proposed expansion,it does not specify a smaller footprint.in addition,the chabad sought to top the property with a clock tower featuring the star of david and to incorporate several external elements that would restore some of the property period details.the chabad contends that,at that meeting,hdc member wendy kuhne kuhne voiced her opposition to its application,due in part to the size of the addition and her belief that the star of david was not historically compatible with the historic district.other hdc members,including crawford,also expressed concerns regarding the size of the addition,with one member urging that w e have to get the public out on this project for the public hearing.at the conclusion of the meeting,the hdc scheduled a second meeting for the following month.
at the second meeting,held on october,the chabad announced its changes in response to the requested modifications,which included altering the shape of windows and lowering the roof line of the addition.following the chabad presentation,kuhne commented,i s this all there is.though the chabad did not object to kuhne comments at the meeting,it later requested that she recuse herself from the public meetings and decisionmaking process,which she did.the hdc then bifurcated the hearing process concerning the chabad application,reserving the first hearing to address the chabad proposed modifications and the second to address whether denial of the chabad application would place a substantial burden on its religious exercise.following the first public hearing,held on november,the chabad altered its proposal to,among other changes,lower the foundation of its addition,use alternative exterior building material,reduce the height of the star of david finial atop the clock tower,and reconstruct a front porch that had been removed during an earlier renovation.at the second hearing,held on december,the chabad asserted its need for a larger structure,but did not disclose the size of its assembly or the number of students likely to attend religious classes.
the hdc denied the chabad application on december.in its written opinion,the hdc catalogued the history and importance of the deming house to the historic character of the borough of litchfield.per the hdc,the altered but nonetheless distinctively residential structure serves as one of the last vestiges of the borough residential district,significant alteration of which would destroy the residential character of the property environs.as such,the hdc commended the chabad proposals to rehabilitate the existing structure,but nevertheless denied three of the chabad proposed modifications hanging a double door on the front of the house,incorporating a clock tower,and building an addition on the property.the hdc concluded that the double door would conflict with the house original design and would require removal of a single door that was probably the original door of the house.the hdc deemed the clock tower incongruous with the immediate neighborhood and the district as a whole,and found that it would in one stroke transform the house from a residential structure in appearance to an institutional structure.id.finally,the hdc objected to the size of the proposed addition,which it characterized as massive and nearly square f ee t,a size over five times as large as the deming house that would dwarf and overwhelm not only the house but also the neighborhood as a whole.
however,in light of the chabad proposed religious use of the property,the hdc also granted accommodations to substitute for the rejected modifications.specifically,the hdc stated that it would accept a proposal replacing the clear glass currently in the house front door with stained glass,incorporating a finial with a star of david atop the house,and including an addition that was no larger than the original structure.the hdc granted the chabad leave to file an amended application consistent with these conditions.thereafter,five hdc members voted unanimously to deny the chabad a certificate of appropriateness,including hillman.crawford was not recorded as having cast a vote.the chabad did not administratively appeal the denial or file an amended application.see.
procedural history 
the chabad and rabbi eisenbach filed the underlying action in september.in their third amended complaint,filed on april,the plaintiffs asserted that the hdc denial of the chabad application abridged their rights under the first amendment free exercise,free speech,and free association clauses the fourteenth amendment equal protection and due process clauses rluipa substantial burden,equal terms,and nondiscrimination provisions as well as provisions of the connecticut state constitution and the connecticut religious freedom act cfra.the plaintiffs also asserted that the named hdc members conspired to violate and failed to prevent the violation of their civil rights under and,respectively.
in january,the defendants moved to dismiss rabbi eisenbach claims for lack of standing under federal rule of civil procedure b the district court granted this motion on june.the district court first concluded that rluipa requires a plaintiff to hold some property interest that he has attempted to use and which has been threatened by the illegal conduct of the defendant.chabad i,d at citing.because rabbi eisenbach proposed use of the facilities at west street did not qualify as such a property interest and his claim of a right to place a mortgage lien on the property for unpaid salary barely warrant ed addressing,the district court determined the rabbi lacked standing to press his claims under rluipa.id.at.in addition,the district court concluded that rabbi eisenbach failure to distinguish his claims from those of the chabad denied him standing under,and,the connecticut constitution,and cfra.id.at.
the chabad subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on may,and on may,the defendants for summary judgment in february,the district court denied the chabad motion and granted the defendants.pertinently,the district court found that,because connecticut general statutes et applies to any entity seeking to alter a property in a historic district save for nonprofit institutions of higher education it is a neutral law of general applicability and thus could not,as a matter of law,impose a substantial burden on the chabad religious exercise,thereby barring the chabad claim under rluipa substantial burden provision.chabad ii,d at.in addition,the district court concluded that the chabad failure to cite a valid secular comparator was fatal to its claim under rluipa equal terms provision,id.at,and that its failure to identify a religious institution that was more favorably treated and identically situated to the chabad precluded its claim under rluipa nondiscrimination provision,id.at.finally,the district court rejected the chabad remaining constitutional and state law claims for many of the same reasons described above.id.at.because the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the merits,it did not address the hdc members asserted entitlement to either absolute or qualified immunity.id.at.the chabad and rabbi eisenbach appealed both of the district court rulings,and the defendants.

a.the chabad rluipa claims 
the chabad asserts claims under three of rluipa land use provisions the with a land use applicant religious exercise in the absence of a compelling justification,a and the equal terms and nondiscrimination provisions,which prohibit unequal treatment of and discrimination against religious assemblies and institutions by a government,id.b.we address each in turn.
the chabad rluipa substantial burden claim 
rluipa substantial burden provision provides 
no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,including a religious assembly or institution,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,assembly,or institution a is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and b is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
a.the provision applies only when a substantial burden occurs attendant to a federally funded program implicates interstate or international commerce or commerce with indian tribes or is imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation or system of land use regulations,under which a government makes,or has in place formal or informal procedures or practices that permit the government to make,individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved.id.a.to establish a claim,a plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that at least one of these predicates applies and that the defendant implementation of a land use regulation placed a substantial burden on the plaintiff religious exercise.b.the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that it acted in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and that its action is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.id.at citing b.
we agree with the chabad that rluipa substantial burden provision applies in this case under the statute individualized assessment predicate under the plain meaning of a c,this predicate is satisfied when the government may take into account the particular details of an applicant proposed use of land when deciding to permit or deny that use.guru nanak sikh soc y cnty.of sutter,cir.thus,while the mere application of a neutral and generally applicable zoning law likely would not trigger rluipa at least,not under this predicate,application of a zoning law that permits a governmental entity to consider the applicant intended use of a property,applying at least partly subjective criteria on a basis,likely would.see id.at see also westchester day sch.vill.of mamaroneck,d noting that application of neutral and generally applicable law to particular facts may constitute individualized assessment where such application does not involve a mere numerical or mechanistic assessment,but instead involv es criteria that are at least partially subjective in nature,aff,cir.
rluipa substantial burden provision combats subtle forms of discrimination by land use authorities that may occur when a state delegates essentially standardless discretion to nonprofessionals operating without procedural safeguards.sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,city of new berlin,cir.accordingly,when a governmental entity conducts a evaluation of a land use application,carrying as it does the concomitant risk of idiosyncratic application of land use standards that may permit and conceal potentially discriminatory denials,rluipa applies.midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir holding that ordinance permitting such evaluations was quintessentially an individual assessment regime under rluipa see also dep t of justice policy statement on the land use provisions of rluipa at,hereinafter doj statement,available at noting that,due to idiosyncracies of zoning law,solely mechanical,objective assessments exempt from this predicate would be extremely rare.
the broad reach of this predicate is no accident.in regulating individualized assessments by government of the proposed uses to which property is to be put,the substantial burden provision codifies principles announced in sherbert verner,d,insofar as that case held that a government system for granting individual exemptions from a general rule must have a compelling reason to deny a religious group an exemption that is sought on the basis of hardship.sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,at discussing individualized assessment predicate.because almost all land use regimes implicate such individualized review,see river of life kingdom ministries vill.of hazel crest,cir en banc sykes,dissenting,almost all impos itions or implementation s of land use regimes,u.a c,will satisfy this predicate.
under this rubric,connecticut statutory scheme undeniably demands an individual assessment of applications to alter historic properties.while connecticut general statutes a requires that nearly all entities seeking to modify a property in a historic district shall obtain a certificate of appropriateness,the scheme also requires that local commissions implement that general rule by applying loosely defined and subjective standards to discrete applications.see id.to that end,commands that commissions hold a public hearing upon each application.id.a emphasis added.similarly,directs that commissions,when weighing an application,must determine whether the proposed erection,alteration or parking will be appropriate.id.a emphasis added.and,in assessing the appropriateness of a modification,commissions are further directed to consider such criteria as the historical and architectural value and significance of the modification,its architectural style,scale,general design,arrangement,texture and material used,the relationship of the exterior architectural style to the neighborhood and any other pertinent factors.id.even the district court found these standards to be subjective in nature,but nonetheless deemed the statutory scheme to be immune from substantial burden analysis.see chabad ii,d at.in the absence of more definite standards limiting the hdc discretion in reviewing applications,we disagree.see doj statement at 
were there any doubt as to the type of assessment at issue,even a cursory review of the hdc consideration of the chabad application confirms that the process was patently individualized.the hdc probed the chabad proposed window and roof measurements,door selections,building materials,roof adornments,and glass type,and imposed a size limitation on the chabad development based on a tailored review of surrounding properties.moreover,the hdc conducted this inquiry without the guidance of laws or regulations that dictated the specific metes and bounds either of its inquiry or of the conditions it imposed.regardless of whether the hdc inquiry was defensible,it was thus at a minimum individualized.because connecticut statutory scheme therefore permits indeed,demands application of subjective standards to individual land use applications,and because the hdc applied such subjective standards to the chabad application,we conclude that the hdc denial of the chabad application resulted from an individual assessment,triggering rluipa substantial burden provision the district court consequently erred in determining that the chabad could not establish a claim under rluipa substantial burden provision as a matter of law,and we vacate the district court judgment insofar as it concerns that claim.
in reaching its decision,the district court improperly read our opinion in westchester day school as holding that,as a matter of law,generally applicable land use regulations may only result in a substantial burden when arbitrarily and capriciously imposed.see chabad ii,d at citing westchester day,at.this holding would be in tension with the plain language of rluipa substantial burden provision,which in certain instances regulates burden s that result from a rule of general applicability suggesting that such burdens fall within rluipa cognizance,even when imposed in the regular course.a a,b.moreover,such a rule would render the substantial burden provision largely superfluous given rluipa nondiscrimination and equal terms provisions,which regulate overtly discriminatory acts that are often characterized by arbitrary or unequal treatment of religious institutions.see id.b bethel world outreach ministries montgomery cnty.council,cir requiring a religious institution to show that it has been targeted on the basis of religion in order to succeed on a substantial burden claim would render the nondiscrimination provision superfluous.sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,at t he substantial burden provision backstops the explicit prohibition of religious discrimination in the later section of rluipa,much as the theory of employment discrimination backstops the prohibition of intentional discrimination.if a decision imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise and the decision maker can not justify it,the inference arises that hostility to religion influenced the decision.citations omitted.
instead,westchester day school enumerates some of the factors that may be considered to determine whether a substantial burden is imposed,including whether the law is neutral and generally applicable.in conducting the substantial burden analysis,we considered several factors.see at stating that the arbitrary and unlawful nature of defendant conduct support ed a substantial burden claim,while also looking to other factors see also fortress bible church,at finding that arbitrary and capricious application of land use regulation bolstered a substantial burden claim.in addition to the arbitrariness of a denial,our multifaceted analysis considered whether the denial was conditional if so,whether the condition was itself a substantial burden and whether the plaintiff had ready alternatives.see westchester day,at see also fortress bible church,at considering whether rejection of land use application denied plaintiff the ability to construct an adequate facility for its religious exercise,or was merely a rejection of a specific building proposal.our sister circuits have contributed additional texture to this analysis.see,bethel world outreach ministries,at weighing whether plaintiff had reasonable expectation of receiving approval to build church when it bought property and deeming it significant that the defendant has completely prevented the plaintiff from building any church on its property petra presbyterian church vill.of northbrook,cir considering as a factor whether plaintiff bought property reasonably expecting to obtain a permit,particularly when alternative sites were available midrash sephardi,at deeming it significant that the plaintiff could operate a church only a few blocks from its preferred location.thus,while we conclude that the substantial burden provision applies,we leave it to the district court to determine as a question of first instance,see dardana yuganskneftegaz,cir,whether the denial here in fact impose d a substantial burden on the chabad religious exercise,a see fortress bible church feiner,cir requiring that the substantial burden have a close nexus with religious exercise to be cognizable under rluipa westchester day,at holding that substantial burden occurs when government coerces the religious institution to change its behavior emphasis omitted.we note that,in conducting the substantial burden analysis on remand,the district court should consider,inter alia,whether the conditions attendant to the hdc denial of the chabad application themselves imposed a substantial burden on the chabad religious exercise,whether feasible alternatives existed for the chabad to exercise its faith,and whether the chabad reasonably believed it would be permitted to undertake its proposed modifications when it purchased the property at west street.the district court should also consider,of course,whether the proposed modifications shared a close nexus with and would be consistent with accommodating the chabad religious exercise.see fortress bible church,at.
the chabad rluipa equal terms claim 
we can address the chabad equal terms claim in comparatively short order.rluipa equal terms provision states that n o government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.b.under this provision,the plaintiff bears the initial burden to produce prima facie evidence to support a claim of unequal treatment,after which the government bear s the burden of persuasion on any element of the claim.id.b.
division exists among our sister circuits concerning whether the equal terms provision invariably requires evidence of a similarly situated secular comparator to establish a claim and,where such evidence is necessary,on what ground the comparison must be made.see generally river of life kingdom ministries,at en banc majority opinion discussing circuits conflicting approaches id.at sykes,dissenting same discussion.we need not enter the fray here,as the chabad has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie equal terms claim under any standard.
in this court sole analysis of the equal terms provision,we declined to define the precise outlines of what it takes to be a valid comparator under rluipa provision.third church of christ,scientist city of new york,cir.nevertheless,we noted that organizations subject to different regimes may well not be sufficiently similar to support a challenge.id.at emphasis omitted.in support,we cited primera iglesia bautista hispana of boca raton,broward county,in which the eleventh circuit held that a church and school were insufficiently comparable to establish an equal terms claim,given that the properties sought different forms of zoning relief from different land use authorities applying sharply different criteria.see,cir.because the evidence of the church and school treatment was thus consistent with the neutral application of different zoning regulations suggesting different treatment,not unequal treatment the court held that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie equal terms claim.id.at see also vision church vill.of long grove,cir rejecting equal terms claim,in part,because the fact that the religious land use applicant and the elementary schools were subject to different standards because of the year in which their special use applications were considered compels the conclusion that there was no unequal treatment.
the same is true here the chabad has failed to establish a prima facie equal terms claim.its sole support for its equal terms claim comes in the form of one alleged comparator the wolcott library,a building in litchfield historic district that,according to uncontested evidence submitted by the chabad,was permitted to construct a substantial addition on its property that altered the character of the property from residential to institutional however,the wolcott library expansion was approved in by a different land use authority pursuant to a different land use regime.specifically,the board of warden and burgesses,the predecessor to the hdc,approved construction of the addition under a law that explicitly barred consideration of the relative size of buildings.by contrast,connecticut general statutes a,which guided the hdc consideration of the chabad application,explicitly requires that commissions shall consider scale.
while minor differences in land use regimes may not defeat a comparison under the equal terms provision in all disputes,the centrality of the size of the chabad proposed addition to this dispute renders the wolcott library an inappropriate comparator to support the chabad equal terms claim.as such,the chabad has at most established different treatment,not unequal treatment.primera iglesia bautista hispana,at.because the chabad has thus failed to identify any evidence that it endured less than equal treatment as compared to a secular assembly or institution,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on this claim 
the chabad rluipa nondiscrimination claim 
rluipa nondiscrimination provision states that n o government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.b.as with the equal terms provision,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie claim,after which the government bears the burden of persuasion on the elements of the nondiscrimination claim.id.b.
this court has not previously interpreted the nondiscrimination provision.nonetheless,the plain text of the provision makes clear that,unlike the substantial burden and equal terms provisions,evidence of discriminatory intent is required to establish a claim.see b prohibiting discrimination on the basis of religion or religious denomination emphasis added.as such,courts consider the provision have held that the nondiscrimination provision enshrine s principles announced in church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d,which cast a jaundiced eye on laws that target religion.see midrash sephardi,at.
lukumi looked to equal protection principles in analyzing whether a law was discriminatory.see lukumi,at citing vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.other courts analyzing rluipa nondiscrimination provision,as well as the related equal terms provision,have similarly looked to equal protection precedent in weighing such claims.see,bethel world outreach ministries,at church of scientology of,city of sandy springs,d.we join in employing this approach.rluipa,after all,codified existing free exercise,establishment clause,and equal protection rights against states and municipalities that discriminated against religious land use.midrash sephardi,at discussing the equal terms provision,but also noting that rluipa tailors the nondiscrimination prohibitions in b and to land use regulations because congress identified a significant encroachment on the core first and fourteenth amendme
