defendants siemens corporation,siemens ag,binder ag in abwicklung,binder beteiligungs ag,wb holding ag,binder and co ag,bosch rexroth ag,bosch rexroth corporation,and omniglow corporation collectively,defendants appeal from the order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge,dated november,granting plaintiffs motion for class certification.see in re ski train fire in kaprun,austria on november,no.mdl.the district court certified the class,pursuant to.b for liability purposes only,as limited to the claims of heirs,beneficiaries and personal representatives of individuals who died in the ski train fire at kaprun,austria on november.id.to join this class,the district court order further required that prospective members opt in by affirmatively consenting to inclusion.see in re ski train fire in kaprun,austria on november.defendants argue,inter alia,that the district court overstepped the bounds of rule by certifying an opt in class.we agree and therefore reverse the order of the district court.
background 
the history of this case is reported in the opinion and order of the district court,and we recount below only those facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal.see in re ski train fire.on november,a funicular train caught fire inside a tunnel near kaprun,austria passengers and crew members died in the inferno.among the victims were austrians,germans,ten japanese,eight americans,four slovenians,two dutchmen,a briton,and a czech.plaintiffs,family members of the american victims,filed various lawsuits related to the kaprun tragedy in several american courts.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred these cases to the united states district court for the southern district of new york for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.see in re ski train fire in kaprun,austria on november,d.
in their amended complaint before the district court,plaintiffs sought damages,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief,from various entities,alleging that the train and tunnel were improperly designed,constructed,and maintained,as well as negligently operated and promoted.plaintiffs also alleged,inter alia,that certain defendants fraudulently misrepresented the safety of the train and the tunnel and intentionally inflicted emotional distress.most significantly for the purposes of this appeal,plaintiffs brought their claims on their own behalf,and on behalf of a class of heirs and representatives of victims of the kaprun tragedy who consent in being included as members of the class.if certified,the plaintiffs class would consequently include the heirs and beneficiaries of foreign victims.plaintiffs asked the district court to certify this class pursuant to rule b and b 
in an amended order dated october,the district court certified plaintiffs class pursuant to.b to resolve liability issues only,rather than damages.in re ski train fire,at.the class would consist of all heirs,beneficiaries and personal representatives of all individuals who died in the fire who consent to inclusion.id.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.because participation in the class requires prospective members to take affirmative action by first consenting to be bound by the judgment,the district court certified an class,as opposed to the traditional rule b class.id.at.defendants now appeal the district court certification decision.
defendants challenge the district court decision on four grounds.first,they argue that rule does not permit certification of a class with an opt in provision.second,they argue that a class of all heirs,beneficiaries and personal representatives is unmanageable because identifying class members would require an individualized inquiry into each decedent estate.third,defendants challenge the suitability of the class action mechanism for resolving issues of legal liability in an accident with mass fatalities.finally,defendants argue that the district court erred by certifying a class to pursue claims of fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress,since such claims may require individual determinations.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to certify a class for abuse of discretion.see,parker time warner entm t,cir.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon,cir internal citations omitted.
ii.an opt in class 
we first consider whether the district court erred by certifying what it described as an opt in class.rule c contains a opt out requirement,mandating that members of a class certified under rule b be afforded an opportunity to request exclusion from that class the language of rule does not,however,require members of any class affirmatively to opt into membership.nor is such an opt in provision required by due process considerations.see phillips petroleum shutts,d we reject the contention that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that absent plaintiffs affirmatively opt in to the class,rather than be deemed members of the class if they do not opt out.
not only is an opt in provision not required,but substantial legal authority supports the view that by adding the opt out requirement to rule in the amendments,congress prohibited opt in provisions by implication.professor benjamin kaplan of harvard law school,who served as reporter of the advisory committee on civil rules from to,and later as a justice of the supreme judicial court of massachusetts,explained that the committee rejected the suggestion that the judgment in a b class action,instead of covering by its terms all class members who do not opt out,should embrace only those individuals who in response to notice affirmatively signify their desire to be included benjamin kaplan,continuing work of the civil committee amendments of the federal rules of civil procedure i,harv.he elaborated the rationale of the committee decision 
r equiring the individuals affirmatively to request inclusion in the lawsuit would result in freezing out the claims of small claims held by small for one reason or another,ignorance,timidity,unfamiliarity with business or legal matters,will simply not take the affirmative step.the moral justification for treating such people as null quantities is questionable.for them the class action serves something like the function of an administrative proceeding where scattered individual interests are represented by the government.in the circumstances delineated in subdivision b,it seems fair for the silent to be considered as part of the class.otherwise the b type would become a class action which was not that at prime point of discontent with the version of rule.
id.at,cited with approval in shutts,at.courts have generally echoed justice kaplan view that opt in provisions are contrary to rule.see clark universal builders,cir t he requirement of an affirmative request for inclusion in the class is contrary to the express language of rule c b enter.wall paper bodman,rule c b calls for a notice that enables prospective members to,in language strongly suggesting the impropriety of requirements the judgment,whether favorable or not,will include all members who do not request exclusion.this reading of the rule has been accepted by most courts essentially for the reasons stated by justice kaplan 
admittedly,we have never squarely held that rule prohibits certification of an opt in class.this is unsurprising since it appears,as the district court concedes,at,no other federal court has explicitly certified an opt in class.it is more common that courts have considered whether mandatory questionnaires are permissible during the discovery stage of a class action.some courts have held that such questionnaires are because they may constitute a de facto opt in provision.see cox am.cast iron pipe,cir used in a rule b setting,a discovery order threatening dismissal for amounts to no more than an affirmative is,it requires passive class members to take positive action to stay in the suit.mccarthy paine webber group,dismissal of an absent class member claims as sanctions for failure to answer a questionnaire is contrary to the policy of rule.likewise,courts have hesitated to require class members to file proofs of claim before a liability determination because such a provision resembles an opt in procedure.see enter.wall paper,at abulaban pressprich,failure to file any document in the nature of an inclusionary request should not,in the initial stages of the litigation,preclude a person from being considered a member of the class.see also james moore,et,moore practice and procedure b a court may generally not require class members to file a proof of claim form before a liability determination,because courts have generally found the use of such a form to be an improper requirement in violation of rule c,at least as a prerequisite to trial.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed noting that some courts have refused to authorize the use of a form because such a form may constitute an opt in provision internal citation omitted.in short,we find scant support for the proposition that a court could ever certify a class with an opt in provision during the liability stage of the litigation.
despite substantial authority indicating that rule precludes certification of opt in classes,the district court relied on a handful of cases to announce a new rule of civil procedure,namely that opt in classes are not only permissible,but may in fact be necessary in certain circumstances.in re ski train fire,at citing robinson union carbide,cir,and in re crazy eddie sec.the district court reasoned that an opt in class is necessary in this case because plaintiffs sought to certify a class whose prospective members are defined by their willingness to take the affirmative action of consent ing to be bound by the judgment.id.at.the district court elaborated that a n class is necessary here because it would be unfair to presumptively include members in a class for which membership depends on a waiver of a right,presumably the right of foreign class members to relitigate their claim in foreign courts.id.at.acknowledging the novelty of certifying an opt in class under rule,the district court also indicated that its authority to do so could be derived from other sources.one such source was an analogy to the fair labor standards act flsa,which provides for judgments that bind only those who affirmatively desire to be class members.id.at.another asserted source was the district court equitable powers.id.
the district court certification of an opt in class in this case was error.zervos,at noting that legal error is a species of abuse of discretion.first,the two cases on which the district court relied hardly provide clear guidance on the issue.the only support to be found for the district court application of robinson is a single then only if taken out of context.the court of appeals for the fifth circuit stated that there are some class actions where it is necessary for class members who do not opt out to take some affirmative action as a condition of ultimate recovery,at internal quotation marks omitted,but then immediately continued the key word here is ultimate.although there may be some actions in which unnamed individual plaintiffs will have to come forward to establish their entitlement to portions of the recovery,such requirement should not be imposed upon them until necessary for adjudication opting in was not necessary before the determination of liability.id.at emphasis added.in other words,in relying on robinson,the district court ignored the critical difference between,on the one hand,requiring an individual to take affirmative action to join a class for liability determination purposes and,on the other hand,requiring a class member to take action such as filling out a claim form in order to obtain the ultimate relief the former is an opt in provision and the latter is not,since a class member who fails to obtain ultimate relief because he did not fill out a claim form is nonetheless still a class member.judge wisdom concurring opinion in robinson explained this distinction the supplemental notice in this case does not violate the amendment to rule c because it does not require members to the class action in order to be bound by it the supplemental notice,directed only to those members who had not excluded themselves,merely conditioned the receipt of individualized relief on the submission and proof of the claim for such relief.id.at wisdom,concurring wright,miller kane,at recognizing that class members should not be barred from asserting their rights simply because they failed to demonstrate at the outset of the action that their claims had some validity,even though,once defendant liability is established,the court may be justified in requiring class members to file statements of their claims and barring those not presented at that time.
crazy eddie is likewise unavailing.in that case,a district court denied a request to send an information statement to putative class members,citing sources that counsel against certifying opt in classes.at.then,in a brief unsupported comment,the court added circumstances may require a court to depart from the spirit of the federal rules and impose what amounts to an opt in requirement.those special circumstances are not present in this case.id.the crazy eddie court offered no guidance,however,on circumstances when opt in classes may prove appropriate.it can thus hardly sustain the weight of the district court unprecedented legal conclusions here.
second,even assuming for the argument that rule permits courts to certify opt in classes when certain circumstances prove them necessary,in re ski train fire,at,the district court clearly erred in defining such circumstances.according to the court,the opt in provision was rendered necessary in this case by plaintiffs decision to define class membership by reference to affirmative affirmative consent to being included.the opt in provision was not,therefore,necessary in any objective sense rather,it was necessary only because plaintiffs defined it into necessity.the district court approach would thus authorize opt in classes well beyond the narrow confines of current rule jurisprudence by plaintiffs opt in requests.
on appeal,plaintiffs suggest three additional reasons why an opt in class was appropriate in this action.appellees br.at.first,class members must accept the risk that,if they are required to litigate damages in their own countries and if these foreign courts decline to recognize the liability judgment of american courts,an american judgment may only be evidence of a defendant liability.id.this argument has essentially the same flaw as the district court purported necessity of the opt in provision is a function not of the circumstances of this case,but of the particular litigation strategy that plaintiffs chose to pursue.second,the procedure avoided any question as to whether class members received adequate issue likely to arise in international class actions and t hird,the procedure assured that absent class members desired to be represented by class concern that often arises in the context of serious personal injury claims.id.whatever the merits of these two arguments,they would expand the use of opt in provisions far wider than the present rule jurisprudence conceivably contemplates.after all,adequate notice and satisfactory class representation are salient issues in most class actions.
in short,we can not envisage any circumstances when rule would authorize an opt in class in the liability stage of a litigation.but even if circumstances necessitating the certification of such a class could be shown,neither the district court nor plaintiffs have done so in the case before us.
nor does the district court analogy to the flsa provide support for this novel reconstruction of rule.the court is correct that,unlike rule,the flsa provides that n o employee shall be a party plaintiff to a
