this appeal presents the question of whether a defendant may recover costs and damages from security posted by a plaintiff in obtaining a temporary restraining order tro,even though the plaintiff later filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice,preventing a final adjudication on the merits.the district court for the southern district of new york furman,judge granted plaintiff appellant a tro against defendant appellee windstream communications,windstream.in doing so,the district court required to post security with the court clerk under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure the tro security or rule c security the district court later denied motion for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the tro,concluding that failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying suit.soon afterward,filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice under rule a a i of the federal rules of civil procedure.windstream then moved for an award of costs and damages from the tro security.the district court found that awarding recovery from such security requires a final adjudication on the merits.it went on to conclude,however,that voluntary dismissal without prejudice functioned as a final adjudication on the merits and allowed recovery on the tro security.
we agree that a district court may grant recovery from a tro security after the plaintiff files a notice of voluntary dismissal.we hold that recovery from a tro security requires only a determination that the defendant was wrongfully restrained,and not necessarily a final adjudication on the merits.because the district court never made this specific determination,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for the district court to determine whether,and for what time period,windstream was wrongfully restrained by the tro,and to calculate the damages accordingly.
background 
was,during the relevant time,a small,privately held business engaged in the resale of telecommunications services to calling card providers,call centers,and similar businesses.in turn purchased telecommunications services from paetec communications,paetec under a long distance service calling agreement the service agreement or the agreement entered into on may.the agreement contained a limitations of service clause,which stated that may not purchase services under this retail service agreement and resell services to end users.the agreement also contained a termination provision,stating that a party may terminate the agreement on thirty days written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement.
windstream acquired paetec in late.on march,windstream informed that it had determined that was engaged in resale of windstream services,in violation of the agreement limitations of service clause.windstream indicated that it would raise rates to what the parties later referred to as interim rates between its lower retail rates and its higher wholesale rates until june.windstream stated that it would further increase rates to its standard wholesale rates after june.in response to windstream rate change notification,did not deny that it was engaged in the resale of windstream telecommunications services.instead,alleged that windstream attempt to raise its rates constituted an impermissible restriction on the resale of telecommunications services in violation of federal law.
on may,windstream sent a termination notice.windstream asserted that its differential pricing structure for retail customers and wholesalers was lawful,and that specifically agreed to that distinction when it signed its retail contract.windstream indicated that it interpreted most recent response as an improper refusal to pay the increased rates and that it would terminate services five days later,on may.id.windstream later agreed not to disconnect service before may.
on may,filed a complaint and a motion for a tro against windstream in the district court for the southern district of new york.the district court granted the tro that day,enjoining windstream from terminating service to.in issuing the order,the district court required that deposit,an amount equal to twice the charges on windstream most recent monthly invoice,as security into the registry of the district court.
the district court held a hearing on may,which it continued until june.at the june hearing,the district court determined that it would allow windstream to increase the rates to the wholesale rates effective june until the hearing on motion for a preliminary injunction,scheduled for june.throughout the course of these hearings,the tro remained in effect,and windstream continued to provide telecommunications services to 
at the june,hearing,the district court denied motion for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the tro.the district court concluded that although had established irreparable harm at the time the tro was first issued,any risk of such harm that remained on june resulted from failure to use the time when the tro was in effect to obtain a new service provider.the district court further concluded that had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying contractual dispute.the district court determined that was engaged in the resale of telecommunications services,and that this resale constituted a material breach of the service agreement.finally,in response to contention that windstream may notice of termination was ineffective because it provided that services would be terminated on may,before the end of the agreement termination notice requirement,the district court concluded that this issue was moot.the district court reasoned that under new york law a termination notice that incorrectly identifies the termination date nevertheless becomes effective as of the correct termination date.
after issuing this ruling,the district court asked counsel for windstream whether it objected to the return of the tro security to windstream counsel responded no objection,your honor,considering you are dissolving the tro.the district court also noted that windstream had not filed an answer to complaint,even though windstream answer was due that day.windstream counsel requested an extension,and the district court granted an extension until the following day,june.
early in the day on june,before windstream filed its answer,filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice under rule a a i of the federal rules of civil procedure.three days later,windstream sent a letter to the district court requesting recovery from the tro security.in the letter windstream counsel acknowledged that he had not objected to the return of the tro security at the june hearing.he explained,however,that at the time of the hearing he was not aware that windstream had just issued an invoice in the amount of for services rendered between may,and june.windstream requested that the district court direct the payment of that amount from the tro security.
on january,the district court issued an opinion and order concluding that voluntary dismissal established that windstream was entitled to recover from the tro security.see windstream commc ns,d the district court found that recovery on rule c security a t least in this circuit required a final adjudication on the merits.id.at.the district court nevertheless concluded that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice may function as a final adjudication on the merits for the purpose of recovery on rule c security.id.at.because decision to enter a voluntary dismissal without prejudice immediately followed the court denial of motion for a preliminary injunction and the dissolution of the tro,and because there was no reason to explain voluntary dismissal other than the court determination that was unlikely to prevail on the merits,the district court concluded that the dismissal qualified as a final adjudication on the merits.id.at.finally,the district court calculated the damages recoverable against the tro security at,a figure that it reached based on the interim rates that windstream charged for the period from may,when the tro was first entered to may,and the wholesale rates for the period from june,to june,when the tro was dissolved.id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
raises four issues on appeal.first,argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order recovery from the tro security because the district court order followed voluntary dismissal without prejudice.second,contends that windstream is equitably estopped from asserting and has waived its claim to recovery from the tro security.third,argues that the district court erred in concluding that voluntary dismissal established that windstream had been wrongfully restrained by the tro.finally,asserts that,even if windstream were entitled to recovery from the tro security,the district court erred in calculating the amount based on the rates charged by windstream,rather than the cost to windstream of providing the telecommunications services.we address each argument in turn.
jurisdiction to order recovery on the tro security 
argues that the voluntary dismissal of its complaint deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction to award recovery from the tro security.we review jurisdictional questions de novo.united states ex rel.anti discrimination ctr.of metro,westchester,cir.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure allows a plaintiff one free dismissal.cooter gell hartmarx.the rule permits a plaintiff to dismiss an action without prejudice so long as the plaintiff files a notice of dismissal before the defendant files an answer or motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff has never previously dismissed an action based on or including the same claim.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.a voluntary dismissal without prejudice vitiate s and annul s all prior proceedings and orders in the case,and terminat es jurisdiction over it for the reason that the case has become moot.oneida indian nation of state oneida,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is well established,however,that a federal court may consider collateral issues after an action is no longer pending.cooter gell,at.a district court may,for instance,grant an award of costs or attorney fees or initiate contempt proceedings after a voluntary dismissal without prejudice.id.at.when a district court addresses such collateral issues after a voluntary dismissal,it does not deprive the plaintiff of his right under rule a to dismiss an action without prejudice because the issues resolution does not signify a district court assessment of the legal merits of the complaint.id.at.this is true e ven if a district court indicated that a complaint was not legally tenable or factually well founded for rule purposes,because the resulting rule sanction would nevertheless not preclude the refiling of a complaint.id.
like the rule sanctions at issue in cooter gell,a district court awarding recovery from a rule c security following the voluntary dismissal of a complaint is not a judgment on the merits of an action.at.true,a district court may express its views on the merits of the underlying claims in determining whether a party was wrongfully restrained,just as it may express its views on the merits of the underlying claims in determining whether a complaint is frivolous and warrants sanctions.but that does not preclude the district court from considering collateral issues such as sanctions or recovery from a rule c security.
our conclusion is consistent with the policies underlying both rule a and rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.in cooter gell,the supreme court observed that rule a was designed to curb abuses of nonsuit rules by limiting the right to voluntary dismissal without prejudice to the brief period before the defendant had made a significant commitment of time and money.id.at.similarly,rule operates to deter t he filing of complaints,papers,or other motions without taking the necessary care in their preparation,which constitutes a separate abuse of the judicial system,subject to separate sanction.id.at.
just as the harm triggering rule concerns has already occurred upon the mere filing of baseless papers e ven if the careless litigant quickly dismisses the action,a defendant may have already suffered harm while the tro was in effect even if the tro is subsequently dissolved.the rule c security requirement is designed to assure the restrained party that it may readily collect damages from the funds posted in the event that it was wrongfully restrained,and that it may do so without further litigation and without regard to the possible insolvency of the plaintiff.nokia interdigital,cir.to achieve these purposes,a district court must retain jurisdiction to award costs and damages from rule c security despite the plaintiff entry of a voluntary dismissal under rule a.like the imposition of rule sanctions,moreover,an award of costs and damages from rule c security is useful to deter misconduct.cooter gell,at.discouraging abuse of tros is particularly important given the drastic character of the remedy,pan am.world airways,flight eng rs int l ass n,cir,which may be issued in an ex parte proceeding in which the restrained party lacks the opportunity to be heard,see in re vuitton et fils,cir per curiam.
determining whether a defendant is entitled to recover from a rule c security following a plaintiff voluntary dismissal is also consistent with the expeditious,summary procedure provided for by federal rule of civil procedure.wright miller.rule permits a wrongfully enjoined or restrained party,by motion and without filing an independent action,to collect against a surety on a tro or injunction bond.where a plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed its suit before a final adjudication on the merits,the defendant recovery on the rule c security would similarly be sought by motion and adjudicated in a summary proceeding.
accordingly,the issue of whether the defendant may recover against a rule c security is collateral to the merits of the plaintiff underlying claims.because it is collateral,the district court retains jurisdiction to award recovery against the rule c security after the plaintiff has filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.
ii.equitable estoppel and waiver 
also asserts that windstream is either equitably estopped from asserting or has waived its claim for damages from the tro security because windstream attorney stated at the june hearing that he had n o objection to the release of the tro security.j.where the facts are undisputed,a determination regarding waiver and estoppel is a question of law,reviewed de novo.see jarvis ford motor,cir considering waiver chartier marline,llc,cir considering estoppel.
the district court rejected equitable estoppel and waiver arguments,the former because it found that could not establish detrimental reliance.i,wl,at.we agree with the district court that failed to establish the detrimental reliance required for equitable estoppel.as for waiver,we conclude that windstream attorney statement did not evince a clear and unequivocal intent to forgo recovery against the tro security.
equitable estoppel 
equitable estoppel precludes a person from regaining property or its value where that person makes a definite misrepresentation of fact to another person having reason to believe that the other will rely upon it and the other in reliance upon the misrepresentation so change s his position that it would be unjust to deprive him of that which he thus acquired.heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford,quoting restatement second of torts.a hallmark of the doctrine is its flexible application id.an essential element of equitable estoppel,however,is detrimental reliance on the adverse party misrepresentations.republic of ecuador chevron,cir internal quotation marks,citations and alteration omitted.
we conclude later in this opinion that a recovery on rule c security turns on a determination that the defendant was wrongfully restrained.because windstream ability to recover on the tro security did not depend on voluntary dismissal,and because does not identify any other actions that it took in reliance on windstream counsel representations during the brief,period between the june hearing and windstream request for costs and damages from the tro security,we find that failed to establish detrimental reliance.
waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.hamilton atlas turner,cir.although we have recognized that waiver may be inferred from the conduct of the parties,we have emphasized that t he conduct said to constitute a waiver must be clear and unequivocal,as waivers are never to be lightly inferred.mooney city of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we will infer a waiver only where the parties were aware of their rights and made the conscious choice,for whatever reason,to waive them.id.internal quotation marks omitted.mere negligence,oversight,or thoughtlessness does not create a waiver.d estoppel and waiver.
we have little difficulty rejecting waiver argument.although windstream did indicate that it had n o objection to the release of the tro security during the june hearing,this brief colloquy included no mention of windstream right to recover damages from the tro security before it was released.the remarks of windstream counsel,then,evince no conscious or unequivocal choice to forgo recovery from the tro security.on the contrary,there is no reason to doubt counsel representation that his remarks reflected his unawareness that windstream had issued an invoice for services rendered during the time the tro was in effect,and that this invoice had not been paid.waiver is an equitable doctrine based upon fairness and justice,which we use to avoid a result where parties have conducted themselves in such a way as to make that result unfair.estoppel and waiver.that standard was not met here.
iii.determining recovery on rule c security following a voluntary dismissal without prejudice 
rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure allows for recovery on posted security where the party has been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.citing our decision in blumenthal merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,argues,and the district court held,that determining whether a defendant was wrongfully restrained requires a final adjudication on the merits.additionally argues that the district court erred to the extent it concluded that voluntary dismissal constituted the requisite final determination on the merits.we review a district court decision to grant or deny recovery against an injunction bond for abuse of discretion,recognizing that the court discretion should be exercised in a manner consistent with the presumption that wrongfully enjoined parties are entitled to recovery against the bond for provable damages.nokia,at.the abuse of discretion standard entails de novo review for legal issues and clear error review for factual findings.united states legros,cir.
whether determining wrongful restraint requires a final adjudication on the merits 
the supreme court has held that whether a party has been wrongfully enjoined or restrained is not always coextensive with a final adjudication on the merits.see grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund.in grupo mexicano,the plaintiffs,various investment funds,had purchased unsecured notes of the defendant,grupo mexicano de desarrollo,gmd,a mexican company involved in the construction of a toll road sponsored by the mexican government.id.at.due to a downturn in the mexican economy,the mexican government assisted various entities involved in the construction of the toll road,including gmd,by issuing guaranteed notes to them.id.at.the problems in the mexican economy persisted,gmd started to negotiate a restructuring of its debt,and reports began to circulate suggesting that gmd was dissipating its most valuable assets the guaranteed notes issued by the mexican government to the detriment of its creditors,including the investment funds.id.at.
the investment funds brought suit in the district court for the southern district of new york to recover on their unsecured notes following gmd default.id.at.the district court granted a tro and then a preliminary injunction prohibiting gmd from transferring the notes.id.at.while the interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction was pending,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the investment funds and converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.id.at.gmd ultimately chose not to appeal the grant of summary judgment or the permanent injunction,but continued with its appeal of the preliminary injunction.id.at.
the supreme court agreed that the preliminary injunction should not have been issued,even though the plaintiffs prevailed on the merits.the court explained that,in the usual case,the final injunction establishes the substantive validity of the preliminary injunction because t he final injunction establishes that the defendant should not have been engaging in the conduct that was enjoined.id.at emphasis in original.at times,however,the substantive validity of the final injunction does not establish the substantive validity of the preliminary one,so the defendants may establish that they have been harmed by the issuance of the unauthorized preliminary injunction and hence should be able to recover on the bond even if the final injunction is proper.id.emphasis in original.the court concluded that grupo mexicano presented the latter type of case because the district court had enjoined the defendant transfer of assets in contravention of the historical principle that before judgment or its equivalent an unsecured creditor here,the investment funds has no rights at law or in equity in the property of his debtor.id.at.
just as an injunction may have been improperly issued even though the plaintiff ultimately prevails on the merits,a defendant may have been properly enjoined even though the plaintiff ultimately loses on the merits.several circuits have held,for instance,that,where a plaintiff acquires temporary relief to enforce an procedure required under a collective bargaining agreement,the defendant may not necessarily recover from the rule c security even though it ultimately prevails in the arbitration process.see newspaper periodical drivers helpers union,local newspaper agency,cir miscellaneous drivers,helpers,heath care pub.emps.union local kroger,cir lever.int l chem.workers union,local,cir.these decisions reason that a procedure in a collective bargaining agreement establishes a procedural right distinct from the underlying merits of any given labor dispute.thus,temporary relief enforcing this procedural right may be properly issued even if the defendant ultimately prevails on the merits in arbitration.see newspaper periodical drivers helpers union,at.
although resolving the propriety of temporary relief can be distinct from the final adjudication on the merits,as in grupo mexicano,in the usual case the wrongfulness inquiry generally must be resolved by a trial on the merits.of camenisch,emphasis added see also guzman local,serv.emps.int l union,cir finding that the claim should be resolved only after the district court has conducted a full evidentiary hearing where the defendant claim to recovery from the injunction bond turned on whether the defendant was entitled to refrain from the conduct compelled by injunction.that is because it is the final adjudication on the merits,after the full presentation of the parties cases,that ordinarily establishes whether the defendant should not have been engaging in the conduct that was enjoined.see grupo mexicano,at.tro and preliminary injunction proceedings do not typically give the parties the benefit of a full opportunity to present their cases or a final judicial decision based on the actual merits of the controversy.camenisch,at.
our decision in blumenthal is illustrative.there,the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the two plaintiffs,former merrill lynch brokers,from soliciting the firm clients using its customer records.at.following arbitration proceedings before the new york stock exchange,the arbitrator found that the plaintiffs had the right to use the customer records and that the injunction should be lifted.id.the district court,however,denied recovery by the plaintiffs against the injunction bond.id.we reversed and held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover costs and damages against the rule c bond.id.at.in light of the ultimate decision on the merits by the arbitrators,we concluded,merrill lynch was not entitled to the injunction it received and that the plaintiffs had at all times the right to do business with their merrill lynch clients.id.at.
that a trial on the merits is usually required to determine whether the defendant was entitled to engage in the conduct that was enjoined is true irrespective of whether the defendant seeks recovery on security posted to secure a tro or a preliminary injunction.in both situations it is only upon full presentation of the parties evidence that it may typically be determined whether the defendant should have been restrained or enjoined.but the need for a final adjudication on the merits does not apply where,as here,a plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed its suit following the order for temporary relief.by voluntarily dismissing its suit,the plaintiff has,in effect,abandoned its right to a full opportunity to present its case or of a final judicial decision based on the actual merits of the controversy.camenisch,at.having decided that its claims should not be pursued to trial,the plaintiff can hardly insist that the defendant have no opportunity to establish that it was wrongfully restrained.
this holding resolves the district court concerns over the potential abuse of tros in this context.if a final adjudication on the merits is necessary to award recovery on a tro security,a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses an action after a tro has been issued reaps the benefit of the tro and,at the same time,deprives the defendant of an opportunity to establish that the tro ought not to have been granted.ii,d at quoting belfer minko,cv,wl,at.apparently motivated by that concern,a number of district courts including the district court here have concluded that a voluntary dismissal may operate as a final adjudication on the merits for purposes of recovery from security posted to secure a tro however,by rejecting the premise that a final adjudication on the merits is always required for recovery on rule c security,our holding resolves this problem without redefining a dismissal without prejudice as its opposite,an adjudication upon the merits.semtek int l,lockheed martin.
in sum,we reject assertion and the district court holding that recovery on rule c security always requires a final adjudication on the merits.following the voluntary dismissal of a plaintiff complaint,recovery on rule c security requires only a determination that the defendant was wrongfully restrained.
whether windstream was wrongfully restrained 
windstream argues that,even if the district court erred in reasoning that notice of voluntary dismissal established the wrongfulness of the tro,the district court denial of motion for a preliminary injunction and dissolution of the tro establishes that windstream was wrongfully restrained.this argument has some merit.when a plaintiff files a voluntary dismissal under rule a,the district court denial of the plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction may establish that the tro should not have been granted and the defendant was wrongfully restrained by a preceding tro.middlewest motor freight bureau united states,cir where a party fails to prove grounds sufficient for the grant of an interlocutory injunction,he at the same time shows that the temporary restraining order should not have been granted,at least to the extent of rendering him liable in restitution for benefits received under the temporary restraining order.qualcomm,motorola,when a court denies a preliminary injunction after it has granted a contested tro,the restrained party has been wrongfully restrained,given that a tro is only intended to last until a preliminary injunction hearing is held.
yet,just as the substantive validity of the final injunction does not always establish the substantive validity of the preliminary one,grupo mexicano,at emphasis in original,denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction and dissolution of a tro will not always establish that the defendant was wrongfully restrained.for instance,a plaintiff may fail to prove at the preliminary injunction stage that she will suffer irreparable harm from the defendant conduct or that the public interest weighs in favor of an injunction.see winter natural res.def.council.if the denial of the preliminary injunction is based on some ground other than the lawfulness of the defendant conduct,then the denial of the preliminary injunction may not be sufficient to show that the defendant was wrongfully restrained.it may also be that although a tro was justified for a portion of the time period it was in effect,it was not justified for the entire period.
after a district court has granted a tro,the burden remains on the plaintiff to show that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction.granny goose foods,of teamsters auto truck drivers local of alameda.thus,where a district court dissolves a tro without granting the plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction,a plaintiff seeking to defeat the defendant request for recovery from the tro security bears the burden of establishing that the defendant was not wrongfully restrained and is,therefore,not entitled to recover from the tro security.a plaintiff may satisfy this burden by showing that the defendant did not have the legal right to engage in the conduct restrained while the tro was in effect,notwithstanding the denial of the preliminary injunction.if the plaintiff fails to make this showing,then the dissolution of the tro likely establishes that the defendant was wrongfully restrained,and the defendant consequently enjoys a presumption in favor of recovery against the security for provable damages.nokia,at.
the effect of the notice of termination provision in the parties contract here illustrates the complexities of this analysis.when the tro was first issued,it performed two functions.first,the tro prevented windstream from terminating service based on refusal to pay the higher rates that windstream had imposed on second,the tro prevented windstream from cutting off service before june,the last day of the service agreement termination notice period.
the district court effectively rejected the first basis for the tro when it found,at the june,preliminary injunction hearing,that had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying contractual dispute about resale of windstream services.that determination,however,does not establish that windstream was wrongfully restrained for the period up until june when the tro arguably functioned to enforce the termination notice clause.the district court declined to address contention that windstream may notice of termination violated the termination notice clause,concluding that the issue had become moot because,at the time of the hearing,thirty days had passed since the notice of termination.
the district court finding that was unlikely to prevail on the merits of its underlying contractual claim is irrelevant,however,to the validity of the tro in enforcing the termination notice provision.such a provision provides a window of time during which a business may locate a different service provider,thereby preventing disruption in the business operations that could result in an irreparable loss of customer goodwill.eastman kodak collins ink,d,granting preliminary injunction to enforce contractual termination notice provision.although the district court found at the june hearing that any remaining risk of irreparable harm derived from.failure to use the time the tro afforded to locate a new telecommunications service provider,the district court made clear that,when the tro was initially issued,had established a risk of irreparable harm if windstream services were so abruptly cut off.
although the enforcement of the termination notice provision may have been an appropriate basis for the initial issuance of the tro,whether windstream may recover from the tro security for unpaid charges for that period requires a different analysis.a wrongfully restrained defendant may recover against a tro security to cover the costs and damages incurred as a resul
