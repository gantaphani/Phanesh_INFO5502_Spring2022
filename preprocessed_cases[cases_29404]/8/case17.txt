petitioners,teva pharmaceuticals and related firms,own a patent that covers a manufacturing method for the multiple sclerosis drug copaxone.when respondents,sandoz,and other firms,tried to market a generic version of the drug,teva sued them for patent infringement.sandoz countered that the patent was invalid.specifically,sandoz argued that the claim that copaxone active ingredient had a molecular weight of to kilodaltons was fatally indefinite,see,because it did not state which of three methods of calculation the weight of the most prevalent molecule,the weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules,or weight as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for more was used to determine that weight.after considering conflicting expert evidence,the district court concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was thus valid.as relevant here,it found that in context a skilled artisan would understand that the term molecular weight referred to molecular weight as calculated by the first method.in finding the molecular weight term indefinite and the patent invalid on appeal,the federal circuit reviewed de novo all aspects of the district court claim construction,including the district court determination of subsidiary facts.
held when reviewing a district court resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim,the federal circuit must apply a clear error,not a de novo,standard of review.
a federal rule of civil procedure a states that a court of appeals must not set aside a district court f indings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.it sets out a clear command,anderson bessemer city,and does not make exceptions or exclude certain categories of factual findings from the court of appeals obligation,swint.the rule thus applies to both subsidiary and ultimate facts.ibid.and the function of an appeals court reviewing the findings of a district court sitting without a jury is not to decide factual issues de novo.anderson,supra,at.even if exceptions to the rule were permissible,there is no convincing ground for creating an exception here.markman westview instruments,neither created,nor argued for,such an exception.there,the court held that the ultimate question of claim construction is for the judge,not the jury,at,but it did not thereby create an exception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.instead,the court pointed out that a judge,in construing a patent claim,is engaged in much the same task as the judge would be in construing other written instruments,such as deeds,contracts,or tariffs,at.construction of written instruments often presents a question solely of law,at least when the words in those instruments are used in their ordinary meaning.great northern merchants elevator.but if a written instrument uses technical words or phrases not commonly understood,at,those words may give rise to a factual dispute.if so,extrinsic evidence may help to establish a usage of trade or locality.ibid.and in that circumstance,the determination of the matter of fact will preced e the function of construction.ibid.
the markman court also recognized that courts will sometimes have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes in patent construction rule requires appellate courts to review such disputes under the clearly erroneous standard.application of this standard is further supported by precedent and by practical considerations.clear error review is particularly important in patent cases because a district court judge who has presided over,and listened to,the entire proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain the necessary familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles,graver tank linde air products,than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just those portions referenced by the parties.
b arguments to the contrary are unavailing.sandoz claims that separating factual from legal questions may be difficult and,like the federal circuit,posits that it is simpler for the appellate court to review the entirety of the district court claim construction de novo than to apply two separate standards.but courts of appeals have long been able to separate factual from legal matters,see,first options of chicago,kaplan,and the federal circuit efforts to treat factual findings and legal conclusions similarly have brought with them their own complexities.as for sandoz argument that clear error review will bring about less uniformity,neither the circuit nor sandoz has shown that divergent claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact on subsidiary matters should occur more than occasionally.
c this leaves the question of how the clear error standard should be applied when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in patent claim construction.when the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent,the judge determination is solely a determination of law,and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo.however,where the district court needs to consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand,for example,the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period,and where those subsidiary facts are in dispute,courts will need to make subsidiary factual findings about the extrinsic evidence.the district judge,after deciding the factual dispute,will then interpret the patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them.the ultimate construction of the claim is a legal conclusion that the appellate court can review de novo.but to overturn the judge resolution of an underlying factual dispute,the appellate court must find that the judge,in respect to those factual findings,has made a clear error.
d here,for example,the district court made a factual finding,crediting teva expert account,and thereby rejecting sandoz expert contrary explanation,about how a skilled artisan would understand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data reflects molecular weights.based on that factual finding,the district court reached the legal conclusion that figure did not undermine teva argument that molecular weight referred to the first method of calculating molecular weight.when the federal circuit reviewed the district court decision,it did not accept teva expert explanation,and it failed to accept that explanation without finding that the district court contrary determination was clearly erroneous.the federal circuit erred in failing to review this factual finding only for clear error.teva asserts that there are two additional instances in which the federal circuit rejected the district court factual findings without concluding that they were clearly erroneous those matters are left for the federal circuit to consider on remand.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in markman westview instruments,we explained that a patent claim is that portion of the patent document that defines the scope of the patentee rights.at.we held that the construction of a patent,including terms of art within its claim,is not for a jury but exclusively for the court to determine.ibid.that is so even where the construction of a term of art has evidentiary underpinnings.at.
today case involves claim construction with evidentiary underpinnings.see part iii,infra.and,it requires us to determine what standard the court of appeals should use when it reviews a trial judge resolution of an underlying factual dispute.should the court of appeals review the district court factfinding de novo as it would review a question of law or,should it review that factfinding as it would review a trial judge factfinding in other cases,namely by taking them as correct unless clearly erroneous see fed.rule civ.proc.a.we hold that the appellate court must apply a clear error,not a de novo,standard of review.
the basic dispute in this case concerns the meaning of the words molecular weight as those words appear in a patent claim.the petitioners,teva pharmaceuticals along with related firms,own the relevant patent.the patent covers a manufacturing method for copaxone,a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis.the drug active ingredient,called is made up of molecules of varying sizes.app.and the relevant claim describes that ingredient as having a molecular weight of to kilodaltons.at.
the respondents,sandoz,and several other firms,tried to market a generic version of copaxone.teva sued sandoz for patent infringement.supp,sdny.sandoz defended the suit by arguing that the patent was invalid.ibid.the patent act requires that a claim particularly poin t out and distinctly clai m the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.ed.see nautilus,biosig instruments,slip,at.the phrase molecular weight of to kilodaltons,said sandoz,did not satisfy this requirement.
the reason that the phrase is fatally indefinite,sandoz argued,is that,in the context of this patent claim,the term molecular weight might mean any one of three different things.the phrase might refer to molecular weight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that is most prevalent in the mix that makes up.the scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is,we are told,peak average molecular weight.the phrase might refer to molecular weight as calculated by taking all the molecules in the mix that makes up and calculating the average weight,adding up the weight of each molecule and dividing by the number of molecules.the scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is,we are told,number average molecular weight.or,the phrase might refer to molecular weight as calculated by taking all the molecules in the mix that makes up and calculating their average weight while giving heavier molecules a bonus when doing so.the scientific term for molecular weight so calculated,we are told,is weight average molecular weight.see,ca fed.app.in sandoz view,since teva patent claim does not say which method of calculation should be used,the claim phrase molecular weight is indefinite,and the claim fails to satisfy the critical patent law requirement.
the district court,after taking evidence from experts,concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite.among other things,it found that in context a skilled artisan would understand that the term molecular weight referred to molecular weight as calculated by the first method,peak average molecular weight.supp,at see nautilus,supra,at slip,at t he definiteness inquiry trains on the understanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent application in part for this reason,the district court held the patent valid.supp,at.
on appeal,the federal circuit held to the contrary.it found that the term molecular weight was indefinite.and it consequently held the patent invalid,at.in reaching this conclusion,the federal circuit reviewed de novo all aspects of the district court claim construction,including the district court determination of subsidiary facts,at,see also light ing ballast control llc philips electronics north am,ca fed.en banc reaffirming de novo review of district court claim construction.
teva filed a petition for certiorari.and we granted that petition.the federal circuit reviews the claim construction decisions of federal district courts throughout the nation,and we consequently believe it important to clarify the standard of review that it must apply when doing so.
federal rule of civil procedure a states that a court of appeals must not set aside a district court f indings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.in our view,this rule and the standard it sets forth must apply when a court of appeals reviews a district court resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim.we have made clear that the rule sets forth a clear command.anderson bessemer city.it does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings from the obligation of a court of appeals to accept a district court findings unless clearly erroneous.swint.accordingly,the rule applies to both subsidiary and ultimate facts.ibid.and we have said that,when reviewing the findings of a district court sitting without a jury,appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues de novo.anderson,supra,at quoting zenith radio hazeltine research.
even if exceptions to the rule were permissible,we can not find any convincing ground for creating an exception to that rule here.the rules advisory committee pointed out that,in general,exceptions would tend to undermine the legitimacy of the district courts,multiply appeals,and needlessly reallocate judicial authority.advisory committee note on subd.a of fed.rule civ.proc,see also anderson,supra,at de novo review of factual findings would very likely contribute only negligibly to accuracy at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources 
our opinion in markman neither created,nor argued for,an exception to rule a.the question presented in that case was a seventh amendment question should a jury or a judge construe patent claims,at.we pointed out that history provides no clear answer,at.the task primarily involves the construction of written instruments,at.and that task is better matched to a judge skills,at the construction of written instruments is one of those things that judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors unburdened by training in exegesis we consequently held that claim construction falls exclusively within the province of the court,not that of the jury,at.
when describing claim construction we concluded that it was proper to treat the ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent as a question of law in the way that we treat document construction as a question of law,at.but this does not imply an exception to rule a for underlying factual disputes.we used the term question of law while pointing out that a judge,in construing a patent claim,is engaged in much the same task as the judge would be in construing other written instruments,such as deeds,contracts,or tariffs,at,see also motion picture patents universal film,patent claims are aptly likened to the description in a deed,which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains goodyear dental vulcanite davis,analogizing patent construction to the construction of other written instruments like contracts.construction of written instruments often presents a question solely of law,at least when the words in those instruments are used in their ordinary meaning.great northern merchants elevator.but sometimes,say when a written instrument uses technical words or phrases not commonly understood,at,those words may give rise to a factual dispute.if so,extrinsic evidence may help to establish a usage of trade or locality.ibid.and in that circumstance,the determination of the matter of fact will preced e the function of construction.see also lord,williston on contracts,ed.in contract interpretation,the existence of a usage a practice or method in the relevant industry is a question of fact internal quotation marks omitted.this factual determination,like all other factual determinations,must be reviewed for clear error.see,supra at the rule does not exclude certain categories of factual findings and applies to both subsidiary and ultimate facts internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,when we held in markman that the ultimate question of claim construction is for the judge and not the jury,we did not create an exception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.markman no more creates an exception to rule a than would a holding that judges,not juries,determine equitable claims,such as requests for injunctions.a conclusion that an issue is for the judge does not indicate that rule a is inapplicable.see fed.rule civ.proc.setting the standard of review for factual findings and conclusions by the court emphasis added.
while we held in markman that the ultimate issue of the proper construction of a claim should be treated as a question of law,we also recognized that in patent construction,subsidiary factfinding is sometimes necessary.indeed,we referred to claim construction as a practice with evidentiary underpinnings,a practice that falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact.at.we added that sometimes courts may have to make credibility judgments about witnesses,at.in other words,we recognized that courts may have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes.and,as explained above,the rule requires appellate courts to review all such subsidiary factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.
precedent further supports application of the clearly erroneous standard.before the creation of the federal circuit,the second circuit explained that in claim construction,the subsidiary question of how the art understood the term was plainly a question of fact and unless the district court finding was clearly erroneous,we are to take it as controlling.harries air king products,hand.we have said the same as to subsidiary factual findings concerning other patent law inquiries,including obviousness.dennison panduit,per curiam subsidiary determinations of the district court subject to rule a clear error standard.
finally,practical considerations favor clear error review.we have previously pointed out that clear error review is particularly important where patent law is at issue because patent law is a field where so much depends upon familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles not usually contained in the general storehouse of knowledge and experience.graver tank linde air products.a district court judge who has presided over,and listened to,the entirety of a proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain that familiarity than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just those portions to which the parties have referred.lighting ballast,at,dissenting federal circuit judges lack the tools that district courts have available to resolve factual disputes fairly and accurately,such as questioning the experts,examining the invention in operation,or appointing a expert anderson,at the trial judge major role is the determination of fact,and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise 
sandoz argues that claim construction mostly consists of construing a set of written documents that do not give rise to subsidiary factual disputes.tr.of oral arg.it adds that separating factual from legal questions is often difficult.and sandoz,like the federal circuit itself,argues that it is simpler for that appellate court to review the entirety of the district court claim construction de novo rather than to apply two separate standards,at see also lighting ballast,supra,at criticizing clear error review in part because of the purportedly difficult task of disentangling fact from law.
but even were we free to ignore the federal rule which we are not,we would not find this argument convincing.courts of appeals have long found it possible to separate factual from legal matters.see,first options of chicago,kaplan,review of factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo is the ordinary standard for courts of appeals.at the same time,the federal circuit efforts to treat factual findings and legal conclusions similarly have brought with them their own complexities.see,cybor fas technologies,ca fed.en banc claim construction does not involve factual evidentiary findings citation and internal quotation marks omitted lighting ballast,supra,at claim construction has arguably factual aspects dow jones ablaise,ca fed.t his court,while reviewing claim construction without deference,takes into account the views of the trial judge nazomi communications,arm holdings,plc,ca fed.c ommon sense dictates that the trial judge view will carry weight citation and internal quotation marks omitted lightning ballast,supra,at lourie,concurring we should rarely overturn district court true subsidiary factfinding we should,and do,give proper informal deference to the work of judges of a subordinate tribunal cybor,supra,at opinion of newman,by continuing the fiction that there are no facts to be found in claim interpretations,we confound rather than ease the litigation process see also anderson,supra,at the parties have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much brief for peter menell et as amici curiae federal circuit overturns district court claim construction at unusually high rate.
finally,the circuit feared that clear error review would bring about less uniformity.lighting ballast,supra,at.neither the circuit nor sandoz,however,has shown that or explained why divergent claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact on subsidiary matters should occur more than occasionally.after all,the federal circuit will continue to review de novo the district court ultimate interpretation of the patent claims.and the attorneys will no doubt bring cases construing the same claim to the attention of the trial judge those prior cases will sometimes be binding because of issue preclusion,see markman,at,and sometimes will serve as persuasive authority.moreover,it is always possible to consolidate for discovery different cases that involve construction of the same claims.and,as we said in markman,subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated claim construction,at.
the dissent argues that claim construction does not involve any factfinding,or,if it does,claim construction factfinding is akin to the factfinding that underlies our interpretation of statutes.post,at,opinion of thomas.its first,broader contention runs contrary to our recognition in markman that claim construction has evidentiary underpinnings and that courts construing patent claims must sometimes make credibility judgments about witnesses,at.indeed,as discussed in part iii,infra,this case provides a perfect example of the factfinding that sometimes underlies claim construction the parties here presented the district court with competing claims by different experts,and the district court resolved the issues of fact that divided those experts.
the dissent contention also runs contrary to sandoz concession at oral argument that claim construction will sometimes require subsidiary factfinding.tr.of oral arg.it is in tension with our interpretation of related areas of patent law,such as the interpretation of obviousness,which we have said involves subsidiary factfinding subject to rule a clear error review.see dennison,at.and it fights the question presented in this case,which assumes the existence of such factfinding.see pet.for cert.i whether a district court factual finding in support of its construction of a patent claim term may be reviewed de novo,or only for clear error 
neither do we find factfinding in this context sufficiently similar to the factfinding that underlies statutory interpretation.statutes,in general,address themselves to the general public patent claims concern a small portion of that public.statutes typically though not always rest upon congressional consideration of general facts related to a reasonably broad set of social circumstances patents typically though not always rest upon consideration by a few private parties,experts,and administrators of more narrowly circumscribed facts related to specific technical matters.the public,and often an adversarial public,typically considers and discusses the relevant general facts before congress enacts a statute only private parties,experts,and administrators likely consider the relevant technical facts before the award of a patent.given these differences,it is not surprising that this court has never previously compared patent claim construction in any here relevant way to statutory construction.as discussed supra,at,however,the court has repeatedly compared patent claim construction to the construction of other written instruments such as deeds and contracts.see,markman,supra,at,motion picture patent,at goodyear,at.
now that we have set forth why the federal circuit must apply clear error review when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in patent claim construction,it is necessary to explain how the rule must be applied in that context.we recognize that a district court construction of a patent claim,like a district court interpretation of a written instrument,often requires the judge only to examine and to construe the document words without requiring the judge to resolve any underlying factual disputes.as all parties agree,when the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent the patent claims and specifications,along with the patent prosecution history,the judge determination will amount solely to a determination of law,and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo.see brief for petitioners,reply brief brief for respondents see also brief for united states as amicus curiae.
in some cases,however,the district court will need to look beyond the patent intrinsic evidence and to consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand,for example,the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.see,seymour osborne,wall,a patent may be so interspersed with technical terms and terms of art that the testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable to a correct understanding of its meaning in cases where those subsidiary facts are in dispute,courts will need to make subsidiary factual findings about that extrinsic evidence.these are the evidentiary underpinnings of claim construction that we discussed in markman,and this subsidiary factfinding must be reviewed for clear error on appeal.
for example,if a district court resolves a dispute between experts and makes a factual finding that,in general,a certain term of art had a particular meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention,the district court must then conduct a legal analysis whether a skilled artisan would ascribe that same meaning to that term in the context of the specific patent claim under review.that is because e xperts may be examined to explain terms of art,and the state of the art,at any given time,but they can not be used to prove the proper or legal construction of any instrument of writing.winans new york erie,how,see also markman,supra,at where technical terms are used,or where the qualities of substances or any similar data necessary to the comprehension of the language of the patent are unknown to the judge,the testimony of witnesses may be received upon these subjects,and any other means of information be employed.but in the actual interpretation of the patent the court proceeds upon its own responsibility,as an arbiter of the law,giving to the patent its true and final character and force quoting robinson,law of patents,emphasis in original.
accordingly,the question we have answered here concerns review of the district court resolution of a subsidiary factual dispute that helps that court determine the proper interpretation of the written patent claim.the district judge,after deciding the factual dispute,will then interpret the patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them.this ultimate interpretation is a legal conclusion.the appellate court can still review the district court ultimate construction of the claim de novo.but,to overturn the judge resolution of an underlying factual dispute,the court of appeals must find that the judge,in respect to those factual findings,has made a clear error.fed.rule civ.proc.a.
in some instances,a factual finding will play only a small role in a judge ultimate legal conclusion about the meaning of the patent term.but in some instances,a factual finding may be close to dispositive of the ultimate legal question of the proper meaning of the term in the context of the patent.nonetheless,the ultimate question of construction will remain a legal question.simply because a factual finding may be nearly dispositive does not render the subsidiary question a legal one.a n issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate legal question.miller fenton.it is analogous to a judge sitting without a jury deciding whether a defendant gave a confession voluntarily.the answer to the legal question about the voluntariness of the may turn upon the answer to a subsidiary factual question,say whether in fact the police engaged in the intimidation tactics alleged by the defendant.at.an appellate court will review the trial judge factual determination about the alleged intimidation deferentially though,after reviewing the factual findings,it will review a judge ultimate determination of voluntariness de novo.see,at.an appellate court similarly should review for clear error those factual findings that underlie a district court claim construction.
we can illustrate our holding by considering an instance in which teva,with the support of the solicitor general,argues that the federal circuit wrongly reviewed the district court factual finding de novo.see brief for petitioners brief for united states as amicus curiae.recall that teva patent claim specifies an active ingredient with a molecular weight of about to kilodaltons.recall sandoz basic argument,namely that the term molecular weight is indefinite or ambiguous.the term might refer to the weight of the most numerous molecule,it might refer to weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules,or it might refer to weight as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for more.the claim,sandoz argues,does not tell us which way we should calculate weight.see part i,supra.
to illustrate,imagine we have a sample of the active ingredient made up of molecules weigh kilodaltons each,weigh kilodaltons each,and weigh kilodaltons each.using the first method of calculation,the molecular weight would be kilodaltons,the weight of the most prevalent molecule.using the second method,the molecular weight would be total weight,divided by the number of molecules.using the third method,the molecular weight would be more than,depending upon how much extra weight we gave to the heavier molecules.
teva argued in the district court that the term molecular weight in the patent meant molecular weight calculated in the first way the weight of the most prevalent molecule,or peak average molecular weight.sandoz,however,argued that figure of the patent showed that teva could not be right.supp,at.we have set forth figure in the appendix,infra.that figure,said sandoz,helped to show that the patent term did not refer to the first method of calculation.figure shows how the weights of a sample molecules were distributed in three different samples.the curves indicate the number of molecules of each weight that were present in each of the three.for example,the figure legend says that the first sample molecular weight is.according to teva,that should mean that molecules weighing kilodaltons were the most prevalent molecules in the sample.but,look at the curve,said sandoz.it shows that the most prevalent molecule weighed,not kilodaltons,but slightly less than about kilodaltons.see app.after all,the peak of the first molecular weight distribution curve the solid curve in the figure is not at precisely kilodaltons,but at a point just before.thus,argued sandoz,the figure shows that the patent claim term molecular weight did not mean molecular weight calculated by the first method.it must mean something else.it is indefinite.supp,at.
the district court did not accept sandoz argument.teva expert testified that a skilled artisan would understand that converting data from a chromatogram to molecular weight distribution curves like those in figure would cause the peak on each curve to shift slightly this could explain the difference between the value indicated by the peak of the curve about and the value in the figure legend.app.sandoz expert testified that no such shift would occur.app.the district court credited teva expert account,thereby rejecting sandoz expert explanation.supp,at brief for respondents.the district court finding about this matter was a factual finding about how a skilled artisan would understand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data reflects molecular weights.based on that factual finding,the district court reached the legal conclusion that figure did not undermine teva argument that molecular weight referred to the first method of calculation peak average molecular weight.supp,at.
when the federal circuit reviewed the district court decision,it recognized that the peak of the curve did not match the kilodaltons listed in the legend of figure,at.but the federal circuit did not accept teva expert explanation as to how a skilled artisan would expect the peaks of the curves to shift.and it failed to accept that explanation without finding that the district court contrary determination was clearly erroneous.see ibid.the federal circuit should have accepted the district court finding unless it was clearly erroneous.our holding today makes clear that,in failing to do so,the federal circuit was wrong.
teva claims that there are two additional instances in which the federal circuit rejected the district court factual findings without concluding that they were clearly erroneous.we leave these matters for the federal circuit to consider on remand in light of today opinion.
we vacate the federal circuit judgment,and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice thomas,with whom justice alito joins,dissenting.
i agree with the court conclusion that there is no special exception to federal rule of civil procedure a for claim construction.but that is not the question in this case.because rule a provides for clear error review only of findings of fact and does not apply to conclusions of law,swint,the question here is whether claim construction involves findings of fact because it does not,rule a does not apply,and the court of appeals properly applied a de novo standard of review.
in reaching the contrary conclusion,the majority fails to engage the vexing distinction between questions of fact and questions of law.at.unfortunately,rule a does not furnish particular guidance with respect to distinguishing law from fact,and we have found it difficult to discern any other rule or principle that will unerringly differentiate the two.ibid.that inquiry is thus not as simple as pointing out the undeniable evidentiary underpinnings of claim construction.ante,at.
instead,we must consider how findings of fact and conclusions of law were understood at the time rule was adopted.tome united states,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment noting that,because the federal rules have their background in principles,the body of common law knowledge must be a source of guidance in our interpretation of the rules internal quotation marks omitted.unfortunately,the evidence of this court treatment of evidentiary determinations underlying claim construction is inconclusive.in several decisions,the court considered extrinsic evidence related to claim construction with no apparent deference to the district courts findings based on that evidence.coupe royer,loom higgins,tilghman proctor,winans denmead,how.none of those decisions,however,expressly turned on a disagreement over a subsidiary evidentiary determination.
absent specific evidence of the treatment of a particular issue at the time rule was adopted,we have drawn analogies to the treatment of other issues under rule a.see,pullman,supra,at.in general,we have treated determinations as analytically more akin to a fact the more they pertain to a simple historical fact of the case,and as analytically more akin to a legal conclusion the more they define rules applicable beyond the parties dispute.miller fenton,see also bose consumers union of united states,baumgartner united states.under this approach,determinations underlying claim construction fall on the law side of the dividing line.
patents are written instruments,so other written instruments supply the logical analogy.see markman westview instruments.and as the majority recognizes,the construction of written instruments is generally a question of law.see ante,at.but in certain contexts,a court construing a written instrument makes subsidiary determinations that the law treats as findings of fact.
the classic case of a written instrument whose construction does not involve subsidiary findings of fact is a statute.our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings underlying statutory construction as conclusions of law makes sense for two reasons.
first,although statutory construction may demand some inquiry into legislative intent,that inquiry is analytically legal the meaning of a statute does not turn on what an individual lawmaker intended as a matter of fact,but only on what intent has been enacted into law through the constitutionally defined channels of bicameralism and presentment.see wyeth levine,thomas,concurring in judgment.this remains so even if deciding what passed through those channels requires a court to determine a fact of historical understanding through an examination of extrinsic evidence.see,sosa,examining the historical understanding of the term law of nations when the alien tort statute was enacted see also,mcintyre ohio elections comm n,thomas,concurring in judgment construing a constitutional provision by asking how the words were originally understood and marshaling evidence of that understanding.the court has given no hint that this practice changes when the statute it construes is a land patent that is,a public land grant.see leo sheep united states,making detailed historical findings in the course of construing a land grant because courts,in construing a statute,may with propriety recur to the history of the times when it was passed in order to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of particular provisions in it see also marvin brandt revocable trust united states,slip,at looking to the historical background against which a land grant was passed to confirm its interpretation.
second,statutes govern the rights and duties of the public as a whole,so subsidiary evidentiary findings shape legal rules that apply far beyond the boundaries of the dispute involved.our rules of construction for legislative acts have long been consciously shaped by the public stake in those acts.see,the binghamton bridge,wall,describing a rule of construction borrowed from english common law and reflected in the decisions of the several states.
the construction of contracts and deeds,by contrast,sometimes involves subsidiary findings of fact.our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings as findings of fact in this context makes sense because,in construing contracts and deeds,the avowed purpose and primary function of the court is to ascertain the intention of the parties.lord,williston on contracts,ed.williston see also reed proprietors of locks and canals on merrimac river,how.sometimes that intention is clearly set forth in the express language of the contract,williston,at,so no subsidiary findings of fact are necessary to its construction.but when ambiguities require a court to look beyond the express language,its search for intent becomes factual in nature.that search focuses on real intention s embodied in an actual meeting of minds or an actual conveyance of a physical parcel of land that have an existence outside the written instrument and that the instrument merely records.see william james brown mcgran,pet,story,reed,supra,at.see generally union pacific united states.cl,declining to interpret a statute according to contract rules because a ll the terms of the compact are dictated and accepted by one side,and the only intent which judicial construction can make certain is the intent of the legislative power cited in singer,sutherland on statutory construction,ed.
of course,not all subsidiary inquiries that a court makes in the course of construing contracts amount to findings of fact.for example,when a court searches for the meaning that a hypothetical person conversant with the with which the contract is dealing would give to the words of the contract,its conclusion often remains one of law.silver king coalition mines of nevada silver king consol.mining of utah,cited in advisory committee notes on fed.rule civ.proc.
the question we must ask,then,is whether the subsidiary findings underlying claim construction more closely resemble the subsidiary findings underlying the construction of statutes or those underlying the construction of contracts and deeds that are treated as findings of fact.this,in turn,depends on whether patent claims are more like statutes or more like contracts and deeds.
a patent,generally speaking,is an official document reflecting a grant by a sovereign that is made public,or patent.marvin brandt revocable trust,supra,at slip,at.invention patents originated not as private property rights,but as royal prerogatives.see holdsworth,a history of english law.they could be issued and revoked only by the crown,which sometimes used the patent to delegate governmental power to regulate an industry,at.provoked by the crown use of these monopoly patents to promote private economic interests over innovation and beneficial commerce,parliament enacted the statute of monopolies in,at.but even under the regime that parliament put in place,patents remained sovereign grants,issued,enforced,and revoked by the privy council.lemley,why do juries decide if patents are valid.
the framers adopted a similar scheme.article i of the constitution vests the patent power in congress,authorizing it t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.const.art.i,cl.although congress could issue such patents as special statutes,see,bloomer mcquewan,how,it has mostly acted by authorizing the executive branch to issue patents when certain statutory requirements are met.see see also act of july,stat.act of july,stat.act of,ch,stat.
like the royal prerogatives that were their historical antecedents,patents have a regulatory effect they restrain others from manufacturing,using or selling that which the patent holder has invented for a specified period of time.motion picture patents universal film,emphasis added.and because the regulatory scope of a patent is determined by the claims in the patent,the subsidiary findings that a court makes during claim construction contribute to rules that limit conduct by the public at large.
because they are governmental dispositions and provide rules that bind the public at large,patent claims resemble statutes.the scope of a patent holder monopoly right is defined by claims legally actualized through the procedures established by congress pursuant to its patent power.thus,a patent holder actual intentions have effect only to the extent that they are expressed in the public record.see keystone bridge phoenix iron,see also goodyear dental vulcanite davis,examining the avowed understanding of the patentee,but disclaiming any holding that such understanding c ould be allowed to enlarge,diminish,or vary the language of a patent afterwards issued 
moreover,because the ultimate meaning of a patent claim,like the ultimate meaning of a statute,binds the public at large,it should not depend on the specific evidence presented in a particular infringement case.although the party presentations shape even statutory construction,de novo review on appeal helps to ensure that the construction is not skewed by the specific evidence presented in a given case.
for purposes of construction,contracts and deeds are less natural analogies for patents.in particular,patents lack the characteristics of those instruments that have justified departing from the usual practice of treating document construction as a wholly legal inquiry,not subject to subsidiary findings of fact.
to be sure,we have occasionally characterized a patent as a carefully crafted bargain between the inventor and the public.pfaff wells electronics,see also kendall winsor,how,grant raymond,pet.but,as our decisions have also recognized,the patent is perhaps better characterized as a reward for feats already accomplished that is,innovation and public disclosure than as a mutual exchange of executory promises.see,motion picture patents,supra,at seymour osborne,wall,grant,supra,at see also markman westview instruments,ca fed,aff distinguishing patents from contracts.in granting a patent,the government is acting not as a party to a bilateral contract binding upon itself alone,but instead as a sovereign bestowing upon the inventor a right to exclude the public at large from the invention marked out by his claims.
in this sense,patents are more closely analogous to deeds,motion picture patents,supra,at collecting cases,because they share the common characteristic of describing rights that the owner holds against the world.see bonito boats,thunder craft boats.but in the context of land patents,we have been unwilling to interpret sovereign dispositions in the same way we interpret analogous private conveyances.see,leo sheep,at missouri,kansas pacific,leavenworth,united states,see also marvin brandt revocable trust,supra interpreting a land grant as a statute rather than as a deed.we should not blithely extend the rules governing the construction of deeds to their even more distant cousins,invention patents 
bearing these differences in mind,the subsidiary facts relevant to the construction of patents,on the one hand,and contracts and deeds,on the other,differ substantially.as explained above,we have justified treating subsidiary determinations about the actual intentions of parties to contracts and deeds as findings of fact.but the subsidiary determinations about patent claims that the majority identifies as factual do not concern historical facts,such as what the parties agreed to do or how a given parcel of land is situated.see william james brown,at reed,at.
for example,the fact of how a skilled artisan would understand a given term or phrase at a particular point in history is a legal fiction it has no existence independent of the claim construction process.there is no actual skilled artisan who,at the moment the application was filed,formed an understanding of the terms of the claim an understanding that an omniscient factfinder could ascertain.neither is the skilled artisan understanding a proxy for some external fact that,could the court know it,would supply the meaning of a patent claim.whatever the scope of the inventor right under the patent before the introduction of claims,the law has limited that right to the claims as written in the patent.see markman,supra,at.our decision in markman rested in part on this characteristic of claim construction,distinguishing it from other patent determinations that must go to a jury because they require the factfinder to inspect an embodied conception outside of the patent itself or things which have their existence in pais.at distinguishing bischoff wethered,wall.
because the skilled artisan inquiry in claim construction more closely resembles determinations categorized as conclusions of law than determinations categorized as findings of fact,i would hold that it falls outside the scope of rule a and is subject to de novo review.
the majority makes little effort to justify its assertion that the subsidiary determinations a district court makes in the course of claim construction are findings of fact.and the few analogies that it attempts to draw
