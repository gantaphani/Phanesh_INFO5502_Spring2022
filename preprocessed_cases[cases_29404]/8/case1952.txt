because of litigation in state and federal courts,winners have yet to be declared in an election for two seats in the albany county,new york,legislature first scheduled for november and not held until april.appellant,the albany county board of elections,would like to declare the winners,and the new york court of appeals has instructed the board to exclude certain absentee ballots in doing so.appellee voters,along with two candidates who have since dropped out of the case,argued in the district court lawrence kahn,judge that their constitutional rights would be violated if the board certified the election results without counting the disputed absentee ballots,and the district court preliminarily enjoined the board from certifying the election results.
the board argues that under the doctrine,the district court should have dismissed the voters suit for lack of jurisdiction in light of earlier litigation over the absentee ballots.the board also contends that principles of claim and issue preclusion require dismissal of the voters suit alternatively,the board asserts that on the merits,this court should vacate the district court preliminary injunction because the voters have not sufficiently established that their constitutional claim is likely to succeed.although we are unpersuaded by the board arguments,we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings and leave the preliminary injunction in place.
background 
this appeal is the latest installment in litigation that began in over elections for the albany county legislature.in august,ruling on a challenge brought by voters and the naacp,the united states district court for the northern district of new york held that albany county redistricting plan for the november election likely violated the federal voting rights act.arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany arbor hill i,d.although the district court ultimately approved a substitute redistricting plan,by then it was too late to hold the november election in accordance with the substitute plan,and the district court declined to order a special election.arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany arbor hill ii,d,see also arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany arbor hill iii,cir per curiam.on appeal,this court partially reversed the district court decision and ordered that a special primary election be held in march and that a special general election be held thereafter on a schedule and subject to procedures to be established by the district court on remand.arbor hill iii,at.
as directed by the district court on remand,the albany county board of elections issued absentee ballots for the march special primary to voters who had requested absentee ballots for the originally scheduled fall general or primary elections.the board also issued absentee ballots for the special general election,scheduled for april,to those same voters.gross albany county bd.of elections gross iii,per curiam.the district court,however,had directed that ballots for the special general election be issued in accordance with article of the new york election law,which would have required voters to file a new request for such ballots.arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,cv,slip op.at,law.contrary to article requirement,the board issued the ballots,as it had issued the ballots,without the voters having filed a new request for absentee ballots.
the absentee ballots for the april special general election could determine the election to two seats in the albany county legislature.candidates hoblock,a republican,and gross,a democrat,vied for the district seat candidates carman,a republican,and messercola,a democrat,contested the district seat.after the machine count of votes not including absentee ballots,the election was close according to the complaint,hoblock led gross by three votes,while messercola led carman by four votes.on may,when the board of elections convened to hand count the absentee ballots,all four candidates raised various challenges.the board then decided to postpone counting those ballots until a state court ruled on their validity.
all four candidates petitioned the new york supreme court in albany county to have various absentee ballots invalidated the board opposed the petition the state court opinion reveals that the candidates challenged a total of absentee ballots carman challenged,gross,hoblock,and messercola.of the ballots,were challenged on the basis that the board improperly issued them based on a november application and were challenged on other grounds.of these ballots,the state court invalidated but held to be valid none of them is at issue in the current litigation.
the state court held that the ballots issued based on november applications were invalid because they were issued in violation of the district court order and article of the new york election law.see gross albany county bd.of elections gross i,slip op.at.june.the appellate division,with two judges dissenting,affirmed on the same grounds.gross albany county bd.of elections gross ii,per curiam see id.at spain,joined by carpinello,concurring in part and dissenting in part.on october,the new york court of appeals affirmed the appellate division decision,again for the reasons relied on by the trial court and again with two judges dissenting.gross iii,at id.at rosenblatt,joined by smith,dissenting.
having lost in state court,candidates hoblock and carman sued in federal district court along with seven voters who claim to sue on behalf of other similarly situated voters the plaintiff voters and candidates claimed,under,that the board refusal to tally the challenged absentee ballots violated their rights under the fourteenth amendment and clauses.the district court dismissed the claims of hoblock and carman,see hoblock albany county bd.of elections,d,and they have not appealed the dismissal.the district court also preliminarily enjoined the board from certifying the election results without tallying the challenged absentee ballots.id.the board has now appealed the district court order granting the preliminary injunction the district court has yet to rule on the merits of the voters claim.
ii.discussion 
a.the question 
where a federal suit follows a state suit,the former may be prohibited by the doctrine in certain circumstances.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure jurisdiction.the district court raised sua sponte and determined that the doctrine barred the claims of candidates hoblock and carman,but not those of the voters.hoblock,d at.hoblock and carman abandoned their appeal,so we do not consider whether the district court properly dismissed their claims.we must,however,consider the board argument that the district court should have also dismissed the voters claims on grounds.because goes to jurisdiction,we review de novo the district court application of the doctrine.rivers mcleod,cir per curiam.
the supreme court recent decision in exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d,examined the doctrine as it has been applied by the lower federal courts.exxon mobil thus requires us not only to evaluate how the district court applied,but also to examine anew the doctrine itself.
the supreme court has applied the doctrine to defeat federal jurisdiction exactly twice,in the two cases for which the doctrine is named.see id.at.at.in rooker fidelity trust,the court held that a federal district court lacked jurisdiction over a suit to have a decision declared null and void on grounds that it violated the constitution.the court explained that because t he jurisdiction possessed by the district courts is strictly original under the statutes governing the federal judiciary,the district court could not hear the suit.id.at.to do so would be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction,which only the supreme court possesses over judgments.id.
sixty years later,in district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,a suit brought by disappointed applicants for the bar challenging the decision of the district of columbia highest court refusing to admit them to the bar,the court held that a federal district court lacked jurisdiction over some of the applicants claims but not over others.noting that a federal district court has no authority to review final judgments of a state court in judicial proceedings,id.at,the court held that to the extent that the applicants challenged the court decision,in their particular case,to deny them admission to the bar by refusing to waive certain requirements,the challenge could not proceed in federal court,id.at.but to the extent that the applicants challenged the rules promulgated by the court in a nonjudicial capacity,id.at.applicants suit was not barred,because such a challenge do es not require review of a final judgment in a particular case,id.at.
rooker and feldman thus established the clear principle that federal district courts lack jurisdiction over suits that are,in substance,appeals from judgments but the two cases provided little guidance on how to apply that principle.nor,until exxon mobil,did other supreme court cases offer much assistance.the few mobil decisions that have mentioned rooker and feldman have done so only in passing or to explain why those cases did not dictate dismissal.exxon mobil,at.at see also id.at.at collecting cases.
lower federal courts have struggled to define reach.some courts,including the seventh and ninth circuits,have interpreted the doctrine narrowly.see,noel hall,cir gash assocs.village of rosemont,cir.others,including this circuit,have applied expansively we held in moccio new york state office of court administration,cir,that was effectively coextensive with doctrines of claim and issue preclusion.see also charchenko city of stillwater,cir we note that is broader than claim and issue preclusion because it does not depend on a final judgment on the merits.aside from this distinction the doctrines are extremely similar.moccio relied for this conclusion on the following statement from a footnote in feldman 
if the constitutional claims presented to a united states district court are inextricably intertwined with the state court denial in a judicial proceeding of a particular plaintiff application for admission to the state bar,then the district court is in essence being called upon to review the decision.this the district court may not do.
at.emphasis added.interpreting this language,moccio held that the supreme court use of inextricably intertwined means,at a minimum,that where a federal plaintiff had an opportunity to litigate a claim in a state proceeding subsequent litigation of the claim will be barred under the doctrine if it would be barred under the principles of preclusion.at.
the district court in this case,relying on moccio,analyzed the question solely in terms of claim and issue preclusion.finding that neither type of preclusion applied to the voters suit,the district court held that did not deprive it of jurisdiction.hoblock,d at.the supreme court has now told us that moccio and,by extension,the district court analysis based on moccio was incorrect.indeed,the supreme court cited moccio as an example of a case that wrongly construed the doctrine to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases,overriding congress s conferral of jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts,and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to.exxon mobil,at.at.exxon mobil teaches that and preclusion are entirely separate doctrines.
in exxon mobil,the supreme court pared back the doctrine to its core,holding that it is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.at.at.from this holding,we can see that there are four requirements for the application of.first,the plaintiff must have lost in state court.second,the plaintiff must complain of injuries caused by a judgment.third,the plaintiff must invit e district court review and rejection of that judgment.fourth,the judgment must have been rendered before the district court proceedings commenced,has no application to suits proceeding in parallel with ongoing litigation.the first and fourth of these requirements may be loosely termed procedural the second and third may be termed substantive.
the substantive requirements 
underlying the doctrine is the principle,expressed by congress in,that within the federal judicial system,only the supreme court may review decisions that principle animates the two substantive requirements for application outlined in exxon mobil the federal plaintiff must complain of injury from a judgment and the federal plaintiff must seek review and rejection of the judgment.
exxon mobil declares these requirements but scarcely elaborates on what they might mean.the court does,however,give some negative guidance as to what cases are not captured by the requirements.the court points out that and thus does not deprive a district court of jurisdiction 
simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.if a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.
at.at quoting gash,at alterations in exxon mobil.this language describes a set of federal raising independent claims that are outside compass even if they involve the identical subject matter and parties as previous suits.
the voters federal suit is therefore barred by only if it complains of injury from the judgment and seeks review and rejection of that judgment,but not if it raises some independent claim.how do we determine whether a federal suit raises an independent,claim at first glance,one might think that a federal claim is independent of claims raised in state court if the federal claim is premised on a theory not passed upon by the state court.indeed,the voters make essentially this argument,asserting that does not apply because the voters raise a fourteenth amendment argument and thus are not seeking review of the state court decision,which was strictly limited to state law 
just presenting in federal court a legal theory not raised in state court,however,can not insulate a federal plaintiff suit from if the federal suit nonetheless complains of injury from a judgment and seeks to have that judgment reversed.feldman itself makes this plain.prior to feldman,the fifth circuit held in dasher supreme court of texas,cir,that a federal district court had jurisdiction,notwithstanding,to hear a plaintiff constitutional challenge to a judgment denying the plaintiff admission to the state bar,provided the state court had not passed on the constitutional issues raised in the federal suit.the court took pains in feldman to explain that dasher was wrong such federal constitutional claims,even if not raised in state court,are inextricably intertwined with the challenged judgment denying bar admission,and therefore a federal district court lacks jurisdiction over such claims because the district court is in essence being called upon to review the decision.feldman,at.
the inextricably intertwined language from feldman led lower federal courts,including this court in moccio,at,to apply too broadly.in light of exxon quotes feldman use of the phrase but does not otherwise explicate or employ it,at.at appears that describing a federal claim as inextricably intertwined with a judgment only states a conclusion.bars a federal claim,whether or not raised in state court,that asserts injury based on a state judgment and seeks review and reversal of that judgment such a claim is inextricably intertwined with the state judgment.but the phrase inextricably intertwined has no independent content.it is simply a descriptive label attached to claims that meet the requirements outlined in exxon mobil.
are the voters federal constitutional claims independent of the judgment,or does the voters federal suit assert injury based on a state judgment and seek review and reversal of that judgment,are the voters federal claims inextricably intertwined with the state judgment we begin by asking whether the voters suit seeks review and reversal of the judgment.in one sense,no the voters do not want the federal court to evaluate the state court reasoning,the federal court need not review the substance of the judgment.but we know,as explained above,that a federal suit is not free from bar simply because the suit proceeds on legal theories not addressed in state court.
more importantly,even if what the voters seek in federal court is not review in some sense,the voters do seem to seek reversal the state court ordered the board not to count the voters ballots,and the voters want the federal court to order the board to count the ballots.because the board can not comply with both the order and the desired order,the order,if granted,would seem to reverse the judgment.
on the other hand,we know that an independent and therefore claim may den y a legal conclusion reached by the state court.exxon mobil,at.at quoting gash,at.precisely what this means is not clear from either exxon mobil or gash associates the original source of the language,but it suggests that a plaintiff who seeks in federal court a result opposed to the one he achieved in state court does not,for that reason alone,run afoul of.
the key to resolving this uncertainty lies in the second substantive requirement that federal plaintiffs are not subject to the bar unless they complain of an injury caused by a state judgment.indeed,this is the core requirement from which the others derive focusing on it helps clarify when the doctrine applies.
first,this requirement explains why a federal plaintiff can not escape the bar simply by relying on a legal theory not raised in state court.suppose a state court,based purely on state law,terminates a father parental rights and orders the state to take custody of his son.if the father sues in federal court for the return of his son on grounds that the state judgment violates his federal substantive rights as a parent,he is complaining of an injury caused by the state judgment and seeking its reversal.this he may not do,regardless of whether he raised any constitutional claims in state court,because only the supreme court may hear appeals from judgments.
further,by focusing on the requirement that the judgment be the source of the injury,we can see how a suit asking a federal court to den y a legal conclusion reached by a state court could nonetheless be independent for purposes.suppose a plaintiff sues his employer in state court for violating both state law and title vii and loses.if the plaintiff then brings the same suit in federal court,he will be seeking a decision from the federal court that denies the state court conclusion that the employer is not liable,but he will not be alleging injury from the state judgment.instead,he will be alleging injury based on the employer discrimination.the fact that the state court chose not to remedy the injury does not transform the subsequent federal suit on the same matter into an appeal,forbidden by,of the judgment 
the voters claims in this case seem at first to complain only of the board refusal to tally their votes rather than of any injury caused by the state court judgment.matters are complicated,however,by the fact that in refusing to tally the votes,the board is acting under compulsion of a order.can a federal plaintiff avoid simply by clever alleging that actions taken pursuant to a court order violate his rights without ever challenging the court order itself surely not.in the example given above,if the state has taken custody of a child pursuant to a state judgment,the parent can not escape simply by alleging in federal court that he was injured by the state employees who took his child rather than by the judgment authorizing them to take the child.the example shows that in some circumstances,federal suits that purport to complain of injury by individuals in reality complain of injury by judgments.the challenge is to identify such suits.
the following formula guides our inquiry a federal suit complains of injury from a judgment,even if it appears to complain only of a third party actions,when the third party actions are produced by a judgment and not simply ratified,acquiesced in,or left unpunished by it.where a judgment causes the challenged action,any challenge to that action is necessarily the kind of challenge to the state judgment that only the supreme court can hear.this formula dovetails with the requirement about timing that we have termed procedural,the requirement that the federal suit be initiated after the challenged state judgment.if federal suits can not be barred by unless they complain of injuries produced by judgments,it follows that no federal suit that precedes a judgment will be barred the injury such a federal suit seeks to remedy can not have been produced by a judgment that did not exist at the federal suit inception.
applying this formula,we find that the voters federal suit does complain of an injury caused by the judgment and seek that judgment reversal.it thus meets substantive requirements.in determining that the voters injury was produced by the judgment directing the board not to count their ballots,rather than by the board action in refusing to count their ballots,we look at both the allegations in the voters federal complaint and the records of the proceedings.
the allegations in the voters complaint are somewhat ambiguous as to whether the injury they seek to have board refusal to count their,and thus was not produced by,a decision.while the board was canvassing the ballots,various candidates objected to the counting of certain absentee ballots.the board decided not to count ballots to which objections were lodged.the wording of the complaint suggests that the board intended to shunt responsibility for deciding which ballots to count to the state court the voters allege that b y agreement,the board of elections did not open the absentee ballots until the state court could rule on them.compl.at.
the state trial court opinion,however,makes plain that the board,had it been left to its own devices,would have counted the absentee ballots issued based on november applications.gross i,slip op.at.the board argued in state court that the ballots were valid and should be counted,and but for the state court judgment ordering the board not to do so,the board would have counted the challenged absentee ballots.the judgment did not ratify,acquiesce in,or leave unpunished an anterior decision by the board not to count the ballots.instead,the judgment produced the board refusal to count the ballots,the very injury of which the voters complain.whether bars the voters federal suit therefore turns on whether their suit meets the remaining procedural requirements pertaining to timing and party identity outlined in exxon mobil.
the procedural requirements 
does not automatically bar every federal suit that seeks review and rejection of an state decision.instead,such federal suits must meet two further requirements,which we have termed procedural,imposed by exxon mobil the federal suit must follow the state judgment and the parties in the state and federal suits must be the same.at.at.
the timing requirement will usually be straightforward,although federal suits challenging interlocutory state judgments may present difficult questions as to whether the state proceedings have ended within the meaning of on the federal questions at issue.federacion de maestros de junta de relaciones del trabajo de,cir.may.lexis,at quoting exxon mobil.at discussing this question.more commonly,however,the federal suit will come after the state suit has unequivocally terminated,as in this case the new york court of appeals decided on october,that the contested ballots should not be counted,gross iii,at,and the plaintiffs filed suit in federal district court on october,hoblock,d at.
the second requirement,common identity between the state and federal plaintiffs,will also often be straightforward,as when the federal plaintiff was a named party in the state lawsuit.in this case,however,whether the requirement is met is not obvious.candidates hoblock and carman were plainly parties in state court,but they have abandoned their appeal.we are left with the question whether the voters,despite not having appeared in state court,should nonetheless be considered losers for purposes.
because is a doctrine of federal jurisdiction,we must look to federal law to determine whether the voters should be treated,for purposes,as if they were parties to the candidates suit.see suzanna sherry,judicial federalism in the trenches the doctrine in action,notre dame,see also david currie,res judicata the neglected defense,chi,rooker thus provides for a limited,uniform federal law of preclusion in cases that varying state laws may not foreclose.while we recognize that claim and issue preclusion are distinct from the doctrine,we believe that federal case law governing the application of preclusion doctrines to nonparties should guide the analogous inquiry in the context 
in montana united states,d,the court seemed to discourage using the term privity to describe the relationship between nonparties who assume control over litigation in which they have a direct financial or proprietary interest and are therefore subject to issue preclusion based on the results of litigation that they controlled.subsequently,however,the court has used the term privity in discussing the principles according to which a nonparty may be bound by an earlier judgment.richards jefferson county,d.
following richards,we think that the question in this case may be posed this way is there sufficient privity,as a matter of federal law,between the voters and the candidates that the voters should be considered parties to,and bound by,the candidates state lawsuit against the board the supreme court has explained that a nonparty can be bound by the results of someone else litigation when,in certain limited circumstances,a person,although not a party,has his interests adequately represented by someone with the same interests who is a party.martin wilks,d see also richards,at.quoting wilks.wilks provided two examples of such limited circumstances where the first suit was brought by a class representative and the second suit was brought by a class member,as discussed in hansberry lee.and where the second suit was brought by a party who actually controlled,without being a party to,the first suit,as discussed in montana,at.wilks,at.
some lower federal courts have expansively interpreted the concept of privity under federal law to reach beyond the limited circumstances discussed in wilks.under the doctrine of virtual representation,a person may be bound by a judgment even though not a party if one of the parties to the suit is so closely aligned with his interests as to be his virtual representative.askew,cir.we have endorsed this doctrine,observing that claim preclusion may bar to earlier litigation when the interests involved in the prior litigation are virtually identical to those in later litigation.chase manhattan bank,celotex,cir.the doctrine is controversial,however,and the seventh circuit has sharply criticized it.tice am.airlines,cir see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice procedure jurisdiction.
we need not determine whether the supreme court discussion of privity in richards,which postdates both and chase manhattan bank,undermines the doctrine,for even under that doctrine,which gives privity its broadest scope under federal law,the candidates did not virtually represent the interests of the voters when the candidates sued the board in state court.as a general matter,in an election contest the interests of candidates who seek to be elected and the interests of voters who seek to have their votes counted may overlap,but they are not necessarily virtually identical to each other,as chase manhattan bank requires for the doctrine to apply.see schulz williams,cir tarpley salerno,cir.in this case in particular,the candidates initial position in the state litigation was directly hostile to the interests of some voters in having their votes counted the candidates sought to have certain absentee ballots declared invalid.given that the state court disregarded the candidates subsequent attempt to argue in favor of counting disputed ballots and instead ruled on the candidates initial challenges,the candidates did not virtually represent the voters interests in state court.
it remains possible,however,that the plaintiff voters and candidates are in privity if the candidates in fact are controlling the voters federal suit,not to advance the interests of all voters who submitted challenged absentee ballots,but rather to further the interests of the candidates and a subset of voters whose interests do coincide exactly with those of the candidates.if the plaintiff voters are in reality the candidates pawns,then by definition the plaintiff voters interests are identical to the candidates and different from the interests of all similarly situated voters and were adequately represented in the candidates lawsuit.and as wilks explained,where a nonparty controls a party,identity of interest and adequacy of representation suffice to create privity between nonparties and parties to an earlier suit.at.
aspects of the complaint in the federal suit,together with information revealed by the proceedings,raise at least the possibility that the plaintiff voters are puppets and the candidates puppetmasters.the complaint,filed jointly by the voters and the candidates,challenges not the board decision to disregard all absentee ballots issued ostensibly in violation of state law and the order,but only a very particular subset of those ballots.
in the litigation,the four candidates petitioned to have a total of ballots invalidated carman challenged,gross challenged,hoblock challenged,and messercola challenged.of the challenged ballots,are not at issue in this suit because no one disputes that the state court properly ruled on their validity.which of the remaining ballots,challenged in state court because they were issued based on a november application,are at issue in the current litigation is a critical question.the complaint,filed initially by hoblock,carman,and seven named voters,purports to be filed on behalf of those seven and all other voters similarly situated.compl.the complaint refers to the class members that are the subject of this action,id,and to absentee ballots upon which voters cast ballots.id.the complaint,however,actually names only voters the named plaintiffs and others.id.
it turns out that the named voters are a very particular subset of the voters whose ballots were challenged because those ballots were issued based on a november application they are voters whose ballots were challenged in state court by candidates gross and messercola.of the remaining voters in the group of,those not named in the complaint,were challenged in state court by hoblock or carman,and christina marbach kellett was challenged by messercola.it seems that the complaint inadvertently failed to name this last voter,hence the discrepancy between the absentee ballots referred to in the complaint and the named voters.
if the named voter plaintiffs are suing only to require the board of elections to count ballots that candidates gross and messercola challenged in state court,despite purporting to sue on behalf of all other voters similarly situated,then the voter plaintiffs are effectively suing only on behalf of hoblock and carman,not on behalf of all voters whose ballots were invalidated because they were issued based on a november application.this suggests that the voter plaintiffs may actually be the pawns of hoblock and carman and that,rather than advancing the interests of all similarly situated voters which may diverge from the candidates interests,they are advancing only the candidates interests.
when pressed at oral argument to explain why the complaint named only voters despite the voters asserted interest in representing all similarly situated voters,the voters counsel explained that he filed the complaint hastily.he maintained that the voters did indeed intend to represent all similarly situated voters,and that although he had copied sections from the candidates complaint,the voters were not simply trying to have those ballots counted that candidates hoblock and carman but not messercola and gross wanted counted.
this explanation is not wholly satisfying.nonetheless,if the voters indeed represent the interests of all voters whose ballots were rejected by the state court because they were issued based on a november application,then the voters interests are plainly distinct from the candidates interests.and to the extent that the voters,represented by counsel independent from the candidates counsel,seek to advance their own interests by having all disputed ballots of which candidates hoblock and carman argued at least initially in state court should not be voters could not be considered to be under the candidates control.the requirements for privity under federal of interests and adequacy of thus absent if the voters seek to have all disputed ballots counted.
we therefore remand the case with instructions that the district court grant the voters the opportunity to amend their complaint to make clear whether they seek to have all disputed ballots counted.if the voters so amend their complaint,will not bar their suit,for by amending the complaint the voters will demonstrate that they are not in privity with the candidates.conversely,if the voters decline to amend their complaint,they will demonstrate that in fact they are the tools of,and therefore in privity with,hoblock and carman,and will bar their suit.
ordinary preclusion principles 
we now turn to whether the federal action is barred by ordinary preclusion principles.exxon mobil teaches that the narrow inquiry is distinct from the question whether claim preclusion res judicata or issue preclusion collateral estoppel will defeat a federal plaintiff suit.because under mobil second circuit law,was held to be coextensive with preclusion,the parties fully briefed the preclusion issues in this case,and the district court decision not to apply was equally a decision that neither claim nor issue preclusion foreclosed the voters suit.we therefore review the district court decision as a matter of preclusion law,apart from the question.because the full faith and credit act,requires federal courts to accord state judgments the same preclusive effect those judgments would have in the courts of the rendering state,new york preclusion law applies.
standard of review 
claim and issue preclusion are affirmative defenses that frequently turn on pure questions of law,or on the application of law to undisputed facts,and we therefore generally review de novo a district court ruling on preclusion.see,diorinou mezitis,cir sec monarch funding,cir.in some cases,however,whether preclusion applies will turn on the question of privity.courts and commentators differ as to whether privity is a question of law or of fact.the fifth circuit seems to have taken both positions,first observing that the determination of identity between litigants for the purpose of establishing privity is a factual question,astron indus,chrysler motors,cir,and later stating without suggesting that astron was being overruled that federal cases have recognized that privity denotes a legal conclusion rather than a judgmental process,southwest airlines texas int l airlines,cir.
decisions from this circuit,too,are in discord on the question.in expert electric,levine,this court observed that the identity of parties,qualified by the doctrine of privity is a factual determination of substance,not mere form,cir citing astron,at.subsequently,however,stone williams,cir,cited with seeming approval the fifth circuit characterization in southwest airlines of privity as a legal conclusion.more recently still,chase manhattan bank cited expert electric for the proposition that s ome courts have held that the privity inquiry is a factual issue.at.the language in chase manhattan bank some courts where this court would have been ambivalence over whether privity should always be considered a question of fact.
the seventh circuit has tackled the question and resolved it by holding that because privity sometimes turns on facts and other times turns on legal questions,t he question of privity is therefore particularly amenable to a standard of review.in re l s,cir.similarly,a leading treatise notes that 
the ultimate conclusion about privity may turn essentially on matters of fact in some cases,while in other cases it may turn primarily on legal concepts.the standard of review is shaped by the specific setting,permitting free review when legal appraisal of the underlying relationships dominates the inquiry and limiting review to a standard when factual issues dominate.
wright,miller cooper,federal practice procedure jurisdiction,at.
we need not resolve in this case when,as a general matter,privity should be treated as a question of law or a question of fact.instead,we note that the district court determination about privity rested on the purely legal proposition that c andidates rights,though related to voters rights,are said to be distinct from them.hoblock,d at quoting griffin burns,cir.based on this proposition,the district court found that the candidates interest in having the voters absentee ballots counted was insufficient to create privity.id.because we review questions of law de novo,we will review de novo the district court finding under the circumstances of this case,as well as its rulings on other legal questions related to claim and issue preclusion.
issue preclusion 
under new york law,issue preclusion will apply only if the issue in question was actually and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding,and the party against whom issue preclusion is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding.moccio,at internal quotation marks omitted.the issue in question in the federal suit is whether voters federal constitutional rights are violated by the board of elections refusal to count absentee ballots on the ground that those ballots,although issued to voters by the board of elections,were invalid under state law.the board maintains that the new york court of appeals necessarily decided this constitutional question in gross iii,and points out that judge rosenblatt dissent refers to a first circuit case,griffin burns,cir,that decided an election dispute similar to the one in this case on federal constitutional grounds.see gross iii,at rosenblatt,dissenting.the board also points out that the opinion dissenting in part from the new york appellate division ruling in gross ii accuses the majority of depriv ing voters of their constitutional right to vote at spain,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
certainly the authors of the dissenting opinions cited by the board believed that the voters constitutional rights were at stake.but to determine what issues were actually and necessarily decided by the new york court of it is the preclusive effect of that decision alone that is in look to the majority opinion.where,as here,that opinion unambiguously relies on state law alone,we can not say that the court decided federal constitutional questions just because a dissenting judge in the court of appeals let alone dissenting judges in the appellate division would have preferred that the case be decided differently on constitutional grounds.the new york court of appeals held that the absentee ballots collected in violation of both a federal court order and article of the new york election law are invalid gross iii,at.it explained further that in new york,the right to vote by absentee ballot is purely a statutory right.id.nowhere does the court of appeals discuss the voters constitutional rights,and we therefore agree with the district court that t he issue of whether the invalidation of the absentee ballots would violate the fourteenth amendment was not addressed by the court of appeals,hoblock,d at,and issue preclusion thus does not bar the voters from litigating this issue in federal court.
the district court further held that issue preclusion does not ap
