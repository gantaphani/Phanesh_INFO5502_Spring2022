the defendant,honeywell international,honeywell appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york michael telesca,judge in order to challenge the court award of an attorney against it.the underlying action was brought to enforce an employer undertaking to guarantee an undiminished level of benefits to employees of three unionized manufacturing plants that the employer had sold to another company.the employees,now employed by the remote successor of the acquiring company,brought suit against honeywell in its capacity as a successor to the seller,alleging violations of the labor management relations act,et,lmra,the employee retirement income security act of,et,erisa,and contractual rights.in an order that we affirmed in relevant part on a previous appeal,see laforest former clean air holding,cir laforest i,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs under the lmra.honeywell eventually complied with that order and the benefit level was secured.
this appeal concerns three orders entered after the district court ruled in plaintiffs favor under the lmra an order dated december,and entered several days thereafter,granting a motion for summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the erisa claim,laforest honeywell int l,civ,doc.laforest order i a december,consent judgment entered pursuant to a settlement agreement,laforest honeywell int,civ,doc.laforest order ii and a december,order granting the plaintiffs motion for an attorney fee,laforest honeywell int l,civ,wl,dist.lexis,laforest order iii.honeywell argues that the district court december determination that the case arises under erisa was erroneous,and that there is therefore no valid predicate judgment upon which to base an attorney fee award.but because the settlement encompassed the erisa claim,and honeywell reserved only the right to challenge an award of an attorney fee,honeywell now has no right to appeal the erisa judgment.we therefore do not address the merits of the district court december determination.
we do,however,review laforest order iii,the district court december order granting an attorney fee.we conclude that the court erred in basing its fee analysis at least in part on honeywell conduct relating to the claim brought under the lmra.because the fee award was granted pursuant to a statute permitting fees only for claims arising under erisa,not the lmra,we remand for the court to consider whether plaintiffs are entitled to an attorney fee based solely on their erisa claim.
background 
in the underlying lawsuit,now settled,the plaintiffs,once employees of honeywell remote predecessor bendix corporation,sought to establish honeywell liability to the plaintiffs under a guaranty in which bendix promised to pay insurance premiums necessary to maintain benefit levels for the members of the plaintiff class if the benefits were ever reduced by a successor employer.the guaranty was entered into in connection with the divestiture by bendix,pursuant to a consent decree it entered into with the federal trade commission,see laforest i,at,of three unionized manufacturing facilities.in order to induce workers at the divested facilities to continue their employment under new ownership,bendix agreed,in the guaranty,to preserve their employee welfare and pension benefits for life,at the level in place at bendix on april,or at a different level subsequently agreed upon between their new employer and the union.a successor of bound by the terms of the guaranty.honeywell int l,purolator prods,cir honeywell.
in,after the ownership of the plants had passed through several hands,the plaintiffs benefits were reduced during stalled negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement.the plaintiffs brought this class action to enforce the guaranty against honeywell,asserting a claim under the lmra,a claim under erisa,and a claim for promissory estoppel.in sequential rulings,the district court awarded summary judgment on the plaintiffs lmra claim,and issued a preliminary injunction essentially providing the plaintiffs with all the relief they sought.on a previous appeal,we affirmed those rulings.see laforest i,at.
while the appeal of the lmra ruling was pending,the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their erisa claim.honeywell opposed the motion and for summary judgment on the grounds that under erisa i the guaranty is not a plan,and ii honeywell is not an employer or otherwise a proper defendant.
on december,the district court found in the plaintiffs favor on the erisa claim.laforest order i.the court decided that the defendants liability,previously established under the lmra,could have been based,alternatively,on erisa.id.at.the erisa ruling had no impact on the substantive relief previously granted to the plaintiffs.the district court denied honeywell petition to certify the erisa decision for interlocutory appeal.
after we affirmed the lmra rulings in laforest i and remanded that part of the case to the district court for clarification and modification of the preliminary injunction,all parties to the plaintiffs,honeywell,and the into a settlement agreement resolving all of the plaintiffs substantive claims.the settlement agreement explicitly preserved the issue of honeywell liability for an attorney fee and costs pursuant to g.on december,the district court approved the settlement agreement and entered a consent judgment dismissing all of the plaintiffs claims with prejudice.laforest order ii.
after entry of the consent judgment,the plaintiffs moved for an attorney fee award pursuant to erisa.while that motion was pending,honeywell appealed from the district court erisa liability ruling.we decided that the parties subsequent settlement mooted all issues other than plaintiffs pending motion for attorneys fees and costs.honeywell,at.we acknowledged that honeywell was seeking review of the erisa ruling in order to prevent it from serv ing as a predicate for an award of fees and costs,but declined to exercise jurisdiction because the district court had not yet set the amount of the fees and costs,and the appeal might become moot if the district court decided to award no fees at all,id.
on december,the district court decided that the fee request for was excessive,and granted a reduced award of in fees,together with in costs.laforest order iii.this appeal,which combines a second appeal of the erisa judgment with a first appeal of the attorney fee award,followed.
discussion 
we previously ruled that the parties settlement of all claims mooted all issues other than plaintiffs pending motion for attorneys fees and costs.honeywell,at.we therefore declined to address the merits of the district court grant of summary judgment on the issue of erisa liability.id.insofar as honeywell argued that we should review the issue of erisa liability because it could serve as a predicate for an award of fees and costs,we decided that because the district court at the time had not yet awarded fees or costs,there was no appealable final order addressing the issue.id.
because there is now an appealable final order regarding fees and costs,that order is ripe for review.both parties seem to assume that we can now also review the issue of erisa liability.we disagree.

that the settled erisa claim may have constituted the predicate to the fee award does not take that claim outside the scope of the consent judgment.we confronted a similar situation in doyle kamenkowitz,cir.there,the district court granted partial summary judgment for a subset of defendants,entitling them to an award of attorney fees.id.at.the parties then settled the claims,but expressly preserved the right to appeal a judgment awarding attorney fees.id.at.the plaintiffs,against whom attorney fees were assessed,attempted to challenge the underlying orders granting summary judgment that made attorney fees possible on the theory that those orders constituted the predicate to the fee judgment,by making the defendant officers prevailing defendants for purposes of recovering fees.id.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.we declined to address the correctness of the underlying summary judgment orders,concluding that all disputes bearing on the merits of the underlying action were mooted by the stipulated order of dismissal.id.at.we reach the same conclusion here.

attorney fee awards under erisa standard of review 
we review the award of an attorney fee in an erisa action for abuse of discretion.paese hartford life accident ins,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if its conclusions are based on an erroneous determination of law,or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.matthew bender west publ g,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
erisa provides that i n any action brought under erisa by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary,the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party.g.the determination whether to allow an attorney fee under erisa requires the court to weigh five factors 
the degree of the offending party culpability or bad faith,the ability of the offending party to satisfy an award of attorney fees,whether an award of fees would deter other persons from acting similarly under like circumstances,the relative merits of the parties positions,and whether the action conferred a common benefit on a group of pension plan participants.

b.the district court decision 
the district court,invoking the chambless test,decided that all five factors weighed in favor of granting the plaintiffs motion for a fee award.the court expressly analyzed only two of the chambless factors,however the degree of the offending party culpability or bad faith and whether a fee award would deter other persons from acting similarly under like circumstances.the court decided that both factors weighed in favor of a fee award,and concluded that the other three factors were not in dispute.laforest order iii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court likely elided its written analysis of the other three factors because honeywell,in its opposition to the motion for an attorney fee,stated that if this were an erisa case,plaintiffs would be entitled to some sort of fee award.mem.in opp to pls.mot.for att ys fees and costs,laforest honeywell int l,civ,doc.honeywell then went on to argue that the district court should nonetheless decline to award the entire sum requested by plaintiffs,because two of the chambless and against plaintiff.id.in light of this possible concession,the district court,having decided not to revisit its finding that erisa liability was established,apparently decided that these two factors were the only ones in dispute,and that the three ability of the offending party to satisfy a fee award,the relative merits of the parties positions,and whether the action conferred a common benefit on a group of pension plan not.
with respect to the culpability factor,the district court found that w hile there had been no prior specific finding of bad faith or culpable conduct on the part of honeywell by the court,honeywell had reluctantly complied with the court directives.laforest order iii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.r eluctant may be a proper characterization of honeywell compliance with the court orders,pursuant to its lmra ruling,to provide the level of coverage required under the guaranty,as evidenced by the injunction forcing honeywell to comply.see laforest i.but there is no evidence of which we are aware that honeywell was reluctant to comply with any subsequent court order relating to the erisa claim.it thus appears that the district court based its culpability analysis on the conduct of honeywell regarding the litigation of the claim against it under the lmra,a statute that,unlike erisa,does not provide for an award of an attorney fee.if this was what the court did,it was error.see chambless,at requiring district court to evaluate the five factors with respect to the erisa claim rather than other claims in the lawsuit.
the district court also found that the deterrence factor weighed in favor of finding that an attorney fee was justified because an award of fees may deter defendants that are similarly situated to honeywell and other plan fiduciaries who do not honor clear and unambiguous contractual obligations because it is not in their economic interest to do so.laforest order iii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.this appears to be a reference to honeywell breach of its contractual obligations under the lmra.while the court was likely correct that fee awards may deter those who seek to break their contractual obligations in violation of the lmra,that is beside the point.the question here is whether the award would deter erisa fiduciaries from unlawful behavior.rather than looking to honeywell behavior with regard to the lmra,the district court should have analyzed the chambless deterrence factor with reference solely to the erisa claim.
for these reasons,we remand for the district court to and clarify its analysis relating to the culpability factor and the deterrence factor,focusing solely on the erisa claim.
the other three factors were not addressed by the parties or by the district court.on remand,the district court should decide whether they have effectively been conceded in the plaintiffs favor by honeywell,and if not,consider them in the first instance.
finally,we note that our finding in part i,above,that we must treat erisa liability as having been established does not necessitate an award of an attorney fee.chief judge jacobs has not persuaded us,however,by his partial dissent,that on the current record and as a matter of law,an attorney fee award can not be justified upon the district court completion of its of the matter applying the chambless factors in accordance with this opinion.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court judgment insofar as it awarded an attorney fee to the plaintiffs,and remand for the district court to analyze whether an attorney fee is justified based solely on the erisa claim.
