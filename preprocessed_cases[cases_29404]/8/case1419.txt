this case arises out of the massive and now infamous ponzi perpetrated by bernard madoff,which culminated abruptly with his arrest in december but whose aftershocks continue.
between october and december,the plaintiff,mlsmk investment company mlsmk,invested million with madoff investment company,bernard madoff investment securities bmis.the defendants,jp morgan chase jpmc and jp morgan chase bank,chase bank,were,respectively,a trading partner for madoff apparently legitimate business and the bank with which madoff maintained the account for bmis.mlsmk lost its million investment when,on december,madoff was arrested and his assets seized.
mlsmk subsequently filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging several new york claims against the defendants.it also asserted a federal claim contending that the defendants had conspired with madoff to fleece his victims,in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,d and c.in that connection,mlsmk alleges that by late summer,the defendants became suspicious of madoff business activities and therefore undertook a due diligence investigation into madoff activities,and that the investigation revealed to the defendants that madoff investment business was a thoroughly fraudulent enterprise.nevertheless,mlsmk asserts,the defendants eager to continue receiving the substantial fees they derived from madoff and banking activity continued to trade with and provide banking services to him.mlsmk asserts that by failing to freeze madoff accounts,the defendants became liable for conspiracy to violate rico by aiding and abetting madoff breach of fiduciary duty,commercial bad faith,and negligence.
the district court barbara jones,judge dismissed the plaintiff complaint in its entirety,concluding that the complaint did not adequately plead any of the claims purportedly contained therein.we have affirmed that court dismissal of the plaintiff claims for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,commercial bad faith,and negligence.see mlsmk inv.jp morgan chase mlsmk i,cv,wl.lexis cir.june,summary order.with regard to the remaining claim brought under rico,addressing an issue of first impression in this court,we conclude that the claim also must be dismissed,because it is barred by section of the private securities litigation reform act the pslra,c.we therefore affirm that portion of the district court judgment that remains on appeal.
background 
the following statement of facts is drawn from the plaintiff complaint.as is required on appeal from a successful motion to dismiss in the district court,we accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and draw all inferences in the plaintiff favor.see mortimer off shore,fed.republic of,cir,cert.denied.see also harris mills,cir reciting the supreme court guidance in bell atl.twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,that we need not credit legal conclusions couched as factual statements or threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this suit arises out of bernard madoff infamous and ponzi scheme.mlsmk investment company is a florida partnership,all of whose partners are citizens of that state.jpmc is a global financial services firm providing a panoply of investment banking and financial services to businesses and individuals chase bank,a commercial bank,is a wholly owned subsidiary of jpmc.both are delaware corporations with their principal places of business in new york city 
the general contours of bernard madoff businesses and transgressions are notorious.for about forty years preceding his december arrest,he owned and operated bmis,a business based in manhattan.bmis operated three separate entities providing distinct services services,services,and proprietary trading.bmis business,of which the defendant jpmc was a trading partner,is generally thought and is conceded by mlsmk to have been legitimate but bmis business,according to mlsmk,was entirely fictional and central to madoff criminal enterprise.compl.madoff accepted funds from individual and corporate clients promising to invest them in the entity through which the clients would earn returns of up to a year.id.at compl.madoff never made those investments.instead,he used money to pay returns to other investors and to fund his lavish lifestyle a classic ponzi scheme 
having received monthly statements from bmis for june through september of indicating a to percent annualized return on previously made investments,mlsmk caused million to be transferred to bmis by wiring the funds to bmis s account at chase bank in new york between october,and december.id.at compl.
mlsmk alleges that all of the money madoff received in the fraudulent investment advisory business was deposited into accounts he held at defendant chase bank,id.at compl,and that,because the investor account number was required to be written on the face of the check,chase bank knew that the funds were not madoff or bmis s but rather belonged to the victim and were being received by bmis as a fiduciary,id.at compl.mlsmk asserts that,for many years prior to,bmis chase bank account had an average balance of several billion dollars.id.compl.with the advent of the global financial crisis in september,however,the account balance often dropped to near zero.id.
mlsmk alleges that jpmc,in addition to operating as a trading partner for bmis,developed a derivative product specifically for use with investments.id.at compl.jpmc product,a note it offered primarily to european investors,guaranteed a return of three times the earnings of a fund offered by the fairfield greenwich group,one of madoff feeder fund s.id.compl.internal quotation marks omitted the fairfield greenwich group fund,known as the sentry fund,had assets totaling billion,percent of which was invested with bmis id.at compl.according to the complaint,jpmc hedged against the risk assumed by its derivative product by depositing three times the face amount of the notes up to million by the summer of directly into the sentry fund.consequently,if the sentry fund did well as it was expected to do,based on madoff consistent to percent bogus returns jpmc returns would offset its obligations on the notes.id.at compl.according to the plaintiff,this fund continued to report gains of five percent due to the returns madoff was showing on the money invested with bmis,even as the financial markets were crumbling in the summer and early fall of.id.compl.
mlsmk alleges that the sentry fund consistently strong returns despite the market mayhem triggered jpmc suspicion about madoff results.the investment company therefore embarked on a due diligence investigation of madoff operations.id.the complaint alleges that a s a result of its investigation,in or about september,jpmc quietly liquidated its investment in the fund,although it remained liable on its own derivative product.id.at compl.by that time,the defendants had unequivocally concluded that madoff reported returns were false and illegitimate and that the only way to protect its own capital was to liquidate the entirety of its investments.see also id.in short,by september,jpmc knew that madoff business was a fraud.the plaintiff asserts that in january,jpmc publicly admitted that the withdrawal of its investment was based on concerns and questions raised during the due diligence investigation of madoff.id.
finally,the complaint alleges that,despite the defendants actual knowledge that madoff investments were a sham,and that madoff was diverting customer funds,jpmc continued to trade with madoff market making business,and chase bank continued to provide madoff with banking services.id.at compl.according to the plaintiff,the defendants continued these activities because madoff account was very lucrative,having provided chase for years with substantial earnings and fees from the large cash balances in the account.id.at compl.the plaintiff asserts that r ather than protect other victims of madoff fraud as it had already protected itself,chase chose not only to protect madoff,but also to partner with him in the fleecing of his victims by providing exactly the same range of services,for substantial fees,after learning of his criminal enterprise,as it had before its investigation.id.
on april,mlsmk filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york asserting five claims against jpmc and chase bank.four of the five causes of action aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,commercial bad faith,and two counts of negligence were pleaded under new york law.the fifth denominated count one in the complaint alleged that,from about september to december,the defendants conspired to violate rico,d and c by knowingly and purposely conspir ing with madoff to further madoff racketeering enterprise by providing madoff with banking services that were integral to the functioning of the racketeering enterprise and by engaging in various rico predicate acts,including numerous interstate wire communications,for which the defendants were paid substantial fees derived entirely from madoff racketeering enterprise.id.at compl.mlsmk seeks,inter alia,an award of treble damages under rico for this allegedly illegal activity.
on june,the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that the plaintiff did not adequately plead the required elements of its claims,and,as to the rico conspiracy cause of action,that the claim is barred by section of the pslra.
by order dated july,the district court granted the defendants motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety.the district court dismissed the rico claim because,the court concluded,mlsmk failed adequately to plead the defendants requisite state of mind.
mlsmk now appeals.in a summary order dated june,we affirmed the dismissal of mlsmk four claims for substantially the reasons relied upon by the district court however,we retained jurisdiction over the rico claim.see mlsmk i,wl,at.lexis,at.this opinion therefore addresses only the viability of mlsmk rico conspiracy claim.
discussion 
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under rule b,accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.litwin blackstone,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
chase bank and jpmc argued before the district court,and continue to assert on appeal,that mlsmk rico conspiracy claim is precluded by section of the pslra,c,presenting a question of first impression for this court.the district court judges in our circuit that have addressed it are divided.the district court in the instant case avoided the issue altogether by dismissing mlsmk rico claim on the ground that the plaintiff had not adequately pled scienter,which is required when a plaintiff alleges a rico claim based on fraudulent predicate acts.see first capital asset,satinwood,cir a ll allegations of fraudulent predicate acts are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.baisch.gallina,cir.in light of the possibility that the plaintiff might seek in the district court to amend the complaint based on recently discovered evidence and then successfully replead scienter,we affirm the dismissal,instead,on the grounds that,in any event,section of the pslra bars the plaintiff rico conspiracy claim.see in re methyl tertiary butyl ether prods.liab,cir stating that this court may affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court internal quotation marks omitted.
section of the pslra which was enacted as an amendment to the rico statute and accordingly is often referred to as the rico amendment provides that no person may rely upon any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation of section.c.as explained by the united states district court for the southern district of texas,b efore the rico amendment,a plaintiff could allege a private civil rico claim for securities laws violations sounding in fraud because fraud in the sale of securities was listed as a predicate offense.in re enron,derivative erisa,d,citing bald eagle area sch.dist.keystone,cir.inasmuch as fraud in the sale of securities was,before the rico amendment,a predicate offense in both criminal and civil rico actions,plaintiffs regularly elevated fraud to rico violations because rico offered the potential bonanza of recovering treble damages.bald eagle area sch,at citation omitted.
the rico amendment changed the use of that tactic by barring civil rico claims based on allegations of securities fraud.see thomas lee equity fund v,mayer brown,rowe maw llp,d,section of the pslra bars private causes of action under rico for predicate acts that describe conduct that would otherwise be actionable as securities fraud.see also bald eagle area sch,f d at the pslra amended rico by narrowing the kind of conduct that could qualify as a predicate act.as the plaintiff concedes,the purpose of the bar was to prevent litigants from using artful pleading to securities fraud cases into rico cases,with their threat of treble damages.appellant reply br.accord bald eagle area sch,at quoting the legislative history and explaining the purpose of the pslra.
but the scope of the rico amendment bar is unsettled in this circuit.the parties dispute whether it applies to all civil rico claims predicated upon securities fraud,or if there is an exception where,as here,the plaintiff can not bring a securities fraud claim against the defendant because the plaintiff alleges only an aiding and abetting claim,which can not serve as a basis for a private right of action,see cent.bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,concluding that section b of the securities exchange act of,b,does not impos e private civil liability on aiders and abettors of securities fraud.the determinative question,then,is whether the rico amendment bars all rico claims that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities,c,or only rico claims in cases where that plaintiff could have asserted a fraud claim against the named defendant.that is,we must determine whether,as the defendants assert,the bar applies to claims based on conduct that could be actionable under the securities laws even when the particular plaintiff can not bring a cause of action under the securities laws,appellees br.quoting thomas lee,d at internal quotation marks omitted see appellees supp.br,or whether,as mlsmk contends,the viability of a rico claim turns on the claims available against a particular defendant,appellant reply br.see appellant supp.br.a court must analyze whether the particular plaintiff has a cause of action sounding in securities fraud against the named defendant.
this court has not weighed in on the question.the answers proffered by the district courts in this circuit diverge,but at least three district court judges in this circuit have accepted the argument made by the defendants here.in fezzani bear,stearns,civ,wl,dist.lexis,richard casey,judge,the plaintiffs,who had asserted section b claims and rico claims against several defendants,urged the court to interpret the rico amendment to permit a civil rico claim based upon alleged predicate acts of aiding and abetting securities fraud.the district court rejected the plaintiff particularly narrow interpretation of the rico a mendment,which would permit rico liability against any defendant not individually alleged to have committed securities fraud,despite that defendant extensive reliance on others securities fraud.fezzani,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court viewed this approach as inconsistent with congress purpose in enacting the law.see also,at,reprinted in,describing congress intent to eliminate securities fraud as a predicate act of racketeering in a civil rico action.the court specifically rejected the contention also pressed by mlsmk here that because securities fraud laws do not create a private cause of action for aiding and abetting securities,mail,or wire fraud,a plaintiff should be able to pursue a rico claim against an alleged aider and abetter of securities fraud.fezzani,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court expressed concern that if it were to accept the plaintiffs interpretation,a plaintiff could too easily manipulate a complaint to skirt the rico amendment limitations 
armed with the knowledge that aiding and abetting a manipulative or deceptive practice is insufficient under central bank of denver,at,for example,a plaintiff could deliberately plead facts that established no more than that a particular defendant aided and abetted another securities fraud.such incentive is particularly strong where,as here,a plaintiff might rely on the securities fraud of those with few assets to obtain treble damages against deeper pockets.
in thomas lee,judge gerard lynch reached the same conclusion.thomas lee,d at.as in fezzani,the plaintiffs in thomas lee alleged that a defendant violated rico by aiding and abetting another securities law violations.id.at.judge lynch adopted the reasoning of fezzani,stating that the plaintiffs proffered interpretation of the pslra rico amendment under which so long as plaintiffs are pursuing aiders and abettors,they may proceed under rico because their securities claims are not actionable is treacherous.id.the court explained that t he language of the statute simply does not require that,for a rico claim to be barred,the plaintiff who sues under rico must be able to sue under securities laws,or that the conduct actionable as securities fraud on which the plaintiff relies to establish the rico violation must be that of the defendant.id.at see also id.at the plaintiffs argument to the contrary is problematic for precisely the reasons discussed in fezzani.citing fezzani,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.finally,the thomas lee court noted that the plaintiffs narrower interpretation of the rico amendment would require the court to overlook that the amendment barring rico claims was made in the same statute that explicitly authoriz ed only the sec not private parties to bring enforcement actions against aiders and abettors.id.the court concluded that 
i t would be strange indeed if congress,in a statute that otherwise bars private causes of action under rico for predicate acts that describe conduct actionable as securities fraud,nevertheless chose to allow enhanced rico remedies treble damages and attorneys fees against only the very parties that congress simultaneously made immune from private suit under the securities laws.the better interpretation and the one supported by the plain meaning of of the pslra is that the rico amendment bars claims based on conduct that could be actionable under the securities laws even when the plaintiff,himself,can not bring a cause of action under the securities laws.
id.at emphasis in original.
at least one other district court has accepted the interpretation adopted in thomas lee and fezzani cohain klimley,civ,civ,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,paul gardephe,judge adopting the thomas lee court interpretation of section of the pslra and noting that most courts to address the subject have held that any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities including aiding and abetting securities fraud may not be relied upon to establish a rico violation see id.at,dist.lexis,at collecting cases.
as the thomas lee court noted,d at and as the plaintiff points out in its opening brief on appeal and in its supplemental at least two other district courts in this circuit have interpreted the rico amendment bar more narrowly.see seippel sidley,austin,brown wood,llp,d,shira scheindlin,judge noting the split among courts in the southern district of new york on the issue of the breadth of the rico amendment bar.in osrecovery,v.one groupe int l,d,the plaintiffs asserted a rico claim based on the defendant alleged aiding and abetting of another securities law violations.the defendant foreign bank moved to dismiss the rico claim,arguing that it was precluded by the rico amendment.id.at.the district court lewis kaplan,judge denied the defendant motion,interpreting the rico amendment to bar only rico claims based on predicate acts of securities fraud that the plaintiffs could have pursued as securities claims against the named defendant.see id.at.that is,the court in osrecovery thought the relevant question under the pslra to be whether the specific defendant alleged conduct is actionable under the securities laws.id.at.the district court concluded that,because there is no private right of action for aiding and abetting under section b of the securities exchange act,and the plaintiffs therefore could not have sought to vindicate their rights by filing a securities claim,the rico amendment did not bar the plaintiffs rico claim.
in renner chase manhattan bank,civ,wl,dist.lexis,charles haight,judge,the district court determined that the rico amendment did not preclude the plaintiff rico claim.id.at,dist.lexis,at.judge haight reasoned that,because the plaintiff claim against chase manhattan bank a predecessor to the defendants in the case now before us alleged only that the bank aided and abetted the fraud of another,the allegations did not provide a valid basis for a securities fraud claim.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court continued that the claim therefore would not have been actionable against chase under the securities law,and accordingly was not prohibited by the pslra rico amendment.id.at,dist.lexis,at see also id.at,dist.lexis,at t he application of the reform act turns upon whether chase alleged conduct is actionable under the securities laws.
mlsmk asserts that the district judges accepting the defense of rico amendment preclusion were concerned predominantly with the policy implications of a plaintiff electing between causes of action to evade the restrictions of the pslra,appellant reply br,issues that the plaintiff contends are not present here,see id.the court in fezzani specifically feared that a plaintiff who might legitimately have a securities fraud claim against a defendant would nevertheless instead plead only aiding and abetting conduct in order to bring the case under rico.the defendants,by contrast,urge us to accept the view adopted in the fezzani line of cases,citing the court statement in thomas lee that the minority approach endorsed in osrecovery is both unpersuasive and against the great weight of precedent.thomas lee,d at see cohain,wl,at,dist.lexis,at osrecovery has not been relied on for the proposition that the rico amendment does not bar rico claims premised on conduct that constitutes aiding and abetting securities fraud,however,and several courts have explicitly rejected its reasoning.
we agree with the defendants that the reasoning of the district courts in fezzani and thomas lee is persuasive.we conclude that section of the pslra bars civil rico claims alleging predicate acts of securities fraud,even where a plaintiff can not itself pursue a securities fraud action against the defendant 
crucially,the plain language of the statute does not require that the same plaintiff who sues under rico must be the one who can sue under securities laws its wording does not make such a connection.in re enron,d at see c n o person may rely upon any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation of section.emphases added.as another district court has explained,
when congress stated that no person could bring a civil rico action alleging conduct that would have been actionable as securities fraud,it meant just that.it did not mean no person except one who has no other actionable securities fraud claim.it did not specify that the conduct had to be actionable as securities fraud by a particular person to serve as a bar to a rico claim by that same person.
hemispherx biopharma,asensio,no.civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,quoted in in re enron,d at.we agree that the rico amendment is worded broadly and does not indicate that congress intended that it be applied in the limited manner that mlsmk urges.cent.bank of denver,at quoting blue chip stamps manor drug stores,when congress wished to provide a remedy to those who neither purch
