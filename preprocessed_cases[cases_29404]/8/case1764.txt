these appeals arise from judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lewis kaplan,judge,dismissing plaintiff atsi communications,atsi complaints under.b in two separate actions arising from the same events.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,d.atsi alleges that the defendants made misrepresentations in connection with securities transactions and engaged in market manipulation in violation of b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,or were liable as control persons under a of the exchange act,a.atsi claims that the defendants fraudulently induced it to sell to them its convertible preferred stock.the defendants then aggressively short sold atsi common stock and converted the preferred stock to cover their short positions.the alleged consequence was a death spiral in the price of atsi stock and enormous profit for the defendants.
we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
the following facts are taken from atsi complaints and supporting documents,which we must assume to be true in reviewing a.b dismissal.see rothman gregor,cir.
atsi and its efforts to raise money 
atsi was founded in december and hoped to become a leading provider of retail communications services in mexico in the wake of the deregulation and privatization in latin america telecommunications markets.it never turned a profit.by,atsi needed an infusion of capital to expand its customer base and further develop its telephone network in mexico.
to raise money,atsi issued four series of cumulative convertible preferred stock preferred stock series b,c,d,and each transaction included a securities purchase agreement,a certificate of designation,and a registration rights agreement.each series included a conversion feature that worked as follows.upon conversion,a market price was calculated as the average of the lowest five closing bid prices during the period preceding the conversion date.the conversion price was calculated as the lesser of the closing bid price on a trading day fixed by the certificate of designation and the market price discounted by to depending upon the series.atsi would then issue a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of preferred stock to be converted multiplied by the preferred stock stated value of per share divided by the conversion price.because there is no limit on the number of common shares into which the preferred stock could convert,securities such as these are called floorless convertibles.the obvious inference from atsi sale of these securities is that these unfavorable terms were necessary to attract investors because atsi was continuously losing money.in fact,atsi acknowledged that in light of its financial condition,it might not be able to raise money on any acceptable terms.american telesource international,annual report form,at july.
sales to the levinson defendants 
on a road show in dallas,texas in march,defendant corporate capital management ccm introduced atsi executives to defendant sam levinson,the managing director of levinson capital and the shaar fund.shaar advisory services,shaar advisory served as executive officer and general partner of the shaar fund.defendant uri wolfson controls the shaar fund.collectively,levinson,levinson capital,the shaar fund,and shaar advisory constitute the levinson defendants.
during a may telephone conversation,ccm told atsi that the shaar fund had invested in several strong,successful companies and that the levinson defendants were interested in atsi growth.during a june meeting,levinson told atsi,inter alia,that the levinson defendants sought a investment in atsi and would not engage in any activity to depress its stock.atsi claims that all of these representations were false and misleading because ccm and levinson knew otherwise and the levinson defendants were actually market manipulators that profited at the expense of the companies in which they invested.
over the next six months,atsi entered into the following securities transactions with the shaar fund.
the securities purchase agreement for each transaction included written representations that 
the shaar fund was an accredited investor within the meaning of rule of regulation d under the securities act of and 
neither the shaar fund nor its affiliates nor any person acting on its or their behalf has the intention of entering,or will enter into,prior to the closing,any put option,short position,or other similar instrument or position with respect to the common stock of atsi and neither the shaar fund nor any of its affiliates nor any person acting on its or their behalf will use at any time shares of common stock acquired pursuant to this agreement to settle any put option,short position or other similar instrument or position that may have been entered into prior to the execution of this agreement.
atsi claims that these representations were false because the shaar fund net worth was not high enough to meet the requirements for being an accredited investor and the shaar fund intended to engage,and did engage,in short selling and manipulation of atsi stock before,during,and after entering into these agreements.
the registration rights agreement in each transaction contained a merger clause stating that 
there are no restrictions,promises,warranties,or undertakings,other than those set forth or referred to herein.this agreement,the securities purchase agreement,the escrow instructions,the preferred shares and the warrants supersede all prior agreements and undertakings among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.
the registration rights agreements contemplated that the shaar fund would soon sell its converted common stock into the public markets.they required atsi to use its best efforts to register the common stock to be issued upon conversion of the preferred stock within days of closing and to take all reasonable steps to help the shaar fund sell the common stock.they also imposed,at most,a holding period before the shaar fund could convert its preferred stock.the only restriction upon the shaar fund ability to sell the common stock was if atsi notified it of a material misstatement in the stock prospectus.
sales to rose glen 
in september,atsi decided to issue million in its equity to fund an acquisition.defendant crown capital corporation crown capital,acting as placement agent,recommended defendants rgc international investors,ldc,and rose glen capital management,defendants wayne bloch,gary kaminsky,and steve katznelson were employees of rose glen capital management.we refer collectively to all of these defendants as rose glen.
during negotiations,rose glen allegedly made false verbal representations similar to those made by the levinson defendants.
on september,rose glen submitted a draft term sheet to atsi offering a million investment.atsi claims that it then fell victim to a when,on october,rose glen submitted closing documents providing for only a million investment in series e preferred stock,with a promise of further investment of up to million if certain conditions were met.atsi says it was forced to accept these terms because it was required to pay million to vendors in mexico the next day.atsi sold rose glen additional series e preferred stock in march and july of.
the purchase agreement pursuant to which these securities were sold included two representations by rose glen that atsi claims to be false on the same basis as the levinson representations 
rose glen was an accredited investor and 
rose glen was purchasing the preferred stock and common stock issuable upon conversion 
for its own account and not with a present view towards the public sale or distribution thereof except pursuant to sales registered or exempted from registration under the act provided,however that by making the representation herein,the buyer does not agree to hold any of the securities for any minimum or other specific term and reserves the right to dispose of the securities at any time in accordance with or pursuant to a registration statement or exemption under the act.
the registration rights agreements also contained a merger clause similar to the one in the shaar fund transaction documents.
b.the death spiral financing manipulation scheme 
in addition to these misrepresentations,atsi claims that all of the defendants manipulated the market in atsi common stock by bringing about a death spiral in the price of atsi common stock.the scheme,as alleged,worked as follows.the shareholder would short sell the victim common stock to drive down its price he then converts his convertible securities into common stock and uses that common stock to cover his short position.the convertible securities allow a manipulator to increase his profits by allowing him to cover with discounted common shares not obtained on the open market,to rely on the convertible securities as a hedge against the risk of loss,and to dilute existing common shares,resulting in a further decline in stock price.atsi was aware of the risk of dilution for example,it disclosed in the registration statement on its form that it expected the shaar fund to convert shortly after the registration became effective and that future issuances of preferred stock would put downward pressure on and dilute its common stock.
atsi accuses the levinson defendants,wolfson,and rose glen of deliberately causing a death spiral in its common stock.the shaar fund began converting its preferred stock shortly after it was contractually permitted to do so.during the first two quarters of fiscal year,it had converted all of its series b shares into approximately million common shares.although atsi april,form states that the shaar fund sold the common stock,the complaints do not allege any such sales.between december,and january,the shaar fund converted its series d shares into shares of atsi common stock.between march,and august,rose glen converted its preferred stock into over nineteen million shares of common stock.
atsi does not allege any specific acts of short selling by the levinson defendants,but it includes circumstantial allegations.it alleges that searches in the sec edgar database reveal that of the companies that reported the levinson defendants as investors,experienced stock price declines indicative of a death spiral financing scheme.its allegations against rose glen are of like kind.
atsi also relies on the magnitude and timing of changes in its stock price and trading volume.at the time of the series b transaction in july,its stock traded at per share.two months later,it traded at per share.in february,the series d preferred stock purchase was preceded by a significant increase in the daily trading volume of atsi shares and a dramatic rise in atsi share price to per share perhaps not coincidentally as atsi listed its stock on the american stock exchange amex during that period.april saw massive stock sales and large price declines in atsi stock.for example,between april,and april,which time atsi filed a registration statement for the common stock into which the series c and d preferred stock would price fell from per share to per share on heavy volume.atsi claims that these price movements could only have resulted from sales by the levinson defendants,despite levinson claim that the shaar fund was not selling.
atsi stock price climbed up to per share by.on september,atsi registration of common stock for the series c and d preferred stock became effective and,by november,its price had fallen to per share,and plummeted to per share on august.
in addition to these price fluctuations,atsi relies more specifically on price movements and trading volume around the time that the shaar fund and rose glen converted their series d and e preferred stock,which worked to their benefit.atsi further points to instances where its stock price reacted negatively to positive news.atsi also points to a period between december,and january,in which depository trust company records show that over eight million shares were traded in excess of settlement,which it claims could only result from sham trading.
c.other defendants 
atsi alleges that any manipulation had to involve defendant trimark securities,trimark,which served as the principal market maker in atsi stock.
atsi also alleges that several defendants,hereinafter referred to as the citco defendants,caused the shaar fund to engage in the charged misconduct.defendant citco fund services curaçao is the parent of defendant intercaribbean services,the shaar fund sole director.declan quilligan is a director of intercaribbean.langeveld,hugo van neutegem,and luc hollman served as managing directors of shaar advisory.
atsi demise 
telecom stocks were generally during the period in which atsi alleges manipulation.between february,the date on which atsi issued the series d preferred stock and october,the date on which atsi filed its first suit,the amex north american telecom index of which atsi stock was not a component dropped by.when atsi filed its complaint,its stock traded at per share.its financial impairment has rendered it unable to raise capital to maintain or expand its business.
atsi claims and procedural history 
atsi claims that the levinson defendants,wolfson,langeveld,rose glen,ccm,and crown capital are liable for misrepresentations under b and rule that these same defendants and trimark are also liable for market manipulation in violation of rule and that the citco defendants and others not relevant to this appeal are liable as control persons under a.atsi also asserts various state law claims.
atsi filed its complaint in the first suit in october against all defendants except wolfson atsi i.in march,the district court dismissed atsi first amended complaint against the levinson defendants and rose glen for failing to satisfy the pleading requirements of.b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra,b.it dismissed as to the other defendants for improper service and lack of personal jurisdiction.second and third amended complaints followed and,in july,atsi filed a largely identical complaint against levinson and wolfson in a separate suit atsi ii.in february,the district court dismissed the third amended complaint in atsi i under.b with prejudice for again failing to satisfy rule b and the pslra pleading requirements.see atsi commc ns,d at.because subject matter jurisdiction was based solely on atsi federal claims,the district court did not separately consider the state law causes of action.the district court entered judgment under.b,and the parties in atsi ii stipulated to dismissal based on the district court order in atsi 
atsi timely appeals followed.
discussion 
legal standards 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to.b de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.ganino citizens utils,cir.in addition,we may consider any written instrument attached to the complaint,statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,legally required public disclosure documents filed with the sec,and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit.rothman,at.to survive dismissal,the plaintiff must provide the grounds upon which his claim rests through factual allegations sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atl.twombly,d.once a claim has been adequately stated,it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.id.at.
securities fraud claims are subject to heightened pleading requirements that the plaintiff must meet to survive a motion to dismiss.first,a complaint alleging securities fraud must satisfy rule b,ganino,at,which requires that the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.b.this pleading constraint serves to provide a defendant with fair notice of a plaintiff claim,safeguard his reputation from improvident charges of wrongdoing,and protect him against strike suits.rombach chang,cir.a securities fraud complaint based on misstatements must specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent,identify the speaker,state where and when the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.novak kasaks,cir.allegations that are conclusory or unsupported by factual assertions are insufficient.see luce edelstein,cir.
second,private securities fraud actions must also meet the pslra pleading requirements or face dismissal.see b a.in pleading scienter in an action for money damages requiring proof of a particular state of mind,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.id.b.the plaintiff may satisfy this requirement by alleging facts showing that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.ganino,at.moreover,in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter,the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.for an inference of scienter to be strong,a reasonable person must deem it cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.emphasis added.
if the plaintiff alleges a false statement or omission,the pslra also requires that the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.
ii.atsi market manipulation claims 
market manipulation and short selling 
section b,in proscribing the use of a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,id.b,prohibits not only material misstatements but also manipulative acts.cent.bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.under the statute 
manipulation is virtually a term of art when used in connection with securities markets.the term refers generally to practices,such as wash sales,matched orders,or rigged prices,that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity.section b general prohibition of practices deemed by the sec to be manipulative in this technical sense of artificially affecting market activity in order to mislead fully consistent with the fundamental purpose of the exchange act to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor 
santa fe indus.green,d alteration in original citations omitted.thus,manipulation connotes intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.ernst ernst,at.the critical question then becomes what activity artificially affects a security price in a deceptive manner.
although not explicitly described as such,case law in this circuit and elsewhere has required a showing that an alleged manipulator engaged in market activity aimed at deceiving investors as to how other market participants have valued a security.the deception arises from the fact that investors are misled to believe that prices at which they purchase and sell securities are determined by the natural interplay of supply and demand,not rigged by manipulators.gurary winehouse,cir see also mobil marathon oil,cir stating that the supreme court has indicated that manipulation under b refers to means unrelated to the natural forces of supply and demand pagel,sec,cir agreeing with the sec that w hen individuals occupying a dominant market position engage in a scheme to distort the price of a security for their own benefit,they violate the securities laws by perpetrating a fraud on all public investors crane westinghouse air brake,cir holding that nondisclosure of large open market purchases combined with large secret sales to deter stockholders from participating in a competing tender offer violated rule by distort ing the market picture and deceiv ing the issuer stockholders.
in identifying activity that is outside the natural interplay of supply and demand,courts generally ask whether a transaction sends a false pricing signal to the market.for example,the seventh circuit recognizes that one of the fundamental goals of the federal securities laws is to prevent practices that impair the function of stock markets in enabling people to buy and sell securities at prices that reflect undistorted though not necessarily accurate estimates of the underlying economic value of the securities traded,and thus looks to the charged activity effect on capital market efficiency see sullivan long,scattered,cir.the seventh circuit focus on disruptions to the efficient pricing of a security is consistent with our view that in preventing market rigging,b seeks a market where competing judgments of buyers and sellers as to the fair price of the security brings about a situation where the market price reflects as nearly as possible a just price.sec first jersey,cir quoting,at.in an efficient market,trading engineered to stimulate demand can mislead investors into believing that the market has discovered some positive news and seeks to exploit it,see in re initial pub.offering sec,d,aff tenney credit suisse first boston,wl cir.may,the duped investors then transact accordingly.to prevent this deleterious effect on the capital markets,the third circuit distinguishes manipulative from legal conduct by asking whether the manipulator inject ed inaccurate information into the marketplace or creat ed a false impression of supply and demand for the security for the purpose of artificially depressing or inflating the price of the security.gfl advantage fund,colkitt,cir see also jones,d.
market manipulation is forbidden regardless of whether there is a fiduciary relationship between the transaction participants.see united states russo,cir united states regan,cir.a market manipulation claim,however,can not be based solely upon misrepresentations or omissions.lentell merrill lynch,cir.there must be some market activity,such as wash sales,matched orders,or rigged prices.see santa fe,at.
furthermore,short in high not,by itself,manipulative.gfl,at.aside from providing market liquidity,short selling enhances pricing efficiency by helping to move the prices of overvalued securities toward their intrinsic values.see id.at sullivan long,at discussing the defendants short sales as arbitrage that eliminates disparities between price and value in re scattered.sec,john finnerty,short selling,death spiral convertibles,and the profitability of stock manipulation,available at.ralph janvey,short selling,sec.reg.in essence,taking a short position is no different than taking a long position.to be actionable as a manipulative act,short selling must be willfully combined with something more to create a false impression of how market participants value a security.similarly,purchasing a floorless convertible security is not,by itself or when coupled with short selling,inherently manipulative.such securities provide distressed companies with access to capital and,so long as their terms are fully disclosed,can provide a transparent hedge against a short sale.
pleading market manipulation 
market manipulation requires a plaintiff to allege manipulative acts damage caused by reliance on an assumption of an efficient market free of manipulation scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities furthered by the defendant use of the mails or any facility of a national securities exchange.see schnell conseco,d,cowen merriam.
because a claim for market manipulation is a claim for fraud,it must be pled with particularity under rule b.see internet law library,southridge capital,d,d at see also rooney pace,reid,applying rule b to a market manipulation claim.a claim of manipulation,however,can involve facts solely within the defendant knowledge therefore,at the early stages of litigation,the plaintiff need not plead manipulation to the same degree of specificity as a plain misrepresentation claim.see internet law library,d at,d at rombach,at relaxing the standard where information was likely to be in the exclusive control of the defendants and analysts.
accordingly,a manipulation complaint must plead with particularity the nature,purpose,and effect of the fraudulent conduct and the roles of the defendants.see in re blech sec,adopting this test as set forth in the unpublished decision baxter baron,civ,wl,see also compudyne shane,d,commodity futures trading comm bradley,d,market manipulation under the commodity exchange act fezzani bear,stearns,d,in re royal ahold sec.erisa,d,log on,promethean asset,d,d at in re blech sec.but see,d at articulating requirements for a less stringent pleading standard in the third circuit.general allegations not tied to the defendants or resting upon speculation are insufficient.this test will be satisfied if the complaint sets forth,to the extent possible,what manipulative acts were performed,which defendants performed them,when the manipulative acts were performed,and what effect the scheme had on the market for the securities at issue.baxter,wl,at see also miller lazard,d,in re sterling foster.sec,d,blech.at.this standard meets the goals of rule b while also considering which specific facts a plaintiff alleging manipulation can realistically plead at this stage of the litigation.
because a claim for market manipulation requires a showing of scienter,the pslra heightened standards for pleading scienter also apply.therefore,the complaint must plead with particularly facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant intended to deceive investors by artificially affecting the market price of securities.see b section,supra.this pleading requirement is particularly important in manipulation claims because in some cases scienter is the only factor that distinguishes legitimate trading from improper manipulation.
manipulation by the levinson defendants,wolfson,and rose glen 
atsi allegations that the levinson defendants,wolfson,and rose glen manipulated the market are based on selling of atsi stock with coinciding drops in the stock price,trading patterns around conversion time,the stock negative reaction to positive news,and the volume of trades in excess of settlement during a period in.we agree with the district court that these allegations are inadequate under rule b.in sum,atsi has offered no specific allegations that the defendants did anything to manipulate the market it relies,at best,on speculative inferences.moreover,atsi has failed to adequately plead scienter.
atsi complaint alleges selling between april,and april,resulting in a decline in stock price.atsi narrows the list of potential culprits to these defendants because atsi major shareholders said that they were not selling stock,leaving only the defendants with large enough blocks of shares to trade at the observed volumes.these allegations fail to state even roughly how many shares the defendants sold,when they sold them,and why those sales caused the precipitous drop in stock price.and the complaint is devoid of facts supporting atsi belief that these defendants had sufficient shares to engage in the trading alleged.even though the complaint alleges trading volumes of up to million shares per day,atsi reported in its april,form that the shaar fund held only shares of its common stock.the complaint and relevant documents do not reveal how many shares wolfson and rose glen held.atsi argues that the shaar fund shares of series d preferred stock were eventually converted into million common to support the observed trading volumes.this allegation does not help atsi,however,because the complaint states that the shaar fund did not begin converting those preferred shares until december,many months after the selling.
the complaint then alleges that there was a drop in atsi stock price in the days leading up to the defendants conversion of the preferred stock.it alleges that in the absence of manipulation,the reference price for conversion should approximate the average price during the days prior to the period and that trading volumes during the periods should have been equal to the average for the previous quarter.we agree with the district court view that atsi position is ludicrous.atsi commc ns,d at.one does not observe constant prices or trading volumes in the stock markets.cent.bank of mattoon dep t of treasury,cir t he value of a company is rarely constant over an entire year.
the complaint next alleges that manipulation may be inferred from the stock negative reaction to positive news.the district court was mistaken in dismissing this circumstance on the grounds that the announcement concerns events with no apparent connection to the defendants or this case.atsi commc ns,d at.the premise of atsi theory is that an issuer stock price,in the absence of manipulation,should increase when good news is announced under such a theory,the subject of the news and the defendants do not need to be connected.
nevertheless,this allegation can not save the complaint because atsi pleads no particular connection between the negative reaction of the stock price and anything the defendants did.adopting atsi reasoning would subject large holders of convertible preferred stock to the risk of suit under b whenever the stock price does not react to news as the issuer expects.see rombach,at stating that rule b serves,inter alia,to safeguard a defendant reputation from improvident charges of wrongdoing and protect him against strike suits.
finally,the complaint rests on an inference of manipulation based upon depository trust company records showing that shares were traded in excess of settlements during the period before the amex suspended trading of atsi stock.trading volume increased over this period,yet the percentage of trading volume that settled decreased.atsi claims that the only plausible explanation is that the trades did not result in any change in beneficial ownership,indicating wash trades,matched trades,phantom shares,and other manipulative trading.
the inference atsi asks us to draw is too speculative even on a motion to dismiss.see segal gordon,cir holding that distorted inferences and speculations could not meet rule b requirements.nowhere does atsi particularly allege what the defendants simply mentioning common types of manipulative state how this activity affected the market in atsi stock.this data could easily be the result of internal settlements within that do not involve the depository trust company.manipulation is also unlikely given that atsi closing share price during this period started at per share and ended at per share.
for similar reasons,none of these allegations,nor anything else in the complaint,meets the pslra requirements for pleading scienter.see b.a strong inference of scienter is not raised by alleging that a legitimate investment vehicle,such as the convertible preferred stock at issue here,creates an opportunity for profit through manipulation.see ganino,at.these circumstances are present for any investor in floorless convertibles.chill,cir holding that a generalized motive that an issuer wishes to appear profitable,which could be imputed to any public enterprise,was insufficiently concrete to infer scienter in re alstom sa sec,d,stating a similar proposition for corporate insiders.accordingly,there is a plausible nonculpable explanation for the defendants actions that is more likely than any inference that the defendants intended to manipulate the market,see tellabs.at atsi and the defendants simply entered into mutually beneficial financing transactions.further,because atsi has not adequately pled that the defendants engaged in any short sales or other potentially manipulative activity,there is no circumstantial evidence of manipulative intent.see ganino,at.accordingly,more specific allegations are required.
manipulation claims against trimark 
the complaint is plainly insufficient in alleging that trimark engaged in market manipulation it only alleges that trimark was the principal market maker in atsi stock,that trimark knew or should have known of the manipulation,and that atsi believes that trimark was a cooperating.wholly absent are particular facts giving rise to a strong inference that trimark acted with scienter in manipulating the market in atsi common stock and any allegations of specific acts by trimark to manipulate the market,much less how those actions might have affected the market.
iii.atsi misrepresentation claims 
to state a claim under rule for misrepresentations,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant made misstatements or omissions of material fact,with scienter,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,upon which the plaintiff relied,and that the plaintiff reliance was the proximate cause of its injury.lentell,at.the district court properly dismissed the misrepresentations claims.
levinson defendants and wolfson 
of the misrepresentations that atsi claims,we can quickly dispose of all except the two alleged in the transaction agreements.the registration rights agreement between atsi and the shaar fund plainly states that the only promises,restrictions,and warranties to the transaction were those set forth in the transaction documents.where the plaintiff is a sophisticated investor and an integrated agreement between the parties does not include the misrepresentation at issue,the plaintiff can not establish reasonable reliance on that misrepresentation.see emergent capital inv.mgmt.stonepath group,cir dresner,d.by engaging in these private placements of complex securities,atsi is clearly a sophisticated investor.accordingly,to the extent atsi causes of action are based on alleged misrepresentations made during negotiations preceding the defendants investment,those claims are barred by the merger clauses.
promise not to short sell 
the complaint alleges,on information and belief,a fraudulent misrepresentation by the shaar fund in promising,in the securities purchase agreement,not to enter a short position prior to closing or cover a short position entered into prior to execution of the agreement using converted common stock.the complaint fails to sufficiently allege that this representation was false when made.while the failure to carry out a promise in connection with a securities transaction might constitute breach of contract,it does not constitute fraud unless,when the promise was made,the defendant secretly intended not to perform or knew that he could not perform.gurary,at internal quotation marks omitted.the speculative allegations that the levinson defendants and wolfson engaged in short selling are deficient for the same reasons that they did not establish manipulation.
atsi asks us to infer that the levinson defendants never intended to honor this promise because they had previously engaged in death spiral financing schemes,as evidenced by the declining stock prices of unspecified companies in which they invested.these allegations fail rule b requirement of stating with particularity why the statement was fraudulent and the pslra requirement of stating the facts on which a belief is based.the complaint does not specify which companies experienced a decline in share price or when they experienced the decline other than that they occurred within year of an unspecified time of investment.it also fails to allege with particularity what,if anything,the defendants did to cause the decline it simply offers a generalized allegation that the defendants engaged in death spiral financing combined with a detailed definition of how death spiral financing works.united states ex rel.walsh eastman kodak,d,holding that fraud was not adequately pled under rule b where the plaintiff only alleged a method by which the defendants could produce false invoices without specifying instances of false claims arising from false invoices.holding otherwise would expose investors in and risky,distressed companies to fraud claims based solely on the unsurprisingly poor performance of their portfolios.see rombach,at.
in response,atsi argues that it adequately identified the defendants victims by detailing how the companies could be found by searching the sec edgar database.it also contends that the defendants have personal knowledge of what investments they made and when the stock prices of those investments declined.
atsi can not sufficiently plead fraud by simply providing a method for the defendant to discover the underlying details.if atsi had access to the details necessary to make these allegations,it must plead them and not just tell the defendants to go find them.
we also reject atsi argument that it adequately pled fraud by pointing to the drop in the stock prices of the defendants other investments because that information is relevant under.b and and supports a reasonable inference of fraud.no inference of sabotage is available from the circumstance that some or many risky investments come to nothing.moreover,the allegations fail to point to any specific actions by the defendants with respect to those investments and thus fail to establish that the defendants promise was fraudulent.to the extent the southern district of new york decision in internet law library,d,is to the contrary,we reject it.
investor profile representation 
atsi also claims that the representation in the securities purchase agreement that the shaar fund was an accredited investor was fraudulent.the complaint does not sufficiently allege loss causation with respect to this misrepresentation.a plaintiff is required to prove both transaction causation also known as reliance and loss causation.lentell,at see also b.transaction causation only requires allegations that but for the claimed misrepresentations or omissions,the plaintiff would not have entered into the detrimental securities transaction.lentell,at quoting emergent capital,at.loss causation,by contrast,is the proximate causal link between the alleged misconduct and the plaintiff economic harm.see dura,broudo,d lentell,at.to that end,the plaintiff complaint must plead that the loss was foreseeable and caused by the materialization of the risk concealed by the fraudulent statement.see lentell,at.
the complaint alleges losses through the tremendous decline in atsi share price,impairing its access to capital and its viability as a business and by atsi sale of its own stock at depressed prices.it fails,however,to establish any causal connection between those losses and the misrepresentation that the shaar fund was an accredited investor.in what appears to be an attempt to meet lentell requirements,atsi contends that it adequately pled loss causation because the levinson defendants made this misrepresentation to induce atsi to enter into the transaction under the pretense that they were trustworthy,reputable and investor s,and that when the true risk of their plans materialized through their manipulative acts,atsi suffered losses.this allegation might support transaction causation it fails,however,to show how the fact that the shaar fund was not an accredited investor caused any loss.see id.at such an is nothing more than a paraphrased allegation of transaction why a particular investment was made,but does not speak to the relationship between the fraud and the loss of the investment.internal quotation marks omitted.
atsi is wrong in claiming that these allegations are sufficient to establish loss causation under our decision in weiss wittcoff,cir per curiam.in weiss,the plaintiff agreed to merge his business with the defendant on the latter representation that his other company would supply goods and services.id.at.when the defendant sold his other company a year after the transaction,id.at,the plaintiff business suffered subsequent losses from higher costs,id.at.we held that the complaint adequately pled loss causation because the plaintiff losses were clearly a proximate result of his reliance on defendants promises,since defendants failure to fulfill those promises foreseeably caused the business financial condition to deteriorate.id.at.
weiss is easily distinguishable.there,the complaint established a causal connection between the promise to provide for the business needs and the business increased costs when the promise turned out to be false.see id.atsi,by contrast,fails to show that the subject of the fraudulent statement proximately caused any loss.see lentell,at thus to establish loss causation,a plaintiff must allege that
