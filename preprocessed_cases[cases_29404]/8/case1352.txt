this appeal requires us to decide whether a trademark registrant delivery of a covenant not to sue,and voluntary dismissal of its trademark claims,divests a federal court of subject matter jurisdiction over a defendant counterclaims for a declaratory judgment and cancellation of the trademark registration.after considering the breadth of the plaintiff covenant not to sue and the improbability of future infringement,the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard sullivan,dismissed the defendant counterclaims because no case or controversy existed under article iii of the united states constitution.we affirm.
background 
the complaint and counterclaims 
in july,plaintiff nike,filed a complaint against defendant already,llc yums yums,alleging trademark infringement,false designation of origin,unfair competition,and trademark dilution in violation of,a,and c,and related claims under new york common law and new york general business law.according to the complaint,in,nike designed a shoe called the air force,which it has since produced in more than color combinations,selling millions of pairs each year.the complaint alleged that the air force shoe has a distinctive appearance for which nike owns several federal trademark registrations,including trademark registration number,registered with the united states patent and trademark office on june,hereinafter the registration,for the design of the stitching on the exterior of the shoe,the design of the material panels that form the exterior body of the shoe,the design of the wavy panel on the top of the shoe that encompasses the eyelets for the shoe laces,the design of the vertical ridge pattern on the sides of the sole of the shoe,and the relative position of these elements to each other.compl.quoting the registration.it further alleged that yums was selling footwear bearing a confusingly similar imitation of the air force shoe,including shoes known as sugar and soulja boy.id.at.
in november,yums filed counterclaims for a declaratory judgment that the registration was not in fact a trademark under or new york law,and for cancellation of the registration pursuant to the cancellation provisions of the lanham act.yums also alleged that an actual controversy existed regarding whether yums had infringed any rights nike had in the purported trademark.
the covenant not to sue 
in march,nike delivered a covenant not to sue the covenant to yums.the covenant preamble stated as follows 
nike has recently learned that yums actions complained of in the complaint no longer infringe or dilute the nike mark at a level sufficient to warrant the substantial time and expense of continued litigation and nike wishes to conserve resources relating to its enforcement of the nike mark.
the covenant obligated nike as follows 
to refrain from making any claim s or demand s,or from commencing,causing,or permitting to be prosecuted any action in law or equity,against yums or any of its successors or related entities and their customers,on account of any possible cause of action based on or involving trademark infringement,unfair competition,or dilution,under state or federal law in the united sates sic relating to the nike mark based on the appearance of any of yums current previous footwear product designs,and any colorable imitations thereof,regardless of whether that footwear is produced,distributed,offered for sale,advertised,sold,or otherwise used in commerce before or after the effective date of this covenant.
the district court proceedings and decision 
in april,a month after nike delivered the covenant,the district court held a hearing to determine whether the covenant divested it of subject matter jurisdiction over yums counterclaims.although nike conceded during the hearing that it would be bound by the covenant even if yums became a competitive threat,yums argued that a case or controversy persisted because nike the registration a continuing libel against yums by making it appear that yums had infringed and continued to infringe nike trademark.in the course of its argument,yums acknowledged that it had not previously sought to cancel the registration,which had been filed nearly two years earlier.
after the hearing,nike moved pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss yums counterclaims without prejudice on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.nike also moved to dismiss its own claims voluntarily and with prejudice,pursuant to rule a.
in response,yums argued that nike claims should be dismissed with prejudice by summary judgment under rule b rather than rule a to allow the action,insofar as it included yums counterclaims,to proceed.yums argued that its counterclaims were not subject to dismissal along with nike claims because,under the declaratory judgment act,they created an independent controversy over whether nike had violated yums rights by improperly obtaining a trademark registration.
to demonstrate the existence of an actual controversy notwithstanding the covenant broad language,yums filed affidavits from prospective investors who suggested that nike lawsuit had deterred them from investing in yums or had prompted them to withdraw prior investments.a former investor in yums,for example,stated that he resold his stock to yums at a loss after learning of nike lawsuit,which he feared would tarnish yums reputation and deter other investors from investing in the company.the investor explained that the covenant provided inadequate assurance that nike could not assert its trademarks against yums in the future over the sales of shoes similar to air force.
on january,the district court dismissed nike claims with prejudice and yums counterclaims without prejudice.see nike,already,llc,yums,civ.rjs,wl,at.in dismissing nike claims on consent,the district court explained that yums had consent ed to dismissal of these claims but did not specify which rule,if any,it was invoking.id.at.
turning to yums counterclaims and relying on medimmune,genentech,d,the district court first concluded that yums declaratory judgment action failed to create a justiciable case or controversy,since a declaratory judgment claimant must,under all the circumstances,demonstrate a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.nike,wl,at quoting medimmune,at.the district court held that yums counterclaims did not meet this standard in light of the covenant.in reaching this conclusion,the district court considered the covenant language and broad scope,yums failure to show that it had taken meaningful steps to create new shoes not covered by the covenant,id.quoting llc idex online,d,and the absence of prior litigation between nike and yums.id.at citing icos vision,scanner techs,d,chin.the district court then ruled that yums counterclaim for cancellation of the registration under failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction because such a claim can arise only as part of a separate,independently supportable action.id.at.lastly,without holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court rejected yums application for attorneys fees under the lanham act,a,because the case was not exceptional as required by the act.id.at.
yums timely appealed,challenging both the district court dismissal of its claims and the court denial of yums motion for attorneys fees without an evidentiary hearing.
discussion 
we determine the existence of subject matter jurisdiction before addressing other threshold issues.where a district court dismisses an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.maloney soc.sec,cir.a case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.makarova united states,cir.
because the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction followed its dismissal of nike claims under rule a,yums urges us to review in the first instance whether the district court complied with that rule,which provides,in relevant part 
except as provided in rule a,an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff request only by court order,on terms that the court considers proper.if a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff motion to dismiss,the action may be dismissed over the defendant objection only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication.
a.yums claims that it did not consent to dismissal of its counterclaims,and that the district court dismissal of the entire action in fact occurred over the defendant objection in violation of the second sentence of the rule.
when a plaintiff seeks to withdraw its claims pursuant to rule a,but another event independently deprives the district court of an article iii case or controversy involving the defendant counterclaims,rule a is irrelevant.see super sack chase packaging,finding it unnecessary to consider whether dismissal pursuant to rule a was proper where dismissal was clearly proper because of the absence of an article iii case or controversy,abrogated on other grounds by medimmune,d see also intellectual prop,tci cablevision of,affirming a dismissal of a counterclaim based on a lack of article iii case or controversy even though the district court had not indicated any reliance on rule a or a statement of,and the record failed to show whether the defendant consented to rule a relief.accordingly,we need not further address rule a because we conclude,as a matter of law,that nike delivery of the covenant to yums divested the district court of subject matter jurisdiction,and we affirm on that basis.
the covenant not to sue 
in order to qualify as a justiciable case or controversy under article iii,t he controversy must be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.aetna life ins.haworth.the case or controversy requirement is not satisfied by a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character.id.at.in trademark cases seeking relief under either the declaratory judgment act,a,or section of the lanham act,a valid covenant not to sue may strip district courts of jurisdiction.we review the jurisdictional effect of such a covenant under both acts in turn.
declaratory judgment act 
we turn first to the effect of such a covenant in trademark cases involving the declaratory judgment act,which provides in relevant part 
in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
a.the declaratory judgment act does not expand the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.see pdk labs,friedlander,cir.in aetna,the supreme court explained that the phrase case of actual controversy in the act refers to the type of cases and controversies that are justiciable under article iii.medimmune,at citing aetna,at.its pronouncement in aetna was refined four years later in maryland casualty pacific coal oil,in which the supreme court endorsed a totality of the circumstances test for determining whether a party seeking relief under the act has demonstrated that a justiciable controversy exists.the court in maryland casualty explained that b asically,the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.id.in adopting this test,the supreme court recognized that t he difference between an abstract question and a controversy contemplated by the declaratory judgment act is necessarily one of degree,and it would be difficult,if it would be possible,to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy.id.
we did not apply the maryland casualty test in a trademark case until starter converse,cir per curiam.in that case,we employed a test for determining whether subject matter jurisdiction exists 
i n a declaratory judgment action involving trademarks,the test for an actual case or controversy has two prongs,both of which must be satisfied in order to establish declaratory judgment jurisdiction has the defendant conduct created a real and reasonable apprehension of liability on the part of the plaintiff,and has the plaintiff engaged in a course of conduct which has brought it into adversarial conflict with the defendant.
after our decision in starter,the supreme court decided medimmune,which confirmed that maryland casualty totality of the circumstances test for declaratory judgment actions applied in intellectual property cases,see at,but which rejected starter reasonable apprehension requirement,id.at,quoting gen probe vysis.medimmune requires that we consider only whether the adversity of legal interests that exists between the parties is real and substantial and admi ts of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.id.at quoting aetna life,at the court also suggested that the threat of future litigation remains relevant in determining whether an actual controversy exists.as in medimmune,for example,simply holding litigation in abeyance,where a party could forestall litigation indefinitely by paying licensing fees,does not eliminate the case or controversy.id.at the declaratory judgment plaintiff own acts eliminate the imminent threat of harm and t he question before us is whether this causes the dispute no longer to be a case or controversy within the meaning of article iii.
until now,we have not applied medimmune in an intellectual property case.however,a few of our sister circuits have done so in the context of declaratory judgment actions involving patents,which we have described as sufficiently analogous to those involving trademarks that principles applicable to declaratory judgment actions involving patents are generally applicable with respect to trademarks.starter,at see also revolution eyewear,aspex eyewear,applying medimmune to declaratory judgment action involving patents 
in determining whether a covenant not to sue eliminates a justiciable case or controversy in a declaratory judgment action involving a trademark,district courts applying the medimmune totality of the circumstances test should especially consider,in addition to other factors the language of the covenant,whether the covenant covers future,as well as past,activity and products and evidence of intention or lack of intention,on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction,to engage in new activity or to develop new potentially infringing products that arguably are not covered by the covenant 
applying these factors here,we agree with the district court that it had no actual case or controversy before it.the language of the covenant is broad,covering both present and future products nike unconditionally and permanently renounced its right to claim,demand or commenc e,caus e or permit to be prosecuted any action in law or in equity with respect to any shoe currently made by yums,including the sugar and soulja boy shoes,and all colorable imitations thereof.nike,wl,at.the breadth of the covenant renders the threat of litigation remote or nonexistent even if yums continues to market and sell these shoes or significantly increases their production.given the similarity of yums designs to the mark and the breadth of the covenant,it is hard to imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe the mark and yet not fall under the covenant.yums has not asserted any intention to market any such shoe.nike,wl,at.
in revolution eyewear,at,the federal circuit concluded that a controversy persisted when the plaintiff delivered a covenant that promised not to sue only as to prior sales of the allegedly infringing product.the crucial difference between revolution eyewear and this case is the scope of the two covenants.in revolution eyewear,it was undisputed
