the united states brought suit under the false claims act fca,et,and federal common law,seeking recoupment of disability payments made to alfred sforza following a slip and fall.alfred and josephine sforza appeal from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york freeman,enforcing a settlement negotiated in open court.on appeal,the sforzas challenge subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that under b,benefit determinations under the federal employee compensation act feca are final and conclusive for all purposes,and not subject to review by another official of the united states or by a court by mandamus or otherwise,and contest the enforceability of the settlement.
background 
on january,alfred sforza submitted a claim for workers compensation benefits pursuant to the feca,et,asserting that while on duty earlier that day as a letter carrier for the united states postal service usps,he had slipped on ice and suffered a back injury.sforza claim was submitted to the office of workers compensation programs owcp,which makes feca eligibility determinations under the authority of the secretary of the department of labor dol.see.in october,owcp found sforza eligible for feca benefits,retroactive to march.
alfred sforza maintained his eligibility for feca benefits over the next fifteen years by regularly providing owcp with sworn affirmations that he remained disabled and by submitting to physical examinations by dol doctors.in his sworn affirmations submitted on form ca and at the medical examinations,sforza claimed that he could not sit,stand,walk,lie down,or drive for any significant period because of pain in his back and leg.sforza also certified that he understood the requirement that he immediately report to owcp any improvements in his physical condition.as early as,dol doctors became skeptical,but sforza continued to receive benefits,largely on the basis of his sworn representations.
the usps leaping into action put sforza under surveillance in november.over the next year,he was observed and videotaped while driving,shopping,mowing his lawn,and performing other yard work.in october,after he had been videotaped on many occasions doing things he had sworn he could not do,he appeared with his wife josephine sforza in dol manhattan office for a rehabilitation interview.at this interview,he made statements that were corroborated by his wife but belied by the videotapes.
in march,sforza was charged in a indictment with making false statements in connection with claims for feca benefits,in violation of a.he pleaded guilty in february to one count,admitting he made false statements at the october interview,and was sentenced to three years of probation four months of which were to be spent in home detention,and was ordered to pay to owcp in restitution for benefits that had continued to be paid even after the october interview.
in february,the united states commenced this civil suit against the sforzas,claiming that they had conspired to submit false claims as to each form ca submitted to owcp between and.the government sought treble damages under the fca in an amount to be determined at trial,as well as a civil penalty for each of the sforzas false claims.the government also alleged several causes of action under federal common law based upon the same alleged conduct.
the sforzas moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing principally that the district court jurisdiction was barred by feca provision,codified in b,which states 
the action of the secretary or his designee in allowing or denying a payment under this subchapter is 
final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact and 
not subject to review by another official of the united states or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.
id.by memorandum and order dated december,the district court schwartz,denied the motion on the ground that b only precludes review of the decision by owcp the secretary of labor designee to award or deny feca benefits,and owcp decision to award benefits was not being directly challenged by the government.see united states sforza,civ.ags,wl,at.discovery followed.
in august,just before trial,settlement discussions were conducted under the auspices of magistrate judge maas.the judge met separately with each party off the record,and then on the record obtained the parties agreement to settle the case for,subject to one contingency a from the chief of the civil division of the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york.the sforzas acknowledged on the record that the agreement announced by judge maas included the terms that each had agreed to.
however,after the required was given by the chief of the civil division,the sforzas refused to execute the written settlement agreement prepared by the government,and denied to the district court that there had been a meeting of the minds.according to the sforzas,they had intended that the release cover criminal liability as well as civil claims,thereby assuring that josephine sforza be protected from prosecution for her complicity.the government tendered a letter disclaiming any present intention to prosecution josephine sforza,but refused to provide the extraordinary release on which the sforzas insisted.
the district court freeman,nevertheless entered an order and final judgment on december,directing the sforzas to pay to the government in exchange for general releases,and dismissing the case with prejudice.united states sforza,civ.df,at.the court ruled that the oral statements on the record constituted a legally binding contract to exchange for a release from civil but not criminal liability.id.
discussion 
on appeal,the sforzas challenge the december,ruling denying their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the december,ruling that the oral agreement to settle the case constituted a legally binding contract.
jurisdiction 
we review the district court legal rulings as to its own jurisdiction de novo.see jaghory new york state dep t of,cir.in doing so,we apply the same standard as the district court,under which a court may dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction only if it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support jurisdiction.see hosp.trs.of rex,d conley gibson,d.
it is uncontested that the fca,by its terms,provides subject matter jurisdiction.under the fca,a violation occurs whenever a person 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government or 
conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid 
a.the complaint alleges that the sforzas conspired to submit false claims to owcp to obtain feca benefits,and thus adequately invokes jurisdiction under the fca.
defendants principal argument is that feca precludes the district court from exercising its fca jurisdiction.this argument cuts against law that strongly disfavors preclusion of one federal statute by another absent express manifestations of preclusive intent.see united states general dynamics,cir citing radzanower touche ross,d.courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.local,int l longshoremen ass n,afl cio new york shipping ass n,cir.quoting morton mancari,d,cert.denied,d.to overcome the presumption against preclusion,defendants must demonstrate a clear congressional intent to preclude,or a positive repugnancy between the two federal statutes.see traynor turnage,d united states batchelder,d.
in arguing that b of feca precludes this suit,defendants rely on lindahl office of personnel management,d,which concerned whether a provision in the civil
