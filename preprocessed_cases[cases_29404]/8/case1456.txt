plaintiff appellant greg kuebel appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york telesca,granting summary judgment for defendant appellee black decker b d.kuebel sues on behalf of himself and other similarly situated current and former b d employees,asserting three sets of claims under the fair labor standards act and the new york labor law.principally,kuebel asserts that b d owes him compensation for all of the time he spent commuting between home and the job site the commute time claims,and overtime hours that he allegedly worked but did not record the claims.he also alleges that b d fired him in retaliation for complaining about unpaid overtime the retaliation claims.as explained below,we conclude that the district court properly granted b d summary judgment on the commute time claims,but that kuebel has raised genuine issues of material fact on his claims.we leave it to the district court to decide in the first instance whether to allow kuebel to reassert his retaliation claims,which he abandoned below,in light of recent supreme court precedent.accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the parties 
b d is a manufacturer of power tools,and sells its products in stores like home depot kuebel was employed by b d as a retail specialist from september to june.retail specialists are assigned to particular home depot stores within a specified territory,and are responsible for b d product merchandising and marketing at those stores.kuebel was assigned to six home depot stores,ranging from twenty minutes to three hours from his home by car.as a retail specialist,he did not report to a central office,but rather used his home as a base.while he was employed by b d,kuebel also did merchandising work for three other companies.
kuebel job duties 
kuebel primary responsibility as a retail specialist was to ensure that b d products were properly stocked,priced,and displayed in his assigned home depot stores.his duties also included setting up b d displays,training home depot sales employees,and assisting those employees in selling b d products.b d expected a retail specialist to spend five to eight hours per day completing these activities.
retail specialists were required to use b personal digital assistants pdas to record entry and exit times at their assigned home depot stores.b d refers to the amount of time recorded by a pda as beacon hours.a retail specialist beacon hours were electronically communicated to his managers when he synchronized synched his pda with b d server.to synch his pda,kuebel plugged it into a cradle attached to his home computer.b d expected retail specialists to synch their pdas six times per week.electronic records show that kuebel typically synched his pda five or six times per week,usually in the evening that it almost always took him less than a minute to synch his pda and that it was not uncommon for him to synch his pda fairly late at night,around 
in addition to synching his pda,kuebel performed several other tasks at his home office.these activities included reading and responding to company emails,checking voicemail,printing and reviewing sales reports,organizing materials,fact tags for b d products,making display signs,taking online training courses,and loading and unloading his car.b d expected these administrative duties to take a retail specialist on average thirty minutes per day.kuebel,however,testified that it took him thirty minutes to an hour to complete these activities fifteen to thirty minutes in the morning,before driving to his first home depot store of the day,and fifteen to thirty minutes in the evening,after returning home from his last store.b d asserts that kuebel was not required to perform all of these activities at home,or at any particular time of day.however,b d does instruct retail specialists to record the time they spend working at home,and its policy is to pay them for that time.
b d commute time policy 
in,b d consulted with outside counsel regarding an appropriate compensation policy for time spent by field employees like retail specialists traveling to and from their job sites.in advising b d,outside counsel relied on a january,opinion letter issued by the wage and hour division of the department of labor dol,which stated,in response to an inquiry concerning the compensability of field employees travel time,that the dol would not take exception to a practice that treats one hour of commuting time as travel,and that treats all travel time in excess of that amount as hours worked,dolwh lexis,at.in light of that letter,b d implemented a policy of paying retail specialists for time spent driving to their first home depot store of the day and for time spent driving home from the last store of the day,to the extent that travel time represented travel in excess of sixty miles for either leg.some managers,including kuebel,instructed their retail specialists that commute time to and from home was compensable to the extent it was for travel in excess of sixty minutes in duration,rather than sixty miles in length.kuebel was compensated in accordance with that policy.for example,if he drove hours from home to his assigned store in the morning,and hours from that store back home at the end of the day,he was paid for three of those five hours of commuting time.
b d time reporting policies 
b d policies required retail specialists to accurately record their hours on timesheets that they submitted to their managers.in a january email sent to all employees,including retail specialists,b d reiterated that employees were obligated to e nsure that business records for example,timecards are honest,complete,and not misleading,and should watch out for going along with the creation of inaccurate or misleading records the email also provided a phone number that could be used to anonymously report violations of these policies.
it is undisputed that there was no official written b d policy that prohibited retail specialists from working,recording,and being paid for overtime.indeed,the one time that kuebel recorded overtime a half hour,he was paid for it.however,b d believed that retail specialists should be able to complete all of their and administrative duties,as well as any compensable commute time,in a workweek.b d therefore expect s retail specialists to manage themselves and budget their time for a hour workweek.appellee br.
kuebel time reporting practices 
kuebel alleges that it was not possible to complete all of his duties in forty hours per week and that,as a result,he frequently worked overtime.however,he did not record any overtime on his timesheets except for the one occasion noted above,and thus was not paid for his alleged overtime.kuebel testified at his deposition that when he worked more than forty hours in a week,he would shave his time entry for friday so that his recorded hours for the week added up to only forty.he estimated that when he was reporting to his first supervisor uzo idigo,from september to january,of his timesheets were false,and that when he was reporting to his second supervisor scott davolt,from january to june,were false.in a subsequent declaration submitted in opposition to b d summary judgment motion,kuebel averred that to the best of his memory,he worked more than forty hours just about every week,and averaged from one to five hours of uncompensated overtime every week.
kuebel asserts that he falsified his timesheets because his supervisors instructed him not to record more than forty hours per week.he testified that at monthly meetings,there was always a point that idigo and davolt and another manager would always indicate that we retail specialists were not to put more than forty hours on our time sheet,and that davolt told all of the reps that they were only to record forty hours a week,no matter what they worked during that particular week.kuebel further testified that during a personal discussion with davolt on february,davolt said to him,you ca work overtime,you only supposed to put forty hours on your timecard.
during that same discussion,kuebel allegedly told davolt that the forty hours appearing on his timesheets was not accurate because he was working more than forty hours per week,and davolt responded,you only supposed to mark forty on your timecard because we ca afford overtime.according to kuebel,he similarly complained to davolt about uncompensated overtime on three occasions in may.for example,he testified that on one occasion,he told davolt that he was working extra hours but still only putting forty hours on my time sheet per his instruction,and did feel that was fair,and davolt simply avoided the topic.b d disputes the notion that it was ever conveyed to kuebel that he should falsify his timesheets so as not to record overtime.
during his employment with b d,kuebel was counseled multiple times by his supervisors regarding perceived performance issues for example,low beacon hours and the unsatisfactory condition of his assigned stores.davolt also apparently suspected that kuebel would sometimes work for one of his other employers while on the clock for b d.in june,b d fired kuebel on the grounds of poor performance,dishonesty,and falsification of company records.
proceedings below 
following his discharge,kuebel sued b d asserting claims under the fair labor standards act flsa,et,and the new york labor law nyll in march,kuebel moved for conditional certification of an flsa collective action pursuant to b.b d thereafter stipulated to conditional certification on the commute time issue,but not the issue.the parties agreed on the form of the notice,which was sent to all retail specialists,and employees opted to join the action.
following discovery,b d moved for partial summary judgement and the district court granted b d summary judgment on the commute time claims.kuebel black decker,cv,dist.lexis may,kuebel i.the district court held that as a general matter,b d practice of compensating commute time only in excess of one hour complied with the flsa the administrative duties performed by kuebel at home did not render the entirety of his commute time compensable because they were not integral and indispensable to his principal job activities,and thus did not extend his workday to include his morning and evening commutes in any event,b d had established a defense to liability under a by virtue of its reliance on the january,dol opinion letter and because there was no evidence that any flsa violation had been willful,a statute of limitations applied,see a.kuebel i,dist.lexis,at.the court also denied kuebel request under federal rule of civil procedure f to defer consideration of b d motion and afford him further discovery on the issues of good faith and willfulness.id.at.
following that decision,b d moved to send notice to the plaintiffs that the collective action claims had been dismissed.kuebel opposed that motion and,in addition,moved to send supplemental notice to the putative plaintiffs who had not opted into the action in,advising them of the claims.while those motions were pending,b d moved for summary judgment on kuebel remaining claims.
in,the district court granted b d summary judgment,dismissing kuebel complaint in its entirety.kuebel black decker,cv,dist.lexis may,kuebel i.the district court held that kuebel had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on his claims had failed to present evidence that any violation was willful,which meant that a statute of limitations applied to the flsa claim,and liquidated damages were not available under the nyll and had abandoned his retaliation claims by not defending them in his brief.id.at,having determined that b d was entitled to summary judgment,the district court denied the parties pending notice motions as moot,and dismissed the case with prejudice.id.at.kuebel appealed,challenging both the and summary judgment decisions.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.tracy freshwater,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
commute time claims 
kuebel commute time claims rest on a continuous workday theory.he argues that he is entitled to compensation for all of his commute time because the administrative tasks he performed at home were integral and indispensable to his principal job activities,and that his workday therefore began and ended at home and encompassed his morning and evening drives between home and home depot store.we disagree.even if kuebel activities were integral and indispensable to his principal activities,they do not render the entirety of his commute time compensable under the flsa.
flsa framework principal job activities and the continuous workday rule 
the flsa guarantee s compensation for all work or employment engaged in by employees covered by the act.coal,iron r.muscoda local.however,the statute does not define what constitutes compensable work.ibp,alvarez.after early supreme court cases defined the term broadly,congress passed the portal to portal act of,et,which narrowed the flsa coverage by providing that compensable work does not include 
walking,riding,or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform,and 
activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities,
which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences,or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases,such principal activity or activities.
the supreme court has since established that any activity that is integral and indispensable to a principal activity is itself a principal activity under a,and thus compensable under the flsa even if performed before or after the regular shift.ibp,at see steiner mitchell.whether an activity is integral and indispensable to an employee principal activities is a inquiry.see reich transit,f d,cir.
pursuant to the dol continuous workday rule,the workday is generally defined as the period between the commencement and completion on the same workday of an employee principal activity or activities.ibp,at quoting b.the rule provides that p eriods of time between the commencement of the employee first principal activity and the completion of his last principal activity on any workday must be included in the computation of hours worked to the same extent as would be required if the portal act had not been enacted.singh city of new york,cir sotomayor,quoting a see a t o the extent that activities engaged in by an employee occur after the employee commences to perform the first principal activity on a particular workday and before he ceases the performance of the last principal activity on a particular workday,the provisions of a have no application.in ibp,the supreme court held that the time spent by slaughterhouse employees before and after their shifts walking between their locker rooms where they engaged in the principal activities of donning and doffing their protective gear and the slaughterhouse floor was part of the continuous workday and therefore compensable under the flsa.at d uring a continuous workday,any walking time that occurs after the beginning of the employee first principal activity and before the end of the employee last principal activity is covered by the flsa.
kuebel at home activities did not extend his workday under the continuous workday rule 
we need not and do not decide whether the district court correctly determined as a matter of law that the administrative tasks kuebel performed at home were not integral and indispensable to his principal job activities.for,even if those tasks do qualify as integral and indispensable and,thus,principal,they do not affect the compensability of kuebel driving time.
the parties arguments about the portal to portal act,and the regulations and cases interpreting it,are largely beside the point.section a does not impose any liability on employers it only exempts them from liability for certain activities that the supreme court had briefly imposed before the portal to portal act overruled it.see ibp,at.other than this exemption,the portal to portal act does not purport to change earlier definitions of compensable work.id.at.
the general rule,however,is and always has been that the flsa does not treat ordinary travel as compensable.the regulations have reflected this fact for at least fifty years,instructing that n ormal travel from home to work is not worktime.the fact that kuebel performs some administrative tasks at home,on his own schedule,does not make his commute time compensable any more than it makes his sleep time or his dinner time compensable.
a helpful analogy is provided by.although that regulation directly applies in the slightly different context of whether time spent waiting is compensable,see,several courts have relied in cases like this one on its instruction that p eriods during which an employee is completely relieved from duty and which are long enough to enable him to use the time effectively for his own purposes are not hours worked.a.for example,in rutti lojack,cir,the ninth circuit held that a technician evening commute was not rendered compensable merely because he performed the arguably principal activity of uploading data to his employer after returning home,because he was free to make the transmission at any time between and similarly,in ahle veracity research,d,the court held that even if the plaintiff private investigators pre and activities,performing background checks and submitting reports qualified as principal,that did not extend their workday to include the time spent driving to and from a surveillance site,since plaintiffs were not required to perform the activities immediately prior to leaving for an investigation or immediately after returning home.
similar reasoning applies here,as it can not seriously be disputed that kuebel had flexibility in deciding when to complete his daily administrative responsibilities of checking email,checking voicemail,synching his pda,printing sales reports,making signs,and so forth the record indicates only that it might have been necessary to perform certain activities in the morning,or in the evening.it does not indicate that kuebel was required to perform them immediately before leaving home,or immediately after returning home.indeed,there is nothing in the record to suggest that a retail specialist could not,for example,wake up early,check his email,synch his pda,print a sales report,and then go to the gym,or take his kids to school,before driving to his first home depot store of the day nor was kuebel prevented from leaving his last store of the day and going straight to a restaurant for dinner,or waiting until late at night to synch his pda as electronic records show he sometimes did.that kuebel may have frequently chosen to perform his activities immediately before and after his commutes does not mean that b d must pay him for the first hour of those drives time that was not part of his continuous workday and that was,in the end,ordinary home to work travel outside the coverage of the flsa.see department of labor,wage and hour division,opinion letter,dolwh lexis,at,advising that time spent at home by a field employee completing service or time allocation reports,checking voice mail,and checking would not make the home a job site for purposes of counting travel as compensable work time 
because kuebel commute time claims fail on the merits,we need not reach whether b d is entitled to a statutory defense,see a,or whether any violation was willful,see a.nor do we find any abuse of discretion in the district court denial of kuebel rule f request for additional discovery.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment for b d on the commute time claims.
ii.off the clock claims 
we turn now to kuebel assertion that b d owes him wages for overtime that he allegedly worked,but admittedly did not report,and conclude that the district court erred in granting b d summary judgment on these claims.
legal standard 
to establish liability under the flsa on a claim for unpaid overtime,a plaintiff must prove that he performed work for which he was not properly compensated,and that the employer had actual or constructive knowledge of that work.anderson clemens pottery,chao gotham registry,cir grochowski phoenix constr,cir.the parties dispute,however,the extent to which kuebel must show the amount of his uncompensated work in essence,his damages in order to survive summary judgment.it is not a question that this court has explicitly addressed.as explained below,the applicable standard requires that kuebel must produce sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.anderson,at.
in anderson,a special master had denied recovery because the amount of the plaintiff uncompensated work could not be ascertained with sufficient definiteness.at.the court of appeals endorsed that determination and ordered that the action be dismissed,holding that the burden rested upon the employees to show by evidence rather than conjecture the extent of overtime worked,it being insufficient for them merely to offer an estimated average of overtime worked.id.at.the supreme court reversed,concluding that the special master and court of appeals had imposed upon the employees an improper standard of proof.id.the court observed that w hen the employer has kept proper and accurate records,the employee may easily discharge his burden by securing the production of those records.id.at.however,where the employer records are inaccurate or inadequate and the employee can not offer convincing substitutes,the court concluded that t he solution is not to penalize the employee by denying him any recovery on the ground that he is unable to prove the precise extent of uncompensated work,as such a result would be contrary to the remedial nature of the flsa.id.instead,the anderson court articulated the following standard 
in such a situation an employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.the burden then shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee evidence.if the employer fails to produce such evidence,the court may then award damages to the employee,even though the result be only approximate.
thus,at summary judgment,if an employer records are inaccurate or inadequate,an employee need only present sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of the uncompensated work as a matter of just and reasonable inference,id.at.see,von friewalde boeing aerospace operations,app x,cir brown family dollar stores of,lp,cir allen bd.of pub.educ.for bibb,cir magnoni smith laquercia,llp,d.consistent with anderson,an employee burden in this regard is not high.see at remedial purpose of flsa militates against making employee burden an impossible hurdle.it is well settled among the district courts of this circuit,and we agree,that it is possible for a plaintiff to meet this burden through estimates based on his own recollection.see,canela rodriguez milbank real estate,civ.jsr,dist.lexis,at,rivera ndola pharmacy,d,magnoni,d at.
here,however,the district court determined that kuebel was not entitled to anderson lenient burden of proof.relying on seever carrols,d,it held that because kuebel was responsible for filling out his own timesheets and had admittedly falsified them,such that any inaccuracies were,a heightened standard applied under which kuebel must prove the amount of time he worked with specificity.kuebel ii,dist.lexis,at.because kuebel could not prove his damages with precision,the district court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate.
we disagree with this approach.first,it is important to recognize that an employer duty under the flsa to maintain accurate records of its emp
