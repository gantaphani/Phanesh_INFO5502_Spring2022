this case presents the issue of the circumstances under which leave will be granted to permit an interlocutory appeal from a district court decision on class certification pursuant to the recently enacted rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure rule f.
plaintiffs commenced a class action suit in against,inter alia,sumitomo corporation sumitomo,morgan stanley morgan stanley,merrill lynch merrill lynch,and global minerals and metals corporation global,alleging that the defendants conspired to manipulate the prices of copper futures contracts traded on the comex division of the new york mercantile exchange from june,through june,in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,and the commodity exchange act cea,a.the united states district court for the southern district of new york milton pollack,senior judge certified a plaintiffs class consisting of more than copper futures contract traders who had executed trades over a discontinuous period.
credit lyonnais rouse,and credit lyonnais,collectively the cl defendants move pursuant to rule f and federal rule of appellate procedure,for leave to appeal from that order,and pursuant to rule f and federal rule of appellate procedure,for a stay of trial proceedings pending the resolution of such an appeal.the cl defendants were supported by a brief filed by amicus curiae futures industry,an industry association of which the cl defendants are members.we denied leave to appeal by an order entered on september,and now take this opportunity to explain that ruling and the standard that we applied and will apply in the future to petitions seeking leave to appeal a district court grant or denial of class certification under rule f.
background 
after plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification under rule b,sumitomo,morgan stanley,and merrill lynch entered into settlement agreements with the class plaintiffs.
global refused to settle and opposed class certification.specifically,global contended that the class plaintiffs could not establish the predominance of common issues required by rule b because they could not prove that the prices in all of the copper futures contracts at issue were artificial or that each class plaintiff incurred the same damages the class plaintiffs had irreconcilable conflicts of interest because the class consists of both buyers and sellers and typicality was absent because the contracts at issue were purchased at different times during the class period.see in re sumitomo copper litigation,sumitomo i.
in its order certifying the class under rule b,the district court rejected global contentions.the district court determined that common issues predominated because the class plaintiffs were not required to prove their claims until trial,at which time,experts on both sides agreed,the class plaintiffs had a reasonable probability of proving their claims the question of individual damages was irrelevant to the liability phase of trial and could readily be resolved at the damages phase of trial by splitting the class into various as permitted by rule c b and both buyers and sellers had a common interest in proving the existence of the conspiracy and price artificiality,and any conflicting interests with respect to damages could be resolved through in the damages phase of trial.see id.the district court also found that typicality was satisfied because every class member purchased or sold the same fungible copper futures contract in the same centralized comex market and was affected by the same alleged conspiracy to manipulate copper prices.id.at.
global thereafter entered into a settlement agreement with the class plaintiffs.the district court approved all the settlement agreements.see in re sumitomo copper litigation.
after the class was certified,but before these settlements were approved,the class plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the cl defendants.in addition to the claims previously asserted,the amended complaint added a fraud claim and extended the class period to include copper futures contract purchases from june,to june.the cl defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds that a it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under rico,and b claims arising before april,were barred by the statute of limitations.in denying the motion,the district court held,inter alia,that plaintiffs were not foreclosed from proving at trial that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled due to defendants alleged fraudulent concealment.see in re sumitomo copper litigation,d,sumitomo ii.
on august,over the cl defendants opposition,the district court granted plaintiffs certification motion and certified the proposed class for the periods of june,to september,and june,to june.see in re sumitomo copper litigation,sumitomo iii.the district court expressly noted that it would modify the class period if it proved too unwieldy.id.a certification order was entered august.the cl defendants timely filed a petition for leave to appeal on august,
discussion 
federal rule of civil procedure f 
federal rule of civil procedure f,which became effective december,provides 
appeals.a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.an appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.
f.according to the committee notes,courts of appeals have unfettered discretion to authorize an appeal under rule f 
permission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.permission is most likely to be granted when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law,or when,as a practical matter,the decision on certification is likely dispositive of the litigation.
f committee notes.although we have recently authorized appeals under rule f,see,daniels city of new york,cir.may,potchin prudential home,cir.july,we have yet to explicate the standard under which rule f petitions should be reviewed.
the seventh circuit,the first to consider the question,identified two categories of cases appropriate for review under rule f.see blair equifax check,cir.the first category comprises the death knell cases and their cases in which the class certification order effectively terminates the litigation either because the denial of certification makes the pursuit of individual claims prohibitively expensive or because the grant of certification forces the defendants to settle.see id.noting that the reviewing court must be wary lest the mind hear a bell that is not tolling,the seventh circuit concluded that under circumstances in which the certification order would effectively terminate the litigation the party seeking leave to appeal had to further demonstrate,at a minimum,that the district court ruling on class certification is questionable taking into account the discretion the district judge possesses in implementing rule,and the correspondingly deferential standard of appellate review.id.at.
the second category of cases are those in which the class certification order implicates an unresolved legal issue concerning class actions.see id.at.observing that the more fundamental the legal question and the greater the likelihood that it will escape effective disposition at the end of the case,the more appropriate is an appeal under rule f,the seventh circuit concluded that the party seeking leave in such a case had to demonstrate,at minimum,that an immediate appeal would contribute to the development of the law of class actions.see also richardson electronics,panache broadcasting of,cir noting that immediate appeal is warranted where it would advance the development of the law governing class actions.
the certification order at issue in blair implicated an unresolved legal issue,namely whether the district court erred in certifying the class when,in a separate overlapping class action suit,the defendant had agreed to settle on the condition
