plaintiff appellant l designs l appeals from a judgment on the pleadings of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge,entered on january,dismissing five counts asserted in l complaint the complaint or compl,each arising out of a creative services agreement the agreement entered into between l and defendant appellee old navy old navy in september of.we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing count iii against old navy for failure to negotiate in good faith an alleged agreement to develop and launch a todd oldham branded line of merchandise the branded line to be sold exclusively in old navy stores.the district court also erred in dismissing count i for declaratory judgment that old navy wrongfully terminated the parties agreement under which l principal,todd oldham,was to provide design services to old navy.accordingly,we affirm in part and vacate in part the district court judgment,and we remand for further proceedings in so doing we reverse in part the order of the district court that dismissed the complaint and reinstate the complaint to the extent provided in this opinion.
materials properly considered on a motion for judgment on the pleadings 
one of the critical issues in this appeal is whether the district court properly considered not only the complaint,old navy answer,and the written documents attached to the complaint in deciding old navy rule c motion,but also five email exhibits to old navy counterclaims exhibits that were attached to old navy answer only by virtue of the fact that its answer and counterclaims were filed in the same document.l argues the district court improperly considered the exhibits without converting old navy c motion to one for summary judgment,as required by rule d.
on a c motion,the court considers the complaint,the answer,any written documents attached to them,and any matter of which the court can take judicial notice for the factual background of the case.roberts babkiewicz,cir.a complaint is also deemed to include any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit,materials incorporated in it by reference,and documents that,although not incorporated by reference,are integral to the complaint.sira morton,cir citations omitted quoting chambers time warner,cir.there is no question that the email exhibits were attached to old navy answer,even if they were only part of old navy counterclaims.see.c a copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes emphasis added.moreover,these emails of which l had notice well before old navy attached them to its answer because l sent or received them were integral to the negotiation exchange that l identified as the basis for its complaint.see sira,at document not expressly cited in complaint was incorporated into the pleading because it was integral to plaintiff ability to pursue his cause of action chambers,at document integral to complaint where complaint relie d heavily upon its terms and effect quotation marks omitted cortec,sum holding,cir necessity of translating motion into one under rule largely dissipated where plaintiff had actual notice of information in documents and relied upon them in framing the complaint.plaintiffs failure to include matters of which as pleaders they had notice and which were integral to their claim and that they apparently most wanted to avoid may not serve as a means of forestalling the district court decision on a b motion.cortec,at.for these reasons,in reviewing de novo old navy motion for judgment on the pleadings,we draw all facts which we assume to be true unless contradicted by more specific allegations or documentary evidence from the complaint and from the exhibits attached thereto and we also consider the emails attached to old navy counterclaims.see blue tree hotels inv.canada,starwood hotels resorts worldwide,cir discrediting allegation belied by letters attached to the complaint hirsch arthur andersen,cir general,conclusory allegations need not be credited when they are belied by more specific allegations of the complaint.the facts thus derived,viewed in the light most favorable to l,are as follows.
ii.the parties 
l principal,todd oldham,is a world famous artist,fashion and graphic designer,photographer,writer,and television personality.he formed l in to manage his design services and intellectual property rights,including eight federal registrations for the mark todd oldham.a luminary in the fashion and design industry for over twenty years,oldham is considered one of the most important designers of fashion and home furnishings working today and the singular talent behind the internationally famous todd oldham brand.compl.for more than a decade,oldham and l have collaborated on a variety of todd oldham branded merchandise 
old navy,a subsidiary of gap,operates a chain of retail apparel stores,with more than a thousand stores throughout the united states and canada.for at least the last five years,old navy has been suffering declining sales.one of its strategies for increasing sales has been to increase its appeal to younger consumers.
iii.the agreement 
in the spring of,l approached old navy to discuss the possibility of entering into a relationship with l,and old navy,enthusiastic about this possibility,ultimately requested that oldham become the company new design creative director.id.in order to induce oldham to join old navy design team,old navy proposed to introduce a todd oldham branded line of clothing,and to pay royalties to l in the form of five percent of the branded line sales.faced with continuing declining sales,old navy pushed oldham to enter into an agreement quickly so that it could publicly announce both oldham appointment as old navy design creative director and also the launching of the branded line.
on september,the parties entered into the agreement under which l was to perform certain services and provide certain deliverables,as set forth in a scope of work the sow attached to the agreement.agreement.under the sow,oldham would provide design services for old navy for three years in exchange for an annual fee of million in addition,oldham would receive a guaranteed bonus of million in year one and,in years two and three,percent of the year incremental sales not to exceed million.sow.section provided that during the term of the agreement,either party may terminate this agreement,effective immediately upon notice thereof,in the event of a material breach of this agreement that remains uncured after thirty days written notice of the breach to the other party.
iv.the licensing agreement 
section of the sow,entitled todd oldham branded line,provided as follows 
a.in september,the parties will announce publicly that todd oldham l shall be serving as design creative director of old navy and that it is the intent of the parties to develop and launch a line of products that will bear todd oldham marks to be sold exclusively at old navy stores at a future time.
l and old navy acknowledge and agree that the specific terms and conditions related to this proposed line of products bearing todd oldham marks are to be negotiated and agreed upon by the parties in a separate agreement.the parties plan to enter into a separate agreement related to these products by october.
c.the parties agree that this separate agreement will contain at least the following royalty fees paid to l of of old navy retail sales for this particular line only not all old navy products and agreement and final approval by both old navy and l as to the collections and products to be sold by old navy.
on september,old navy announced via a press release that it intended to launch the branded line.on october,monika fahlbusch the old navy executive assigned to the branded line emailed vital vayness l representative to recommend we plan to begin discussion on the license agreement for the branded line in our new fiscal year say in april we have until october so there is no rush ex.thereafter,l and oldham performed their obligations under the agreement,and old navy executives publicly and privately praised oldham performance as design creative director.
april october negotiations 
on april,l vayness initiated negotiations to finalize the licensing agreement for the branded line by emailing fahlbusch old navy l standard form license agreement and a term sheet that outlined a initial term and annual guaranteed minimum royalties the april proposal.compl.the email suggested that old navy formulate its initial thoughts,needs and objectives and then present to oldham in m ay while fahlbusch old navy,vayness l,and old navy attorney begin work on the language of the contract.ex.
commencing in may,old navy made material representations that were false,as l subsequently learned.compl.accord ex.for example in may of,fahlbusch old navy assured vayness l that she was already working with our legal team on the licensing agreement template.ex.but throughout the late spring and summer of,l repeatedly followed up with fahlbusch and old navy executive vice president,douglas howe,seeking feedback on the april proposal and on a redirection old navy was taking in its approach,with little or no followup.exs.during one meeting in june of at which oldham l,howe old navy,and tom wyatt another old navy executive were present,old navy proposed postponing discussions of the branded line.nevertheless,on june,vayness l indicated to fahlbusch old navy that things are proceeding in the right direction with the branded line.ex.
in a late july email,fahlbusch old navy suggested that the reason for old navy delay in getting back to l was that next steps on the branded line license would be impacted by who is named president.id.vayness l responded the same day,reminding fahlbusch old navy that we have a provision in the contract calling for the license agreement to be entered into by october.id.
on september,vayness l emailed fahlbusch old navy seeking old navy feedback on the terms set forth in l april email,indicating that l was ready to discuss points as early as possible.ex.l followed up with emails and telephone calls to fahlbusch old navy on september,and.on september,fahlbusch old navy recommended that oldham start working directly with howe as it seems we all have a different understanding of the numerous conversations in recent months related to the branded line.id.
on september,wyatt old navy advised l in a telephone call for the first time that old navy wished to postpone the signing of a license for the branded line indefinitely.compl.quoting wyatt in response,l stated that it expected old navy to provide it with definitive dates to restart negotiations,enter into the licensing agreement,and launch the branded line,and compensation for the postponement of the initial october,signing date.old navy failed to provide a response within a week as promised.
vi.fall notice of breach and demand for damages 
on october,l advised old navy counsel that old navy was in material breach of the agreement for failing to negotiate in good faith.see ex.counsel for old navy responded a week later,stating old navy view that the agreement does not obligate old navy to enter into a separate license agreement for todd oldham branded products and that although old navy did not foreclose the possibility of engaging in discussions about todd oldham branded products in the future if business conditions permit,old navy is not currently in a position to make a commitment to any such future discussions.ex.the next day,wyatt,then president of old navy,told oldham that old navy was very,very sorry but because of economic conditions,old navy could not follow through with the promised license for a todd oldham branded line of apparel to be carried exclusively in old navy stores.compl.
after waiting thirty days from old navy receipt of l october notice of breach,outside counsel for l sent a letter to old navy requesting that old navy remedy the damage to l caused by old navy breach by compensating l for lost royalties and reputational damages estimated at million and paying oldham his expected fees for the second and third years of the agreement million.
vii.old navy december response 
on december,counsel for old navy responded,denying that old navy was obligated to enter into a license agreement or had failed to negotiate in good faith.counsel for old navy explained that,in the course of their negotiations,
differences emerged in the parties positions,including on such essential issues as the types of products to be included in the line,how many stores would be included in a launch,the staffing necessary to support such a line,and,most importantly,the timing of any such launch.
ex.according to old navy counsel,business circumstances made an extensive launch in the immediate near term unfeasible.id.thereafter,from december,to february,old navy engaged in sham negotiations,falsely representing that it fully intended to enter into a license agreement.compl.
viii.the old navy january proposal 
the parties met once in december and several times in january to work out the details of the license agreement,a further draft of which l supplied to old navy on december.compl.on january,one hour before a scheduled conference call,old navy proposed a launch at old navy stores as you know,our history of presenting third product in our stores is relatively short a commitment beginning in the spring of no additional personnel resources and a projected royalty of million our previous discussions have never contemplated any royalty minimum guarantees,and,as a general rule,our company has not and will not agree to minimum guarantees.this has been consistent in all of our recent agreements.the january proposal.ex.
ix.january 
oldham responded immediately by email to old navy january proposal 
your projections seem extremely uncommitted to me.this feels like an effort to absolve old navy contractual responsibilities and not a commitment to build a new brand that was made to me when i joined and what you reiterated to me last month.stores will not work.the million in launch dollars will not be effective.the one year commitment is too brief as there are so many hiccups in launching a brand i hope that we can get this resolved but we are very far away from a reasonable plan.the volume of work necessary to bring a project of this scale to bloom is at great odds with your financial projections.
counterclaims ex.a.in the discussions that followed,l asked for a minimum guarantee of million for a term and then reduced the request to million for a term.on january,l inquired of old navy whether it had made any changes to any of its positions as stated in the january proposal.id.ex.old navy responded the next day 
to date,we have not been presented with any comprehensive counteroffer and instead there has been a sic insistence on large guaranteed minimum payments that we have explained are unacceptable and inconsistent with our business plans and practices 
id.ex.additional emails were exchanged,and on january,the parties held a conference call,during which they agreed to talk again after speaking with their respective principals.ex.the same day,l emailed old navy a revised proposal reflecting oldham input on the points discussed during the call.id.
february communications 
four days later,on february,old navy responded to l january email,advising l that despite our best efforts to negotiate an agreement that would be reasonable and mutually acceptable,we have not reached and will not be able to reach common ground on key business terms,reiterating that minimum guaranteed payments were inconsistent with our business plans and practices.id.vayness l responded the same day,explaining his surprise at old navy email given that the january,call was completely amicable,polite,professional,and friendly and that none of the points discussed during that call was left off as a deal breaker.id.the email went on to list items as to which l contended there was agreement number of stores,products,timeline and term,marketing,royalty rate,and territory items that it was now prepared to accept,including no minimum guaranteed royalties two points that needed clarification personnel and development budget and one issue to be agreed to,namely ownership of designs.id.on february,old navy advised l that material open issues remained,and that,in light of the nature of the negotiations,old navy did not believe that a collaborative partnership could be established.compl.
xi.old navy termination of the agreement 
on february,l commenced this lawsuit against old navy,filing under seal a complaint alleging breach of contract,breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.two days later,on february,counsel for old navy sent l a letter terminating the agreement termination letter on the grounds that l had 
materially breached the agreement by filing a lawsuit against old navy,by failing to provide meaningful input on design processes and procedures,by failing to participate meaningfully in meetings with the old navy creative team and by otherwise failing to perform its obligations under the agreement.
ex.old navy did not provide l with an opportunity to cure its alleged breaches.prior to the february termination letter,old navy had voiced no complaints about oldham performance under the agreement instead,he was continuously praised.
procedural history 
l filed its first complaint in the district court on february,under seal.on april,l filed under seal the amended complaint at issue in this appeal,adding claims for i wrongful termination and ii trade disparagement to its claims for iii breach of contract,iv breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and v fraud.old navy filed its answer and counterclaims on may,and l filed a reply on may.old navy motion for judgment on the pleadings was fully submitted on august.on september,the district court stayed depositions and ruled that a new discovery will be set after the pending rule c motion is decided.special appendix to l appellate brief l app.brief at.in an opinion dated january,it granted old navy motion,dismissing l complaint with prejudice.it issued a slightly amended opinion on january.l moved to amend the judgment and replead two weeks later.the district court denied l motion in an opinion dated february.
motion for judgment on the pleadings 
count iii breach of contract for failure to negotiate in good faith 
the district court first dismissed l claim for breach of contract for old navy failure to enter into the licensing agreement it nonetheless concluded that section of the sow undoubtedly did create an obligation on the part of the parties to negotiate a license agreement in good faith,l designs,old navy,llc,civ,wl,at.however,it found that the record of the detailed documentation of the negotiations between old navy and l over the anticipated license agreement,combined with the detailed allegations of the complaint,show,unequivocally,that l claim that old navy failed to negotiate in good faith is not plausible.id.first,based on the fact that the parties exchanged numerous telephone calls and emails and,as l acknowledged,progress in the negotiations was made,it concluded that old navy negotiated for some ten months.id.although the parties seemed to reach an impasse and negotiations broke down in the fall of,the parties resumed talks and met several times in december and january before l rejected old navy january proposal.id.
second,the district court concluded that because l was making extraordinarily high demands,it was not surprising that old navy resisted these demands,noting that at the five percent royalty rate some million in sales of todd oldham branded products would had to have been generated in one year to generate even the reduced royalty request proposed by l million over two years.id.
third,l only,specific allegation was its assertion that old navy decided to renege on its own january,proposal,and that this decision is itself damning evidence of old navy bad faith.id.at quoting l memorandum of law in opposition to old navy motion for judgment on the pleadings l c opp.at.but,the district court concluded,the emails attached to old navy counterclaims rendered this assertion not plausible because they showed that l purported acceptance of the january proposal on february,clearly was not an acceptance of the proposal in its entirety.id.quoting compl.
fourth,because insisting on terms to the point of impasse is not sufficient to show bad faith,l could not argue that old navy refusal to agree to a minimum guarantee was evidence of bad faith.id.citing venture assocs.zenith data,cir 
count i wrongful termination 
the district court also dismissed count i a request for declaratory judgment that old navy failed to provide i written notice of its claims of breach or ii days opportunity to cure any claimed breach that the termination letter did not effect a termination of the agreement and that old navy wrongfully terminated the agreement in retaliation for l lawsuit against it.the district court offered three reasons why the claim fails as a matter of law,wl,at.first,old navy did provide written notice of termination.id.at citing the termination letter.second,while acknowledging old navy admission that it failed to provide a day cure period,the district court found that it was relieved of this obligation because,for two reasons,notice of cure would have been futile.initially,the district court reasoned,i t is difficult to imagine that oldham could perform his duties after he sued old navy.id.citing allbrand discount liquors,times square stores,dep t,for the proposition that when one party will not live up to the contract,the aggrieved party is relieved from the performance of futile acts.in particular,
oldham could not very well continue to help old navy creatively,including with respect to public relations matters,while pursuing a lawsuit against old navy.agreement.among other things,oldham was supposed to,under the agreement,m otivate,inspire,coach,and share vision,insight and passion with old navy creative team,and he was supposed to p rovide input to old navy president and leadership team.id.
id.notice of breach would also have been futile,the district court reasoned,because e ven a withdrawal of the complaint and it is highly unlikely that l would have withdrawn the complaint if old navy had sent l a notice to cure would not have undone the harm caused by the public filing of a lawsuit against old navy.id.third,count i failed because even assuming the failure to give a cure period was a breach,in the context here it surely was not a material one.id.
after then dismissing counts ii and v of the complaint for trade disparagement and fraud,the district court granted old navy motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed l claims with prejudice.judgment was entered in favor of old navy on january.
ii.motion to amend and replead 
l filed a motion to amend the judgment and replead on february,based on information contained in documents produced by old navy following the close of briefing on the rule c motion.l motion to amend and replead at.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that l had already had two bites at the apple,as it has already filed two complaints the request is untimely,as l has had the documents for months yet never indicated a desire to amend its amended complaint prior to the granting of the motion for judgment on the pleadings and,because the additional documents l now seeks to rely on would not change the district court conclusions,the proposed amendment therefore would be futile.l designs,old navy,llc,civ,wl,at.l filed a timely notice of appeal on february.

motion for judgment on the pleadingsa.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c.see hayden paterson,cir.in deciding a rule c motion,we employ the same standard applicable to dismissals pursuant to rule b.thus,we will accept all factual allegations in the c omplaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff favor.johnson rowley,cir quotation marks and citation omitted 
in ashcroft iqbal,the supreme court set forth a approach to evaluate the sufficiency of a complaint.at.first,although a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint,that tenet is inapplicable to legal conclusions,and threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.harris mills,cir quotation marks and alterations omitted.second,only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss,and determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will be a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.id.quotation marks and alteration omitted.the plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement,but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.iqbal.at quotation marks omitted.plausibility thus depends on a host of considerations the full factual picture presented by the complaint,the particular cause of action and its elements,and the existence of alternative explanations so obvious that they render plaintiff inferences unreasonable.see id.at.
counts ii,iv,and v 
we affirm the district court dismissal of the trade disparagement and common law fraud claims substantially for the reasons articulated by the district court.we also affirm dismissal of the claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,but for a different reason.see infra note.

application 
l stated a plausible claim that old navy breached its obligation to negotiate the license agreement in good faith.the three bases alleged for this claim were that old navy failed to participate in negotiations from april to december,and never provided a single substantive comment with respect to the draft license at any time in,l c opp.at made repeated material representations that it would negotiate the terms of the license agreement in good faith,which l subsequently learned were false,compl.and proposed terms it knew to be in bad faith and economically unfair to l,believing they would be rejected,and then reneged when l did accept,l c opp.at.these are legally cognizable theories for breach of the duty to negotiate in good faith.moreover,drawing all reasonable inferences in l favor,the allegations in l complaint,combined with the exhibits attached thereto,render each one plausible 
first,l plausibly alleged that old navy who in june of proposed postponing negotiations was engaged in dilatory tactics from april until december,during which time it failed to provide any substantive comments on l draft license agreement.the emails exchanged between vayness l and fahlbusch old navy from april until september,when fahlbusch finally recommend ed that vayness and oldham work directly with howe in terms of the branded line,ex.support the plausible inference that fahlbusch was repeatedly putting l off for undisclosed or pretextual reasons discussed further below.the mere exchange of telephone calls and emails most of which were initiated by l according to l exhibits and some of which old navy did not respond to according to l uncontradicted allegations does not make the inference that old navy negotiated for some ten months,wl,at,so obvious that l opposing inference of dilatory tactics is rendered implausible 
similarly,whether or not l agreed to old navy alleged request to postpone discussions in june of a question of fact left open by the that would not defeat l allegations that old navy was engaged in dilatory tactics.a ssuming the pleaded facts to be true and read ing those facts in l favor,sepúlveda villarini dep t of educ.of puerto rico,cir souter,it suggests the converse that l,eager to execute the licensing agreement on terms as favorable to it as possible,and trusting that its negotiating partner in good faith believed a postponement of discussions would be mutually advantageous,was negotiating in good faith.it is reasonable to infer that,once l became suspicious of what it believed to be dilatory tactics on old navy part,it took a firmer stance,clarifying that while old navy may have thought that oldham agreed to postpone the finalizing of an agreement,the idea of postponing immediate discussions was merely discussed,and that the parties should work to ensure that the agreement did not become breached,ex.
second,l plausibly alleged that,commencing in may,old navy made repeated material representations that l subsequently learned were false,such as fahlbusch old navy assurances to oldham that she was already working with old navy legal team on the licensing agreement template,or her multiple promises to get back to l,which either never happened or only occurred after substantial delay l complaint also suggests that,instead of revealing its true purpose,which was to avoid entering into the license agreement as required under the agreement,compl.emphasis added,old navy advanced pretextual reasons for its decision to delay negotiations economic conditions and,ultimately,to cut off negotiations l insistence on minimum guaranteed royalties.see teachers ins.annunity of am.butler,upholding a finding of bad faith,after a trial,where evidence suggested that defendant deliberately intended not to close on an agreement that was no longer economically favorable to it due to a decline in interest rates,seiz ing on other terms of the agreement as a pretext for not going forward with it at the eleventh hour.that old navy true purpose was to avoid negotiating at all can be inferred from the fact that old navy informed l that it wished to postpone the signing of a license indefinitely,that it could not make a commitment to any discussions,and,ultimately,that it could not follow through with the promised license,compl.
moreover,l complaint and the exhibits attached thereto support the inference that old navy purported reasons for withdrawing from negotiations,that minimum guaranteed royalties were inconsistent with old navy business plans and practices,ex.were pretextual.as of december,minimum guaranteed royalties were not one of the four essential issues on which differences had emerged in the parties positions according to old navy,ex.describing the timing of the launch as the most important issue and assuming the truth of l uncontradicted documentary evidence,none of the points that had yet to be resolved after the january conference call including minimum guaranteed royalties was left off as a deal breaker to l,ex.
third,l plausibly alleged that old navy january proposal was designed to be economically unfair to l so that l would reject it,pointing to old navy reneging on its offer when l ultimately signaled after several counteroffers that it would accept the bulk of the january proposal.see l c opp.at.while the district court concluded as a matter of law that l did not accept old navy january proposal,we are inclined to see a fact question as to whether l plausibly alleged that old navy january proposal was designed to elicit l rejection.see venture,at business owner would be acting in bad faith if its purpose in demanding more than prospective buyer would pay was to induce prospective buyer to back out of the deal.whether or not l rejected key terms of old navy january proposal or made a series of before attempting to resurrect it,wl,at the fact remains that,when l finally acquiesced to old navy insistence on no minimum guaranteed royalties and appeared willing to accept an offer substantially on old navy terms,old navy balked.in light of the documentary evidence that old navy first proposal for the branded line did not come until january of,after the intervention of outside counsel allegations that old navy sluggish negotiations from december,to february,were a sham,compl.documentary evidence that l was slowly retreating from and ultimately abandoned its insistence on minimum guaranteed royalties,a supposed sticking point for old navy and allegations that,under new management and in a deteriorating retail environment,old navy had decided it did not want to close any deal with oldham,the complaint raised the plausible inference that old navy january proposal was designed to elicit l rejection.for all of these reasons,l stated a claim for breach of contract for failure to negotiate in good faith 
count i wrongful termination 
l stated a claim for declaratory judgment for all three prongs of count first,l stated a claim for declaratory judgment that old navy failed to comply with the notice and cure provisions of the agreement.before either party could terminate the agreement,section required notice of a material breach,days opportunity to cure,failure to cure the material breach,and notice of termination.see agreement.but old navy termination letter provided only notice of termination effective immediately without providing l with notice of its alleged breaches and days opportunity to cure.old navy conceded as much in its motion for judgment on the pleadings.see old navy memorandum of law in support of motion for judgment on the pleadings at.therefore,this claim should have survived.
second,for the same reasons,l claim for declaratory judgment that the termination letter did not effect a termination of the agreement should have survived.
third,l stated a claim for declaratory judgment that old navy wrongfully terminated the agreement.old navy notified l that it had materially breached the agreement by filing a lawsuit against old navy and by failing to satisfy certain unspecified performance obligations.ex.b ringing suit to determine the meaning of an agreement is not a breach of that agreement absent some explicit contractual provision that the party will not bring suit.prudential equity,llc ajamie,d.moreover,as l explained to the district court,none of the vague,unspecified issues mentioned in the termination letter had been previously raised with l to the contrary,oldham had been repeatedly and widely praised by gap and old navy executives and staff throughout his old navy tenure.l app.brief at citing multiple allegations in,and documentary evidence supporting,the complaint.old navy made no argument,and pointed to no evidence,contradicting these facts.therefore,accepting l allegations as true and drawing every inference in its favor,l plausibly alleged that it was in compliance with the agreement,which was therefore wrongfully terminated.
the district court dismissed count i upon its determination that old navy had no duty to provide l with an opportunity to cure because such cure would have been futile.of course,if the alleged grounds for l termination did not constitute breach or material breach,then it is irrelevant whether l could have cured.thus,the district court concluded that oldham was unlikely to have been able to perform his duties after he sued old navy and unlikely to have withdrawn his complaint if old navy had sent a notice of breach.but this appears to be speculative.that conclusion,and the conclusion that withdrawal of the complaint could not have undone the harm caused by the public filing of a lawsuit against old navy,wl,at emphasis added,rests on the public nature of the litigation.however,it is undisputed that both of l complaints were filed under seal.for all of these reasons,count i survives old navy c motion as a matter of law.
ii.motion to amend the judgment and replead 
we generally review motions for reconsideration under an abuse of discretion standard.see devlin transp.commc int l union,cir.however,a denial of leave to amend that is based on a legal interpretation,such as for futility,is reviewed de novo.see gorman consol.edison,cir littlejohn artuz,cir.
the district court erred in denying l motion for leave to replead its bad faith negotiation claim based on futility however,in light of our finding that count iii stated a claim for relief,this error was harmless because that count of l april,complaint is reinstated.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm in part and vacate in part the district court judgment,and we remand for further proceedings in so doing we reverse in part the order of the district court that dismissed the complaint and reinstate count i and count iii on the three bases discussed in this opinion.
we set forth the pleadings in great detail to demonstrate the unusual amount of material the district court had before it on this c motion.
all exhibits cited herein are exhibits to the complaint unless otherwise noted.
for example,oldham entered into a licensing agreement with mattel,for a special collector edition of a barbie doll.
by its terms,the agreement is governed by new york law.
the complaint alleges that howe,old navy vice president,expressed this to l.see compl.an october,email from vayness l to wyatt,however,indicates that wyatt made the statement.see ex.
l complaint and exhibits attached thereto largely omit reference to the parties january discussions.the facts set forth below are primarily drawn from the five email exhibits to old navy counterclaims.
citing this email,l alleges in the complaint that o n february,l accepted old navy january,proposal in its entirety.compl.as the text of the email makes clear,however,this was not quite so.
