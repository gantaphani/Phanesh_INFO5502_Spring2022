this is the second appeal to reach this court in the litigation of relator mark duxbury qui tam action against defendant ortho biotech products,obp for alleged violations of the federal false claims acts fca,arising from obp marketing of the pharmaceutical drug procrit.following mark duxbury death in october,the district court permitted his surviving spouse,chinyelu duxbury,to substitute herself as relator.
duxbury amended complaint alleged three separate violations of the fca arising from obp efforts to promote procrit,an medication for the treatment of certain types of anemia,from approximately to the parties voluntarily dismissed count ii of the amended complaint prior to duxbury initial appeal.thereafter,in united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech products,duxbury i,cir,we affirmed the district court dismissal of count iii,and certain portions of count i,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.b.id.at.we reversed and remanded,however,as to its determination that duxbury kickback claims from to in count i of the amended complaint were not pled with sufficient particularity under.b.id.at.
on remand,the district court sensibly imposed limitations on the scope of duxbury discovery for these claims based upon its reading of duxbury i,the fca statute of limitations,and the fca provision limiting the court subject matter jurisdiction to those claims as to which a relator has direct and independent knowledge,e a b see united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,civil rwz,wl.at the conclusion of discovery,the parties entered a joint stipulation stating that duxbury had not identified any admissible evidence to support the remaining count i claims.the district court granted obp motion for summary judgment on that basis.united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,civil rwz,wl.
duxbury now appeals,saying that the district court improperly limited the count i kickback claims as a matter of fact and of law.we affirm.
the relevant fca provisions,facts,and procedural history in this case are set out in some detail in duxbury i,at,and in the district court numerous prior orders and opinions,see,united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,d.we narrow our present discussion to the information central to this appeal.
the fca qui tam provisions authorize private persons called relators to bring civil enforcement actions on behalf of the united states against any person alleged to be in violation of section of the act.b.qui tam complaints are initially filed under seal,and relators must allow the government sixty days to intervene and assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the action.id.b,c.if the government declines to intervene,a relator may continue to pursue the action on the government behalf.id.b.either way,the relator is eligible to collect a portion of any damages awarded.united states ex rel.ondis city of woonsocket,cir.
although this financial incentive encourages would be relators to expose fraud,united states ex rel.poteet bahler,cir,it also attracts parasitic relators who bring fca damages claims based on information within the public domain or that the relator did not otherwise discover,united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir quoting united states ex rel.prawer fleet bank of,cir,overruled on other grounds by allison engine united states ex rel.sanders.accordingly,congress has amended the fca several times to walk a fine line between encouraging and discouraging opportunistic behavior.duxbury i,at quoting prawer,at.
to that end,the fca public disclosure bar provides that n o court shall have jurisdiction over a qui tam action that is based upon a prior public disclosure of allegations or transactions found in any of a number of statutorily specified sources.e a see poteet,at.there is,however,an exception to the public disclosure bar for persons deemed an original source of the information in question.e a.to qualify as an original source,a relator must have direct and independent knowledge of the information supporting her claims that she provided to the government before filing an action.id.e b see duxbury i,at.
in,obp hired mark duxbury as a product specialist in its western division oncology sales group.in that capacity,and later as regional key account specialist,duxbury was responsible for marketing procrit to health care providers in the western united states,particularly in the state of washington.on july,obp fired duxbury for cause.see duxbury ortho biotech,i,wl,at.may.
duxbury complaint,filed under seal in the district of massachusetts on november,and amended in october,alleged that obp engaged in a common nationwide scheme to induce medicare providers to submit false and fraudulent reimbursement claims for procrit.the action was unsealed on july,after the united states declined to intervene following investigation.the amended complaint contained three counts,only the first of which is involved in this appeal 
count i of the amended complaint alleged that from december to the present,obp offered kickbacks to healthcare providers across the united states to encourage them to prescribe procrit to their patients.these kickbacks included free procrit,discounts and cash in the form of rebates,consulting fees,educational grants,payments to participate in studies or trials,and advisory board honoraria.the amended complaint further alleged that these purported kickbacks caused providers and hospitals to submit false claims for payment to medicare for procrit in a number of ways 
on january,obp filed its motion to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice,which the district court granted in full on january.duxbury,d at.as to count i,the district court found that all of the amended complaint kickback allegations had been publicly disclosed in an earlier suit,id.at duxbury qualifie d as an original source only with regard to allegations concerning the time period,id.at citing rockwell int l united states,and none of the to kickback allegations had been pled with sufficient particularity under.b,id.at.
on february,the district court denied duxbury motion for reconsideration and he appealed.
in duxbury i,this court largely affirmed the district court dismissal of the amended complaint.like the district court,we found that the kickback allegations supporting count i had been publicly disclosed in an earlier suit,id.at,and that duxbury qualified as an original source only for those of his claims arising from to,during his employment at obp,id.at.but we reversed the district court determination that the allegations supporting duxbury claims from this period were not pled with sufficient particularity under rule b in the amended complaint.id.at.
the reasons for that determination are stated in our opinion.in short,we concluded that duxbury had done more than merely suggest fraud was possible.id.at quoting rost,at.rather,in paragraph of the amended complaint,subsections,duxbury set forth allegations of kickbacks provided by obp that resulted in the submission of false claims by eight healthcare providers in the western united states.id.at.these providers,all located in the state of washington,included 
joseph hospital in tacoma,washington rainier oncology of puyallap,washington memorial clinic in olympia,washington western washington cancer treatment center mid columbia kidney center in kennewick,washington peter hospital in olympia,washington memorial clinic oncology group in washington swedish hospital in seattle,washington.
id.citations omitted.as to each provider,the amended complaint asserted that paragraph allegations were based upon duxbury personal knowledge,observation and direct communications with the accounts,and furnished specific information as to the dates and amounts of the false claims filed by these providers with the medicare program,duxbury i,at.
with respect to the eight medical providers in question,the amended complaint had reasonably set forth the who,what,where,and when of the allegedly false or fraudulent representation s.id.quoting rodi new eng.sch.of law,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,these allegations were also sufficient to support duxbury claim that obp intended to cause the submission of false claims by these providers.id.at emphasis omitted see id.at describing paragraph specific allegations as to obp efforts to induce the submission of false claims.
this court held as follows 
thus,we hold that the kickback claims attributable to duxbury,from the years through,satisfied rule b.as the district court has jurisdiction over these claims since duxbury established himself as an original source,we reverse the dismissal of these claims.
id.at emphasis added.of some importance here,duxbury i did not dictate the appropriate contours for discovery on remand,and it explicitly left to the district court the task of resolving obp alternative grounds for dismissal,including its contention that the fca statute of limitations bar red most of duxbury kickback claims.id.at.
on remand,obp moved for an order clarifying that,in light of the duxbury i decision,duxbury remaining count i claims were limited both i temporally to an period between november and july,and ii geographically to the eight healthcare providers described in paragraph of the amended complaint.in response,duxbury agreed that the kickback claims accruing before november,were by the fca statute of limitations.however,he contended that the appropriate time period for his remaining claims spanned from approximately november to november,and that,because the amended complaint had alleged a nationwide kickback scheme,the scope of his discovery for these claims should not be geographically limited.
on september,the district court issued a memorandum of decision resolving this dispute in favor of obp.see duxbury,wl,at.as to obp proposed time limitation,the district court found that the law of the case established that duxbury was only an original source for claims arising during his employment at obp,and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over any kickback claims arising after his termination on july.id.at.moreover,with respect to obp proposed geographic restriction,duxbury only possessed direct and independent knowledge of obp activities in the western united states,and so he was limited to discovery pertaining to that region.id.at.the district court denied duxbury motion for leave to appeal the september order on february.
on june,the parties filed a joint statement limiting discovery to duxbury count i claims from i november,to july,and from ii five of the eight accounts described in paragraph of the amended complaint the count i claims predicated on duxbury allegations as to the other three accounts had accrued before the november,imposed by the fca statute of limitations,and so could not be pursued.
at the close of the discovery period,the parties filed a stipulation with the district court stating that although they had conferred and cooperated with each other in good faith,duxbury 
ha d not identified and d id not possess any documents,witness testimony or other admissible evidence to support her remaining allegations,as limited by the court order dated september,namely identification of a specific payment that could be considered a kickback made to the accounts serviced by mark duxbury during november,to july.
obp then moved for summary judgment on the basis of duxbury stipulation,which the district court granted on august.duxbury,wl,at.
duxbury now appeals from that decision and from the september order limiting the scope of her count i discovery.
we review the district court order limiting the scope of discovery for abuse of discretion.asociación de periodistas de mueller,cir.because trial court judges exercise broad discretion in managing the scope of discovery,in re recticel foam,cir,we will intervene only upon a clear showing that the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party,asociación de periodistas,at alterations in original quoting ayala gerena bristol myers squibb,cir.
after reviewing the district court evidentiary determinations and thereby settling the scope of the summary judgment record,we review the court grant of summary judgment de novo.united states ex rel.jones brigham women,cir.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor,ayala gerena,at,summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.this court may affirm summary judgment on any basis apparent in the record.see,colón tracey,wl,at cir john danielson,winchester conant,cir.
although duxbury ultimately requests that this court reverse the district court august summary judgment order,she does not attack that order directly.instead,the focus of her argument on appeal is the september order limiting discovery for count i to i the time period of november to july,and ii the five accounts located in the state of washington as to which mark duxbury had direct and independent knowledge.
duxbury challenges the september order on two basic grounds.first,she contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the count i claims outside the specified parameters based upon its misreading of both the fca original source exception to the public disclosure bar and the supreme court discussion of that exception in rockwell.second,duxbury argues that the september order discovery limitations directly contradict the ruling and reasoning of this court in duxbury i in remanding count i to kickback claims to the district court.
in response,obp contends that the district court application of the public disclosure bar to count i was entirely consistent with rockwell,emphasizing that duxbury cites no authority supporting her contrary reading of the supreme court decision.moreover,obp argues that even if the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the whole of count i,this court should affirm the september order on the alternative ground that it was well within the district court discretion to limit the scope of discovery to those count i allegations pled with sufficient particularity under.b.
we do not reach our doubts as to the merits of duxbury first challenge to the september order.assuming arguendo that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over all of the count i kickback claims,we agree with obp alternate ground that the limitations the court imposed on duxbury discovery were entirely consistent with our holding in duxbury i and within the district court broad discretion in managing discovery.
we first dispose of duxbury contention that the discovery limitations imposed by the september order were inconsistent with our application in duxbury i of the more flexible rule b standard recognized in rost,at,and adopted in the fca precedents of this circuit,united states ex rel.gagne city of worcester,cir,and several others,see united states ex rel.bledsoe cmty.health,cir united states ex rel.joshi luke,cir.just like the relator objections in the district court,this argument ignores the particulars of our rule b analysis in duxbury 
following our opinion in duxbury i,the only count i claims that remained were those attributable to mark duxbury,from the years through.at.additionally,our decision to remand those claims to the district court was tied directly to the allegations of fraud contained in paragraph of duxbury amended complaint.in fact,these were the only allegations that distinguished duxbury claims from the ones that we found to be deficient under rule b in rost.see id.at finding that duxbury amended complaint had not only amply describe d the illegal practices in which obp had allegedly engaged,id.at quoting rost,at,but also alleged facts that false claims were in fact filed by the medical providers he identified,id.at rost,at affirming dismissal of qui tam complaint for failure to sufficiently establish that false claims were submitted for government payment in a way that satisfies the rule b particularity requirement,id.at united states ex rel.atkins mcinteer,cir same.
on remand,the district court imposed reasonable limitations on the scope of discovery,which were entirely consistent with our holding i
