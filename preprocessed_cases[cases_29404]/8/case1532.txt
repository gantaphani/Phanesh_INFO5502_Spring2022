the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa precludes plaintiffs from filing certain class actions in state courts that allege fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of nationally traded securities.f.in these consolidated appeals,who are xerox and kodak retirees,filed class action complaints in new york state supreme court,which purported to raise state law claims.they alleged that employees of morgan stanley,misrepresented that if appellants were to retire early,their investment savings would be sufficient to support them through retirement.if slusa applies,appellants are precluded from bringing the actions in state court and defendants are entitled to remove them to federal court,where they are subject to dismissal.f.removed the actions to the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,where appellants moved to remand the cases and defendants moved to dismiss them.after affording appellants an opportunity to amend their complaints to state federal claims,an opportunity appellants declined,the district court denied the motions to remand and dismissed the actions.we find that slusa preclusion provision applies and,therefore,we affirm.
background 
lawton and miller 
the following facts are taken from appellants amended complaints unless otherwise noted.appellants william lawton and gerald miller,were both longtime employees of xerox.xerox employees who were eligible for retirement could elect to receive either lifetime monthly retirement benefits or a lump sum retirement benefit.appellee david isabella was a senior of morgan stanley,a retirement specialist,and a former xerox employee.at various times between and,lawton and miller consulted with isabella about retirement.lawton and miller allege that during these meetings,isabella provided retirement but not investment advice,performed various calculations,and advised them that they had sufficient savings to retire early and comfortably.specifically,lawton and miller allege that isabella advised them that if they could live on annual withdrawals of approximately ten percent of their retirement savings,they could retire early without exhausting their savings principal,a concept appellants refer to as the retirement income premise.lawton and miller further allege that they elected early retirement in reliance on isabella advice,leaving behind job security and substantial benefits.both elected to take a lump sum retirement benefit,which they invested,about eighteen months after they first met with isabella,in various securities through morgan stanley.subsequently,the value of their portfolios dropped precipitously,resulting in substantially reduced monthly withdrawals and significant financial hardship.
lawton and miller filed and subsequently amended a putative class action against isabella and morgan stanley.the amended complaint asserted various state law causes of action,including negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of contract,as well as an unfair and deceptive trade practices claim under section of the new york general business law.bus.mckinney.the amended complaint defined the putative class as xerox employees who received similar retirement advice from isabella and alleged that the putative class size was between to or more persons.morgan stanley and isabella,relying on slusa,removed the case to federal court,and moved to dismiss.lawton and miller to remand on the ground that they had not asserted federal claims.
romano,morrill,and patrick 
the companion case involving kodak employees presents a roughly similar picture.kodak employees who reach retirement are eligible to receive retirement benefits in the form of either a fixed monthly annuity or a lump sum benefit.employees who elect to retire early forfeit their employment,job benefits,and annual salary.appellants john romano,stanley morrill,and richard patrick the romano appellants are former longtime kodak employees who,in connection with their retirement planning,consulted with michael kazacos,a senior vice president,financial consultant,and retirement specialist at morgan stanley.
according to the romano appellants amended complaint,kazacos represented that he was an expert on kodak retirement benefits and,starting in,hosted free seminars offering retirement advice.the romano appellants allege that,during these seminars as well as during individual appointments,kazacos advised them that they had sufficient assets to retire and encouraged them to retire early and take lump sum retirement benefits.the romano appellants insist that,during these meetings,kazacos gave no investment advice and did not mention or recommend specific investment vehicles or asset allocation strategies.the romano appellants each elected to retire early and take a lump sum retirement benefit,which they placed with morgan stanley for investment.as was the case with lawton and miller,the romano appellants retirement accounts suffered disastrous declines in value,allegedly because kazacos retirement advice was inappropriate and had a significant probability of failure.because of this drop in value,the romano appellants allege that their incomes and standards of living have fallen markedly.also,a number of class members allege that they have been required to leave retirement and seek new employment.
the romano appellants filed and subsequently amended a putative class action against morgan stanley and kazacos in new york state supreme court alleging common law claims of negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,and violations of section of new york general business law,and seeking as damages lost wages and lost employment benefits.the amended complaint defined the class as persons who were kodak employees and who received from the defendants retirement advice,projections of income,and representations as to sustainable retirement income distributions from their retirement savings that were material to the plaintiffs and describes the class as including persons to persons or more.morgan stanley removed the action to federal court,where it was consolidated with the lawton action,and moved to dismiss pursuant to slusa and rule b.at the same time,appellants moved to remand for lack of federal jurisdiction.
proceedings below 
while considering defendants motions to dismiss and appellants motions to remand,the district court concluded that it could look beyond the face of the complaint to determine whether slusa applies.upon doing so,the district court ruled that appellants state law actions were based on misrepresentations or omissions of material facts since the foundation of the retirement and financial planning services centered upon certain misrepresentations and certain concealments.the district court also ruled that although plaintiffs say their claims are about bad retirement advice and tax planning,and despite a lapse in time between defendants alleged fraud and appellants purchases of covered securities,defendants alleged misconduct coincided with appellants securities purchases under merrill lynch,fenner smith dabit.on this basis,the district court denied the motions to remand,held that slusa preempted both actions,and dismissed them.these appeals followed.we review de novo both the district court denial of appellants motions to remand and its grant of defendants motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b.pac.capital bank,connecticut,cir ortiz mcbride,cir.
iii.discussion 
congress enacted b of the securities exchange act of to make it unlawful for any person t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe.b.pursuant to b,the sec promulgated rule,which makes it unlawful 
for any person t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact or t o engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
private rights of action are,of course,available to enforce rule.see dabit,at.in,in response to perceived abuses of the vehicle in rule litigation,congress passed the private securities litigation reform act the pslra.the pslra established uniform standards for class actions alleging securities fraud,including more stringent pleading requirements for certain securities fraud class actions brought in federal courts.see spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
after the plsra enactment,plaintiffs began circumventing its restrictions by filing federal securities fraud class actions in state court,where they could assert many of the same causes of action while avoiding the pslra requirements,which apply in federal court.lander hartford life annuity ins,cir see also spielman,at.in an effort to curb these perceived,new abuses,congress enacted slusa in under slusa,covered class actions involving covered securities that are filed in state court,invoke state law,and allege securities fraud are removable to federal court,where they are to be dismissed.f.specifically,slusa provides that 
n o covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging a a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or b that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
f.a covered security is a security traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange.f.a covered class action is a single lawsuit in which damages are sought on behalf of more than fifty persons.f.
in order to remove successfully a securities fraud class action to federal court and compel its dismissal,a defendant must show that the state action is a covered class action based on state statutory or common law that alleges that defendants made a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact or used or employed any manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f.the parties agree that the underlying lawsuits involve covered class actions.however,appellants contend that their amended complaints do not allege misrepresentations or omissions of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities,placing prongs and in dispute.
master of the complaint 
appellants initially contend that the district court impermissibly looked beyond the face of the amended complaints,which make no reference to the federal securities laws,when it found that slusa applied.appellants maintain that,under the master of the complaint rule,they are free to avoid federal jurisdiction by pleading only state claims even where a federal claim is also available.marcus v.at t,cir.since jurisdiction may not be sustained on a theory that the plaintiff has not advanced,merrell dow pharms.thompson,appellants contend that they are entitled to avoid slusa by not asserting federal claims in state proceedings.
appellants are incorrect.whether federal courts have federal question jurisdiction over an action is typically governed by the complaint rule,pursuant to which federal question jurisdiction exists only if plaintiff statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based on federal law.vaden discover bank,caterpillar williams.under the complaint rule,then,plaintiff is the master of his complaint and is free to avoid federal jurisdiction by pleading only state claims even where a federal claim is also available.marcus,at.however,there exists a corollary to the complaint artful pleading to which plaintiff can not avoid removal by declining to plead necessary federal questions.rivet regions bank.if the artful pleading rule applies,courts look beyond the face of an artfully pled complaint to determine whether plaintiff has cloth ed a federal law claim in state garb by pleading state law claims that actually arise under federal law.travelers indem.sarkisian,cir.if such is the case,the reviewing court will uphold removal even though no federal question appears on the face of the complaint.rivet,at.
the artful pleading rule applies when congress has either so completely preempted,or entirely substituted,a federal law cause of action for a state one that plaintiff can not avoid removal by declining to plead necessary federal questions,or expressly provided for the removal of particular actions asserting state law claims in state court,see beneficial bank anderson,explaining the act,hh,presents an exception to the complaint rule because it expressly provides for removal of tort actions arising out of nuclear accidents brought in state court even when they assert only claims.application of the first prong is a bit tricky because slusa is a statute of preclusion,rather than preemption but its effect is the same where plaintiffs proceed as a class of fifty or more,state law securities claims are no longer available to them and federal law,which compels the dismissal of those claims,controls.application of the second prong is straightforward.since slusa expressly provides for the removal of covered class actions,it falls under the removal exception to the complaint rule.f.consequently,we are free to look beyond the face of the amended complaints to determine whether they allege securities fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities.see rowinski salomon smith barney,cir no matter how an action is pleaded,if it is a covered class action involving a covered security,removal is proper.quotations and alterations omitted see also segal fifth third bank,cir courts may look must look substance of a complaint allegations in applying slusa.otherwise,slusa enforcement would reduce to a formalistic search through the pages of the complaint for magic words and nothing more.
covered securities 
the amended complaints do not acknowledge that appellants invested in covered securities however,in support of their notice of removal,defendants introduced account statements establishing that appellants deposited their retirement savings into morgan stanley ira accounts,where covered securities were purchased on their behalf mutual funds in the case of the romano appellants and mutual funds and listed securities or securities authorized for listing in the case of the lawton appellants.
when deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,courts focus primarily on the allegations in the complaint.see chambers time warner,however,if subject matter jurisdiction is contested,courts are permitted to look to materials outside the pleadings.see rule b land dollar,see also paul fire marine ins.universal builders supply,cir makarova united states,cir.such materials can include documents appended to a notice of removal or a motion to remand that convey information essential to the court jurisdictional analysis.see,davenport procter gamble,cir looking to information contained in affidavits submitted in support of a motion to remand to determine removability see also oglesby rca,cir holding it was proper for the district court to look to a motion to remand and removal petition to determine removability.
under slusa,removal jurisdiction is restricted to precluded actions.therefore,a motion to remand claiming the action is not precluded must be seen as posing a jurisdictional issue.kircher putnam funds trust.thus,where a district court removal jurisdiction under slusa is challenged,it must first determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims.see dabit,at citing spielman,at newman,concurring.to answer that question,it must determine whether plaintiffs actually allege misrepresentations or omissions of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f.here,the morgan stanley account statements were before the district court in the remand litigation and were used to determine that the euphemistic investments referred to throughout the amended complaints were,in fact,covered securities.the district cou
