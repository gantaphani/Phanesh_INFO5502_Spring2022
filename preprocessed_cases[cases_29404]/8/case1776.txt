background 
the defendant,tim walker,is the proprietor of a website,the website.he operates it from his home in waverly,iowa.as its name suggests,the website provides comments,most of them derogatory,about household movers in the united states.on or about august,walker posted statements about bvl in the section of the website called the black list report.under the heading editor comments,walker wrote that as of bvl was performing interstate moving services without legal authority from the federal motor carrier safety administration,and did not carry cargo insurance as required by law.compl.walker made similar factual assertions in response to a question about bvl that was posted on the section of the website by a person whose whereabouts are not disclosed in the record 
on august,bvl instituted this lawsuit against walker by filing a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.in it,bvl alleges that the statements about it on the website were false,defamatory,and made with an intention to harm it.compl.we assume at this stage of the proceedings that bvl allegations are correct and can be proved.bvl seeks to have walker enjoined from publishing further defamatory statements about bvl.it also seeks compensatory and punitive damages totaling million.
walker moved to transfer the action to the united states district court for the southern district of iowa.bvl opposed the motion,but also treated it as a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.best van lines,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in his reply,walker,representing himself,argued that a new york not give new york courts jurisdiction over him for purposes of this lawsuit.id.

ii.personal jurisdiction in new york 
a.the issue on appeal 
this appeal raises a single question whether the united states district court for the southern district of new york had personal jurisdiction over walker for purposes of entertaining this lawsuit.to answer that question,we look first to the law of the state of new york,in which the district court sits.kronisch united states,cir.if,but only if,our answer is in the affirmative,we must then determine whether asserting jurisdiction under that provision would be compatible with requirements of due process established under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.see int l shoe washington.
agreeing with the district court,we conclude that while new york appellate courts have not decided this precise issue,under principles of new york law,the district court did not have such jurisdiction.we therefore need not address the second question whether,if new york law conferred it,asserting such jurisdiction would be permissible under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution still,because the analysis of the state statutory and federal constitutional limitations have become somewhat entangled in new york jurisprudence,we think it advisable to explore the relationship between the two in some detail.
constitutional limits on personal jurisdiction 
in,the supreme court held that states power to exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants consistent with the federal constitution was not contingent on those defendants physical presence within the states borders.int l shoe,at.instead,in order to exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires only that the defendants have certain minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.citation omitted.
a court deciding whether it has jurisdiction over an defendant under the due process clause must evaluate the quality and nature,burger king rudzewicz,d,of the defendant contacts with the forum state under a totality of the circumstances test,id.at.the crucial question is whether the defendant has purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,id.at.quoting hanson denckla,d internal quotation marks omitted,such that the defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there,id.at.quoting volkswagen woodson,d internal quotation marks omitted 
applying these principles,in keeton hustler magazine,d,the supreme court concluded that a new hampshire federal district court had jurisdiction over the defendant,an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in california,id.at.the court based its conclusion on the fact that the defendant magazine in which the alleged libel appeared had a monthly circulation in new hampshire of to.this established that the defendant continuously and deliberately exploited the new hampshire market,creating in the defendant a reasonable expectation that it might be haled into court there in an action based on the contents of the magazine.id.at.
also invoking the minimum contacts rubric,in calder jones,d decided the same day as court concluded that a california state court had personal jurisdiction over the national enquirer,a nationally distributed weekly with editorial offices in florida,and a reporter and an editor,both florida residents,in a lawsuit based on an allegedly libelous story about the california activities of a california resident.id.at.employing what has since come to be called the effects test,the court reasoned that because california is the focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered,jurisdiction over the defendants was proper in california based on the effects of their florida conduct in california.id.at.in the language of minimum contacts,when the defendants committed their intentional,and allegedly tortious,actions expressly aimed at california,they must have reasonably anticipate d being haled into court there to answer for the truth of the statements made in their article.id.at.citations omitted.
although calder and keeton were handed down simultaneously on similar subjects,they relied on independent,if conceptually overlapping,methods of demonstrating minimum on the defendant overall activity within the forum state calder on the effects of activity.
statutes and a 
relying on international shoe,state legislatures began enacting laws,known as statutes prescribing the terms under which their courts could exercise personal jurisdiction.most of these laws explicitly provide,or have been interpreted to provide,that jurisdiction will be permitted to the full extent allowed by the federal constitution when federal courts sit in such states,there is but one inquiry as to specific personal jurisdiction over the defendant whether the defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum state to satisfy the requirements of due process.see,young new haven advocate,cir because virginia statute extends personal jurisdiction to the extent permitted by the due process clause,the statutory inquiry necessarily merges with the constitutional inquiry,and the two inquiries essentially become one.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the reach of new york statute,by contrast,does not coincide with the limits of the due process clause.analysis under it therefore may involve two separate inquiries,one statutory and one constitutional.if jurisdiction is statutorily impermissible,of course,we need not reach the question of its constitutionality.
the new york statute provides 
as to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section,a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any,or his executor or administrator,who in person or through an agent 
transacts any business within the state or contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the state or 
commits a tortious act within the state,except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act or 
commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state,except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act,if he 
i regularly does or solicits business,or engages in any other persistent course of conduct,or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered,in the state,or 
ii expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce or 
owns,uses or possesses any real property situated within the state.
a.importantly for present purposes,sections a and,which permit jurisdiction over tortious acts committed in new york and those committed outside new york that cause injuries in the state,respectively,explicitly exempt causes of action for the tort of defamation from their scope,whether or not such jurisdiction would be consistent with due process protection.the defamation exceptions thus create a gap between the jurisdiction conferred by the new york statute and the full extent of jurisdiction permissible under the federal constitution.see ingraham carroll,s ubdivision a was not designed to go to the full limits of permissible jurisdiction.the limitations contained in subparagraphs i and ii were deliberately inserted to keep the provision well within constitutional bounds.citations and internal quotation marks omitted second brackets in original 
new york appellate division,first department has reflected on the reasons for the defamation exception.
t he advisory committee intended to avoid unnecessary inhibitions on freedom of speech or the press.these important civil liberties are entitled to special protections lest procedural burdens shackle them.it did not wish new york to force newspapers published in other states to defend themselves in states where they had no substantial interests,as the new york times was forced to do in alabama.
legros irving,dep t referring to times sullivan,d,which reversed a large alabama libel judgment against the new york times based on a pro advertisement that it published where jurisdiction was based on limited daily circulation of the new york times within alabama.
in light of these intentions,one might think that the new york state legislature meant for no provision of the statute to grant jurisdiction over an defendant with respect to a cause of action for defamation.see vardinoyannis encyclopedia britannica,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,leval,because a and expressly exclude actions for defamation,there are strong arguments that the legislature intended to bar use of the statute in defamation cases.but new york courts have not gone that far.under new york law,when a person utters a defamatory statement without the state that causes injury to the plaintiff within the state,jurisdiction may be acquired under section a,even though section a which explicitly concerns jurisdiction as to tortious acts that cause defamation cases from its scope.
legros itself relied on section a to support jurisdiction over an defendant in a defamation case.after describing the history of the statute,the court defended its reliance on section a,which covers transactions of business within the state,to establish jurisdiction.
there is a clear distinction between a situation where the only act which occurred in new york was the mere utterance of the libelous material and on the other hand,a situation where purposeful business transactions have taken place in new york giving rise to the cause of action.where purposeful transactions of business have taken place in new york,it may not be said that subjecting the defendant to this state jurisdiction is an unnecessary inhibition on freedom of speech or the press.
legros,at,at.because virtually all the work attendant upon publication of the book containing the alleged libel occurred in new york,jurisdiction over the defendant under subsection was proper.id.at,at.
defamation cases under section a 
new york courts evaluating specific jurisdiction under section a look to both the language of the statute and the relation between the alleged conduct and the cause of action.to determine the existence of jurisdiction under section a,a court must decide whether the defendant transacts any business in new york and,if so,whether this cause of action aris es from such a business transaction.see deutsche bank,montana bd.of.courts look to the totality of the defendant activities within the forum,sterling bank trust of fidelity mortgage investors,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted,to determine whether a defendant has transact ed business in such a way that it constitutes purposeful activity satisfying the first part of the test,see id.at watch barnes reinecke,cert.denied,d.as for the second part of the test,a suit will be deemed to have arisen out of a party activities in new york if there is an articulable nexus,or a substantial relationship,between the claim asserted and the actions that occurred in new york.henderson ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord deutsche bank,at,at,at.
transacting business 
with respect to the first part of the test for jurisdiction under section a,new york courts define transact ing business as purposeful activity some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.mckee,quoting hanson denckla,d this purposeful avail ment language defining transacting business has been adopted by the new york court of appeals from supreme court cases analyzing the constitutional limitations on a state power to assert personal jurisdiction over a defendant.see kreutter mcfadden oil,new york statute,was enacted in response to inter alia,mcgee international life ins,d,and international shoe washington.new york decisions thus,at least in their rhetoric,tend to conflate the statutory and constitutional analyses by focusing on the constitutional standard whether the defendant conduct constitutes purposeful avail ment of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.denckla,at.see,mckee,at,at,at quoting denckla,at.
it may be that the meaning of transact ing business for the purposes of section a overlaps significantly with the constitutional minimum contacts doctrine.see mckee,at,at,at i t seems to us the contacts here,rather than being minimal,were so infinitesimal,both in light of hanson denckla,d,and watch barnes reinecke,that jurisdiction of the new york courts can not be sustained.deutsche bank,at,at,at discussing the section a and due process requirements seemingly simultaneously donini int l,satec llc,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july,noting that the analysis under section is in essence,the same as that established by the united states supreme court to evaluate the constitutionality of personal jurisdiction under statutes.but we do not understand new york courts to teach that the gap created by the defamation exceptions in sections a and,see ingraham,at,at,at,is eliminated by the transact ing business analysis.some distance remains between the jurisdiction permitted by the due process clause and that granted by new york statute.
new york courts do not interpret transact ing business to include mere defamatory utterances sent into the state.although section a does not exclude defamation from its coverage,new york courts construe transacts any business within the state more narrowly in defamation cases than they do in the context of other sorts of litigation.in other cases,proof of one transaction,or a single act,in new york is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction,even though the defendant never enters new york,deutsche bank,at,at,at internal quotation marks omitted see also galleries,franklyn,finding jurisdiction where defendant never entered new york,but participated in a live auction in new york by making one telephone call to new york and thus was receiving and transmitting bids over an open telephone line fischbarg doucet,dep t finding jurisdiction over defendants who solicited new york lawyer plaintiff to provide them with legal advice and called,emailed,and faxed the plaintiff in new york pursuant to such representation,though defendants never entered the state catauro goldome bank for,dep t finding jurisdiction where missouri defendant called a new york bank with an inquiry,mailed letters to the bank,enclosing the bankbook and the power of attorney,and thereafter received money from the bank.but see kimco exchange place thomas benz,dep t the defendants acts of faxing the executed contracts to new york and of making a few telephone calls do not qualify as purposeful acts constituting the transacting of business.in defamation cases,by contrast,the single act of uttering a defamation,no matter how loudly,is not a transact ion of business that may provide the foundation for personal jurisdiction.in other words,when the defamatory publication itself constitutes the alleged transact ion of business for the purposes of section a,more than the distribution of a libelous statement must be made within the state to establish jurisdiction over the person distributing it 
consistent with this analysis,in cases where the plaintiff has brought a defamation action based on letters the defendant sent into new york from outside the state,new york courts have concluded that the act of sending the letters into the state does not alone amount to a transaction of business within the state under section a.for example,in kim dvorak,dep t,the third department concluded that the sending of four allegedly defamatory letters by the defendant to health care professionals in new york did not constitute transaction of business in the state,id.at,at.to hold otherwise,the court said,would unjustifiably extend the intendment of the legislature to allow,in limited circumstances,the reach of this state jurisdiction beyond its borders.id.in pontarelli shapero,dep t,the first department similarly decided that the sending of two allegedly defamatory letters and one facsimile into new york did not constitute transaction of business in the state for purposes of section a,id.at,at.and in strelsin barrett,dep t,the court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over a california defendant who had allegedly libeled the plaintiff in a television broadcast recorded in california.subsequent distribution of a tape of the broadcast in new york d id not constitute doing business in new york by the newscaster who performed elsewhere.id.at,at.
to be sure,new york courts have found jurisdiction in cases where the defendants conduct involved defamatory statements projected into new york and targeting new yorkers,but only where the conduct also included something more.in sovik healing network,dep t,for example,the appellate division,fourth department,concluded that one allegedly defamatory letter sent by the defendants could provide a basis for jurisdiction where the defendants had drafted the letter and either distributed or authorized the distribution of the letter in the buffalo area,thereby demonstrating the defendants active involvement and personal control in new york over the writing and distribution of the allegedly defamatory statement.id.at,at affirming district court decision that plaintiffs were entitled to jurisdictional discovery legros,at,at concluding that the publication of an allegedly defamatory book for which virtually all the work attendant upon publication had occurred in new york,including the research for it and the negotiations and execution of the contract with the publisher,constituted transactions of business for the purposes of section a modica westchester rockland newspapers,misc d.westchester county finding jurisdiction proper under section a where the newspaper containing an allegedly defamatory column was published in new york for new york readers.
arising from a transaction of business 
if the defendant is transacting business in new york,the second half of the section a inquiry asks whether the cause of action aris es from that business transaction or transactions.see deutsche bank,at,at,at.new york courts have held that a claim aris es from a particular transaction when there is some articulable nexus between the business transacted and the cause of action sued upon,or when there is a substantial relationship between the transaction and the claim asserted.sole resort,at citations omitted.a connection that is merely coincidental is insufficient to support jurisdiction.id.citation omitted.
under the arises from prong,new york courts have also concluded that they lacked jurisdiction over defendants accused of having uttered defamatory falsehoods where the defamation claim did not arise from the defendants specific business transactions in new york.realuyo villa abrille,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july,noting that the defendants were not involved in the publication or distribution of the allegedly libelous article at issue.in talbot johnson newspaper,for example,a california resident wrote two letters to the president and board of trustees of lawrence university.in the letter,he alleged that his daughter had seen the plaintiff,a school athletic coach,drunk at a fraternity party.id.at,at,at.a newspaper later published one of the letters,which it had received from one of the trustees,and quoted from a telephone interview with the daughter,who was also a california resident.in concluding that new york courts did not have jurisdiction over the father and daughter in a defamation suit brought against them by the coach,the new york court of appeals did not address whether the letters or the telephone call into the state could themselves constitute purposeful activities.instead,it found that even if the daughter attendance at lawrence could qualify as a purposeful activity,jurisdiction would be improper because the cause of action did not arise out of that contact with new york.id.at,at,at.and in american radio association,abell,misc d.county,the court noted that the defendant,the publisher of the baltimore sun,which circulated copies in new york state and derived just over of its advertising revenue from new york,might transact business in new york,but the court concluded that the defamation claim did not arise from any of those contacts,id.at,at.n ot one of the alleged contacts may be relied upon to uphold jurisdiction under the statute since the cause of action alleged in the complaint does not,as is required by statute,arise from any of the acts enumerated.instead,t he acts of publication,of distribution and of circulation which underlie the alleged grievances occurred in baltimore and not here.id.at,at.
section a and case law respecting defamatory websites 
while no new york appellate court has yet explicitly analyzed a case of website defamation under the transact ing business provision of section a,several federal district courts in new york have.consistent with the principles developed in the new york cases discussed above,these courts have concluded that the posting of defamatory material on a website accessible in new york does not,without more,constitute transact ing business in new york for the purposes of new york statute.see realuyo,wl,at,dist.lexis,at deciding that the availability of an article on a website,without more,does not amount to transaction of business for purposes of section a see also starmedia network,star media,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,i t is now well established that one does not subject himself to the jurisdiction of the courts in another state simply because he maintains a web site which residents of that state visit.citation and quotation indication omitted.in addition,to the extent that there are business transactions incident to establishing a website,a defamation claim based on statements posted on a website does not arise from such transactions.see realuyo,wl,at,dist.lexis,at finding that the publication of the article was not the transaction of business in new york and the defamation claim did not arise from advertising links on the website see also competitive,pross,misc d a,wl,at,misc.lexis,at.suffolk county,concluding that libelous statements posted on a message board did not give rise to jurisdiction because they were not in connection with any business transactions.
internet defamation,and analysis under zippo manufacturing company 
in analyzing personal jurisdiction in the internet context,many courts have turned to the standards set out more than ten years ago by a judge of the western district of pennsylvania in zippo manufacturing company zippo dot com.cited by,toys r us,step two,cir calling zippo the seminal authority regarding personal jurisdiction based upon the operation of an internet web site als scan,digital serv.consultants,cir adopting the zippo model cybersell,cybersell,cir citigroup city holding,d.we think that the opinion therefore warrants separate mention here.in zippo,the court applied traditional due process minimum contacts principles to determine whether jurisdiction over the website proprietor was constitutionally permissible.zippo.at citing pennsylvania statute.b,which allows pennsylvania courts to exercise jurisdiction to the fullest extent allowed under the constitution.noting that the likelihood that personal jurisdiction can be constitutionally exercised is directly proportionate to the nature and quality of commercial activity that an entity conducts over the internet,the court explained the spectrum of internet interactivity that many courts have since invoked in determining jurisdiction.
at one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the internet.if the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the internet,personal jurisdiction is proper.at the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an internet web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions.a passive web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.the middle ground is occupied by interactive web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer.in these cases,the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the web site.
id.at citations omitted 
several federal district courts in new york have applied the zippo formulation to website defamation cases in analyzing personal jurisdiction under section a.see citigroup,d at at the very least,the interactivity of the defendant site brings this case within the middle category of internet commercial activity.moreover,the interaction is both significant and unqualifiedly commercial in nature and thus rises to the level of transacting business required under cplr a.realuyo,wl,at,dist.lexis,at declining to exercise jurisdiction over defendant proprietor because its website,on which alleged libel was posted,was passive having email registrants in new york was insufficient to establish jurisdiction under section a.in lenahan law offices,llc hibbs,wl,at,the plaintiff argued that the defendant website,which contained allegedly defamatory material about the plaintiff,fell into the middle range of the zippo sliding scale because the website permitted the defendant to answer questions posted by users.the court rejected that argument,concluding that such interactivity was insufficient to support jurisdiction.absent an allegation that hibbs is projecting himself into new york,this court can not exercise specific personal jurisdiction over him.id.even if such interactivity could constitute transacting business under section a,the court concluded,the plaintiff had failed to show that its cause of action arose from such transactions since the allegedly defamatory material was posted on a passive portion of the website.id.
while analyzing a defendant conduct under the zippo sliding scale of interactivity may help frame the jurisdictional inquiry in some cases,as the district court here pointed out,it does not amount to a separate framework for analyzing jurisdiction.best van lines,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.instead,traditional statutory and constitutional principles remain the touchstone of the inquiry.id.as the zippo court itself noted,personal jurisdiction analysis applies traditional principles to new situations.zippo.at a s technological progress has increased the flow of commerce between states,the need for jurisdiction has undergone a similar increase.quoting hanson,at.internal quotation marks omitted.we think that a website interactivity may be useful for analyzing personal jurisdiction under section a,but only insofar as it helps to decide whether the defendant transacts any business in new is,whether the defendant,through the website,purposefully avail ed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within new york,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.cutco indus.naughton,cir see also deutsche bank,at,at,at determining that there was jurisdiction over a sophisticated institutional trader from montana who knowingly initiat ed and pursu ed a negotiation with plaintiff in new york via instant messaging that culminated in the sale of million in bonds,thus enter ing new york to transact business 
iii.jurisdiction over walker 
to decide this appeal,then,we must determine whether the conduct out of which bvl claim arose was a transact ion of business under section a.in other words,were walker internet postings or other activities the kind of activity by which the defendant purposefully avail ed him self of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,mckee,at,at,at internal quotation marks omitted,and over which the new york legislature intended new york courts to have jurisdiction bvl argues that there are three different factual bases for an affirmative conclusion.
a.the black list report 
bvl first asserts that walker inclusion of a report on bvl in his black list report contained false and defamatory statements about bvl.compl.as we have seen,new york case law establishes that making defamatory statements outside of new york about new york residents does not,without more,provide a basis for jurisdiction,even when
