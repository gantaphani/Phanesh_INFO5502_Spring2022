on june,a notice of hearing was served by mail on.the notice indicated that a master hearing had been set for november.it is undisputed that uncle was not served with either the nta or the notice of hearing.failed to appear at the hearing,and on november,the ij ordered him removed to ecuador.

discussion 
under the principles of chevron,natural resources defense council,d,if a statute is clear on its face,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.fulani fcc,cir quoting chevron,at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting chevron,at.the agency interpretations of ambiguous provisions of the immigration and nationality act are owed substantial deference unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.mardones mcelroy,cir quoting chevron,at.with respect to regulations,the agency interpretations are also entitled to deference and are controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in most cases,a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed within days after the final order of removal is entered,c c i c however,pursuant to b c ii,an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with the immigration and nationality act ina.see also b iii a an order entered in absentia in deportation proceedings may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed a t any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice.
the ina requires that the nta shall be given in person to the alien or,if personal service is not practicable,through service by mail to the alien or to the alien counsel of record,if any.a.the statute is silent with respect to service upon minors however,the corresponding regulations provide that i f the respondent is a minor under the age of,the notice to appear shall be served upon the person or persons specified by a c of this chapter.a.section a c ii,in turn,states that in the case of a minor under years of age,service shall be made upon the person with whom the minor resides whenever possible,service shall also be made on the near relative,guardian,committee,or friend.
section of the regulations is entitled detention and release of juveniles.a juvenile is defined as an alien under the age of years.a.the regulation provides,in relevant part 
juveniles shall be released,in order of preference,to 
i a parent 
ii legal guardian or 
iii an adult relative brother,sister,aunt,uncle,grandparent who is not presently in service detention,unless a determination is made that the detention of such juvenile is required to secure his or her timely appearance before the service or the immigration court or to ensure the juvenile safety or that of others.in cases where the parent,legal guardian,or adult relative resides at a location distant from where the juvenile is detained,he or she may secure release at a service office located near the parent,legal guardian,or adult relative.
if an individual specified in paragraphs b i through iii of this section can not be located to accept custody of a juvenile,and the juvenile has identified a parent,legal guardian,or adult relative in service detention,simultaneous release of the juvenile and the parent,legal guardian,or adult relative shall be evaluated on a discretionary basis.
in cases where the parent or legal guardian is in service detention or outside the united states,the juvenile may be released to such person as is designated by the parent or legal guardian in a sworn affidavit,executed before an immigration officer or consular officer,as capable and willing to care for the juvenile.such person must execute an agreement to care for the juvenile and to ensure the juvenile presence at all future proceedings before the service or an immigration judge.
in unusual and compelling circumstances and in the discretion of the director of the office of juvenile affairs,a juvenile may be released to an adult,other than those identified in paragraphs b i through b iii of this section,who executes an agreement to care for the juvenile and to ensure the juvenile presence at all future proceedings before the service or an immigration judge.
argues that his proceedings should be reopened and his in absentia removal order rescinded pursuant to b c ii and b iii a because he did not receive notice of his removal hearing as required by the statute and regulations.specifically,he argues that because he was only fifteen years old when the notice of hearing was issued,and because his uncle was made to agree in writing to ensure his presence at any future immigration proceedings,his uncle should have been given notice of the hearing as well.
argument finds support in,a ninth circuit case with facts largely similar to those in the present case.relying on the ninth circuit concluded that the ins service of the time and place of the proceedings on only flores himself and not on the adult who took custody of him deprived flores of the effective notice to which he was legally entitled under the statute,at.the court reasoned that t he fair implication of as a whole is that any adult to whom an alien juvenile is released is charged with the dual responsibilities of caring for the ju
