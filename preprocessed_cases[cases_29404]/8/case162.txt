no principle is more firmly embedded in american jurisprudence than this one when a claim is proffered that threatens a person life,liberty,or property,that person is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before a court awards any substantial relief.see mullane cent.hanover bank trust.in federal court practice,this due process guarantee is facilitated by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure a rule regulating service of process.absent waiver or consent,a judgment that is rendered without lawful service of process is null and void.see precision etchings findings,lgp gem,cir.so it is here.
background 
on july,maribel vázquezrobles commenced a civil action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico against her former employer,commoloco.her complaint alleged workplace discrimination claims under the americans with disabilities act,title vii of the civil rights act of,id.to and local law.on august,the plaintiff attempted to serve the summons and complaint by serving prentice hall corporation system puerto rico,prentice,which she believed to be the defendant registered agent for service of process in puerto rico.the defendant denies that prentice was its registered agent at the time,and there is no evidence that prentice ever forwarded the papers to the defendant.
when no answer was filed,the plaintiff moved for,and on september obtained,an entry of default.see.a.the district court later empaneled a jury to liquidate the defaulted claims and the jury again without any notice to or appearance by the defendant awarded the plaintiff in damages.
in march of,the plaintiff procured a writ of execution.with that writ in hand,a deputy united states marshal seized funds equal to the full amount of the judgment from the defendant bank account.the seizure of nearly one million dollars got the defendant attention it immediately moved to vacate the judgment as void,see.b,maintaining that it had no prior knowledge of the action.the plaintiff opposed the motion and,on march,the district court denied it.see vázquez robles commoloco,d.
on the same day,the defendant moved for reconsideration,proffering additional documents.the district court rejected this motion in an unpublished order.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
there is a threshold matter,which can swiftly be dispatched.the plaintiff insists that the defendant submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the district court by filing a notice of appeal without an explicit reservation of its right to contest personal jurisdiction.
it is true,of course,that the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction may be waived by express submission,conduct,or failure to assert the defense.see precision etchings,at.here,however,there was no act or omission that could fairly be said to constitute a waiver.the defendant asserted its jurisdictional defense,clearly and distinctly,in its initial filing in the district court.it persisted in that defense in its subsequent district court submissions.the only rulings made by the district court went to the jurisdictional issue that is,to the efficacy of service of process.
under these circumstances,no reasonable person could doubt that the defendant notice of appeal was meant to continue its previously stated challenge to personal jurisdiction.thus,the notice of appeal simpliciter was sufficient to preserve the jurisdictional defense see trust of,cir holding service of process issue preserved although not specifically mentioned in notice of appeal.
this brings us to the main attraction the district court denial of the motion to vacate the judgment.orders denying rule b motions are normally reviewed for abuse of discretion,see united states v.one star class sloop sailboat,cir,and the plaintiff suggests that this standard obtains here.that suggestion is jejune.where,as here,the raw facts are not legitimately in dispute and a motion to vacate is brought under rule b on the ground that the judgment is void,appellate review is de novo.see esso standard oil rodríguez pérez,cir m k welding,leasing partners,llc,cir.we proceed accordingly.
our obvious starting point is the record as it stood when the district court denied the motion to vacate.the motion papers featured the affidavit of brad chapman,assistant general counsel of the defendant parent company the chapman affidavit.the chapman affidavit vouchsafed that prentice was the defendant registered agent only until april,and that the defendant on that date switched its registered agent from prentice to ct corporation system ct.annexed to the chapman affidavit were two exhibits a resolution of the defendant board of directors removing prentice as the company registered agent and appointing ct in prentice place and stead,and a certification from the secretary of state of puerto rico confirming that this change in the identity of the company registered agent was effectuated on april,at 
as part of its opposition to the motion,the plaintiff tendered a declaration from its process server,yma gonzález marrero the gonzález declaration,describing the steps she had taken in an effort to ensure proper service of process.she asserted that she had looked at the website set up by the department of state of puerto rico,which listed prentice as the defendant registered agent.moreover,she perused the defendant most recent annual report to the department of state covering the year this report listed prentice as the defendant registered agent.
she then contacted the law firm of fiddler gonzález rodríguez fg r,where prentice had an address.some unnamed person there confirmed that prentice was the registered agent for the defendant and that process could be delivered to kenneth bury,presumably a prentice functionary,at fg r offices.gonzález proceeded to serve bury.according to her,bury confirmed that prentice was the defendant registered agent and that he was authorized to receive process on prentice behalf.
with this descriptive backdrop in place,we turn to the applicable law.it is common ground that a judgment rendered in the absence of personal jurisdiction is a nullity.see world wide volkswagen woodson.the existence of such jurisdiction normally depends on legally sufficient service of process.see omni capital int l,rudolf wolff,d.when a defendant seasonably challenges the adequacy of service,the plaintiff has the burden of showing that service was proper.see rivera lópez municipality of dorado,cir.
in the federal courts,service of process is governed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see united,radio mach.workers pleasant,cir.rule h,which deals with service of process on corporations,contemplates service either in a manner consistent with the law of the forum state see.h a,or on an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.h b.in this case,puerto rico law controls the inquiry under rule h a,while federal law controls the inquiry under rule h b.see charles wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.updated.this distinction is largely theoretical in most cases,relevant state and federal practice will be substantially the same,see,and the parties do not suggest that there is a material difference here.
both in this court and in the court below,the parties have argued the efficacy of service in terms of puerto rico law.puerto rico offers a finite number of options for effecting service on a corporation.see laws ann.tit.one such option lies at the epicenter of this appeal a corporation may be served by delivery of process to its registered agent.id.if the registered agent is itself a corporation,that delivery may be made to any one of its enumerated officers.id.
the term registered agent is a term of art that has a meaning under puerto rico law.with respect to corporations chartered in puerto rico,it refers to the requirement that every such corporation must denominate and maintain a registered agent within the commonwealth.see id.that registered agent must be identified in the corporation certificate of incorporation.see id.a.a change in the registered agent identity can be accomplished only by a resolution of the corporation board of directors amending its certificate of incorporation and subsequent filing with the department of state.see id.neither party contends that any other vehicle exists under puerto rico law for effectuating a change of registered agent.
the defendant does not deny that prentice,in the person of bury,was served with the summons and complaint.it argues instead that prentice was not its registered agent at the time,thus rendering the purported service nugatory.the plaintiff demurs,insisting that prentice was the defendant registered agent on the date of service.
the plaintiff position is marred by an inherent contradiction she has offered nothing to dispute that the defendant board of directors resolved to remove prentice as the corporation registered agent and to substitute.nor has she offered evidence to dispute that the documents embodying this change were duly filed with the department of state well over a year before bury was served.the gonzález declaration,on which the plaintiff chiefly relies,speaks to neither of these points,and it is impossible to reconcile the plaintiff insistence that service was proper with her factual proffers.
to be sure,the district court made this leap of logic and concluded that prentice was the defendant registered agent.in its order,the court characterized the gonzález declaration as credible but labeled the chapman affidavit unreliable.vázquez robles,d at.but this ipse dixit can not withstand scrutiny the chapman affidavit,with its attached board resolution and certificate from the secretary of state,resolves the dispositive points and neither of these exhibits is contradicted or impeached by any significantly probative evidence.taking the gonzález declaration as true does not alter this reality because gonzález account sheds no light on the critical facts.
given the state of the record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed clear error,united states gypsum,when it branded the chapman affidavit unreliable and treated the gonzález declaration as affording a basis for upholding service.the two exhibits annexed to the chapman affidavit constituted hard evidence of the legally dispositive issues,and their authenticity was not impugned in any way.this compelling documentary proof belies the district court puzzling statement that the chapman affidavit failed to offer any realistic evidence that prentice was no longer the defendant registered agent at the time of service.vázquez robles,d at.
the plaintiff makes two other arguments in an effort to support the district court assertion of personal jurisdiction.we address them sequentially.
the legal rationale for the plaintiff first argument is not clearly stated,but that rationale appears to implicate the doctrine of apparent agency.under this doctrine,a principal may be bound by a purported agent acts,even in the absence of actual authority,when a third party reasonably believes the agency relationship to exist and that reasonable belief can be traced to the principal manifestations.see,ophthalmic surgeons,paychex,cir restatement third of agency see also grajalesromero am.airlines,cir noting that even though the nomenclature of apparent agency may not always be used in puerto rico law,the essential elements of the doctrine are recognized.this apparent agency argument fails both legally and factually.
from a legal perspective,it is doubtful that the doctrine of apparent agency has any purchase in the context of service of process.see blair city of worcester,cir maiz virani,cir ocasio lozada united states,wl,at,wright et,supra,stating,in the context of serving process on an individual agent,that authority to accept process must either be express or implied.the plaintiff has not cited any precedent that would lead us to conclude that puerto rico follows a different rule.
from a factual perspective,the plaintiff argument is even weaker.after all,it is hornbook law that a n agent authority to act can not be established solely from the agent actions the authority must be established by an act of the principal.fdic oaklawn,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord restatement third of agency.puerto rico law is consistent with this tenet.see grajales romero,at construing puerto rico law.
here,the apparent agency claim rests on the gonzález declaration.but under the rule recounted above,any assurances that gonzález may have received from either bury or the anonymous person with whom she spoke at fg r can not be used to prop up the plaintiff apparent agency claim.
this leaves only the defendant corporate annual report a form filed with the department of state.see laws ann.tit,a.a second lesson drawn from agency law teaches that apparent agency can only be established through a third party belief if that belief is reasonable.see grajalesromero,at construing puerto rico law see also bates ex rel.murphy shearson lehman,cir kansallis fin.fern,cir.viewed through this lens,prentice listing as the registered agent in the annual report does not get the plaintiff very far.
the document bears the title annual report.although it was filed on june,the document purports to describe the state of the corporation affairs for the year.we do not think that the plaintiff could reasonably rely on a statement in this document to pinpoint the identity of the defendant registered agent as of august,the date of service.
the plaintiff other argument builds on the fact that the department of state website,an informal compilation maintained by the department for public convenience,still listed prentice as the defendant registered agent when service was attempted.the record is pellucid that this listing was in error.the mills of government sometimes grind exceedingly slow and,even though the identity of the defendant registered agent had been legally changed on april,it appears that the department of state simply had not gotten around to updating the website.there is not a shred of evidence,however,that this lapse was attributable to any action of the defendant.
against this backdrop,the plaintiff argues that the defendant has an affirmative obligation to police its public records and ensure that all public presentations of its affairs such as the listing on the website are accurate.since the defendant neglected this obligation,the plaintiff thesis runs,the appropriate remedy would be to hold the defendant to the incorrect information here,to treat prentice as if it remained the defendant registered agent.
the plaintiff tries to build this argument around two of our earlier decisions.see senior loiza vento dev,cir hosp.mortg,parque indus.rio canas,cir.in particular,she argues by analogy from a statement that a corporation has a duty to make its address known to the public by maintaining an accurate record with the department of state.hosp,at.this analogy is flawed,and the plaintiff reliance on the two cited decisions is mislaid.
both of our earlier cases dealt with whether the plaintiffs had made sufficient efforts to locate the defendants so as to open the door under puerto rico law for service by publication see senior loiza,at hosp,at.both times,service had been attempted unsuccessfully at the principal places of business reflected in the department of state official records,but both defendants had relocated without informing the department of state.see senior loiza,at hosp,at.we determined that the plaintiffs had made efforts adequate to justify service by publication.see senior loiza,at hosp,at.
the case at hand is a horse of a quite different hue.the two cases relied on by the plaintiff involved defendants who had not informed the department of state of address changes.here,however,the defendant did all that was legally required it executed and filed the paperwork necessary to effectuate a change in its registered agent.see laws ann.tit.consequently,the cases are distinguishable.
in all events,there is good reason to think that the pertinent language from senior loiza and hospital mortgage should be limited to the context of determining what antecedent efforts are satisfactory to allow service by publication.both cases were decided before the supreme court deci
