pro se appellant winoc bogaerts bogaerts or appellant appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york casey,granting a motion by appellee pnl asset management pnl or appellee to dismiss bogaerts appeal from an order of the united states bankruptcy court bohanon,which had purported to dismiss conditionally appellant claims in the underlying adversary proceeding.the district court dismissed the initial appeal for lack of jurisdiction,on the ground that appellant notice of appeal was untimely.because the bankruptcy court had failed to enter a final judgment in the underlying matter,and thus the statutory time to appeal had never begun,we hold that the time to appeal can not be said to have passed.we therefore vacate the dismissal and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
the relevant facts,taken from the district court opinion,are as follows bogaerts and pnl were parties to an adversary proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.the purpose of the proceeding was to determine the priority of mortgages held by bogaerts and pnl on certain real property located in ulster county,new york.when bogaerts failed to comply with various discovery requests,pnl filed a motion to compel discovery.bogaerts did not respond and did not attend the motion hearing.
on july,the bankruptcy court granted pnl motion to compel and entered an order nearly identical to one proposed by pnl requiring bogaerts to provide certain documents to pnl no later than july,to appear for a deposition no later than august,to pay to pnl a discovery sanction no later than july,and to furnish the court,no later than september,with an affidavit certifying that he had complied fully with the order.the order asserted that,if bogaerts failed to complete these actions,any and all claims or of any nature asserted by winoc bogaerts in this adversary proceeding shall be deemed dismissed with prejudice without further order of the court.copies of the order were sent to bogaerts,but were returned by the postal service as unclaimed.
although bogaerts did not comply with the court order,the bankruptcy court apparently did not at that point consider his claims dismissed.instead,on august,it signed and entered a supplemental order which had again been proposed by pnl,setting new deadlines for bogaerts compliance.analogously to the earlier order,bogaerts was to provide certain documents to pnl no later than august,to appear for a deposition no later than august,to pay to pnl a discovery sanction no later than august and to confirm doing so through an affidavit filed with the district court by august,and to furnish the court with an affidavit,no later than august,certifying that he had complied fully with this supplemental order.like the first order,the supplemental order asserted that if bogaerts failed to complete any one of the required actions,any and all claims or of any nature asserted by winoc bogaerts in this adversary proceeding shall be deemed dismissed with prejudice without further order of the court.moreover,the supplemental order specifically noted that regardless whether bogaerts has complied with all of the other provisions of the order,his claims would be deemed dismissed with prejudice without further order of the court if he failed to deliver the sanction payment to pnl by august.
bogaerts again did not comply with the conditions set forth in the order.instead,on september,he filed a notice of appeal with the district court.the notice purported to appeal from an order entered by the bankruptcy court on or before august.bogaerts asserts that he picked august because,on that date,he was told that his case was dismissed with prejudice.he further states that the notice of appeal was timely filed within ten days of my learning of a possible judgment,which the plaintiff attorney classified as final judgment with prejudice.
pnl moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,claiming,inter alia,that bogaerts notice of appeal was not timely pnl argued that,because the rules of bankruptcy procedure require that a notice of appeal be filed with the clerk within days of the date of the entry of the judgment,order,or decree appealed from,fed.a,a timely notice of appeal from the august,supplemental order would have to have been filed no later than august.
in september,the magistrate judge issued a report and a recommendation,concluding that the appeal was not timely and recommending that it be dismissed with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.the magistrate agreed with pnl that appellant should have filed his notice of appeal by august,but conceded that t here is an argument to be made that,in the case of a conditional order such as the one in this case,entry should be deemed to occur either on the date the conditions contained within the order are satisfied or the date when it is no longer possible to satisfy them.nevertheless,the magistrate reasoned that,even under the latter interpretation,the appeal was not timely.as the district court noted,the magistrate determined that bogaerts should have appealed the august,supplemental order by august,or,at the very latest,by august,days after bogaerts failed to comply with the deadline for delivering the required sanction payment to pnl counsel.
in january,the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation,rejecting bogaerts claim that he was confused by the supplemental order.the district court noted that 
the supplemental order explicitly stated that bogaerts claims would be deemed dismissed,regardless of his compliance with any of the other conditions,if he failed to deliver the required sanction payment on or before on august,it is undisputed that bogaerts did not satisfy this directive.thus,by the plain terms of the supplemental order,his claims were dismissed at that time and the appeals period commenced.
the district court then dismissed the appeal,and bogaerts timely appeal to this court followed.
to determine whether bogaerts appeal to the district court was timely,we must ascertain when the time for him to appeal began,and when,if at all,it ended.three provisions of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure inform our inquiry.first,the bankruptcy rules provide for appeal,as a matter of right,from a judgment,order,or decree of a bankruptcy judge to a district court as permitted by a or a.fed.a.the statute referenced in that rule,in relevant part,gives the district courts jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees of the bankruptcy court.a emphasis added.second,as noted earlier,the bankruptcy rules require that a notice of appeal be filed with the clerk within days of the date of the entry of the judgment,order,or decree appealed from.fed.a emphasis added.and third,the bankruptcy rules expressly incorporate rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and require that e very judgment entered in an adversary proceeding or contested matter shall be set forth on a separate document.fed.emphasis added.
considering these rules together,we note that bogaerts could,as a matter of right,appeal to the district court from the bankruptcy judge final order,so long as he filed a notice of appeal within the specified period,and that the period would begin to run on the date that the bankruptcy court final forth in a separate entered.in this case however,the bankruptcy court supplemental order was not final,but conditional.it directed bogaerts to take certain actions.and the ultimate effect of the order,by its own terms,depended on whether or not those actions were completed.
the supplemental order did,of course,purport to be it asserted that,if bogaerts did not comply with its requirements,it would become a final judgment without any further action by the court.given the conditional nature of the order,two questions remain first,whether such an order may be appealed from at all and,second,whether the time for appeal from such an order,if indeed it can be appealed from,may lapse as a result of its on a set date.
appellee cites prior decisions of this court which have held that a conditional order can rip
