before us on appeal is an amended complaint alleging various acts of intimidation and harassment aimed at joanne smith and edward lilly by new york state trooper ben campbell.we affirm that part of the district court order dismissing smith claim for retaliatory prosecution,lilly claim of a violation of his first amendment right to peaceable assembly,and both plaintiffs claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.we vacate and remand,however,the dismissal of plaintiff lilly unlawful seizure claim.
smith alleges in her amended complaint that campbell began harassing her on november,when he tailgated her in an vehicle,spooking her,and causing her to run a yellow light.campbell continued to follow smith until she pulled into the private driveway of a residence from which she was picking up her adult son,tom smith tom.campbell parked behind smith car.he and an local police officer who had been riding with him then approached the vehicle on opposite sides.campbell,now standing outside the driver side window,identified himself as a new york state trooper before he and the local officer began to question smith about her driving,accusing her of running a red light and failing to legally yield at a.
at campbell direction,tom,who had emerged from the house,approached the vehicle and saw that his mother was visibly shaken.tom and campbell exchanged heated words,during which campbell indicated that smith would receive an additional ticket because tom was causing trouble.tom then took out his cell phone and stated that he would call and speak to campbell supervisor.campbell and the local officer immediately left without issuing smith any tickets at that time.
on november,smith and her husband donald smith visited the new york state police barracks where campbell was stationed and complained about campbell conduct.four hours later,campbell appeared at smith home and delivered to her three traffic tickets related to the november incident.
in december and january,smith wrote additional letters to the new york state police complaining of campbell conduct.on january,the state police responded by letter,dismissing her accusations against campbell.on february,officers appeared at smith home suggesting in an intimidating manner that she plead guilty to all of the traffic tickets and that everything would be reduced to a parking ticket as a result.
on july,smith appeared in lewiston town court to challenge all three tickets.campbell acted as prosecutor for the case,as is permitted under new york law.campbell also testified,admitting,among other things,that the tickets were issued partly because tom was making a scene and smith refused to admit she had done anything wrong.smith was convicted on all three tickets.she appealed the town court ruling as to all three tickets.
three days later,on july,while smith appeal was pending,tom remarked at a coffee shop that campbell had been harassing his mother.as pleaded in the amended complaint,this prompted additional retaliation from campbell who,later the same day,appeared at smith home with a second new york state trooper,john pinzotti.upon their arrival,smith,who had been outside playing with her grandchild,called donald and retreated back into the house.donald informed campbell and pinzotti that tom was not home.
at this point lilly,smith,pulled into smith driveway.campbell,recognizing lilly,ordered him to leave.lilly refused to leave and requested that campbell cease harassing his.in response,campbell and pinzotti surrounded lilly,campbell standing within six inches of lilly face and pinzotti standing in very close proximity directly behind lilly.campbell proceeded to yell at lilly,again instructing him to leave but continuing to stand sufficiently close so as to block lilly egress.lilly did not move,believing that the close proximity of the officers was purposeful and an attempt,when coupled with the yelling,to cause lilly to come into physical contact with one of the troopers should he attempt to leave.lilly believed that if he came into physical contact with either campbell or pinzotti he would be arrested and struck by campbell.
lilly told pinzotti that he was only trying to stop campbell harassment of his,prompting pinzotti to walk away.campbell,after making additional comments,followed pinzotti.pinzotti and campbell,who had arrived in separate cars,moved their vehicles.pinzotti parked across the street from smith home.campbell blocked her driveway.
lilly then called to report campbell,and donald,having gone inside and retrieved a camera,began taking pictures.upon donald emergence from the house with the camera,campbell and pinzotti departed.later that day campbell returned,again parking in front of the smiths house.the amended complaint alleges further acts of harassment by campbell that are unnecessary to detail here.
about eleven months later,on june,two of the three tickets issued to smith were dismissed on appeal.
two years later,on june,plaintiffs commenced this suit against campbell.after an initial dismissal with permission to replead,the amended complaint at issue in this appeal was filed.the amended complaint alleges three claims deprivation of rights under,deprivation of rights under fourth amendment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and h.the magistrate judge handling the case construed the amended complaint as alleging four claims a first amendment peaceable assembly claim asserted by lilly,a retaliatory prosecution claim asserted by smith,an unlawful seizure claim asserted by lilly,and an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim asserted by both.the magistrate judge report and recommendation r r recommended granting the motion to dismiss as to the peaceable assembly and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims but also recommended denying the motion as to the retaliatory prosecution and unlawful seizure claims.
defendant filed objections to the r r,arguing that smith first amendment claim was time barred and that lilly allegations related to his seizure did not plausibly allege a fourth amendment violation.in their responsive briefing to defendant objections,plaintiffs neither filed objections to the r r,nor challenged the magistrate judge recommendation that the peaceable assembly and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims be dismissed.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge unchallenged recommendation to dismiss the peaceable assembly and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims,but rejected the recommendation that the retaliatory prosecution and unlawful seizure claims should not be dismissed.the district court held that the retaliatory prosecution claim was time barred because it was filed more than three years after smith received the tickets from campbell.it dismissed the unlawful seizure claim solely on the ground that lilly had improperly identified that claim as arising under the fourth amendment rather than under.this appeal followed.

lilly unlawful seizure claim 
when evaluating lilly claim that he was constructively seized by campbell outside of the smiths house on july,the district court reasoned as follows 
t he court previously dismissed pursuant to.h claims asserted in this action directly under the constitution.if plaintiff lilly has a viable fourth amendment claim,he will have to plead it as a claim,and he has not done so.the amended complaint excludes plaintiff lilly fourth amendment allegations from his claim.plaintiff lilly fourth amendment claim is therefore dismissed with leave to replead.
