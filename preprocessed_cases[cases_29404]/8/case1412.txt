in august,istar financial,istar fired kenneth thomas.a year and a half later,thomas sued istar and one of his supervisors there,ed baron,collectively defendants for various violations of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and parallel provisions of the new york city human rights law nychrl,admin.code et.after a trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,a jury found that thomas termination was in retaliation for complaints he had made about baron,and it awarded compensatory and punitive damages.both sides now appeal numerous issues related to,trial,and proceedings.
thomas appeals from an order of the district court vacating his punitive damages award in the amount of million and offering him a choice between accepting a lesser award of or a new trial on punitive damages.for the purposes of bringing this and other issues forward on appeal,the parties jointly petitioned the district court to reduce thomas punitive damages award as a matter of law without offering thomas the option of a new trial.we need not determine whether the district court was authorized to grant such relief since we read the parties joint submission as effectively stipulating to a new jury trial,the result of which was an award in the reduced amount of,rendering the district court judgment final.our jurisdiction thus established,we affirm the decision of the district court that thomas original punitive damages award was unconstitutionally excessive.additionally,we hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction to correct its clerical mistake without first obtaining leave from this court to do so,but we now grant that leave nunc pro tunc.because the remaining issues raised in both parties appeals are without merit,we affirm the district court judgment in its entirety.
background 
in his complaint,thomas asserted that defendants fired him both because he is african american and in retaliation for complaints he made about racist treatment at istar.he also claimed that,while he was employed,defendants created a hostile work environment.the district court granted summary judgment against thomas on the hostile work environment claim but allowed his discriminatory termination and retaliation claims to go to trial.thomas istar,thomas i,d.a jury subsequently found that defendants were not motivated by racial animus when they fired thomas,but that they did act in retaliation for previous complaints thomas had lodged about baron.it awarded him compensatory damages in the form of,and pain and suffering.the jury also assessed punitive damages against istar in the amount of million dollars,the district court determined that the punitive damages award was unconstitutionally excessive.thomas istar,thomas ii,d.it ordered a conditional remittitur of those damages,id.at,and,after thomas refused to remit his award voluntarily,scheduled a new trial on the issue.before the new trial took place,however,the parties filed a joint submission requesting that the district court directly reduce thomas punitive damages award as a matter of law and without the option of a new trial.the district court agreed and accordingly ordered entry of final judgment against istar in the amount of in punitive damages.thomas istar,thomas ii,d.
the district court also decided to award thomas prejudgment interest on his damages.thomas ii,d at.although thomas argued that the new york statutory interest rate should be applied to calculate that award,the court determined the interest should be calculated using the applicable rate under federal law.id.in a subsequent order related to thomas remittitur of punitive damages,however,the district court erroneously directed the clerk of court to calculate thomas prejudgment interest using the new york rate.order granting joint submission for reduction of punitive damages,dkt.when the district court realized its mistake,it issued a corrected order directing the clerk of court to rescind the earlier judgment and to calculate the prejudgment interest using the federal rate,as set forth in thomas ii.order correcting calculation of prejudgment interest,dkt.by the time the district court took this action,however,thomas had already filed a notice of appeal.notice of appeal,dkt.
ii.discussion 
remittitur of punitive damages 
on september,the district court conditionally granted defendants motion for a new trial under fed civ.a on the issue of punitive damages because it determined that the jury punitive damages award was unconstitutional thomas ii,d at.it ordered that a new trial on punitive damages would be scheduled unless thomas agreed within ten days to remit voluntarily his punitive damages award from million to the maximum amount that the court found to be consistent with the fifth amendment due process requirement.id.before his election period had run,thomas moved pursuant to local civil rule for reconsideration of the district court conditional remittitur order.in the alternative,he sought certification of an interlocutory appeal on the issue.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration and refused to certify an appeal.thomas istar,d,reaffirming the conditional remittitur,the district court scheduled a new trial on the issue of and punitive damages to begin april,unless thomas agreed to remit those awards within the next seven calendar days.id.at.four days later,thomas sent a letter to the district court stating that he declined to accept the remitted amount of damages and elected to proceed to a new trial.order advising parties of new trial scheduled to commence april,dkt.in preparation for the new trial,the district court convened a status conference with the parties wherein it was apparently suggested and agreed that if possible the district court should directly reduce thomas punitive damages award to as a matter of law without providing the option of a new trial.telephone status conference,dkt.the parties then filed a joint submission officially urging the district court to enter judgment in the reduced amount of and offering putative legal authority for it to do so.joint brief,dkt.the submission argued,in essence,that conditional remittitur was unnecessary with respect to thomas punitive damages award because the jury award of punitive damages did not constitute a finding of fact for the purposes of the seventh amendment.id.thomas pledged that if the district court entered final judgment on the punitive damages award along the lines urged in the joint submission,he would accept the remitittur on so that the case could be closed.id.the submission was signed by both parties.id.the district court adopted de facto the joint submission reasoning,entered final judgment for,inter alia,in punitive damages,and closed the case.thomas iii,d,at thomas now appeals the district court decision after trial to vacate the jury punitive damage award.plaintiff appellant cross appellee br.
we write first to address the procedural path and substantive decision by which the district court reduced the jury punitive damages award.
central to our discussion is the seventh amendment of the united states constitution,which provides that no fact tried by a jury,shall be otherwise in any court of the united states,than according to the rules of the common law.with respect to damages,this has traditionally meant that after trial,district courts may not unilaterally reduce awards that are excessive.hetzel prince william,per curiam instead,the procedure consistent with the rules of the common law for revisiting this aspect of a jury verdict is an order for a new trial see gasperini centr.for humanities.alternatively,though it is not required,a district court may give the plaintiff the choice of voluntarily remitting his award to a set lesser amount in lieu of a new trial.id.at.this option have a new trial or voluntarily remit the award is called a conditional remittitur.if the plaintiff accepts the remitted amount and forgoes a new trial,however,the district court order may not be appealed.donovan penn shipping,see also wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure civil i t is now clear that a plaintiff may not appeal the propriety of a remittitur to which he agreed,whether under protest or not.
with respect to remittiturs,the law of this circuit does not distinguish between compensatory and punitive damages.notwithstanding language in cooper industries,leatherman tool group,about the reach of the seventh amendment reexamination clause in the punitive damages context,this court has,since cooper and without discussion of that case provided plaintiffs with the option of a new trial even where a punitive damages award has been deemed excessive.see,fabri united techs.int l,f d,cir punitive damages award vacated on appeal and the issue remanded for entry of a conditional remittitur disorbo hoy,cir compensatory and punitive damages conditionally remitted on appeal see also celle filipino reporter,cir punitive damages conditionally remitted on appeal lee edwards,cir same this has been so even where the punitive damages award has been held unconstitutionally excessive under the factors set forth in bmw of north america,gore.see fabri,at disorbo,at lee,at johansen combustion eng g,cir noting that the tenth and second circuits have continued to require conditional remittiturs in cases of unconstitutional punitive damages and that the constitution does not prohibit this cautious approach.
in any event,we need not determine whether the district court was obligated to present thomas with a conditional remittitur in the circumstances of this case since the result the parties sought to obtain through their joint submission was permissible.by petitioning the district court to enter judgment on thomas punitive damages in the reduced amount of,they were seeking to secure appellate review of the district court underlying determination in thomas ii that the jury award of punitive damages was excessive while at the same time avoiding the risk,time and expense of a new trial.from thomas perspective,unless he could proffer new evidence,would likely be the largest award he could expect the district court to allow following a second trial an event that could also,of course,result in a lesser award.for its part,istar evidently determined that paying in punitive damages should defendants prevail on appeal was worth avoiding the cost and effort of a new trial,even if a new trial held out the possibility of a smaller award.in other words,the parties agreed thomas should be able to appeal the district court holding that an award of million in punitive damages was unconstitutionally excessive if thomas prevailed,he would have that original award reinstated but if,on the other hand,thomas ii was affirmed,istar would pay in punitive damages.
we give force to the parties agreement by construing their joint submission to the district court as a stipulation to the effect that the result of a new trial is a jury award of in punitive damages.judgment is entered on that award,and from that judgment an appeal may be taken.wright,miller kane,supra,at citing deas paccar,cir exercising appellate jurisdiction after plaintiff moved for and received adverse judgment rather than face a new trial,and polymer,borg warner,cir same a party who is willing to gamble on review of a new trial order may be able to win the right to appeal by soliciting entry of an adverse final judgment.donovan prohibition on appeals from accepted remittiturs to the extent a conditional remittitur is required,in the first instance,when the award is one of punitive,rather than compensatory,damages is not implicated because of the defendants role here in structuring the process by which final judgment was entered.
based on our construction of the parties stipulation,we reach the merits of the district court order in thomas ii conditionally remitting the original jury award of million in punitive damages.if we affirm that decision,thomas has already elected a new trial and stipulated to its result if,on the other hand,we determine that million in punitive damages was not unconstitutionally excessive,the original award must be reinstated.for the reasons that follow we affirm.
we review de novo a district court determination of the constitutionality of a punitive damages award.cooper,at.the framework for assessing whether a punitive damages award violates due process is well established.in gore,the supreme court set down three guideposts for courts reviewing such awards the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,citing gore,at.the court has held,however,that p erhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,which reflects the accepted view that some wrongs are more blameworthy than others.gore,at.in assessing the reprehensibility of a defendant conduct,the supreme court has instructed that courts should 
consider whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.
campbell,at.although the type of harm is surely relevant,purely economic harm can merit the imposition of a punitive damages award,see motorola credit uzan,f d,cir,and some courts have noted the relative reprehensibility of intentional discrimination as distinguished from some other forms of purely economic injury,see,zhang am.gem seafoods,cir.
the record in this case supports the district court determination that an award of million in punitive damages was excessive.it is clear that istar conduct did not result in physical injury to thomas,nor did it evince an indifference to or reckless disregard for the health or safety of others.see thomas ii,d at this is not a case involving violence or the threat of violence.crediting the jury verdict,however,leads to the conclusion that istar conduct was at the very least more than merely negligent,and istar may have risked harm to other employees by failing to respond to complaints regarding baron conduct,see id.e vidence was presented at trial that baron had targeted other black employees and that some of those employees did complain with no action being taken.finally,the harm to thomas did not arise from a single discrete act,but occurred over a period of time.at bottom,however,taking all the circumstances of the case into account,istar conduct,though undeniably reprehensible,was insufficiently reprehensible to justify a punitive damages award in significant excess of his compensatory damages award.
prior to the district court remittitur of the compensatory damages award,the original punitive damages award of million resulted in a ratio of approximately.taking into account the court remittitur of thomas compensatory damages award which thomas does not challenge on appeal that ratio rises to approximately.while this ratio is not per se unconstitutional,the supreme court has concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.campbell,at.there are,however,no rigid benchmarks for this analysis,and w hen compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.id.the precise award in any case,of course,must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant conduct and harm to the plaintiff.we agree with the district court conclusion that,taking into account the underlying facts in this case,thomas was awarded a very substantial amount in compensatory damages.thomas ii,d at.this factor weighs heavily in favor of a punitive damages award equal to or less than the remitted compensatory damages award.
