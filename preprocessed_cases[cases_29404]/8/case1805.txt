reliance insurance company ric,a pennsylvania insurance company now in liquidation,appeals from judge wexler dismissal of its claims against polyvision corporation polyvision.ric concededly brought the claim after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.however,it argues that because an identical action had been timely brought in new york state court by reliance insurance company of new york rny a company whose relation to ric is in should be given the benefit of new york savings statute,a mckinney.judge wexler rejected this argument and held that ric claims were.ric appeals that dismissal.
whether ric is entitled to the benefit of section a is a threshold issue,but the outcome is not settled by any applicable new york decision.given the interest of new york in having new york courts resolve this issue,we certify the question to the new york court of appeals.
background 
the new york court of appeals will have the full record on appeal before it,and we will provide only a brief summary of the relevant background.while the history of this case reveals no little confusion,the underlying claim is straightforward.
in,the lindenhurst school board contracted with park industries,park to perform window and curtain wall replacement for several local high schools in suffolk county,new york.in anticipation of issuing construction surety bonds for this project,ric and rny had,in january of,each entered into separate indemnity agreements with park and its subcontractors,sws industries sws and reading company reading.at the time,rny was a subsidiary of ric.ultimately,ric issued a performance bond and a labor and material payment bond insuring park performance of the high school and junior high school construction.rny,on the other hand,never issued any surety bonds on the high school or junior high school projects,but did issue similar bonds with the same lindenhurst school a different elementary school construction project.
in,park and sws both filed for bankruptcy,and ric executed a takeover agreement,assuming responsibility for completing the high school construction project.prior to bankruptcy,sws and park had ordered insulated metal curtain wall panels from greensteel,a division of information display technology,idt,a new york corporation.polyvision,also a new york corporation,is the successor to idt.the greensteel panels were faulty and rusted within months of installation.greensteel claimed the panels were installed improperly,and sold ric replacement panels in and.the new panels,however,also rusted within months,costing ric in replacement and labor costs.
in,rny filed suit against greensteel in new york state court.ric concedes that it,rather than rny,should have been the named plaintiff in the suit,because ric,and not rny,issued the relevant surety bonds.no full explanation has ever been provided for this crucial mistake.whatever the cause,the confusion continued for years,while other complexities emerged.rny filed two amended complaints,in and,the latter being filed in order to reflect a settlement between ric and rny on the one hand and the lindenhurst school board on the other.after ric and rny were placed in liquidation in,the state action was stayed until,whereupon reading attempted to intervene,claiming that a series of assignments had resulted in its inheriting the claim against polyvision,which by this time had become the to greensteel.reading attempted intervention eventually came to naught when it could not adequately demonstrate the alleged transfers of interest.
finally,in,ten years after the original filing,polyvision moved to dismiss on the grounds that rny was not the real party in interest.the state court granted the motion in early,finding that rny parent,ric,actually issued the relevant bond,and that rny has no right to seek indemnification for claims paid out under such bonds.the state court order is marked final disposition,although the court did not use the words on the merits or with prejudice.at no point during the proceedings did ric ever attempt to intervene or be substituted as plaintiff.
discussion 
following dismissal of the state court action,ric filed the present suit in the eastern district.all parties acknowledge that the applicable statute of limitation has long since expired,but ric argues it should be given the benefit of a.that section reads 
a new action by plaintiff.if an action is timely commenced and is terminated in any other manner than by a voluntary discontinuance,a failure to obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant,a dismissal of the complaint for neglect to prosecute the action,or a final judgment upon the merits,the plaintiff,or,if the plaintiff dies,and the cause of action survives,his or her executor or administrator,may commence a new action upon the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences within six months after the termination provided that the new action would have been timely commenced at the time of commencement of the prior action and that service upon defendant is effected within such period.
the parties agree that the action is timely if a applies.the district court held that a was applicable only when it is the same person or entity whose rights are sought to be vindicated in both actions.reliance ins.polyvision,d.it concluded that the plaintiff,ric,was never a party to the dismissed action and therefore may not take advantage of cplr.id.at.
ric argues that the district court erred by finding that it was rny parent and therefore an independent entity.instead,ric contends,the district court should have accepted its claim,purportedly made in its complaint and an accompanying exhibit,that it was rny successor by merger.this claim lacks merit.the accompanying exhibit and complaint,even read liberally,state only that ric assumed rny surety business.however,the transactions at issue here involve ric surety business,not rny surety business.thus,even if the district court accepted as factual the claim that ric assumed rny surety business,it would have made no difference to the outcome because rny never had any interest in this claim,and thus there is no interest to assume or succeed to.
we recognize that the district court considered allegations outside the complaint and its exhibits in resolving the rule b or rule c motion presented to it and did so without explicitly giving notice that it was converting the rule motion to a rule motion.under ordinary circumstances,such consideration is error.see friedl city of new york,cir rule b sellers floor crafters,cir rule c.however,we find no error here because it is clear from the record before us that ric knew additional factual considerations were being considered and,in fact,responded with its own evidentiary submissions.see groden random house,cir excusing failure of explicit notice because,in part,the party had ample opportunity to present evidence outside the pleadings,and in fact he did so.in addition,ric did not object to the procedure the district court used.even if we found error,it must be acknowledged that the error would not disadvantage ric.as we have explained,an allegation that ric assumed rny surety business does not suffice to show that ric and rny are effectively the same party within the meaning of a,or that ric seeks to vindicate rny interests.in any case,ric can succeed only if a applies to actions mistakenly filed in the name of a different,related corporate entity.it is to this question we now turn.

this case therefore turns on the proper interpretation of a and,in particular,whether a different plaintiff can file a second action under a when a related but separate plaintiff erroneously filed the first action.
we have held that t he purpose of a is to avert unintended and capricious unfairness by providing that if the first complaint was timely but was dismissed for curable reasons,the suit may be reinstituted within six months of the dismissal.hakala deutsche bank ag,cir.the new york court of appeals has itself explained that the function of a is to ameliorate the potentially harsh effect of the statute of limitations in certain cases in which at least one
