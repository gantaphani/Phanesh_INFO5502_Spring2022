telenor mobile communications as telenor,a norwegian company,and storm llc storm,a ukrainian company,own kyivstar kyivstar,a ukrainian mobile telecommunications company.a shareholders agreement among the three companies dated january,the agreement sets forth the terms of such ownership and provides that any disputes that arise in connection with the agreement will be submitted to arbitration.the present consolidated appeals result from an arbitration,commenced by telenor,seeking relief for storm alleged breach of the agreement.
this opinion addresses appeal,in which storm challenges a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york the district court gerard lynch,judge granted telenor petition to confirm the arbitral award in its favor and denied storm for vacatur.
on appeal,storm argues that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law in two respects.first,storm contends it was reversible error for the panel to fail to give preclusive effect to ukrainian court judgments concluding that the agreement was not arbitrable because,according to the ukrainian courts,the agent who signed the agreement on behalf of storm was not authorized to do so.in the alternative,storm contends,the panel manifestly disregarded our decision in sphere drake ins.clarendon ins,cir,by failing to require a trial on the arbitrability issue in the district court.we conclude that the panel had colorable reasons for rejecting both arguments and it therefore did not manifestly disregard the law in either respect.storm also contends,on the merits,that the agreement is not arbitrable.we conclude,as did the arbitration panel and the district court,that storm agent had at least the apparent authority to execute the agreement on behalf of storm,and,therefore,that the agreement is arbitrable.
the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.
background 
events prior to 
in,a shareholders agreement dated march,the agreement set forth the terms of the ownership of kyivstar shares.the agreement contemplated the existence of five stakeholders,including telenor and storm.at some point in early,however,telenor and storm agreed to attempt to buy out the other three stakeholders.by august of that year,they had nearly succeeded only omega jsc omega remained.in light of kyivstar newly altered ownership structure and in anticipation of omega eventual capitulation,storm and telenor negotiated an interim voting agreement between themselves the voting agreement,which supplemented and altered their rights and obligations as to each other under the agreement.
the voting agreement was executed on september.valeriy nilov,storm general director,signed for storm.three days earlier,storm had sent telenor a copy of a unanimous resolution by storm shareholders authorizing nilov to do so.see storm llc,notice regarding resolutions adopted by written polling,at authorization of the general director of storm,nilov valeriy vladimirovich,to execute and deliver inter alia,the voting agreement and take or cause to be taken any and all other actions,as are required or desirable in connection with this resolution and the agreements.
the voting agreement contained a promise by each of the parties to execute a new shareholders agreement once storm bought omega shares or the agreement was terminated,whichever occurred first.see voting agreement providing that,within three days after the earlier of either condition,the shareholders,telenor and storm agree to,and to cause kyivstar to,execute and deliver the new shareholders agreement.a form for the contemplated new shareholders agreement was attached to the voting agreement as an exhibit.it was in all substantive respects but provision setting forth the terms of material breach,which was later amended at storm request identical to what would be the agreement.
on october,storm sent telenor a document,signed by nilov,entitled certificate of senior officer of purchaser.the certificate included,among other things,a copy of the storm shareholders resolution authorizing nilov to execute the voting agreement,and minutes of a meeting occurring on october,which confirmed the resolutions adopted by written polling on august.the certificate provided that those documents constitute valid approval under the laws of ukraine of storm execution,delivery and performance of inter alia,the voting agreement and any other documents in implementation of inter alia,the voting agreement.
the agreement 
in january,storm purchased the outstanding kyivstar shares from omega.after negotiations between storm and telenor about possible alteration of the material breach provision of the contemplated new shareholders agreement,a negotiator for storm wrote to telenor by email on january,saying storm reviewed the language of the new shareholders agreement that you distributed yesterday and agreed to it.we are ready to sign it tomorrow.
the following day,nilov and representatives from telenor and kyivstar signed the agreement.storm sent telenor two documents,each entitled certificate of incumbency and authority of storm,which were signed by the chairman of storm and another storm official,respectively.the documents each certified that nilov was duly authorized to sign,on behalf of storm,the shareholders agreement dated january,between and among telenor,storm,omega and kyivstar.unlike the certificate of senior officer of purchaser,however,the certificate s of incumbency and authority of storm did not attach or incorporate by reference copies of documentation of the shareholder authorization.
the agreement contains an arbitration provision stating that a ny and all disputes and controversies arising under,relating to or in connection with this agreement shall be settled by arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators under the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral arbitration rules then in force.agreement a.it precludes any other sort of action in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with this agreement,except for actions in connection with arbitration.id.b.
the arbitration and the ukrainian proceedings 
pursuant to the agreement arbitration provision,telenor instituted an arbitration against storm on february,alleging that storm had breached the agreement by violating its obligation thereunder not to frustrate kyivstar board activities through storm absence violating a noncompete provision therein by acquiring an equity interest in at least one other company engaged in the mobile telecommunications business in ukraine and violating the arbitration provision therein by prosecut ing a series of court actions throughout ukraine,attacking provisions of the shareholders agreement and kyivstar charter.telenor among other relief,a declaration that storm had breached the agreement,an injunction requiring storm to participate in the governance and management of kyivstar,an injunction,and damages.
on april,day of the first conference of the arbitration limited alpren,a subsidiary of altimo holdings investment limited altimo,brought suit in a ukrainian court against storm.alpren and altimo are the owners of storm,and alpren,altimo,and storm all belong to the same russian corporate group,the alfa group consortium.alpren applied to the ukrainian court for a declaration that the agreement was invalid because nilov lacked the authority to execute it on storm behalf.apparently,neither telenor nor the arbitration panel were notified of the alpren lawsuit.
storm retained no counsel and submitted no written defense to the alpren suit.instead,vadim klymenko,an altimo officer responsible for that company litigation and arbitration but who is not an,appeared for storm and registered an oral opposition on the ground that the arbitration panel had jurisdiction over alpren claim.the proceeding lasted approximately minutes.
on april,the ukrainian court concluded that nilov lacked the authority to execute the agreement on behalf of storm.the court decision rendered that agreement null and void in full,including the arbitration clause,from the time of nilov execution of the document.storm appealed.on may,the ukrainian appeals court affirmed.
five days later,storm filed a statement of defense in the arbitration panel arguing,among other things,that telenor claims were not arbitrable in light of the ukrainian judgment.storm also moved before the panel to dismiss the arbitration.on october,the panel issued a partial final award and denied the motion.the panel concluded that it had jurisdiction to determine the agreement arbitrability.it also concluded that the dispute was arbitrable,notwithstanding the ukrainian decision in the alpren suit,because it found that storm and telenor had a clear intent to have their disputes resolved through arbitration,and that the arbitration provision of the agreement was severable and thus not subject to the ukrainian judgment.partial final award.the panel noted that the ukranian court did not address the severability question,because alpren and storm did not present the question to the court and because telenor was never even notified of the proceeding.id.at.
shortly thereafter,storm asked the ukrainian court of appeals to clarify whether,in the court opinion,the arbitration provision of the agreement and the agreement as a whole were invalid in light of the potential severability of the arbitration clause.on november,the court concluded,by now unsurprisingly,that the arbitration agreement was invalid and that any arbitration pursuant to it was in violation of the court prior order.
on november,storm applied in new york state supreme court for an injunction terminating the arbitration proceedings and vacating the partial final award in light of the ukrainian decisions.telenor removed the new york lawsuit to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.storm then made a motion in that forum seeking a preliminary injunction.the district court denied the motion on the grounds that the panel order was interlocutory and therefore not ordinarily subject to appeal,and that storm was unlikely to prevail on the merits.
a ukrainian court then,upon alpren application,enjoined telenor,storm,and klymenko from participating in the arbitration.telenor received no notice of the injunction and was not a party to this new alpren lawsuit.storm twice applied to the arbitration panel to stop the arbitration pursuant to the ukrainian injunction,but the panel denied each application.
in an attempt to put a stop to the ukrainian litigation,telenor applied in these federal district court proceedings for an injunction against storm and its related entities.the district court issued such a temporary restraining order.
following an evidentiary hearing,the district court issued an injunction,writing that there is no doubt that the ukrainian litigation has been designed to,and has had the effect of,interfering in the arbitration process indeed,that it was conducted in the most vexatious way possible and that the court substantially agreed that nilov had at least apparent authority to sign the agreement under either new york or federal law.storm llc telenor mobile commc ns as,civ.gel,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
with the injunction in place,the arbitration hearings continued.storm refused to participate.
on july,the arbitration panel issued a final award,which reaffirmed the partial final award findings in light of subsequent events.see final award.the panel held,as relevant to this appeal,that nilov had both actual and apparent authority under new york law to execute the agreement on storm behalf,see id.at,and that storm was in breach of the agreement in several respects,see id.at.telenor was granted injunctive relief but no damages.see id.at.
the confirmation of the award 
telenor petitioned the district court for a confirmation of the final arbitral award.storm for vacatur.with a lengthy opinion that appears to reflect decreasing patience with storm tactics,telenor mobile commc ns as storm llc,d,the court granted telenor application and denied storm.the court rejected storm contentions that the panel had manifestly disregarded the law by failing to give determinative effect to the ukrainian judgments that the agreement was never executed by storm and thus not arbitrable.after conducting its own independent assessment of arbitrability,the district court concluded that storm had proffered insufficient evidence to warrant a trial on the issue.the court wrote 
storm provided every conceivable assurance to telenor that its signatory officers were empowered to bind it to the agreement.when storm breached the agreement,it was provided with precisely the fair and impartial hearing it had bargained for despite making repeated efforts to renege on its agreement and to torpedo the proceeding by collusive and vexatious litigation.

discussion 
governing legal standardsa.review of arbitral awards under the new york convention 
federal jurisdiction over the final arbitral award in favor of telenor arises from chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,which empowers the federal courts to enforce arbitrations,such as this one,governed by the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,the new york convention or the convention.see the convention shall be enforced in united states courts in accordance with this chapter.id.an action or proceeding under the convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the united states.the district courts of the united states shall have original jurisdiction over such an action or proceeding vaden discover bank,d 
given the strong public policy in favor of international arbitration,review of arbitral awards under the new york convention is very limited in order to avoid undermining the twin goals of arbitration,namely,settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation.encyclopaedia universalis encyclopaedia britannica,cir citation,internal quotation marks,and ellipsis omitted.storm arguments on appeal implicate three types of such limited review.
defenses to enforcement of the arbitral award.pursuant to the new york convention as incorporated by the faa,a district court,upon petition by a party to a qualifying arbitral award,shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the convention.the convention sets forth seven grounds for denial of confirmation,including,of relevance to this appeal,if recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the country in which that relief is sought,new york convention,art.v b 
the party opposing enforcement of an arbitral award has the burden to prove that one of the seven defenses under the new york convention applies.encyclopaedia universalis,at.the burden is a heavy one,as the showing required to avoid summary confirmance is high.id.citations,ellipsis,and internal quotation marks omitted see also zeiler deitsch,cir same.
arbitrability.a dispute is arbitrable only if the parties contractually bind themselves to arbitrate it.see,at t,commc ns workers of,d noting that arbitration is a matter of contract see also first options of chicago,kaplan,d t he arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.a question of arbitrability is therefore raised when,as here,someone asserts that an arbitral award should not be enforced because there was no effective agreement to arbitrate the dispute.
review of arbitrability questions is subject to two important presumptions first,the federal policy in favor of arbitration requires that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues be resolved in favor of arbitration.shaw group triplefine int l,cir quoting moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr,d.second,arbitrability questions are presumptively to be decided by the courts,not the arbitrators themselves.see id.w hen the doubt concerns who should decide arbitrability t he law presumptively favor s judicial rather than arbitral resolution.see also first options,at.we have written that the latter presumption can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence from the arbitration agreement,as construed by the relevant state law,that the parties intended that the question of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator.bell cendant,cir internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted see also shaw group,at 
the presumption that the court should decide arbitrability questions also applies when a party seeks to compel arbitration under the new york convention.see new york convention,art.ii providing that the court shall,at the request of one of the parties,refer the parties to arbitration,unless it finds that the agreement is null and void,inoperative or incapable of being performed.we addressed such a motion to compel in sphere drake,clarendon ins,cir,writing that when the making of the agreement to arbitrate is placed in issue the court must set the issue for trial,so long as the party putting the agreement to arbitrate in issue present s some evidence in support of its claim.id.at quoting interocean shipping shipping trading,cir.depending on the type of claimed inarbitrability,we noted that the party might also be required to make a specific challenge to the arbitration clause.see id.at noting that in setting an arbitrability issue for trial,a party alleging that a contract is void need not challenge the arbitration clause,but a party alleging that a contract is voidable must challenge the arbitration clause in particular see also supra.
manifest disregard.federal courts with jurisdiction to enforce an arbitral award may also consider whether the award was in manifest disregard of the law.see sa animalfeeds int l,cir the boundaries of the manifest disregard concept are not precisely defined,but the term clearly means more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,bobker,cir.a mere demonstration that an arbitration panel made the wrong call on the law does not show manifest disregard the award should be enforced if there is a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached.wallace buttar,cir emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.examples of manifest disregard therefore tend to be extreme,such as explicitly reject ing controlling precedent or otherwise reaching a decision that strains credulity or lacks even a barely colorable justification,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is,in a word,rare to obtain relief from an arbitral award under this doctrine.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the manifest disregard inquiry has three steps 
first,we must consider whether the law that was allegedly ignored was clear,and in fact explicitly applicable to the matter before the arbitrators 
second,once it is determined that the law is clear and plainly applicable,we must find that the law was in fact improperly applied,leading to an erroneous outcome 
third,once the first two inquiries are satisfied,we look to the subjective element,that is,the knowledge actually possessed by the arbitrators.in order to intentionally disregard the law,the arbitrator must have known of its existence,and its applicability to the problem before him.

ii.analysis 
a.the ukrainian judgments 
storm argues that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law governing the preclusive effect of foreign judgments when it failed to give such effect to the ukrainian court judgments holding that the agreement was never executed by storm and is therefore not arbitrable.storm also argues that its compliance with the arbitral award as enforced by the district court would entail actions that would place it in contempt of the ukrainian courts,contrary to new york public policy.
manifest disregard.
in ackermann levine,cir,we reiterated the rule that 
a final judgment obtained through sound procedures in a foreign country is generally conclusive as to its merits unless the foreign court lacked jurisdiction the judgment was fraudulently obtained or enforcement of the judgment would offend the public policy of the state in which enforcement is sought.
id.at emphasis in original.storm contends that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded this rule by failing to give conclusive weight to the ukrainian judgments that the agreement is not arbitrable 
the district court disagreed.it concluded that the judgments obtained by alpren against storm had contravened the rule against friendly litigation,see lord veazie,how.concluding that such litigation results in a judgment which is a mere form and is therefore a nullity.the district court remarked that it and the arbitration panel had both previously found the alpren litigation to have been collusive.telenor,d at.the district court also concluded that the ukrainian proceedings had afforded telenor no notice or opportunity to be heard prior to the entry of the judgment,and that they were intended to undermine a possible confirmation of an award in telenor favor.id.at.in light of those conclusions,the court found that the ukrainian procedures were not sound for ackermann purposes and therefore not binding on the arbitration panel.id.at.
storm argues that the arbitration panel did not actually find that the ukrainian actions by alpren were collusive.to be sure,the panel did not employ the word collusive in its partial or final award.but the panel does mention,repeatedly,that the alpren litigation was conducted among related corporate entities,see,final award as previously noted,alpren and storm were under the direct or indirect control of altimo,and the ultimate control of alfa,without notice to or appearance by telenor,see,id.at telenor had no notice of the ukrainian proceedings until after the order of the ukrainian appellate court id.t he ukrainian court proceedings came as a surprise to both the tribunal and to telenor.the panel repeated observations along these lines make clear that the panel considered the ukrainian proceedings to have been collusive,even though the panel understandably elected to avoid using that term in relation to proceedings before a duly constituted foreign court.see id.at noting that the panel had previously made clear that it was not ignoring the decisions of the ukrainian courts or impugning the integrity of those courts or their decisions.
politic or not,in light of the strong presumption that an arbitration tribunal has not manifest ly disregarded the law,westerbeke,at,the panel multiple references to the and ex parte nature of the alpren litigation supply a sufficiently colorable justification for its refusal to give the ukrainian judgments controlling weight.motorola credit uzan,cir affirming denial of comity to injunctions entered by turkish courts that were the product of collusion.
storm does not seriously dispute that the alpren litigation was a cooperative venture among allied interests it argues,instead,that storm had no contact with its adversary during the litigation,that it presented a defense in the proceedings,and that it appealed.appellant br.but these assertions,if true,would not refute the panel finding of collusion on the facts of this case and would not be a basis upon which the district court was required to overturn that finding.the panel was not obliged to interpret storm decidedly modest efforts in the alpren suit to be material or meaningful 
moreover,the force of the ukrainian judgments as against telenor is further reduced by the fact that telenor was not a party to the alpren litigation and was continually denied notice of the proceedings.final award see also id.at,telenor,d at.the failure of the ukranian cour
