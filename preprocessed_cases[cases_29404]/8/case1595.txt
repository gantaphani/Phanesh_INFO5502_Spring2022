carlos bustamante appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york mcmahon,granting motion to dismiss the complaint as moot.b provides that a naturalization applicant can bring a petition to the district court when united states citizenship and immigration services uscis has not decided the application for more than days after the initial examination of the applicant.the district court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter,with appropriate instructions,to the service to determine the matter.b.in this case,the district court ruled that uscis could still decide bustamante naturalization application after he filed a section b petition.since uscis denied bustamante application,the district court deemed this section b action moot.
the issue on this appeal is whether uscis can still decide a naturalization application after an applicant files a section b petition in district court.we conclude that only the district court has jurisdiction to determine a naturalization application when,after uscis has failed to adjudicate the application within days of the initial examination,the applicant files a section b action.although a properly filed section b petition removes uscis power to decide the naturalization application,uscis still can recommend a disposition to the district court or request a remand for the agency to determine the application.it is incumbent upon the district court,however,to determine the matter or remand the matter.b.because uscis did not have the power to adjudicate the application after bustamante filed a section b action with the district court,this action is not moot.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court.
background 
bustamante,a native of mexico,has been a lawful permanent resident lpr since.in,years after becoming an lpr,bustamante filed a naturalization application on the grounds that he was an lpr residing in the united states for at least five years and showed good moral character during the period preceding his application on february,he was interviewed by a uscis officer.
section b provides 
if there is a failure to make a determination under section of this title before the end of the period after the date on which the examination is conducted under such section,the applicant may apply to the united states district court for the district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter.such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter,with appropriate instructions,to the service to determine the matter.
b.on july,without a decision from uscis more than days after his initial interview,bustamante filed a section b petition in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,seeking to have the court hold a hearing on his application and either grant the application or remand it to uscis with an instruction to grant it.
on august,after bustamante filed his section b petition,uscis denied bustamante application based on his involuntary manslaughter conviction for his involvement in a fight that resulted in a person death.though the conviction occurred outside the statutory period and the record does not contain reference to other offenses,uscis determined that bustamante failed to show good moral character based on the conviction in its denial,uscis informed bustamante that he could request a hearing on the decision within days.bustamante did not seek a hearing.defendants then brought a motion to dismiss the section b petition as moot based on uscis denial of the application.bustamante countered that uscis denial of the naturalization application had no legal consequence because the filing of the section b petition divested uscis of jurisdiction.
on january,the district court issued an order granting defendants motion.see bustamante chertoff,d.on february,the district court entered an amended order granting the motion.the district court held that section b does not divest cis of jurisdiction over a pending naturalization application.id.at.the district court reasoned that t he statutory language does not explicitly vest the district court with exclusive jurisdiction,and that a decision by uscis does not divest a district court of jurisdiction because nothing can prevent an aggrieved applicant from going to the district court for final de novo review,id.at,a reference to the naturalization applicant right to appeal an adverse uscis decision once internally and then to a district court.see c.based on its determination that uscis had the authority to deny bustamante application after the section b petition was filed,the district court ruled that uscis denial mooted the section b petition.
bustamante timely appealed.
discussion 
this case presents a question of first impression for our court whether a properly filed section b petition divests uscis of jurisdiction over a naturalization application a divided panel of the fourth circuit and unanimous in banc panel of the ninth circuit have answered the question in the affirmative.etape chertoff,cir united states hovsepian,cir in banc we agree that only the district court has jurisdiction over a naturalization application once an applicant files a proper section b petition.see etape,at hovsepian,at.
i.the text of section b 
s tatutory analysis necessarily begins with the plain meaning of a law text and,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.puello bcis,cir quotation marks omitted.the language of section b expressly states that,when a naturalization applicant requests a hearing before the district court on a pending application that uscis has not decided for more than days after the initial examination of the applicant,the court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter,with appropriate instructions,to the service to determine the matter.b.this language clearly grants the district court jurisdiction over the naturalization application.see in re am.preferred prescription,cir jurisdiction concerns a court authority to make any ruling on the merits of an issue.the issue as framed by the parties is whether the court jurisdiction under section b is exclusive.
the district court jurisdiction under section b vests with a naturalization applicant petition for a hearing in the absence of a timely decision by uscis.uscis has jurisdiction to adjudicate a naturalization application during the period up to days after the initial examination of an applicant.uscis also retains jurisdiction beyond the period following the initial examination as long as a naturalization applicant does not file a section b petition.see b.if uscis does not render a decision for more than days after the initial examination,section b provides for judicial intervention at the election of the naturalization applicant.the authority granted to the district court by section b to determine the merits of the application or to remand the application to that a properly filed section b petition vests jurisdiction in the district court and divests uscis of its jurisdiction to decide the application.see id.b.
the government contends that uscis retains authority to decide a naturalization application after a section b petition is filed.it would be illogical,however,for congress to vest the district court with jurisdiction to determine the matter upon the filing of a section b petition,see b,but permit uscis to have simultaneous authority to decide the application,see etape,at nothing in the statute suggests that congress intended that an agency could subvert congress choice to vest the district court with jurisdiction to determine the matter once an applicant files a timely b petition.quoting b hovespian,at how can the court determine the matter if the ins has the option to determine the matter,too,and essentially force the court to accept its view if congress had intended the ins to retain power to make a naturalization decision even after the district court acquires jurisdiction,why would the statute expressly give the district court the option to decide the matter.
