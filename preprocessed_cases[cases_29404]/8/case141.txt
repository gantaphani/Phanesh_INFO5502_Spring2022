this appeal arises out of a putative class action against forest pharmaceuticals,the manufacturer of lexapro,an antidepressant medication.plaintiffs claim that lexapro drug label misleads california consumers by omitting material efficacy information,in violation of california consumer legal remedies act clra,cal.et,false advertising law fal,cal.bus.et,and unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus.et.the district court dismissed these claims,finding them barred by california safe harbor doctrine.see in re celexa lexapro mktg.sales practices litig.marcus forest,nmg,wl.march.see generally cel tech commc ns,cellular,cal th,d,outlining california safe harbor doctrine.
expressing no view on the california safe harbor doctrine applicability here,we instead find that federal law impliedly preempts these claims because the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,prohibits forest from independently changing its label as plaintiffs claim california law requires.see pliva,mensing,d.therefore,we affirm the judgment dismissing the complaint.
background 
lexapro belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.forest also manufactures celexa,a drug with a chemical composition closely related to lexapro.in,the fda first approved lexapro to treat adults for depression.in,forest sought fda approval for the use of lexapro to treat major depressive disorder in adolescents.
fda drug approval process 
the fda drug approval process is onerous and lengthy.mut.pharm,bartlett,d.the fdca requires that drug manufacturers gain fda approval prior to marketing or selling a drug in interstate commerce.see a.to gain fda approval,a drug manufacturer must submit either a application nda,for a new drug,or a supplemental application snda,for a new treatment.see et.ndas and sndas are subject to the same approval requirements.see id.the nda or snda must include full reports of all clinical investigations which have been made to show whether such drug is effective in use.b a.the fda may only approve the drug if the nda or snda provides substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it is represented to have.id.d.as part of its showing that it has provided such substantial evidence,a manufacturer submits the results of adequate and investigations,including clinical investigations,by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved.id.d.
in its evaluation of an nda or snda,the fda has discretion to determine that data from one adequate and clinical investigation,along with other confirmatory evidence,are sufficient to establish effectiveness.see c the fda is required to exercise its scientific judgment to determine the kind and quantity of data and information an applicant is required to provide for a particular drug to meet the statutory standards.the fda will not approve a drug if the nda or snda lacks substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have.d.
the drug manufacturer must also submit the labeling proposed to be used for such drug.id.b f c i.the application must include the proposed label text with annotations to the information in the drug application that support the inclusion of each statement on the label.c.c i.in order to approve an nda or snda,the fda must determine,based on a fair evaluation of all material facts,that the proposed label is not false or misleading in any particular.d b.after approval,the manufacturer may distribute the drug without violating federal law as long as it uses the label.see c,a,a,c.
in an effort to secure fda approval to sell lexapro for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents,forest submitted to the fda the results of four studies celexa study,celexa study,lexapro study,and lexapro study.celexa study and lexapro study showed no efficacy.celexa study and lexapro study found positive efficacy that was statistically significant,but only barely so.in march,the fda nevertheless approved the sale of lexapro to treat major depressive disorder in adolescents based on a finding that substantial evidence supported the efficacy of that use.in making this finding,the fda extrapolate d on the basis of a previously reviewed positive study with celexa,along with the positive statistical efficacy results from lexapro study.as required by the fdca,in approving the snda,the fda made a specific finding that lexapro label was not false or misleading in any particular.d b.that approved label included the following 
clinical studies,major depressive disorder adolescents 
the efficacy of lexapro as an acute treatment for major depressive disorder in adolescent patients was established in an week,study that compared lexapro to placebo in outpatients to years of age inclusive who met dsm iv criteria for major depressive disorder.the primary outcome was change from baseline to endpoint in the children depression rating scale revised cdrs r.in this study,lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the cdrs 
the efficacy of lexapro in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents was established,in part,on the basis of extrapolation from the week,study with racemic citalopram,celexa.in this outpatient study in children and adolescents to years of age who met dsm iv criteria for major depressive disorder,citalopram treatment showed statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline,compared to placebo,on the cdrs r the positive results for this trial largely came from the adolescent subgroup.
two additional,mdd studies one lexapro study in patients ages to and one citalopram celexa study in adolescents did not demonstrate efficacy.
although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients has not been systematically evaluated,maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.
changing the label 
there are two ways pertinent to this lawsuit in which a manufacturer of a brand name prescription drug can change the drug label.first,the default rule is that a manufacturer must secure fda approval for a proposed change prior to distributing the product with the changed label.b v a.second,under what is known as the changes being effected cbe regulation,id.c iii,a manufacturer can make certain types of changes to its label,without prior fda approval,by sending the fda a supplement submission.
to make a change under the cbe regulation,the manufacturer must satisfy at least two requirements.first,the change must reflect newly acquired information.see also id.b defining newly acquired information.second,the change must be for the purpose of accomplishing at least one of the five following objectives 
a to add or strengthen a contraindication,warning,precaution,or adverse reaction for which the evidence of a causal association satisfies the standard for inclusion in the labeling 
b to add or strengthen a statement about drug abuse,dependence,psychological effect,or overdosage 
c to add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product 
d to delete false,misleading,or unsupported indications for use or claims for effectiveness or 
e any labeling change normally requiring a supplement submission and approval prior to distribution of the drug product that fda specifically requests be submitted under this provision.
c.the complaint 
according to the complaint,in april,randy and bonnie marcus,the plaintiffs,purchased lexapro to treat their adolescent son depression.based on their reading of lexapro label,they and their son physician overestimated lexapro effectiveness.as a result,they spent money purchasing a drug that they describe as no more clinically effective than a placebo.on behalf of all other californians who purchased lexapro for an adolescent from march until present,they claim that forest pharmaceuticals omitted material efficacy information,in violation of california state consumer protection laws the clra,fal,and ucl.
the clra prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts that result in the sale of goods to any consumer.cal.a.the complaint alleges that forest violated four different provisions of the clra,specifically a misrepresenting the source,sponsorship,approval,or certification of goods or services.a representing that goods or services have sponsorship,approval,or benefits,which they do not have a representing that goods are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,if they are of another.and a advertising goods with intent not to sell them as advertised.the fal prohibits companies from disseminating untrue or misleading statements.cal.bus.and the ucl prohibits unfair or fraudulent business act s or practice s and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.id.
in support of these state law claims,the complaint takes issue with the fda accept ance of the questionable data from lexapro study and the flawed data from celexa study to conclude that forest met its regulatory requirement of providing two studies showing that lexapro was effective for the treatment of adolescent depression.expressing displeasure with federal law as well as the fda,the complaint further notes that the fda standards for approving antidepressants are minimal according to the law.
the complaint gives a different read to celexa study than did the fda experts,who found that the study showed a statistically significant difference between celexa and a placebo for an acute treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents.the complaint disagrees,and asserts instead that a close evaluation of the unpublished version of celexa study reveals that data was manipulated to create the appearance of statistical significance.in sum,the complaint characterizes celexa study results as fraudulent and misleading.
the complaint also reads lexapro study differently than did the fda experts,who found that this study also showed a statistically significant difference between lexapro and placebo for an acute treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents.as with celexa study,the complaint questions the study finding of statistical significance,and underscores the fact known to the fda at the time of approval that the difference indicated is not clinically significant.
based on the foregoing,the complaint argues that the drug label for lexapro is misleading and inadequate.in its prayer for relief,plaintiffs request that the court p ermanently enjoin forest from continuing to sell or market lexapro with its current drug label and direct forest to seek fda approval of a new drug label.although the complaint contains general allegations of deceptive marketing,and quotes a press release from forest plaintiffs who seek to represent a class hinge their claims and the relief they seek on their challenge to the adequacy of the efficacy discussion in the label.for example,plaintiffs allege that forest misconduct was uniformly directed at all consumers and their prescribing healthcare professionals in california through the use of a misleading drug label.thus,all members of the class have a common cause of action plaintiffs then allege that the question of forest conduct,whether the drug label was misleading,predominates over any individual issues.
procedural history 
randy and bonnie marcus filed the complaint in may,seeking class certification,in the central district of california.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation subsequently transferred the case to the district of massachusetts as part of ongoing multidistrict litigation,in re celexa and lexapro marketing and sales practices litigation,mdl nmg.forest moved to dismiss,relying on fdca preemption and california safe harbor doctrine.while both parties fully briefed forest federal preemption defense,the district court did not reach it,relying instead on its conclusion that the complaint failed under california safe harbor doctrine.
ii.standard of review 
we give de novo review to the district court grant of forest motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.see,cooper charter commc ns entm ts i,llc,cir.we accept as true all facts in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.id.
iii.analysis 
in deciding whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted,we are urged by plaintiffs to restrict our inquiry to determining whether the safe harbor doctrine under california law defeats plaintiffs claims.hornbook principles of appellate procedure,however,grant us discretion to rely on any basis made apparent in the record for affirming a district court decision,debnam fedex home delivery,cir.
in moving to dismiss,forest relied upon not just the california safe harbor doctrine,but also on principles of federal preemption.the parties briefed the federal preemption issue in the district court.on appeal,forest repeats that argument,urging that we may affirm on that ground.plaintiffs in response concede that unpacking how federal law interacts with state law is key to applying california safe harbor doctrine.we agree.it therefore makes more sense to look first at this question of federal law rather than skipping forward to figuring out or certifying to california supreme court the question of whether california safe harbor doctrine would shield forest even if federal law did not preempt the california consumer protection claims 
the united states constitution supremacy clause provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.where state law requires a private party to violate federal law,that state law is without effect.bartlett.at internal quotation marks omitted.federal law impliedly preempts state law where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.id.quoting english,d see also freightliner myrick,d noting that conflict also applies where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs complaint seeks to impose liability on forest because of what lexapro label states or fails to state.in other words,as the complaint reads,forest would need to change lexapro label in order to avoid liability under state law.
in two recent cases,the supreme court has addressed how principles of federal preemption apply to such claims.see pliva,d wyeth levine,d.we turn to these opinions to find the preemption rules that guide our decision here.
in wyeth,a jury found a brand name drug manufacturer liable under vermont law for what the jurors deemed to be an inadequate warning of risks in an label.at.in rejecting the manufacturer preemption defense to liability under vermont law,the court pointed to the cbe regulation,which both reflects the manufacturer ultimate responsibility for its label and provides a mechanism for adding safety information to the label prior to fda approval.id.at.thus,when the risk became apparent,wyeth had a duty under federal law to provide a warning that adequately described that risk,and the cbe regulation permitted it to provide such a warning before receiving the fda approval.id.based on these observations,the court found that a state law effectively penalizing the manufacturer for not having exercised its federally sanctioned ability to improve the label under the cbe regulation was not preempted.id.at.
two years later,the supreme court distinguished wyeth in sustaining a preemption bar to the imposition of tort liability on a generic drug manufacturer for failure to add a warning of a risk to its label.pliva.at.the court observed two differences in the federal drug labeling duties that applied to generic manufacturers as compared to brand name manufacturers.id.at.first,a generic manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is the same as the brand name.id.second,the cbe process was not open to generic manufacturers.id.at.therefore,the generic drug manufacturer in pliva could not have changed its label without prior fda approval,which it could only have obtained by proposing that the fda require a change in the c
