on appeal,argues principally that the district court erred by approving the settlement of the shareholders derivative litigation brought on behalf of dhb industries,against a number of its former officers and directors because the settlement agreement impermissibly releases and indemnifies dhb former chief executive officer and chief financial officer against all liability arising under of the act,we agree.
background 
we recount only such facts as are necessary to explain our decision.in the fall of,dhb industries,dhb stock price plummeted following revelations that the body armor manufactured by the company contained an inferior material prone to rapid deterioration.numerous derivative and class action lawsuits were subsequently filed against dhb and a number of its former officers and directors.in january,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seybert,consolidated the derivative actions and class actions and appointed derivative counsel and class counsel.the settlement of the consolidated derivative action the settlement is the subject of this appeal,though the settlement is a joint settlement that settled both the consolidated derivative action and the consolidated class action.
in the district court,david cohen and the department of justice civil litigation division doj,in consultation with the securities and exchange commission sec,doj and sec collectively,the united states,presented objections to the settlement.as relevant to our decision,cohen and the united states objected to the provisions in which dhb agreed to release david brooks,dhb former chairman and chief executive officer ceo,and dawn schlegel,dhb former chief financial officer cfo,from any liability under of the act sox,and to indemnify them against any liability they may incur under over these objections,on july,the district court entered final judgment approving the settlement.the court subsequently entered an order granting derivative counsel application for attorneys fees and rejecting cohen application for attorneys fees.this appeal followed.
procedural history 
it was in december that the district court was first presented with the proposed settlement,which had been agreed to by derivative counsel,class counsel,the named defendants,and dhb.the following month,cohen moved to intervene in the consolidated class and derivative actions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a and,inter alia,objected to preliminary approval of the proposed settlement.cohen subsequently filed a memorandum of law in opposition to that approval and,in may,appeared at a court hearing held to review it.the court made a preliminary finding in favor of the settlement and subsequently entered an order to that effect.
in september,cohen filed objections to final approval of the settlement.
on october,dhb filed restated financial statements for,and the first three quarters of.three days later,on october,the doj petitioned the district court pursuant to the class action fairness act,et,for an extension of time to evaluate the proposed settlement.
the following month,the united states filed objections to the settlement,principally on the grounds that it i limited the remedies available to the government in pending criminal cases against the individual defendants,and ii undermined efforts by the sec to hold the individual defendants liable for disgorgement under.in letters to the district court in december and june,the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york expressed concern regarding its ability to seek restitution in connection with pending criminal cases and noted that brooks contribution to the settlement was funded at least in part with the proceeds of insider trading.
in response to the united states objections,the settling parties offered to add the following language to the settlement nothing contained in this settlement is intended to limit the united states ability to pursue forfeiture,restitution or fines in any criminal,civil or administrative proceeding.brooks conditioned his acceptance of the proposed language on the addition of the phrase except that of the settlement shall remain in full force and effect,thus seeking to ensure that brooks and schlegel were indemnified against liability under.see,supra.cohen and the united states continued to object to the settlement.
in june,the district court held a hearing for final approval of the settlement.cohen and the united states each appeared in opposition to the settlement,and each reiterated the objections relating to.as already noted,the court granted final approval of the settlement,and on july,entered final judgment to that effect.paragraph twelve of the final judgment provides that the settlement includes a new paragraph,which states,in part,that n othing contained in this stipulation is intended to limit the united states ability to pursue forfeiture,restitution or fines in any criminal,civil or administrative proceeding,except that paragraph of this stipulation regarding indemnification for liability shall remain in full force and effect.
related actions 
on august,the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york filed a criminal indictment against schlegel dhb former cfo and sandra hatfield dhb former chief operating officer on charges that they inflated corporate earnings and profit margins,and then profited on those inflated earnings through the sale of dhb stock.united states dawn schlegel,et,no.the next day,on august,the sec filed a civil complaint against schlegel and hatfield in the southern district of florida based on the same underlying acts as were charged in the criminal matter.sec dawn schlegel,et,no.

discussion 
on appeal,cohen principally asserts that the district court erred by approving the settlement,awarding attorneys fees to derivative plaintiffs counsel,and denying his application for attorneys fees.because we hold that the indemnification and release provisions of the settlement violate,our discussion is limited to that single issue,and we decline to address the remaining issues argued on appeal.
as a preliminary matter,we note there is no merit to the suggestion that cohen waived any objection to the settlement indemnification of brooks against liability on the grounds that indemnification is violative of and public policy.as already noted,cohen repeatedly raised objections on these grounds to the district court.appellees argument that cohen objections were untimely is precluded,moreover,as this argument was not made in the district court,and appellees do not assert that it is necessary that we nevertheless consider the argument to serve an interest of justice.gibeau nellis,cir quoting ebker tan jay int l,cir friendly.
standard of review 
although the district court normally has discretion to approve a settlement,we may review that court decision de novo where an appellant challenge to the authority of the district court to approve the settlement raises novel issues of law.gerber mtc techs,cir.this is such a case.we have not,and indeed no court has,yet addressed whether by private agreement parties may indemnify a ceo or cfo against liability imposed by.
sox section 
before reaching the ultimate,whether the settlement provisions releasing and indemnifying dhb former ceo and cfo against liability imposed by violate that must first determine whether provides a private cause of action.if it does,the sec would have no claim that the settlement usurps its sole authority to exempt persons from liability.see b.
the ninth circuit,the only other court of appeals to have directly confronted the issue,has held that no such private right of action exists.see in re digimarc.der
