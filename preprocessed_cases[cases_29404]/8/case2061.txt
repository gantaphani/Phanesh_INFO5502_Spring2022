this appeal concerns a district court authority to act in a case that was initially removed from a state court,pursuant to,because it was related to a bankruptcy case,and then remanded back to the state court because the district court determined that mandatory abstention applies.the specific issue is whether,after such a remand,the district court may enjoin a party in the remanded debtor in the pending bankruptcy asking the bankruptcy court to stay the remanded state court action.this issue arises on an appeal by covanta onondaga limited partnership covanta from the september,order of the district court for the northern district of new york howard munson,district judge,granting a permanent injunction sought by the onondaga county resource recovery agency ocrra.we conclude that the injunction must be vacated.
background 
the origin of the pending appeal is a waste disposal agreement entered into by covanta and ocrra in.covanta operates a municipal waste incinerator in jamesville,on property leased to it by ocrra.in february,ocrra notified covanta that the agreement between the parties was terminated by reason of covanta alleged breach of the agreement requirement concerning maintenance of adequate credit.on march,covanta filed a suit in the new york supreme court the state court seeking a declaratory judgment that ocrra was not entitled to terminate the parties agreement the state court case on march,ocrra filed an answer asserting numerous defenses and seeking a judgment declaring,among other things,that ocrra properly terminated the parties agreement.
on april,covanta filed a voluntary petition under chapter in the bankruptcy court of the southern district of new york bankruptcy court.chapter petitions were simultaneously filed by covanta parent company and related companies.on april,covanta filed in the district court for the northern district the district court or northern district a notice of removal of the state court case pursuant to and rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.on april,covanta filed in the northern district a motion to transfer the removed case to the southern district of new york so that it could be referred to the bankruptcy court in the southern district.
also on april,ocrra filed in the northern district a motion to remand the state court case to the state court,or,in the alternative,to have the district court retain jurisdiction and adjudicate the action.remand was sought on the ground that the criteria for mandatory abstention specified in c were met.on august,ocrra filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court.on august,the district court granted ocrra motion and remanded the state court case to the state court.covanta onondaga limited partnership onondaga county resource recovery agency,covanta remand.the district court agreed with ocrra that mandatory abstention was required by subsection c and remanded,apparently using the remand authority conferred by b.on august,ocrra notified the district court that it had filed a proof of claim with the sdny bankruptcy court earlier that month and apologized for not previously informing the court.
on september,covanta filed an adversary proceeding against ocrra in the bankruptcy court seeking,among other things,a declaration that the automatic stay of applied to the state court case,or,in the alternative,an injunction under a to prevent ocrra from further prosecuting the state court case pending confirmation of a plan of reorganization.covanta also sought an injunction under section a,apart from the pendency of the adversary proceeding.
on september,ocrra moved in the northern district for a temporary restraining order tro,which was issued that same day.the tro prohibited covanta and the bankruptcy court from proceeding with covanta adversary proceeding and with covanta motion,filed in that proceeding,for section or section a relief.on september,the district court continued the tro after a hearing.on september,the district court issued the permanent injunction that is the subject of the pending appeal.covanta onondaga partnership onondaga county resource recovery agency,covanta injunction.that injunction prohibits covanta from proceeding in the bankruptcy court with the adversary proceeding and the motion contained within it,and from instituting any further action or proceeding in the bankruptcy court or in any other court against any party regarding the application of the automatic bankruptcy stay to this case,id.at,presumably referring to the state court case.covanta motion for interim injunctive relief pending appeal was denied by the district court and initially denied by this court,without prejudice to renewal before the merits panel.on december,after oral argument,we entered an order maintaining the status quo,pending this appeal,by barring ocrra from proceeding with the state court case and barring covanta from seeking relief in the bankruptcy court with respect to the state court case.
discussion 
the parties have framed the issue on appeal primarily in terms of whether the district court exceeded its discretion under the all writs act,a,by issuing the permanent injunction.although that issue inheres in the appeal,we initially consider whether the district court had jurisdiction to issue the injunction after it had relinquished jurisdiction over the removed state court case by remanding it to the state court.in seeking injunctive relief,ocrra invoked only section a,which authorizes federal courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.however,it is well settled that the all writs act is not an independent source of a federal court jurisdiction.see united states tablie,cir westinghouse electric newman holtzinger,cir telecommunications research and action center fcc.
federal courts frequently use section a to protect their jurisdiction over cases that are grounded on some valid jurisdictional basis,typically diversity or federal question jurisdiction.see,united states new york telephone,d.ocrra has not pled either diversity or federal question jurisdiction as the jurisdictional basis for the injunction it has obtained.instead,its theory of entitlement to the injunction,apparently accepted by the district court,is that the injunction was somehow in aid of the jurisdiction the district court had exercised over the removed and remanded state court action.
if a district court is acting with respect to a case that remains within its jurisdiction,there is no doubt that its jurisdiction over the case includes authority to act under section when necessary to protect,findley laughead in re,cir,or aid,jones lilly,cir,its jurisdiction.furthermore,a court that has concluded its adjudication of the merits of a case within its jurisdiction by entering a final judgment retains authority to take action with respect to some collateral matters related to the case,such as attorney fees and costs,see,chesley union carbide,cir,and sanctions,see,cooter gell hartmarx,d sanctions under.in addition,a court that enters a judgment with continuing effect retains some authority to enforce its judgment,see,yonkers racing city of yonkers,cir approving district court removal of state court suit,in absence of independent removal jurisdiction,because removal necessary to preserve integrity of district court consent decree united states international brotherhood of teamsters,cir affirming district court authority to enjoin from preventing implementation of consent decree,although there are jurisdictional limits to such authority,see kokkonen guardian life insurance of america,d holding that district court lacks ancillary jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreement after underlying lawsuit has been dismissed unless the parties agree to such continuing authority or the court retains jurisdiction for such purpose.
the injunction challenged in the pending appeal does not derive jurisdictional validity from any of these traditional sources of ancillary or continuing jurisdiction.indeed,we are not aware of any other case in which a district court has purported to have jurisdiction to enter an order unrelated to fees,costs,or sanctions after remanding a removed case to a state court.the absence of a precedent,of course,does not demonstrate that jurisdiction is unavailable,but it prompts us to scrutinize with care the claim that jurisdiction exists.
the district court injunction was clearly not issued to prevent any interference with the order it had previously issued.that order returned the removed case from the northern district to the state court.no one is trying to bring the state court case back to the northern district,and we can safely assume that that is the last thing that covanta,the party enjoined,would now want to do.the injunction,however,prohibits more than a renewed attempt to remove the state court case to the northern district,and we must consider whether the district court had authority to issue it.
the district court sought to justify the injunction as necessary to accomplish two related purposes enforcing the res judicata and collateral estoppel effect of the court remand order and preventing an indirect attempt to appeal a removal proceeding order.covanta injunction,at.both rationales bristle with troublesome issues.
the collateral attack rationale raises at least three problems.the first obstacle to grounding the district court injunction on a preclusion rationale is the substantial uncertainty as to whether the court order has preclusive effect.if the remand order is not appealable,as the district court stated in justifying its injunction,then it is highly unlikely that the order has preclusive effect.see,health cost controls of illinois,washington,cir an unappealable ruling,however,is not res judicata,and the district court remand order was unappealable citations omitted.
the second obstacle to the preclusion rationale is the substantial uncertainty as to whether the issue for which preclusion is claimed was decided in the adjudication of ocrra successful motion to remand the state court case.the injunction prohibits covanta from litigating the application of the automatic stay to the remanded state court case,but the district court opinion explaining its decision to remand makes no mention of section and does not explicitly decide whether it applies to the state court case.nor does the opinion mention section or the discretionary factors that bankruptcy courts consider in exercising their section authority.that opinion purported to decide that the district court had jurisdiction over the removed state court case because the state court case was related to a case under title within the meaning of b and because removal was proper under a removal proper if district court has jurisdiction under that the state court case was,see and c that the district court was required to abstain pursuant to the mandatory abstention provision of c.see covanta remand,at.despite the focus of these predicate rulings on matters other than the mandatory stay,the district court later explained its preclusion rationale for the injunction by stating that it had made the implicit finding on the merits that a stay did not apply in the instant case.covanta injunction,at.whether or not such an implicit finding should be inferred from the court prior opinion we have no doubt that judge munson was accurately reporting what he was thinking at the time of the prior remand ruling and whether or not such an implicit finding would have preclusive effect,we are satisfied that it can not serve to accord the district court authority,after relinquishing jurisdiction over the removed case,to prohibit covanta from seeking from the bankruptcy court in the southern district a ruling that the automatic stay applies to the state court case.
a third problem with the preclusion rationale is that,as professor wright treatise explains,o rdinarily both issue preclusion and claim preclusion are enforced by awaiting a second action in which they are pleaded and proved by the party asserting them.the first court does not get to dictate to other courts the preclusion consequences of its own judgment charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction,at ed.see midway motor lodge innkeepers telemanagement equipment,cir in the law of preclusion,however,the court rendering the first judgment does not get to determine that judgment effect.
the district court relied on wood santa barbara chamber of commerce,cir,for the proposition that section empowers a federal court to enjoin parties before it from attempting to relitigate decided issues and to prevent collateral attacks on its judgments.covanta injunction,at.passing the obvious distinction that the district court in the pending case did not have before it the party it asserted jurisdiction to enjoin,we can not agree that wood purported to uphold use of section as general authority to decide the preclusive effect of a court prior decision.on the contrary,wood is an example of a court unquestioned authority to terminate and prevent the renewal of a protracted series of vexatious lawsuits filed by a litigant who is not deterred by the assertion of preclusion defenses in subsequent litigation.see,in re,cir.the enjoined litigant in wood was engaged in the third and fourth generation of lawsuits spawned by the prolixity of the appellant,at,after ten years of litigation,id.at.in approving an injunction to prohibit future litigation,the ninth circuit in wood did not uphold the authority of a court to decide the preclusive effect of one of its prior judgments.instead,it approved the sanction of an injunction to bar repetitive litigation,wood,at,relying on one of its own precedents that had similarly approved enjoining repetitive litigation spanning sixteen years,id.citing clinton united states,cir.wood holding does not support the northern district injunction because there is no allegation or evidence that covanta attempt to secure protection from the bankruptcy court is vexatious or harassing.
even in the absence of a pattern of vexatious litigation,however,a district court that has adjudicated the merits of a case may have authority to prevent relitigation.see new york life insurance deshotel,cir affirming injunction to bar action in federal court moore federal practice,at to ed see also canady allstate insurance,cir affirming injunction to bar action in state court after dismissal for lack of standing.but it is doubtful that a court remanding a removed case that has not been adjudicated on the merits retains continuing authority to enforce what it believes is the preclusive effect of its remand decision.
in addition to its preclusion rationale,the district court supported its injunction on the need to prevent covanta from making an indirect attempt to appeal a removal proceeding order,covanta injunction,at.as we have noted,the court had previously determined that c required mandatory abstention with respect to the removed state court case and had remanded.however,subsection c specifies abstention,not remand,and we assume that the district court remand order was grounded on b,which explicitly provides for remand of a case that has been removed because it relates to a bankruptcy case.see universal well services,avoca natural gas storage,jmc,remanding under section b after abstaining under subsection c thomas bennett,removal,remand,and abstention related to bankruptcies yet another litigation quagmire,cumb.
section b provides 
b the court to which such claim or cause of action is removed may remand such claim or cause of action on any equitable ground.an order entered under this subsection remanding a claim or cause of action,or a decision to not remand,is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of title or by the supreme court of the united states under section of title.
the district court indirect appeal rationale also encounters a substantial problem.although section b applies to all orders remanding cases that were removed under section a because they are related to bankruptcy cases,see cathedral of the incarnation garden city in re cathedral of the incarnation,cir cathedral rejecting contention that prohibition of appeals applies only t
