plaintiff james mcelwee appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york duffy.mcelwee served as a volunteer at valley view center for nursing care and rehabilitation valley view,a federally funded entity operated by defendant orange county the county.in,mcelwee was dismissed from valley view volunteer program after engaging in erratic and harassing behavior toward female staff members.mcelwee,who was previously diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder,brought this action against the county pursuant to title ii of the americans with disabilities act the ada,et,and section of the rehabilitation act of the rehabilitation act,et,alleging that he was denied a reasonable accommodation for his disability.
the district court found that mcelwee was not disabled within the meaning of the statutes and granted the county motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.we affirm the district court award of summary judgment,albeit on different grounds.
background 
the following facts are undisputed,unless otherwise noted.
a.the plaintiff 
mcelwee is a man in his with a neurodevelopmental disorder formally classified as pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos and informally called an autism spectrum disorder.he has an iq of,placing him in the eighth percentile of intellectual functioning.he lives with his mother,has never held a job,and likely will always require assistance in managing money and completing tasks.
in,mcelwee began participating in a volunteer program at valley view,where he performed janitorial and housekeeping duties and transported nursing home residents to religious and social events.mcelwee competently performed these assigned tasks without hindrance from his alleged disability.meanwhile,the volunteer program improved his by allowing him to associate with other people in the community and provide a service to the elderly and infirm.
b.a staff member complains 
on november,martha thompson,a staff member at valley view,informed robin darwin,the assistant administrator,that mcelwee was acting inappropriately towards her and making her feel uncomfortable.specifically,thompson complained that on multiple occasions,mcelwee had waited for her and followed her in the hallways,staring at her rear end.thompson also told darwin that she was aware of at least two other women at valley view who mcelwee had bothered or made to feel uncomfortable.
on november,darwin and amy fey,the director of activities,met with mcelwee to inform him that someone had complained about his behavior and to discuss the allegations with him.when darwin asked mcelwee if he knew who the complainant might be,mcelwee replied that it might be a social worker named lindsay because he look s at her and talk s to her.when darwin told mcelwee that it was not lindsay,he guessed that it might be a particular nurse aide,admitting,i talk to her too,and look at her.mcelwee then said that god was trying to punish him because of his history,and he explained that when he was in high school he made a mean phone call to a girl,saying things.mcelwee further stated,there needs to be punishment and now,and made a gesture simulating slitting his throat.when darwin asked him what he meant,mcelwee replied that he deserve d to be punished when he does bad things.mcelwee then made an angry face and said,just when i think someone is going to pat me on the back someone stabs me,simultaneously making a gesture as if he were holding a knife and repeatedly stabbing himself in the back.when darwin informed mcelwee that it was thompson who had complained about him,he said oh,i should have known.i had a feeling she was going to turn me in.
valley view investigates further 
after her meeting with mcelwee,darwin spoke with valley view facility administrator,who told her to conduct a further investigation regarding mcelwee behavior if she was considering terminating his volunteer services.
on november,darwin informed mcelwee that she was disturbed by the situation,she was going to conduct an investigation,and he should leave valley view and not return until he heard from her.mcelwee started to cry,and said that darwin was a conduit of god.he said that god was telling him not to do these things anymore,and was punishing him for what he had done in the past.mcelwee also said that he had been conducting research at the library over the last several months to see if his behavior could be considered domestic violence or sexual harassment.
darwin subsequently conducted an investigation by interviewing individuals at valley view about mcelwee behavior.in total,five women reported that mcelwee had behaved inappropriately toward them,and a security guard reported that he had seen mcelwee bothering nursing students and visitors.
liz murphy,a staff member in valley view payroll department,told darwin that mcelwee watched her and followed her on her breaks,and she recounted one instance when mcelwee sat in the lobby and watched her while she distributed checks.murphy told darwin that this behavior had been going on for a few years but had increased since the previous spring.she said she gave mcelwee the cold shoulder and went out of her way to avoid him.barbara decker,another payroll department employee,told darwin that mcelwee used to carry around a stuffed dolphin that he asked women to pet,in a manner she perceived as sexually suggestive.decker also said that several years earlier mcelwee had inquired about dating her daughter,and that the way he spoke about her daughter made her uncomfortable.pat matero,the director of admissions,told darwin that mcelwee once asked her how he would look in a speedo,and that she had observed him in the past playing up to young aides with sexual innuendo.irene simpson,the activities supervisor at valley view,told darwin that mcelwee once said to her,d o you realize what i could do to you in what she felt was a threatening way.eric gould,a security guard at valley view,told darwin that thompson and murphy had complained to him that mcelwee behavior made them feel uncomfortable.gould also said he had observed mcelwee leering at and acting inappropriately around female nursing students and visitors.
mcelwee is dismissed 
based on her investigation,darwin concluded that mcelwee was a potential liability for valley view in that he was sexually harassing staff,nursing students,and visitors,and had exhibited disturbing behavior when confronted with these allegations 
on november,mcelwee mother called darwin and told her that mcelwee is not like everyone else and that he should not be discriminated against because he has a disability and because he was looking at people.she asked darwin to call mcelwee therapist,who could better explain why he acted the way that he did.darwin never called the therapist.
darwin consulted with valley view facility administrator,the county executive office,and the county law department regarding the results of her investigation.on december,she sent mcelwee a letter,stating that his volunteer services were no longer needed at valley view.
on december,mcelwee went to valley view to sing christmas carols for the residents.when he arrived at the facility,a security guard told him he was not allowed inside the building because of what had happened recently.
procedural history 
mcelwee filed the action below on january,alleging that the county had violated the ada and the rehabilitation act by dismissing him from the volunteer program and subsequently excluding him from valley view altogether without providing him a reasonable accommodation for his mental impairment.
following discovery,the county moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted the county motion,holding that mcelwee was not substantially limited in the major life activity of interacting with others and therefore was not disabled under the ada or the rehabilitation act.see mcelwee cnty.of orange,civ.ktd,dist.lexis,at.in particular,the court held,while plaintiff may suffer from a diagnosed disorder,plaintiff has not demonstrated that his mental impairment substantially impairs his ability to connect with others,to initiate contact with other people and respond to them,or to go among other people at the most basic level of these activities.id.at quoting jacques dimarzio,cir.
the court did not consider whether mcelwee was otherwise qualified to be a volunteer at valley view or whether the accommodations he sought were reasonable.judgment dismissing the complaint was entered on september.
this appeal followed.

the ada and the rehabilitation act 
title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.similarly,section of the rehabilitation act prohibits programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance from excluding,denying benefits to,or discriminating against otherwise qualified disabled individuals.a.because the standards adopted by the two statutes are nearly identical,we consider the merits of these claims together.see abrahams mta long island bus,cir.
to assert a claim under title ii of the ada or section of the rehabilitation act,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is a qualified individual with a disability the defendant is subject to one of the acts and he was denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the defendant services,programs,or activities,or was otherwise discriminated against by the defendant because of his disability.henrietta bloomberg,cir.
a qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices,the removal of architectural,communication,or transportation barriers,or the provision of auxiliary aids and services,meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.id.a.
under both statutes,a defendant discriminates when it fails to make a reasonable accommodation that would permit a qualified disabled individual to have access to and take a meaningful part in public services.powell bd.of med.exam rs,cir see also b a the term discriminate under the ada includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee.a reasonable accommodation is one that gives the otherwise qualified plaintiff with disabilities meaningful access to the program or services sought.henrietta,at quoting alexander choate,d.
although a public entity must make reasonable accommodations,it does not have to provide a disabled individual with every accommodation he requests or the accommodation of his choice.see fink dep t of personnel,cir.an accommodation is not reasonable if it would impose an undue hardship on a program operation or would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.powell,at citing,b internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,under the ada,workplace misconduct is a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for terminating employment,even when such misconduct is related to a disability a requested accommodation that simply excuses past misconduct is unreasonable as a matter of law 
although it is generally the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed,brady wal mart stores,cir quoting graves finch pruyn,cir internal quotation marks omitted,under certain circumstances,an employer is required to act proactively and engage in an interactive process to accommodate the disability of an employee even if the employee does not request accommodation,see see also o to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal,interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.nevertheless,an employee may not recover based on his employer failure to engage in an interactive process if he can not show that a reasonable accommodation existed at the time of his dismissal.see mcbride,at.
a plaintiff alleging that he was denied a reasonable accommodation bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow him to meet the essential eligibility requirements of the service,program,or activity at issue.see id.at.once the plaintiff has demonstrated that there is a plausible accommodation,the costs of which,facially,do not clearly exceed its benefits,the defendant bears the burden of proving that the requested accommodation is not reasonable.borkowski valley cent.sch,cir.
application 
in this case,the parties agree that mcelwee has satisfied the second element of his claim valley view is a federally funded entity of the county,and therefore is subject to the ada and the rehabilitation act.see b defining public entity as,inter alia,any department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or states or local government a prohibiting discrimination by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
the parties dispute,however,whether the first and third elements are satisfied,whether mcelwee is a qualified individual with a disability and whether the county discriminated against him by denying him a reasonable accommodation.we discuss these elements in turn.
whether mcelwee is a qualified individual with a disability 
the question whether mcelwee is a qualified individual with a disability has two aspects,namely,whether he is disabled and whether he is qualified.we consider both aspects below.
whether mcelwee is disabled 
the district court found that mcelwee was not substantially limited in the major life activity of interacting with others and concluded that mcelwee was not disabled.see mcelwee,dist.lexis,at.on appeal,mcelwee argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the ada amendments act of adaaa,stat,which amended the ada to provide that the definition of disability shall be construed broadly to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and t he term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the adaaa.a,b similarly,the amici curiae argue that,in light of the adaaa,the district court erred in concluding that mcelwee is not disabled.
both mcelwee and amici raise fair concerns as to whether the district court erred in not addressing whether mcelwee was substantially limited in the major life activities of working,caring for himself,communicating,thinking,and brain function.see providing that major life activities include,but are not limited to caring for oneself,learning,concentrating,thinking,communicating,working,and the operation of major bodily functions such as brain function j i instructing courts to construe the term substantially limits broadly id.j iii specifically identifying autism as an impairment that substantially limits brain function in virtually all cases.nonetheless,we need not decide whether the district court erred in finding mcelwee was not disabled because even assuming arguendo that a reasonable jury could find mcelwee disabled,the county is entitled to summary judgment for the reasons
