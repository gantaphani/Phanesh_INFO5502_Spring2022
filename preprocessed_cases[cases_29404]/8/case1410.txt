this case comes to us raising issues concerning a contractual arrangement known as a total return equity swap agreement although our disposition at this stage of the appeal touches only tangentially on such issues.

the parties have endeavored to frame issues that would require decision as to the circumstances under which parties to equity swap agreements must comply with the disclosure provisions of section d.such issues would turn on the circumstances under which the long party to such swap agreements may have or be deemed to have beneficial ownership of shares purchased by the short party as a hedge.
rather than resolve such issues,as to which there is disagreement within the panel,we consider at this time only issues concerning a group violation of section d with respect to csx shares owned outright by the defendants without regard to whatever beneficial ownership,if any,they might have acquired as long parties to equity swap agreements.because we lack sufficient findings to permit appellate review of such issues,we remand for further findings.
background 
we describe here only the salient facts and district court proceedings,leaving many details to the discussion section.
tci and the funds are investment funds that in came to believe that csx,a large railroad company,had unrealized value that a change in corporate policy and perhaps management might unlock.the funds purchased shares in csx and entered into equity swaps referencing csx stock.the funds then engaged in a proxy fight with the management of csx.
a equity swaps.swaps are contracts in which parties agree to exchange sums equivalent to the income streams produced by specified assets.equity swaps involve an exchange of the income stream from a specified number of shares in a designated company stock,and a specified interest rate on a specified principal amount.the party that receives the return is styled the long party.the party that receives the return is styled the short party.these contracts do not transfer title to the underlying assets or require that either party actually own them.rather,in a equity swap,the long party periodically pays the short party a sum calculated by applying an interest rate to an notional amount of principal,as if the long party had borrowed that amount of money from the short party.meanwhile,the short party periodically pays the long party a sum equivalent to the return to a shareholder in a specified company the increased value of the shares,if any,plus income from the shares as if the long party owned actual shares in that company.
as a result,the financial return to a long party in a equity swap is roughly equivalent to the return when borrowed capital is used to purchase shares in the referenced company.long swap positions can,therefore,be attractive to parties that seek to increase the leverage of their holdings without actually buying the shares.the short party financial return,in turn,is equivalent to the return to someone who sold short and then lent out the proceeds from that sale.however,because of the inherent risks in positions share value can be more volatile than interest rates persons holding short positions in equity swaps will usually choose to purchase equivalent numbers of shares to hedge their short exposure.
equity swaps may be or.when an equity swap that is terminates,the long party receives the referenced security itself,in exchange for a payment equal to the security market price at the end of the previous payment period.when a equity swap terminates,the short party pays the long party the sum of the referenced equity security appreciation in market value and other net cash flows such as dividend payments that have occurred since the most recent periodic payment.if this sum is negative,then the short party receives the corresponding amount from the long party.unlike swaps settled in kind,swaps do not give the long party a right to acquire ownership of the referenced assets from the short party.in all other respects,and equity swaps are economically equivalent.
b the transactions in the present case.the swaps purchased by the funds were equity swaps referencing shares of csx.the funds were the long parties,and several banks were the short parties.although the swap contracts did not require the short parties the banks actually to own any csx shares,the funds understood that the banks most likely would hedge their short swap positions by purchasing csx shares in amounts matching the number of shares referenced in the swaps,and the banks generally did so 
the funds trading in csx shares and swaps followed no consistent pattern.during some periods the funds increased their holdings during other periods they decreased them.almost immediately after making its initial investment in csx,tci approached the company to negotiate changes in policy and,if need be,management that could bring better performance and thus a higher stock price,csx i,d at,which would allow tci to profit from its swap holdings.tci later explored the possibility of a leveraged buyout lbo of csx,and informed other hedge funds of its interest in altering csx practices in a manner that tci believed would cause its stock to rise.id.at.when it became clear that csx had little interest in tci proposed policy changes or lbo proposals,tci began preparations for a proxy contest to effectuate its desired policy and management changes at csx.
there is no doubt that the funds wanted to avoid disclosure under the williams act until a time they believed suitable.thus,tci took care to disperse its swaps among multiple counterparties so that no one particular counterparty would trigger disclosure under the williams act by purchasing as a hedge more than percent of a class of csx securities tci could not be certain how counterparties would vote their hedge shares but of course could vote the shares that it owned.when a proxy fight seemed likely,tci decreased its swap holdings and purchased more csx shares.
meanwhile,the funds engaged in various communications among themselves,with csx management,and with some of the banks.as early as november,tci had contacted csx and two banks one in december,and the other in january about the possibility of a leveraged buyout.tci also had communications with both austin friars,a hedge fund owned by deutsche bank,and with deutsche bank itself about csx.tci and communicated between themselves at various times in,but not until december,did they file a schedule with the sec disclosing that they had formed a group by enter ing into an agreement to coordinate certain of their efforts with regard sic i the purchase and sale of various shares and instruments and ii the proposal of certain actions transactions to csx.csx i,d at.
on january,the tci group proposed a minority slate of directors for the csx board.see id.at.the vote on this proposal occurred at the june,csx shareholders meeting.
c the present action.on march,csx brought the present action against tci and in the southern district of new york alleging,among other things,violation of the williams act,stat.codified as amended at u.d g,d,f,and various rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.the williams act added section d to the securities exchange act of to require that,among other things,various disclosures be filed with the securities and exchange commission sec when a person has acquired beneficial ownership of more than percent of an class of a company shares.d.included in the statute definition of a person is a group acting for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer.d.
the district court held that,for purposes of section d,tci was deemed a beneficial owner of all csx shares held by banks as hedges against tci swaps,and thus that tci violated section d by failing to make timely filings once tci combined holdings of csx shares and swaps crossed the percent ownership threshold.see csx.i,d at.in making this ruling,the district court considered whether tci had beneficial ownership of the hedged shares pursuant to both sec rule a,which defines a beneficial owner and sec rule b,which identifies circumstances under which a person shall be deemed to be a beneficial owner see d a,b.ultimately,the district court did not rule on whether tci was a beneficial owner under rule a,see csx i,d at,but did rule that tci was deemed a beneficial owner under rule b because it had created and used the swaps with the purpose and effect of preventing the vesting of beneficial ownership in tci as part of a scheme or plan to evade the reporting requirements of section d,id.at.
the district court also found that tci and violated section d by failing to make timely disclosure of having formed a group with respect to csx securities no later than february.id.at.
the court granted csx a permanent injunction against tci and,prohibiting any further violations of section d,whether or not involving csx shares.id.at.the court concluded that it was foreclosed as a matter of law from granting an injunction prohibiting the funds from voting the percent of csx shares that they had acquired after forming a group.id.at.csx appealed this denial of an injunction against voting the disputed shares.the funds the district court finding that the funds had violated section d and the grant of a permanent injunction against any future violations of section d.on september,we entered an order affirming on csx appeal,but deferred until now our discussion of the reasons for that order.see csx ii,app x at.
discussion 
we leave discussion of the merits of the csx appeal,the issue of whether prohibiting the funds from voting the csx shares was an appropriate remedy for the alleged violation,to the end of this opinion,and turn to the funds.as to that appeal,the panel is divided on numerous issues concerning whether and under what circumstances the long party to a swap may be deemed,for purposes of section d,the beneficial owner of shares purchased by the short party as a hedge.in view of that disagreement,we conclude that it is appropriate at this time to limit our consideration to the issue of group formation,see d,an issue as to which we seek further findings from the district court.all members of the panel are in agreement as to this disposition.
statutory and regulatory framework 
section d provides in pertinent part 
any person who,after acquiring directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any equity security of a class which is registered pursuant to section of this title,is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than per centum of such class shall,within ten days after such acquisition,disclose to the issuer,the sec,and the exchanges a statement containing such of the following information,and such additional information,as the commission may by rules and regulations,prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors 
when two or more persons act as a partnership,limited partnership,syndicate,or other group for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer,such syndicate or group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection.
sec rule b provides that the section d disclosure requirements apply to the aggregate holdings of any group formed for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer.d b.this rule tracks section d in all respects except that the rule adds voting as a group for the purpose of triggering the disclosure provisions.compare id.with d.t he touchstone of a group within the meaning of section d is that the members combined in furtherance of a common objective.roth jennings,cir quoting wellman dickinson,cir.
ii.group violation 
there are three kinds of groups that might be found in the present matter.one might consist of one or more long parties the funds and one or more short counterparties that have hedged with shares the banks.the second might consist of the funds,tci and.the third might consist of banks that have purchased shares as a hedge.only the possibility of a group comprising tci and is at issue on this appeal.
as we have noted,the statute and the implementing rule are both concerned with groups formed for the purpose of acquiring shares of an issuer.see d d b.the district court recognized that whether a group exists under section d turns on whether there is sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence to support the inference of a formal or informal understanding between members for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities.csx i,d at quoting hallwood realty partners,gotham partners,cir emphasis added.
endeavoring to meet the statutory standard,the district court found that tci and formed a group,within the meaning of section d,with respect to csx securities,and that this group was formed no later than february.see id.at.then,after identifying the defendants activities and motives throughout the relevant period,id.at,the court stated,these circumstances all suggest that the parties activities from at least as early as february,were products of concerted action id.at emphasis added.
these findings are insufficient for proper appellate review.although the district court found the existence of a group with respect to csx securities,the court did not explicitly find a group formed for the purpose of acquiring csx securities.even if many of the parties activities were the result of group action,two or more entities do not become a group within the meaning of section d unless they act as a group for the purpose of acquiring securities of an issuer.d.
moreover,because the district court deemed the funds,as long parties to equity swap agreements,to have a beneficial interest in shares acquired by hedging short parties to such agreements,the court did not distinguish in its group finding between csx shares deemed to be beneficially owned by the funds and those owned outright by the funds.however,with our current consideration of a group violation confined to csx shares owned outright by the funds,a precise finding,adequately supported by specific evidence,of whether a group existed for purposes of acquiring csx shares outright during the relevant period needs to be made in order to facilitate appellate review,and we will remand for that purpose.because the combined total outright ownership of csx shares by tci and crossed the percent threshold by april,a group,if it was formed for the statutorily defined purpose,would have been required to file a section d disclosure within ten days,by april,see d d.thus,on remand the district court will have to make findings as to whether the defendants formed a group for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing,d b,of csx shares owned outright,and,if so,a date by which at the latest such a group was formed.only if such a group outright ownership of csx shares exceeded the percent threshold prior to the filing of a section d disclosure can a group violation of section d be found.
iii.appropriateness of injunctive relief 
because on remand,the district court might find a section d group violation with respect to a group acquisition of csx shares outright and the defendants,on the,have disputed the propriety of an injunction,even on the basis of the violations as found by the district court,we will briefly consider some of the considerations relevant to injunctive relief.
it is settled in this circuit that an issuer has an implied right of action to seek injunctive relief for a violation of section d,see gaf milstein,cir,but must satisfy traditional equitable requirements for an injunction,see rondeau mosinee paper,d.we have recognized that a prohibition on future securities law violations has grave consequences because it subjects a defendant to contempt sanctions and also has serious collateral consequences.unifund sal,cir.the usual basis for prospective injunctive relief is not only irreparable harm,which is required for all injunctions,see rondeau,at citing beacon theatres,westover,d,but also some cognizable danger of recurrent violations,rondeau,at quoting united states grant.
in this case,the district court considered both irreparable harm and the probability of future violations.see csx i,d at.having held that the funds violated section d,the district court issued a broad permanent injunction against future violations,an injunction not limited to csx shares 
defendants,their officers,agents,servants,employees,attorneys,and all persons in active concert or participation with any of the foregoing who receive actual notice of this injunction are enjoined and restrained from violating section d of the securities exchange act of,d,and regulation thereunder 
the district court predicated this broad injunction on the basis of a section d violation that took into account not only the shares of csx that the funds owned outright but also the much larger quantity of shares purchased as hedges by the short parties to swaps.because this opinion considers only the more limited issue of whether the funds,as a group,committed a violation of section d with respect to shares that they owned outright,if the district court on remand finds the existence of a group formed to acquire csx shares outright during the relevant period,it will have to reconsider the appropriateness of an injunction,and,if one is to be issued,what should be its appropriate scope.
if a section d violation is found,limited to a group violation with respect to purchase of the shares outright which is the only violation considered in this opinion,the threat of future violations would be less substantial than appeared to the district court,which based its broad injunction,not limited to csx shares on its view that the funds were deemed to be beneficial owners of the hedged shares purchased by the short parties to the swap agreements.
another factor that would arguably weigh against a broad injunction is the disclosure that csx made just prior to the expiration of the period following april,the date when the group total of csx shares owned outright crossed the percent threshold.on april,csx filed its form q for the period ending march.the form q reported that tci had made a filing under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act,stat,of its intention to acquire more than million of csx stock and that tci currently holds a significant economic position through common stock ownership and derivative contracts tied to the value of csx stock.csx i,d at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,tci control ambitions were known to the public before it was required to file under section d,at least with respect to the group outright ownership of shares as of april.we recognize that a hart scott rodino filing does not reveal all of the information required by a section d disclosure.nevertheless,the filing has a bearing on the scope of relief warranted for the limited section d violation we have considered in this opinion.
on the other hand,if a section d violation,even a limited one,is found on the basis of a group purchase of shares outright and when the group holdings crossed the percent threshold,it would continue to be relevant that the district court has found that some of the parties testified falsely in a number of respects,notably including incredible claims of failed recollection.csx i,d at.the district court was within its discretion in concluding that people who have lied about securities matters can reasonably be expected to attempt securities laws violations in the future.
under all the circumstances,we will remand to the district court so that it may a determine whether the evidence permits findings as to the formation of a group,as described above,a date by which at the latest such a group was formed,and whether such a group outright ownership of csx shares crossed the percent threshold prior to the filing of a section d disclosure,and b if a group violation of section d is found,reconsider the appropriateness and scope of injunctive relief based only on the group failure to disclose outright ownership of more than percent of csx shares.
iv.injunctive sterilization of the disputed shares 
the district court concluded that it was foreclosed as a matter of law from enjoining the funds voting of csx shares acquired between the latest date on which their section d disclosure obligations might have begun and the date on which they actually made those disclosures.see csx i,d at.csx argues that the court should have enjoined the voting of those shares on three grounds i courts generally have broad powers to grant injunctive relief ii a sterilization injunction was necessary to promote the ends of the williams act both by leveling the playing field in the contest for corporate control in order to partially restore the integrity of the shareholder franchise and by deterring future violations of the act disclosure provisions and iii courts have inherent authority to sanction litigation misconduct.
in treadway companies,care,cir,we held that an injunction will issue for a violation of d only on a showing of irreparable harm to the interests which that section seeks to protect.at.we also said that t he goal of d is to alert the marketplace to every large,rapid aggregation or accumulation of securities which might represent a potential shift in corporate control.id.internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original see also rondeau,at the purpose of the williams act is to insure that public shareholders who are confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock will not be required to respond without adequate information regarding the qualifications and intentions of the offering party.thus,the interests that section d protects are fully satisfied when the shareholders receive the information required to be filed.treadway,at see also united states,d congress designed the williams act to make disclosure,rather than principles of fairness or artificiality,the preferred method of market regulation.internal quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in original.consequently,in treadway,we held that because shareholders had received the required information four months before the proxy contest in that case,there was no risk of irreparable injury and no basis for injunctive relief.at.in the present matter,the funds section d disclosures occurred in december,approximately six months before the june,shareholders meeting.therefore,following treadway,we conclude that injunctive share sterilization was not available.
csx,however,argues that the williams act does not aim merely at timely dissemination of information but more broadly seeks to provide a level playing field and to promote compliance.appellant brief at.for this proposition,csx relies on a passing remark,in a footnote,in which the supreme court expressed skepticism about whether deterrence of e violations is a meaningful goal,except possibly with respect to the most flagrant sort of violations which no reasonable person could consider lawful.piper chris craft,d.far from supporting csx claim,this remark mentions none of the goals of the williams act,concerns section e rather than section d,and actually casts doubt upon the usefulness of determining remedies with an eye toward promoting compliance.
csx also rests its level playing field claim on two supreme court cases that include fair corporate suffrage as among the original goals of the securities exchange act of virginia bankshares,sandberg,d,and case borak,d.however,neither case attributed that goal to the williams act,and there is no reason to conclude that adequate timely disclosure of the information covered by the williams act would be insufficient to ensure the fairness of a subsequent shareholder vote.
csx also argues that the importance of deterring violations of section d provides a general reason for prohibiting the funds from voting the disputed shares.refusing to sterilize the voted shares would,csx argues,leave the williams act toothless.however,a statutory provision is not necessarily rendered toothless for lack of a particular sanction.we also note that the proposed sanction might have injured those shareholders who,fully informed,chose to vote with the insurgents.
the inappropriateness of share sterilization in such circumstances leaves open the question of what remedies might be appropriate when disclosure that is timely with respect to a proxy contest is not made,and we do not reach that issue here.
csx quotes franklin gwinnett county public schools,d,to the effect that once a federal right of action exists there is a traditional presumption that courts can use all available remedies unless congress clearly has provided otherwise.at.in a similar vein,csx argues that because the district court found that officials of both funds testified falsely,see csx i,d at,the court was permitted to issue an injunction to sterilize the funds disputed shares as a way of sanctioning abuses of the judicial process.however,neither the presumption about the general availability of remedies nor the responsibility of federal courts to protect the integrity of their proceedings,see,in re martin trigona,cir,supersedes treadway holding in the case of section d,an injunction prohibiting the voting of shares is inappropriate when the required disclosures were made in sufficient time for shareholders to cast informed votes.see treadway,at.whether timely or not,the stated purpose of disclosure allowing informed action by shareholders,see supra note was fulfilled.
conclusion 
the district court denial of an injunction against the voting of shares is again affirmed,the injunction issued to prohibit future violations of d is vacated,and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in the event of a subsequent appeal,any party may restore jurisdiction to this court by notice to the clerk within days of any order or judgment sought to be appealed,without a new notice of appeal,in which event such appeal will be referred to this panel.see united states jacobson,cir.
i concur in the judgment remanding for further findings.
the district court finding of a february group formation that required disclosure under rule b can not be upheld for various reasons discussed infra.particularly,it was based in part on a flawed analysis of the economic and legal role of equity swap agreements.
the court viewed the economic role of such swaps as an underhanded means of acquiring or facilitating access to csx stock that could be used to gain control through a proxy fight or otherwise.in my view,without an agreement between the long and short parties permitting the long party ultimately to acquire the hedge stock or to control the short party voting of it,such swaps are not a means of indirectly facilitating a control transaction.rather,they allow parties such as the funds to profit from efforts to cause firms to institute new business policies increasing the value of a firm.if management changes the policies and the firm value increases,the funds swap agreements will earn them a profit for their efforts.if management does not alter the policies,however,and a proxy fight or other control transaction becomes necessary,the swaps are of little value to parties such as the funds.absent an agreement such as that described above,such parties must then,as happened here,unwind the swaps and buy stock at the open market price,thus paying the costs of both the swaps and the stock.
the district court legal analysis concluded that the one role of such swaps was to avoid the disclosure requirements of section d no doubt true and therefore violated rule.the legal conclusion,however,was also flawed,leaving unmentioned,inter alia,explicit legislation regarding swaps and supreme court decisions discussing statutory triggers involving beneficial ownership of a firm stock.that legislation and those decisions,as they stood at the time,foreclosed the conclusion reached by the district court.finally,the recent dodd frank bill and sec response thereto make it clear that the district court analysis is not consistent with present law.dodd frank wall street reform protection act,stat.beneficial ownership reporting requirements and security based swaps,release,part,wl,at june.
in my view,equity swaps do not,without more,render the long party a beneficial owner of such shares with a potential disclosure obligation under section d.however,an agreement or understanding between the long and short parties to such a swap regarding the short party purchasing of such shares as a hedge,the short party selling of those shares to the long party upon the unwinding of the swap agreements,or the voting of such shares by the short parties renders the long party a beneficial owner of shares purchased as a hedge by the short party.
my discussion of the basis of this conclusion will begin with an examination of aspects of the underlying statutory scheme and resultant caselaw not discussed by the district court.it will then turn to the application of relevant rules promulgated by the sec.
a the statutory scheme 
examination of the statutory scheme is particularly important in this matter,for two reasons.first,critical language used in section d is used elsewhere in the act,and some harmonization of interpretation is desirable,if not necessary.second,in and,congress amended the act with particular reference to swaps in ways relevant to this case.
to reiterate,section d requires disclosure of a variety of by single beneficial owners of more than percent of a firm equity securities.it also requires similar disclosure by a group of beneficial owners,who own in the aggregate more than percent of a firm shares,when a purpose of the group is to acquire,hold,or dispose of such securities.see d.
some measure of certainty should be accorded to persons subject to section d disclosure requirements.investors benefit little from case by case,prolonged,expensive and repetitive litigation that weighs amorphous standards and circumstantial evidence regarding state of mind with disparate outcomes,particularly when the underlying information quickly loses its relevance because of commercial environments.even where a disclosure requirement seems less than fully comprehensive,knowledge of what need be disclosed and what need not at least leaves the market with some certainty as to the unknown.
in the present case,much certainty can be provided simply by following the language of section d.the language does not impose a general disclosure requirement that is triggered by an intent to obtain control or an equity position of influence within a particular company.nor does it purport to require,as suggested by the district court,disclosure of all steps that might be part of a control transaction in the eyes of a court rather,it specifies precise conduct constituting the disclosure trigger the acquisition,alone or in coordination with others,of beneficial ownership of percent of any equity security of a company.d.
the term beneficial owner s of any equity security was not drawn from thin air in.id.it was already a familiar term from its use in section,which was part of the original act.section requires the reporting of purchases and sales,and disgorgement of profits from certain of those sales,by a defined group of insiders directors,officers,and,importantly for my purposes,beneficial owner s of more than percent of any equity security of a firm.a.in brief,such beneficial owners and directors or officers must register,disclose their purchases and sales,and disgorge to the firm profits they made in trades,from purchases and sales of the firm shares within six months of each other.a,b.
the purpose of section is generally said to be to reveal transactions by insiders,so defined,and to prevent profit making based on,material information,insider trading.see,foremost mckesson,provident sec,d describing the purpose of section b,at,stating that section a was motivated by a belief that the most potent weapon against the abuse of inside information is full and prompt publicity and by a desire to give investors an idea of the purchases and sales by insiders which may in turn indicate their private opinion as to prospects of the company.
section relies as fundamentally on the concept of beneficial ownership as does section d.subsequent to court decisions that both rejected the sec views and read section in a mechanical way,see reliance emerson,d,the sec,in promulgating rules a and b stated that section d and section had different purposes and the new rules were not intended to affect interpretations of section.adoption of beneficial ownership disclosure requirements,securities act release,exchange act release.
however,in,the sec harmonized section interpretation of beneficial ownership of percent with the corresponding provisions but for a percent requirement of section d.see ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release,investment company act release.by sec rule,a beneficial owner under section was defined as any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the act.a a.one effect of this rule was to apply rules a and b in interpreting section,perhaps a less consequential step than it seems in the context of the present issues because no great conflicts of interpretation had arisen.a perhaps more significant step was to apply rule b,which defines a group,discussed infra,to section determinations of whether multiple holders of equity securities are in the aggregate a beneficial owner of percent.thus,sec rules interpret the term beneficial ownership to be the same under section d as under section.
even without rule a,the pertinent language of the two sections is identical,and harmonization of interpretation is normally necessary.see,gustafson alloyd,d the securities act,like every act of congress,should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.only last term we adhered to the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.quoting dep t of revenue of or.acf,d norman singer shambie singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.the provisions of section relating to beneficial ownership,and the caselaw under it,thus inform and cabin any interpretation of the meaning of beneficial ownership under section d.
the caselaw under section is particularly informative with regard to whether section d is to be interpreted as giving decisive weight to a acquirer intentions toward a target,as the district court did,or whether a more mechanical,interpretation is appropriate.although modern financial transactions have generated some close cases,kern county land occidental petroleum,d the application of section is largely mechanical,that is,independent of the purposes or state of mind of parties to a transaction.see,magma power dow chem,cir section b operates mechanically,and makes no moral distinctions,penalizing technical violators of pure heart,and bypassing corrupt insiders who skirt the letter of the prohibition.such is the price of easy administration.internal quotation marks omitted.for example,disgorgement has not been required for a stock purchase and sale made by a board member on the same day the member resigned,when the resignation became effective before the execution of the transactions.lewis bradley,bradley resignation was the first order of business next,was the sale and delivery of the shares and finally,the exercise of his option rights.that the sequence of events may have been deliberately designed is of no consequence.see also babbitt,lachner,cir since the interval between the purchase and the sale exceeded six months if only by one day any profit which lachner may have made on the transaction is not recoverable under b.
for another and very pertinent example,section has been held to allow a percent shareholder to avoid disgorgement of profits made on a sale of percent of the shares made within six months of their purchase by strategic timing of the sales.reliance,at.the shareholder first sold enough shares to reduce its holdings to percent,just below the percent threshold,and then sold the rest of its shares shortly thereafter.id.at.the shareholder avoided disgorgement of the profits on the second sale even though the two sales were effected pursuant to a single predetermined plan of disposition with the overall intent and purpose of avoiding section b liability.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in so holding the supreme court stated 
the history and purpose of b have been exhaustively reviewed by federal courts on several occasions since its enactment in.those courts have recognized that the only method congress deemed effective to curb the evils of insider trading was a flat rule taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.as one court observed 
in order to achieve its goals,congress chose a relatively arbitrary rule capable of easy administration.the objective standard of section b imposes strict liability upon substantially all transactions occurring within the statutory time period,regardless of the intent of the insider or the existence of actual speculation.this approach maximized the ability of the rule to eradicate speculative abuses by reducing difficulties in proof.such arbitrary and sweeping coverage was deemed necessary to insure the optimum prophylactic effect.
thus congress did not reach every transaction in which an investor actually relies on inside information.a person avoids liability if he does not meet the statutory definition of an insider,or if he sells more than six months after purchase.liability can not be imposed simply because the investor structured his transaction with the intent of avoiding liability under b.the question is,rather,whether the method used to avoid liability is one permitted by the statute.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.given the supreme court direction to harmonize the interpretation of multiple statutory uses of identical language and sec rule,the approach of section governs the interpretation of beneficial ownership of any equity security in section d.d.
a large measure of certainty is provided by this test mechanical attributes,but,as reliance electric noted with regard to section,at a cost.at.application of the language of section d leads to an inevitable overbreadth requiring disclosure where no control or influence is intended by a holder of percent of shares.
there is also an inevitable underbreadth,see id.not requiring disclosure of conduct that constitutes significant steps in an attempt to gain control but does not fall within the pertinent language.without triggering any disclosure requirement,a potential acquirer can,for example,amass percent of the target company shares.the potential acquirer may further make inquiry of some large shareholders with an eye to learning how many shares might be available for private purchases in the future and what price ranges are likely,so long as there is no implicit or explicit agreement to buy.pantry pride,rooney,section d allows individuals broad freedom to discuss the possibilities of future agreements without filing under securities laws.such inquiries may cause and be expected to cause these other shareholders to keep or acquire more shares than they otherwise would,in anticipation of the potential acquirer deciding to make an acquisition.
the same potential acquirer may line up financing in anticipation of a large purchase of the target company shares in a short period of time.the potential acquirer can then form a group with other investors and coordinate future plans to buy the target company stock,again so long as the percent ownership threshold is not yet reached.the group may then cross the threshold and acquire an unlimited amount of the company securities over a period before being required to make disclosure so long as the method used to avoid disclosure is one permitted by the statute,reliance,at,it does not matter that a firm or group of firms employing that method consciously sought to avoid disclosure under section d.that result flows from the statutory language and is not for courts to alter.however,perhaps because of the way this case was argued,none of the pertinent authority established under section was discussed by the district court,which gave overwhelming weight to the funds intent.
the district court also did not consider the fact that congress has been well aware of legal issues involving swaps for years and has repeatedly passed legislation regarding them,all of which is specifically relevant to the issues in this case and generally relevant to the propriety of,or need for,courts adopting legal rules that congress and the sec have avoided.for example,as part of the amendments discussed infra,congress exempted swap agreements from the act definition of a security.see infra note commodity futures modernization act of,app.e,amendment to the gramm leach bliley act,amendment to the act,stat,to codified at,note.in,as part of the dodd frank bill,congress included swaps in the act definition of a security.dodd frank wall street reform protection act a.
however,neither exemption from,nor inclusion in,the definition of security affects the outcome here because section d applies to securities issued by a target firm and the swap instruments in question were not issued by csx.nor do the legislative definitions explicitly resolve the issue of whether the long party to a swap agreement is the beneficial owner of referenced securities purchased as a hedge by the short party.i turn to that issue infra.
my point,nevertheless,is that congress was well aware of the issues arising from swaps.in fact,swap agreements are a metaphoric alsace lorraine in the conflicting claims of jurisdiction by the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc over securities futures products.see peter romeo alan dye,section treatise and reporting guide,at michael gettelman,ed.
the legislation,in effect at the time of the district court opinion and the hearing of this appeal,included a moderately lengthy and detailed amendment to the act broadly limiting the sec regulatory authority over swap agreements.see commodity futures modernization act of.in particular,that amendment prohibited the sec from promulgating,interpreting,or enforcing rules or issuing orders of general applicability in a manner that imposes or specifies reporting or recordkeeping requirements,procedures,or standards as prophylactic measures against fraud,manipulation,or insider trading with respect to any equity swap.b.this amendment contained exceptions to this prohibition with regard to the disclosure and disgorgement provisions of section that,inter alia,make it clear that a long party ownership of equity swaps was not to be calculated in determining beneficial ownership of percent of equity shares see b.
in,the dodd frank bill not only included swaps in the definition of security but also amended the definition of beneficial owner contained in section of the sea.the provision now states 
o beneficial ownership.for purposes of this section and section,a person shall be deemed to acquire beneficial ownership of an equity security based on the purchase or sale of a swap,only to the extent that the commission,by rule,determines after consultation with the prudential regulators and the secretary of the treasury,that the purchase or sale of the swap,or class of swap,provides incidents of ownership comparable to direct ownership of the equity security,and that it is necessary to achieve the purposes of this section that the purchase or sale of the swaps,or class of swap,be deemed the acquisition of beneficial ownership of the equity security.
dodd frank wall street reform protection act e.however,the sec has not exercised its new authority to promulgate rules that specifically reference swaps.rather,it has repromulgated rule d on the ground that a bsent rulemaking under section o,the amendment to section o may be interpreted to render the beneficial ownership determinations made under rule inapplicable to a person who purchases or sells a swap.beneficial ownership reporting requirements and security based swaps,wl,at.the sec fear appears to be that,given the prior congressional bar to its regulating equity based swaps,rule could not apply to such swaps before the amendment and needed repromulgation pursuant to that amendment if the rule were ever to apply to such swaps.
two matters of significance must be noted.first,if rule did not apply to such swaps before the amendment,the district court was wrong in its legal analysis.second,the repromulgated rule makes no mention of swaps and in the words of the amendment to section o regulates them only to the extent that it applies as written.
b beneficial ownership 
i turn now to the issue of whether the funds,as long parties to the equity swaps,are beneficial owners of referenced shares bought by short parties to hedge short positions in those swaps.the district court held that if a long party to such a swap would expect that the short party would hedge its position by purchasing shares,then the long party was a beneficial owner of those shares because it had the power to influence the purchase.csx,d at.the district court further found that the only practical alternative for the short parties to hedge was to purchase csx shares.id.
the fact that the purchasing of csx shares was the only practical alternative for short parties to hedge,as found by the district court,is not a circumstance that differentiates the swaps here from equity swaps generally.other hedging methods for short parties exist,but these methods are exceptional.henry hu bernard black,the new vote buying empty voting and hidden morphable ownership,cal.moreover,they also appear to involve derivatives,swaps,stock options,or stock futures,that may result in the purchasing of referenced shares as a hedge by other parties further down in the chain of transactions.id.the existence of other hedging methods does not affect the analysis,therefore,because the arguments proffered by csx and the district court are as applicable to these hedge shares as they are to a first short party purchase of hedge shares.
in any event,a short party purchasing of shares is the most practical and common method of hedging,and long parties will expect that it will be used,if not by the immediate short party,then by another down the line.as a result,the district court ruling renders the long party to virtually all equity swaps a beneficial owner of such swaps.thus,my discussion of the legal meaning of beneficial owner will assume that long parties expect short parties to hedge by buying shares.
there appears to be no generally accepted or universal definition of the term beneficial owner.like the term fiduciary,it is very,suggesting no more perhaps than that a power,to vote shares or an asset be used for the benefit of the beneficial owner.sec chenery.but to say that a man is a fiduciary only begins analysis it gives direction to further inquiry.to whom is he a fiduciary what obligations does he owe as a fiduciary in what respect has he failed to discharge these obligations and what are the consequences of his deviation from duty 
in the present context,there are two sec rules that apply rules a and b.see d a,b.these rules were in effect at the time of the district court decision and,as discussed supra,were repromulgated in pursuant to the dodd frank amendment to section.
sec rule a defines beneficial owner and provides 
for the purposes of sections d and g of the act a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who,directly or indirectly,through any contract,arrangement,understanding,relationship,or otherwise has or shares 
voting power which includes the power to vote,or to direct the voting of,such security,
investment power which includes the power to dispose,or to direct the disposition of,such security.
to reiterate,the swap agreements in the instant case do not obligate short parties to purchase shares as a hedge,to sell such shares either at a particular time or to the long party,or to vote those shares as the long party desires.the issue here is whether,under rule a,such swaps accord the long party investment or voting power over the hedge shares when the short party purchases referenced shares as a hedge.
a investment power 
csx argues that it was inevitable that tci swap counterparties would buy csx shares to hedge their short swap positions and then would sell those shares when tci closed out its swaps.brief of cross appellee at.tci had,csx concludes,the economic ability to cause its short counterparties to buy and sell the csx shares and therefore had investment power over those shares.id.
csx asserts that expectations based on the incentives of counterparties to buy and sell shares qualify,for the purposes of rule a,as the power to direct the disposition of those shares.d a.i disagree.
both literally and in the context of the term beneficial ownership and section d concerns over control,this argument gives too much breadth to the term direct the disposition of.to direct something,or to influence it,even indirectly,one generally must have some measure of active control,and,in the context of section d and swaps,that control must be exercisable in the interests of the long party.see filing and disclosure requirements relating to beneficial ownership,securities act release,exchange act release,investment company act release,section d disclosure is required from any person who has the ability to change or influence control interpretive release on rules applicable to insider reporting and trading,exchange act release,beneficial ownership under section d emphasizes the ability to control or influence the voting or disposition of the securities.
influence must also be interpreted in the context of section d concern over control transactions.no one would dream that the author of a weekly column providing stock tips that reliably cause investors to buy and sell the stocks mentioned was the beneficial owner of the shares bought and sold even though the column influence d,not to say caused,the purchases and sales a relationship that leaves short parties free to act in whatever way they deem to be in their with regard to purchases and sales of referenced shares also does not fit within the concept of beneficial ownership in the long party.likewise,a swap agreement that accords complete freedom to the short parties to act in their with regard to purchases and sales of referenced shares does not confer beneficial ownership in the long party in any sense in which those words are commonly used.
rather,without an agreement or understanding with regard to hedging or unwinding,equity swaps leave the short counterparty free to act solely in its.absent an agreement or informal understanding committing the banks to buy shares to hedge their swaps or to sell those shares to the long party when the swaps terminated,the funds possessed only the power to predict with some confidence the purchase of those shares as a hedge,not the power to direct such a purchase,much less to direct those shares disposition.the long counterparties act of entering into a swap,therefore,falls well short of directing the short counterparties to purchase the stock.
long counterparties may well expect short counterparties to hedge their swap positions by buying the shares involved in an amount roughly equal to those specified in the swap.however,as noted supra,alternative hedging methods exist and are sometimes used.see,caiola citibank,cir hu black,cal.at.as noted,see note,supra,these alternative methods may lead to a third party,whose identity is unknown to the,buying hedge shares.had the banks chosen,for whatever reason,not to hedge their short swap positions with a purchase of shares,not to sell all their hedge shares once the swaps had terminated,to alter their hedging methods and sell the hedge shares before the swaps were unwound,or to sell those shares to a competing acquirer of csx,the funds would have lacked any means,legal or moral,to compel the banks to alter that choice or even to inform the funds of their actions.see hu black,cal.at.thus,the sort of power that csx attributes to the funds does not fit within the language to direct the disposition of the csx shares.d a.
csx recognizes the need to establish a nexus between influencing a sale of the short party hedge shares upon unwinding and the long party control ambitions by arguing that,in the inducing of those sales,the funds exercised investment power by materially facilitat ing the funds rapid and acquisition of a physical position upon the termination of the swaps.brief of cross appellee at.whether or not the alleged material facilitation would run afoul of the reliance electric test,see supra,or would provide a sufficient nexus to the term investment power to constitute beneficial ownership,d a,the material facilitation claimed here substantially overstates the effect of acquiring long positions in equity swaps.
equity swaps allow the short party to retain its hedge shares or dispose of them at the highest price available.thus,the long party choices for acquiring actual shares in the referenced company are either to go into the open market or to pay the short party no less than the open market price.
buying or selling by the short party may affect the availability and price of shares,but hardly constitutes the claimed material facilitation.if the market for the shares is liquid,as will often be the case,then rapid acquisition of those shares would be possible regardless of the sale of shares used to hedge swap positions.thus,such a sale would have little practical effect on the long party ability to acquire shares.if the market is highly illiquid,then potential short parties would find it very costly to acquire the shares and thus either would not acquire shares to hedge their short swap positions or,more likely,would refuse to enter into such swap agreements 
if the market illiquidity is more moderate,then closing out swap agreements may provide a degree of confidence that a block of shares will go on the market.however,purchasing this confidence will be very expensive,because keeping individual short parties under section d percent threshold may require using several short counterparties,who will be competing with each other for limited available shares and will pass the resulting increased hedging costs on to the prospective long party.moreover,if the long party purpose is to ensure the availability of shares when making its acquisition move,the ultimate effect of these swap stratagems may be only to reduce market illiquidity for a competing acquirer perhaps an acquirer that is in league with the firm management or even management itself who,having avoided the costs of the swaps,will be better positioned to make its own bid.
moreover,equity swaps will not lower a long party costs of acquisition.the basis for csx claim that these swaps allow long parties to acquire shares at a low price is unclear.it may be based on the belief that unwinding the swaps will momentarily increase the market supply of shares and thus lower those shares market price.however,if the swap unwinding is likely to lower the prices of the referenced shares,then the short party,who,as a seller,will suffer from that downward slippage in prices,will insist on passing those foreseeable extra hedging costs along to the long party in the form of higher interest payments,leaving long parties on the average in much the same or worse economic position as if they had simply bought the shares directly,without a detour through a equity swap position.in other words,equity swaps,without more,are not a substitute for the ownership of shares by parties seeking to control a corporation.control still requires the purchase of shares on the open market,as happened in the instant case,or from the short party at the open market price,thus causing the party seeking control to bear the costs of both the swaps and the shares.
in the absence of some other agreement governing the disposition of shares purchased to hedge a swap position,merely having a long position in a equity swap does not constitute having the power,directly or indirectly,to direct the disposition of shares that a counterparty purchases to hedge its swap positions,and thus does not constitute having investment power for purposes of rule a.d a.
b voting power 
the district court found no evidence of explicit agreements between tci and the banks committing the banks to vote their shares in a specified way.csx,d at.nevertheless,csx argues that tci ability to select counterparties gave it voting power,d a,over the counterparties hedge shares.
in fact,tci eventually consolidated its swap holdings in citibank and deutsche bank.tci hope d that deutsche bank would vote in tci favor because a hedge fund internal to deutsche bank,austin friars,also had investments in csx.brief of cross appellee at.csx argues further that when tci chose its other swap counterparties,it selected banks that it knew were sympathetic to its voting objectives.id.at.csx concedes that some of these counterparties had policies that prohibited them from voting their shares but argues that the effective removal of these counterparties shares from the voting pool left tci in a better position than if the votes of those shares had been left to chance.i disagree on both counts.
that a short party predisposes it to vote in favor of positions taken by a prospective long counterparty is insufficient,on its own,to show a transfer of voting power to the long counterparty for purposes of section d and rule a.to hold otherwise would distort both the term beneficial owner and the word power.a short party is not an obligation to vote as the long party would desire.nor is it a right in the long party to compel the short party to vote in a particular way indeed,were another putative acquirer to appear in competition with the long party,the long party might well find that the short party was now at odds with its own.see hu black,cal.at.
purchases by a short party with a policy against voting shares held solely as a hedge will not increase the voting power of a long party shares.abstaining can have influence only with regard to shares that,if not purchased by a short party as a hedge,would have been voted against the wishes of the long party.because the hypothetical voting intentions of persons from whom the abstaining short parties purchased their shares on the open market are unknown,this asserted influence over shareholder votes is entirely speculative and hardly qualifies as voting power.
the facts that the funds hoped that deutsche bank would vote in the desired way,or that the funds entered into equity swap agreements with counterparties believed to be inclined to vote as the funds desired,do not constitute the requisite power to direct the counterparties vote.see d a.indeed,the facts indicate the opposite when tci realized that it needed to exercise control and decided to wage a proxy battle,it started unwinding its swaps and buying shares in order to vote the shares as it pleased,indicating that the funds swap positions did not give the power,directly or indirectly,to direct the voting of the counterparties csx shares.id.
finally,i note that my conclusion parallels congress earlier decision to exclude swaps in determining whether a party is a percent beneficial owner,for purposes of section,triggering its reporting and disgorgement provisions,while requiring percent owners to report swap holdings and to disgorge profits in trading them.see supra note.
while rule a sets forth the criteria for beneficial ownership of a security,rule b sets forth criteria for being deemed such a beneficial owner 
any person who,directly or indirectly,creates or uses a trust,proxy,power of attorney,pooling arrangement or any other contract,arrangement,or device with the purpose of sic effect of divesting such person of beneficial ownership of a security or preventing the vesting of such beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of section d or g of the act shall be deemed for purposes of such sections to be the beneficial owner of such security.
rule b is one of a large number of historical and contemporary rules and regulations,or preliminary notes to them,that seek to prohibit plan s or scheme s to evade statutory provisions or sec rules and regulations the purpose of such evasion provisions is to effectuate statutory policies where sec rules or regulations may not literally cover an unforeseen structure of a transaction or the creation of unforeseen instruments that fall within the regulated area but outside the literal terms of the pertinent regulatory provisions.
evasion provisions are methods of closing unforeseen loopholes that seek to use form to evade substance or to comply with technicalities while violating the spirit or intent of regulatory provisions.as such,there are two important points to be made about them.first,evasion provisions do not expand the permissibly regulable area.second,they are not subject to the canon of construction that a statutory or regulatory provision must be read to have effect and is not superfluous.new york state restaurant ass new york city bd.of health,cir quoting apw potter,cir a basic tenet of statutory construction,equally applicable to regulatory construction,is that a text should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant,and so that one section will not destroy another unless the provision is the result of obvious mistake or error.evasion provisions may be superfluous in actual practice because there are no loopholes.
there is no contention that the funds equity swap arrangements had the purpose or effect of divesting,d b,tci of beneficial ownership of the csx shares that tci counterparties purchased.therefore,the issue under rule b is whether those swap arrangements had the purpose or effect of preventing the vesting,of beneficial ownership in the short parties hedge shares.
rule b must be read in the context of both section d,which provides the underlying authority for the rule promulgation,and of section,as discussed at length supra.as that discussion indicated,a person or group triggers obligations under sections and by conduct.
at one end of a spectrum of relevant conduct raising section d issues,a party,or parties to a group,may decide to take steps toward the acquisition of a company.as noted above,they may plan to buy a significant block of shares well in excess of percent.they may buy percent of the company shares but stop there solely to avoid disclosure.they may arrange and make preliminary inquiries of large shareholders that may facilitate the rapid acquisition of shares once the desired moment to strike has arrived and before the disclosure period has expired.none of this triggers section d disclosure until ten days after the percent threshold has been passed,despite being steps in pursuit of an acquisition and fully designed literally to prevent the vesting of ownership of percent in order to avoid disclosure.
at the other end of the spectrum,a party or group contemplating acquisition of a company may provide funds to another party or parties to buy shares with the understanding that the buyer s will retain them in the buyer name,to be conveyed to the acquirer when so directed and without the nominal buyer s bearing any risk.whether or not various aspects of such a transaction would be legally enforceable,such a sham would trigger the disclosure requirements of section d if the shares held by the parties in the aggregate exceeded percent.in this example,the understanding between the parties places the ostensible seller comfortably within the meaning of the term beneficial owner,because the buyer has obligated itself to retain the shares in order to reconvey them to the seller.the underlying contract would also make the party behind the scheme part of a group with the buyer,as discussed infra.in my view,the funds equity swap agreements with the banks fall closer to the first hypothetical on the spectrum for purposes of section d.
again,for the funds to be deemed a beneficial owner under rule b there must be evidence both that their purpose in entering the swap agreements was to prevent the vesting of beneficial ownership and that the intended prevention was part of a plan or scheme to evade,d b,the section d disclosure requirements.
the district court found overwhelming evidence that the funds entered into the swap agreements at least in major part,for the purpose of preventing the vesting of beneficial ownership of csx shares in tci and as part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of section d csx,d at.the district court rested this conclusion upon the following evidence i tci chief financial officer once said that a reason to use swaps is that they provide the ability to purchase without disclosure ii tci emails had discussed the need to limit the size of swap agreements with individual counterparties in order to avoid those counterparties having to disclose their holdings of shares purchased for hedging purposes iii tci acquired only percent of csx shares below section d percent reporting threshold until tci was ready to disclose its position and iv tci admitted that one of its motivations for avoiding disclosure by its swap counterparties was a concern that disclosure would drive up the market price of csx shares and thus increase tci cost of purchasing csx shares later.id.at.
conduct violating rule b must also include a plan or scheme to evade the section d reporting requirements.d b.the district court concluded that tci purchases were part of such a plan or scheme to evade.csx,d at.it stated that no one suggests that tci did nothing more than enter into an equity swap,and that a t a minimum,it entered into the equity swap agreements rather than buying stock for the purpose,perhaps among others,of avoiding the disclosure requirements of section d by preventing the vesting of beneficial ownership in tci.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
this view of evasion under rule b is extraordinarily expansive.to be sure,tci wanted to avoid disclosure and constrained its trading activities accordingly.in fact,the intent to avoid disclosure under section d is ubiquitous.quite apart from wanting to conceal acquisition tactics,a desire to avoid the expense of disclosure is inevitable.but preventing the vesting of beneficial ownership in shares must mean more than what the district court described.at a minimum,the transaction must include a component that provides a substantial equivalence of the rights of ownership relevant to control,or include steps that stop short of,or conceal,the vesting of ownership,while nevertheless ensuring that such ownership will vest at the signal of the owner.conduct lacking such a component or steps does not violate the statute even when fully intended to avoid disclosure.reliance,at liability can not be imposed simply because the investor structured his transaction with the intent of avoiding liability under b.
the district court rationale depended so heavily on the funds intent to avoid disclosure that it found it unnecessary to decide whether equity swaps constituted the equivalence of beneficial ownership of shares absent a desire not to disclose.csx,d at.the district court strongly implied that it did.it simply held that such swaps prevented the vesting of beneficial ownership a characteristic common to all acts and was intended to avoid disclosure an everpresent state of mind.id.at.the intent to avoid disclosure can not constitute a violation of the statute when the underlying transaction does not provide the party with the substantial equivalence of the rights of ownership relevant to control.that is clearly the meaning of reliance electric.
i am aware of no sec guidance establishing the meaning of evade in rule b,nor has our caselaw addressed the issue.in applying evasion provisions,the commission appears to borrow doctrine from the tax evasion context,in particular,the business purpose and substance over form doctrines.see generally gregory helvering.holding that when the form of a transaction does not comport with its substance,the substance of the transaction controls for tax liability purposes.for example,in what is perhaps its earliest interpretive guidance,the commission suggested that a transaction would be interpreted as an attempt to evade registration requirements under the act if it was not deemed bona fide,even if it might comply with the literal conditions of the act.letters of general counsel discussing application of section a,securities act release,wl,at,citing gregory helvering.
similar analyses can also be seen in more recent commission statements.for example,in a release concerning regulation s,the commission stated that the pertinent evasion provision would preclude an exemption under regulation s where factors indicated that the economic or investment risk never shifted to the offshore purchaser,and that the securities as a matter of substance as opposed to form never left the united states problematic practices under regulation s,securities act release.in a adjudication,the commission stated that regulation s shelters only bona fide overseas transactions it is not a haven for any foreign stock distribution that is part of a plan to evade the registration provisions of the securities act.in re weeks,initial decision release,wl,at,emphasis in original,aff,in re hesterman,securities act release,exchange act release,wl.similarly,in addressing the applicability of the evasion provision under rule,the commission stated that the provision applies when the substance of a transaction is contrary to the rule even though the transaction is structured so as to comply with the rule technical requirements,such as when the transaction is a sham designed to create the illusion that it should be exempt.letter from jacob stillman,solicitor,office of the counsel of the sec,to karon bowdre,dist.court for the dist.of,in re healthsouth sec,no.cv be s,at.
in sum,as pertinent to the instant matter,evasion provisions may apply where a transaction,while in technical compliance with a rule,still evades its underlying policies.for example,the sec staff has stated that it does not seem to us to be necessarily sinister to avail oneself of a valid registration exemption so long as the public policy as expressed in the act is not frustrated.hamelly,sec no action letter,wl,at.
evasion provisions must be read in light of the underlying statutory or regulatory provision.as explained above,there are many perfectly legal methods of intentionally avoiding disclosure under section d.section d is designed to compel disclosure of holdings involving percent beneficial ownership interests.it does not require disclosure of control ambitions absent such holdings.in that light,evasion suggests a transaction with the ownership characteristics and benefits intended to be regulated,or steps to create a false appearance of the transaction or the persons entering into it to avoid compliance with the regulation reporting requirements.see letter from brian breheny,deputy,sec div.of,as amicus curiae to lewis kaplan,dist.court for the dist.of june,csx v.the children inv.fund mgmt,et,doc.cv,at.
if the transaction under scrutiny does not have substantially the characteristics or expected benefits that are intended to be regulated,then an evasion provision simply does not apply.evasion of section d,d,is not present in equity swaps because the swaps themselves provide no means of exercising control.as explained in the discussion of rule a,an owner of such swaps can not seek to exercise control without buying the actual shares in an open competitive market.in the present case,when the funds could not persuade csx to change its policies,they had to make actual
