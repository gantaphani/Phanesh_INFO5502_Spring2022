this appeal arises from an attempt to enforce a settlement agreement signed by plaintiffs appellees william and patricia hendrickson,the united states,and the district court more than thirty years ago.in,the district court clearly indicated its approval of the terms of a settlement agreement resolving plaintiffs suit against the united states in,plaintiffs allege,the united states fell out of compliance with certain payment obligations contained in that agreement.this case requires us to decide whether the actions taken by the district court in verbally expressing approval of the settlement terms,dismissing the case on the merits in a brief order,and subsequently signing and the parties settlement agreement sufficed to retain jurisdiction over the enforcement of the agreement.because the district court order of dismissal failed expressly to retain jurisdiction or to incorporate the terms of the agreement,and because the district court of the settlement agreement took place after the court had already relinquished jurisdiction over the case and was thus ineffective to retain it,we conclude that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the enforcement of the settlement agreement.accordingly,we vacate the district court orders enforcing the agreement and denying the united states motion for reconsideration,and we remand to the district court with instructions to transfer this case to the court of federal claims.
background 
in,william hendrickson and patricia hendrickson brought an action against the united states in the united states district court for the western district of new york pursuant to the federal tort claims act,b.plaintiffs sought monetary damages from the united states for injuries sustained in an automobile accident.the case proceeded to trial in.after two and a half days of trial,however,on march,the parties informed the district court that they had reached a settlement.
at the march hearing,the district court michael telesca,judge,informed that the united states was to provide periodic future payments as part of the settlement,told the parties to s pread the settlement on the record.after hearing the general terms of the agreement and ascertaining that plaintiffs consented to them,the district court stated,i will approve it.i will dismiss the action and i think it an excellent settlement for you.the court then informed counsel that an order of discontinuance would be entered,so there wo be anything else for you to do here.this matter is settled here and discontinued off our calendar.whatever paperwork you have to do,do it between the two of you.
a few days later,on april,the clerk of court entered an order of dismissal signed by the district judge.the order read,in its entirety,the court having been advised by the counsel for the parties that the above action has been settled it is ordered that this action is hereby dismissed without costs and on the merits.j.the april order of dismissal is the last entry to appear on the district court docket sheet.
on april,nearly a month later,the parties signed and submitted to the district court a stipulation for compromise settlement pursuant to settlement agreement that provided the final terms of the settlement,including the precise amounts of the payments the united states had agreed to make.paragraph of the settlement agreement provided that t he execution of this agreement and approval by the court to provide such future periodic payments shall constitute a complete release regarding any future claims arising from the events that had resulted in plaintiffs pending suit.the district court signed the settlement agreement on the same date it was submitted,underneath a notation that read so ordered.the settlement agreement,for unknown reasons,does not appear on the district court docket sheet.pursuant to its terms,the united states agreed,inter alia,to provide for periodic future payments to plaintiffs by purchasing an annuity from executive life insurance company of new york elny.the united states purchased such an annuity,and for years plaintiffs received monthly payments from elny.
the matter returned to federal court in october,almost years after the parties settlement,when plaintiffs filed a motion in the western district,on the same docket,styled a motion to enforce a compromise settlement.in support of this motion,plaintiffs filed an affidavit stating that elny was undergoing liquidation,and that plaintiffs annuity payments had been reduced by fifty percent as a result.plaintiffs alleged that,pursuant to the settlement agreement,the united states was obligated to make up the difference between the periodic payments promised in the agreement and the amounts being paid by elny.the united states,in response,urged the district court to deny plaintiffs motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the district court had failed,in,to take the steps required to maintain jurisdiction over enforcement of the settlement agreement under the supreme court decision in kokkonen guardian life insurance of america,

discussion 
we review de novo a district court legal determination regarding its own subject matter jurisdiction.rogers petroleo brasileiro,cir.federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction that possess only that power authorized by constitution and statute.kokkonen,at citation omitted.in keeping with this principle,a district court does not automatically retain jurisdiction to hear a motion to enforce a settlement agreement simply by virtue of having disposed of the original case.in re am.express fin.advisors sec,cir.instead,a motion to enforce a settlement agreement is fundamentally a claim for breach of a contract,part of the consideration of which was dismissal of an earlier federal suit,kokkonen,at,and therefore requires its own basis for jurisdiction,id.at.
in some circumstances,that basis may be found in the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction,which allows a district court to decide matters that are factually interdependent with another matter before the court,or to take actions necessary to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.id.at.but to retain ancillary jurisdiction over enforcement of a settlement agreement,kokkonen prescribes that a district court order of dismissal must either expressly retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement,or incorporate the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.id.at see also streeteasy,chertok,cir reiterating these two kokkonen alternatives.
the district court in this case,and plaintiffs in their briefing,endeavor to fashion a third category of cases in which a district court may retain ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement cases in which the court has placed its judicial imprimatur on the agreement.hendrickson,wl,at.the district court relied on our decision in perez westchester county,which it construed as holding that where the district court judge judicially
