defendant petitioner,the roman catholic diocese of albany,new york,petitions this court for a writ of mandamus directing the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions,iii,judge to dismiss the case against it for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court found the diocese at home in vermont,and therefore subject to general jurisdiction in that state,based on occasional worship services held there by a small number of priests associated with the diocese and other limited contacts.the district court jurisdictional analysis is clearly erroneous.subjecting the diocese to suit and the resultant foray into sensitive documents investigations into allegations of sexual abuse by its employees when the case would be if brought in new york likely the only state with jurisdiction constitutes exceptional circumstances warranting the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus.a writ of mandamus is the only adequate means for the diocese to prevent that irreparable harm.the clarity of the district court error,taken together with the substantial confidentiality interests at stake which are amplified by the fact that the case against the diocese is unlikely to ultimately proceed to trial in any forum,establish that the diocese has a clear and indisputable right to the writ.
accordingly,we grant the diocese petition for a writ of mandamus,vacate the september,order of the district court,and instruct the district court to grant the diocese motion to dismiss the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction.
michael shovah filed suit in the united states district court for the district of vermont against the diocese and its former priest,gary mercure,alleging that mercure transported shovah when he was a minor sometime in the late from new york to vermont for the purpose of sexually abusing him,and did sexually abuse him.shovah asserted only general not specific jurisdiction over the diocese the diocese alleged wrongs breach of fiduciary duty to shovah by permitting mercure to hold himself out as a roman catholic priest and negligent supervision of mercure did not arise from its contacts with vermont.
the diocese is a new york special act corporation with its principal office in albany,new york.it covers fourteen counties in new york,and does not own real property,maintain an office,or have any financial accounts in vermont.each parish in the diocese constitutes a separate religious corporation that owns its real property,establishes its own operating budget,hires and supervises its own employees,and relies on its own parishioners for charitable contributions.from through,six of the diocese more than parishes were located near the vermont border,and served a total of parishioners who resided in vermont those parishioners constitute of the six parishes combined registered parishioners.from through,the six border parishes employed vermont residents,used a total of vermont vendors in contrast to the vendors,and accepted advertisements from eleven vermont merchants including a barber shop,a pizza parlor,a chiropractor,a law firm,and a funeral home for publication in church materials.
during those ten years,the diocese weekly newspaper,the evangelist,had a weekly circulation of forty of those subscribers were vermont residents.during the same period,the diocese received or of its more than million in philanthropic gifts from vermonters.twelve vermont students enrolled in diocesan schools.
between and,at least thirteen of the diocese approximately priests conducted a combined total of sixteen services of worship in vermont.in addition,from july to february,the diocese authorized father zelker,a new york priest,to celebrate sunday morning mass at a vermont church.father zelker neither served nor was ever designated as a pastor of the vermont church.
following jurisdictional discovery,the diocese moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction.in opposition,shovah pressed a jurisdictional predicate based on diocesan employees working and living in vermont,diocesan publications being sent to vermont residents,diocese parishes accepting advertising from vermont vendors,and diocesan parishioners,students and contributors residing in vermont.
the district court denied the diocese motion to dismiss.although the court acknowledged that the diocese maintains no financial or physical foothold in the state,and that its direct contacts with the state have been limited,it concluded that father zelker weekly masses that ended in and the sixteen services of worship conducted by thirteen diocese priests over a period were imputable to the diocese and together were sufficiently continuous and systematic to render the diocese at home in vermont.shovah mercure,cv,wl.based primarily on those two sets of contacts,the court found that shovah had sufficiently pled jurisdiction and then declined to address whether the parishes contacts were imputable to the diocese and could also serve as a jurisdictional basis for the action.id.at.
the court thereafter denied the diocese motion for certification of interlocutory appeal under b,and ordered the diocese to,inter alia,produce documents,dating back to,reflecting allegations involving sexual abuse of minors by any diocese employees,and the details of any resulting investigations.see shovah mercure,d.
the diocese then filed this petition for a writ of mandamus and moved for expedited consideration of its petition.on december,we granted the diocese motion to expedite,and,on january,this panel sua sponte stayed all district court proceedings pending consideration of the petition.

three conditions circumscribe the writ the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to attain the relief it desires the issuing court,in the exercise of its discretion,must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances and the petitioner must demonstrate that the right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.cheney,at brackets,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
each is satisfied here.
harm that can not be prevented by post judgment relief 
the diocese urges that mandamus is the only means of relief because a appeal would do nothing to alleviate the harm of having to litigate claims that should have been dismissed at the outset,or the harm to employees and former employees from the disclosure of highly sensitive personal information.pet.thus,the diocese stresses,discovery will essentially let the cat out of the bag.id.mandamus is the only means for the diocese to obtain the relief it seeks.
first,the diocese can not challenge the district court denial of its motion to dismiss by means of an interlocutory appeal.we have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the district courts.thus,our jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the existence of a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal quotation marks omitted.and,as relevant here,denial of a motion to dismiss,even when the motion is based upon jurisdictional grounds,is not immediately reviewable.catlin united states.see also wabtec faiveley transp.malmo ab,cir.
further,the diocese rightly does not assert that the order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine.to fall within the small class of decisions excepted from the rule,the order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers,at quoting abney united states,d.setting aside the first two requirements,the order does not involve an asserted right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,and therefore would be reviewable upon entry of a final judgment.united states punn,cir.
second,even if the order qualified for certification under b,the certification decision is entirely a matter of discretion for the district court,and,here,the district court denied the diocese certification request.
finally,an appeal after a final judgment albeit available is not,under these circumstances,an adequate means for the diocese to obtain the relief it seeks.t he type of harm that is deemed irreparable for mandamus purposes typically involves an interest that is both important to and distinct from the resolution of the merits of the case.linde arab bank,plc,cir.
we have previously issued a writ of mandamus to prevent the disclosure of confidential reports of undercover new york city police officers protected by the privilege.see in re the city of new york,cir.we observed that the petitioning parties had no other adequate means to attain relief because a remedy after final judgment can not unsay the confidential information that has been revealed.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,timing matters once the cat is out of the bag,the right against disclosure can not later be vindicated.rajaratnam,cir emphasis in original.
here,the district court issued an expansive discovery order requiring,inter alia,the diocese to disclose investigations of child sexual abuse involving the diocese employees,including the identifying names and addresses of the investigators and summaries of the oral and written statements taken during the course of the investigation.there is no evidence that this information has previously been disclosed.the cat is still in the bag,and the ensuing litigation will inevitably let it out.
moreover,unlike a tort case,this litigation implicates significant confidentiality interests for the diocese,its priests,and more alarmingly other victims and their families who would likely be subjected to distressing depositions,revisiting pasts that would not otherwise be revisited in a case solely against mercure.furthermore,the issue is not one of mere geography the only other forum where jurisdiction would likely lie is new york,and,there,shovah claims against the diocese would be.
in new york,the statute of limitations applicable to a sexual liability claim is the statute found in,and the statute of limitations applicable to negligence claims is the statute found in.under new york,shovah claims would have been tolled until he reached the age of.see.therefore,even if shovah was a newborn in,his claims would have accrued at the latest in years later he,however,did not file his complaint until.
of course,the district court could reduce any harm by,inter alia,limiting discovery,sealing records,and issuing protective orders the diocese could,likewise,do so through additional mandamus litigation in this court.the prospective harm,however,will result not simply from disclosure,but also from the invasive inquiries that necessarily precede it which relief would do nothing to cure.while invasiveness and unpleasantness are not reasons to deny discovery,here disclosure would likely serve no purpose.thus,any corrective measures would only mitigate a harm that should have been,and still can be,avoided altogether.
ii.mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances 
although the general rule is that appellate courts should avoid determining jurisdictional issues on a petition for mandamus,in re ivy,cir,the unique circumstances of this case,as noted above,counsel in favor of immediate review.the district court personal jurisdiction determination is patently erroneous.moreover,its misapplication of the personal jurisdiction standard set forth in goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,d,and recently clarified in daimler ag bauman,d decided after the district court decision,offers an opportunity to reaffirm the contours of general jurisdiction.it is this extraordinary particularly serious harms preventable only through issuance of a writ of mandamus,the clarity of the district court error,and the need for guidance from this court regarding the proper general personal jurisdiction inquiry,particularly as applied to religious and other charitable organizations that renders this case ripe for mandamus relief 
iii.the diocese has a clear and indisputable right to the writ 
the district court clear ly and indisputabl y abused its discretion in finding the diocese at home in vermont.a district court abuses its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence or renders a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,f d cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court indisputabl y employed an erroneous view of the law when it denied the diocese motion to dismiss the diocese has a clear and indisputable right to a writ of mandamus.cheney,at.
personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant in a case requires a inquiry.we first look to the statute of the forum state.see licci ex rel.licci lebanese canadian bank,sal,cir.if jurisdiction lies,the second step is to analyze whether personal jurisdiction comports with the due process clause of the united states constitution.chloe queen bee of beverly hills,llc,cir.
vermont statute.stat.ann.tit.b reflects a clear policy to assert jurisdiction over individual defendants to the full extent permitted by the due process clause.metro.life ins.robertsonceco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we thus look to whether the court exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant satisfies the requirements of due process.id.
in the area of personal jurisdiction,t he canonical opinion remains international shoe washington,in which the supreme court held that a state may authorize its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over an defendant if the defendant has certain minimum contacts with the state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.goodyear.at quoting int l shoe,u.at.
there are two types of personal jurisdiction general and specific.specific jurisdiction,which shovah concedes is lacking,depends on an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy,principally,activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum state and is therefore subject to the state regulation.id.at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,specific jurisdiction cases are limited to those involving issues deriving from,or connected with,the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.id.
by contrast,a court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign sisterstate or corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the state are so continuous and systematic as to render them essentially at home in the forum state.id.quoting int l shoe,at.because general jurisdiction is not related to the events giving rise to the suit,courts impose a more stringent minimum contacts test.in re terrorist attacks on september,cir.
goodyear made clear that only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to jurisdiction there.daimler ag.at.in daimler ag,the supreme court further noted that since international shoe,it has declined to stretch general jurisdiction beyond limits traditionally recognized.id.at.for an individual,the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual domicile for a corporation even a religious one,it is an equivalent place,one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.goodyear.at.
