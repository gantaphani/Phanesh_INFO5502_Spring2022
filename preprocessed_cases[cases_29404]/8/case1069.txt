heriberto silva brought suit in the district of puerto rico against his employer,encyclopedia britannica,and encyclopedia britannica collectively britannica,for breach of contract.the contract,which granted appellant commissions for selling products manufactured by britannica,contained the following and clause this agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of the state of illinois and all actions involving this agreement must be brought in the state of illinois.the district court concluded that the clause was valid,enforceable and mandatory and dismissed the suit without prejudice.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
discussion 
the prevailing view towards contractual clauses is that such clauses are prima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to be unreasonable under the circumstances.bremen zapata,d appellant advances three arguments against enforcing the clause here.first,according to silva,britannica waived its venue defense by failing to assert it timely and properly.silva also contends that the clause at issue is permissive,rather than mandatory.finally,silva the grounds rejected by the district court in support of his claim that the clause is unreasonable and should not be enforced.we review a district court dismissal based on a clause de novo.lambert kysar,cir.
shortly after commencement of this suit,britannica filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction against all plaintiffs except silva see.b.the court granted the motion as to these plaintiffs,and discovery continued with respect to only silva claims.over a year later,britannica filed the motion to dismiss which is the subject of this appeal.appellant argues that by failing to consolidate this defense with its initial b motion against the other plaintiffs,britannica was barred from raising the issue later by.g,which reads 
a party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party.if a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion,the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted,except a motion as provided in subdivision h hereof on any of the grounds there stated.
silva claims that for the same reason,britannica has waived its defense under.h a,which states that a defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person,improper venue,insufficiency of process,or insufficiency of service of process is waived if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision g.
appellant misconstrues the law of this circuit,under which a motion to dismiss based upon a clause is treated as one alleging the failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under.b lambert,at lfc lessors,pacific sewer maint,cir ninigret development narragansett indian wetuomuck housing authority,cir vacating judgment focusing on clause under rule b for reconsideration of exhaustion of tribal remedies under rule b.consequently,in this circuit,a motion to dismiss by reason of a clause is covered by rule h,which states that a defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under rule a,or by motion for judgment on the pleadings,or at the trial on the merits.h.this provision constitutes an exception to the consolidation requirement of rule g and therefore a motion to dismiss on grounds is not bound to the strict limitations of h see frietsch refco,cir observing that if the motion to dismiss were based on b,defendant would escape the clutches of rule h.
accordingly,a motion to dismiss based on a clause may be raised at any time in the proceedings before disposition on the merits.brown trustees of boston,cir holding that by waiting until after the jury reached its verdict,university had waived its rule b defense.britannica met this requirement by filing its motion to dismiss before the completion of discovery although,as appellant points out,britannica erroneously characterized this motion to dismiss as one based on improper venue,we are not bound by the label below,and agree that the case should have been dismissed.lfc lessors,at citing carr learner,cir.
we next turn to whether the language of the clause is permissive or mandatory.to support his contention in favor of the former,appellant cites our recent opinion in autoridad de energía eléctrica de puerto rico ericsson,cir.in that case,we evaluated a clause which provided the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of puerto rico.this court read that language as an affirmative conferral of personal jurisdiction by consent,and not a negative exclusion of jurisdiction in the federal district court.id.at.appellant argues that the same interpretation applies in the instant case.we disagree.
our holding in ericsson did not create a general rule for clauses,as silva intimates in his brief.rather,we based our conclusion on the specific language of the contract at issue.in fact,we explicitly noted that had they so desired,the parties could easily have drafted the contract to provide for exclusive jurisdiction in the commonwealth courts.id.at.the contract here reflects precisely such a case the word must expresses the parties intention to make the courts of illinois the exclusive forum for disputes arising under the contract.see zapata,at.holding that a contract stating that a ny dispute arising must be treated before the london court of justice required the court to exercise its jurisdiction no further than necessary to enforce the clause emphasis added accord keaty freeport indonesia,cir citing zapata as an example of a situation where the contract,on its face,clearly limit ed actions thereunder to courts of a specified locale.we therefore conclude that the clause is mandatory.
since the motion to dismiss was timely raised and the clause is mandatory,we will uphold the district court decision unless enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust,or the clause is invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.zapata,at.silva points out that the contract contained boilerplate provisions not subject to negotiation and that the clause was in small print on the back of the contract.he also places great weight on the overwhelming bargaining power and influence of britannica in the hiring process to support his view that the clause is unenforceable.these reasons fall short of meeting the required criteria for establishing fraud or overreaching,nor do these reasons render the enforcement of the clause unreasonable and unjust.id.
first,that the clause is a boilerplate provision does not ipso facto render it invalid.it is not the law that one must bargain for each and every written term of a contract.lambert,at internal quotation omitted see also carnival cruise lines,shute,d refusing to find a nonnegotiated clause in a form ticket unenforceable simply because it is not the subject of bargaining.similarly,the placement of the clause on the reverse side of the contract is of little consequence where,as here,it is printed clearly in plain language and in a contract of reasonable length.lambert,at.finally,britannica alleged bargaining power is not relevant on these facts.britannica used its bargaining power to do nothing more than offer an appealing employment opportunity to appellant,and no evidence suggests that he was coerced into entering the agreement.all that remains,then,is an transaction,the terms of which are binding on both parties.as such,the enforcement of those terms is not unreasonable,and hence the case was properly dismissed.
conclusion 
the order of the district court is affirmed.
as the district court noted,there is no conflict between federal common law and puerto rico law regarding the enforceability of clauses.see stereo gema,magnadyne,citing unisys puerto rico ramallo.printing,wl stating that the puerto rico supreme court has adopted the federal jurisprudence regarding general enforceability of clauses.we therefore follow the reasoning of the district court and do no
