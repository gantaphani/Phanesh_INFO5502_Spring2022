a jury rendered a verdict in favor of carmen llerena diaz diaz in this age discrimination action.on appeal,jiten hotel management,jiten challenges the district court jury instructions and the court denial of jiten motion to certify a question of state law to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.we affirm.
facts background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see,sony bmg music entm t tenenbaum,cir.diaz began working for the hotel property located at boston street in dorchester,massachusetts in.during the early years of diaz employment,the hotel was known as the howard johnson hotel and then as the south bay hotel.in,jiten purchased the hotel and operated it as a holiday inn express hie.jiten employed diaz as the hie executive housekeeper,meaning that diaz oversaw the housekeeping staff in a managerial role.she worked under mitesh mitch patel patel,the general manager of the hie.
though diaz and patel seem to have worked well together for several years,their relationship began to deteriorate in.according to diaz,patel became mean and arrogant.he began embarrassing diaz in front of her,screaming at her for seemingly insignificant reasons,and unfairly scrutinizing her work.diaz attributes the change in patel behavior to her age,claiming that patel made a variety of ageist comments to her,including telling her that she looked like an old pumpkin,an old hankie,and old shoes.when diaz changed her hairstyle,patel said that the new hairdo made her look younger.when she hired a housekeeper who was in her fifties,patel said,you re going to convert this hotel into a nursing home.in and,patel told diaz that she was getting old and asked when she was going to retire.patel apparently made similar comments about another senior employee,whom patel referred to as old man.
jiten also stopped giving diaz annual evaluations and raises in,despite the fact that it was company policy to perform an annual evaluation for each employee.in,diaz asked patel whether she would be receiving a raise,and he responded that he would do it later or get to it one of these days and that diaz should not worry.she never received the raise.in,diaz again inquired as to whether she would receive a raise for that year.patel allegedly responded,carmen,you are making too much money,be grateful that you have a job.
diaz eventually reported patel behavior to jiten corporate headquarters.jiten vice president met with diaz and patel but did not take any disciplinary action against patel.a few days after the meeting,the vice president sent diaz a flower arrangement.
though patel brother,chet patel,apparently replaced patel as general manager of the hie in september diaz claims that patel remained a presence at the hotel.she also claims that patel behavior had a effect,causing other employees to discriminate against her,even after patel left.for example,a woman who worked in the laundry room of the hie from until october testified that other employees of the hotel referred to diaz as the old woman and an old lady.in june,diaz overheard the hie sales manager saying that jiten wanted to fire diaz because she was too old and that diaz had requested a raise but the hotel did not want to give it to her.
perhaps most importantly for purposes of this appeal,in april,diaz wrote to chet patel requesting an evaluation and a raise for,as well as an explanation as to why she had not received evaluations or raises in and.chet patel did not respond to the letter,and diaz did not receive an annual evaluation or a raise in.at trial,chet patel admitted that jiten failure to provide evaluations for diaz in,and was contrary to company policy.as for the fact that diaz had not received raises during those same years,jiten vice president testified that the company had been experiencing financial difficulties and that diaz salary had maxed out after years.however,diaz introduced evidence that all of the other members of the management team,who were younger than she was,received an evaluation and a raise at some point between and.she also introduced evidence that six members of the management team specifically received raises in.
jiten terminated diaz in august.after filing a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission and the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad,diaz brought the instant age discrimination action against jiten in federal court.she included claims under the age discrimination in employment act adea,and the massachusetts statute.laws ch,chapter,alleging a hostile work environment and disparate treatment the case proceeded to trial.
at the district court request,the parties briefed the question of whether the court should issue a jury instruction described at more length below with respect to diaz disparate treatment claims under the adea and chapter.the court ultimately issued a instruction on the chapter disparate treatment claim but not on the adea claim.jiten requested an instruction on chapter statute of limitations,which the district court did not issue.
in april,the jury rendered a verdict in favor of diaz only on her state law discrimination claim and awarded her in compensatory damages jiten filed a motion to alter or set aside the judgment to certify to the sjc the question of whether the instruction was proper under state law.the district court denied jiten motion.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
jiten argues that the district court erred by issuing the instruction refusing to certify the question to the sjc and failing to issue the chapter statute of limitations instruction.before turning to those claims,we pause for a moment to note that neither jiten opening brief nor its reply brief addresses what standard of review applies in this case,in violation of federal rule of appellate procedure a b.in any event,jiten appeal fails on the merits.
a.the instruction 
the instruction 
we review jiten preserved challenge to the district court jury instruction de novo,though we will reverse only if we find that the court committed an error that was prejudicial based on a review of the record as a whole.sony bmg music entm t,at quoting.eye ear infirmary qlt phototherapeutics,cir.
to put jiten challenge to the district court instruction in context,we begin with a brief overview of the current status of the framework under state and federal law.a case is one in which an employee alleges that s he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerations.gross fbl fin.once a plaintiff in a case establishes that her membership in a protected class was a motivating factor for an employment action,the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision regardless of the impermissible consideration.see desert palace,costa,price waterhouse hopkins.
price waterhouse,which established the analysis,was a title vii case.the supreme court recently held,in gross,that the framework does not extend to adea cases,because u nlike title vii,the adea text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor.at.thus,diaz was not entitled to and did not receive a instruction with regard to her adea disparate treatment claim.rather,under federal law,she was required to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that age was the cause of the challenged adverse employment action.id.at.
under massachusetts law,however,the analysis survives in age discrimination cases,at least for the time being.in construing chapter,the massachusetts sjc has sometimes looked to federal case law for guidance,see wynn wynn.comm against discrimination,overruled on other grounds by stonehill coll.comm against discrimination,but the sjc frequently do es not follow the reasoning of federal appellate decisions applying title vii,cuddyer stop shop supermarket.in wynn wynn,the sjc did choose to adopt price waterhouse analysis and apply it to all actions under chapter in which the plaintiff,armed with some strong direct evidence of discriminatory bias,demonstrates that at least one factor motivating the employer decision is illegitimate.at.though wynn wynn was a gender discrimination case,jiten does not argue that the sjc limited the applicability of the framework to gender discrimination cases.indeed,the broad language of the wynn wynn opinion does not seem to support such an argument.see id.at.
after the supreme court decided gross,the sjc reexamined the validity of the framework under state law in haddad.wal mart stores.although the sjc recognized that the analysis had generated considerable controversy and criticism and resulted in splits in the united states courts of appeals,id.at,the sjc nonetheless affirmed the lower court issuance of a instruction,id.at.the sjc said the following about the status of the analysis under state law 
in gross fbl fin,citing ongoing difficulties in applying the mixed motive analysis in any context,and the absence of a mixed motive requirement in the federal statute on age discrimination in employment,the united states supreme court determined that a mixed motive analysis is not permitted in age discrimination cases.we do not consider today whether we will retain a mixed motive analysis under massachusetts law.
id.at.though haddad was a gender discrimination case,the opinion did not distinguish between state law gender and age discrimination cases,nor did it suggest that the reasoning in gross might apply to state law age discrimination cases.rather,as we read the opinion,the sjc implicitly affirmed the ongoing validity of the framework in all chapter cases,though it left open the possibility that massachusetts might not retain that framework indefinitely.see id.
because the sjc said,in wynn wynn,that it would follow the guidance of the united states supreme court with respect to the allocation of burdens of proof in cases,at,jiten brief argues that it is reasonable to conclude that the sjc would reject a analysis in the context of age discrimination.but the sjc clearly did not reject the analysis in haddad,and wynn wynn thus remained good law at the time that the district court instructed the jury in this case.
furthermore,jiten reads too much into the sjc statement in wynn wynn.while the sjc did choose to adopt the price waterhouse analysis,that did not mean that the sjc was somehow bound by the supreme court later decision in gross.the sjc has made clear that it routinely does not follow federal law in interpreting chapter.that is true for a number of reasons,including the existence of material differences between the massachusetts statutory scheme and the federal scheme and the legislative directive that is to be applied liberally.cuddyer,at see also id.at citing cases in which the sjc has construed chapter differently than the federal courts have construed title vii.hence,in haddad,the sjc did not adopt gross reasoning,instead leaving for another day the question of whether we will retain a mixed motive analysis under massachusetts law.at.
finally,we note that,from a statutory perspective,it makes sense that the framework might apply to state age discrimination claims but not to federal age discrimination claims.there is just one massachusetts statute that outlaws both age and gender discrimination chapter,whereas two separate statutes outlaw age and gender discrimination in the federal context the adea and title vii.the supreme court conclusion in gross that the framework did not extend to adea claims was premised on the fact that title vii is materially different from the adea with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion.gross.at.that is not the case in the state context.
thus,for purposes of diaz state law age discrimination claim,wynn wynn controlled at the time the district court instructed the jury,and we find no error in the court decision to issue the instruction.see,phoung luc wyndham mgmt,cir a federal court applying state law will not create new rules or significantly expand existing rules.
certification to the sjc 
jiten separately challenges the instruction by arguing that the district court should have certified the question to the sjc,an argument that jiten made below as part of a motion to alter or set aside the judgment.see.e,b.our standard of review here is for abuse of discretion.see negrón almeda santiago,cir abuse of discretion review applies to the denial of a motion to alter or amend the judgment muñiz rovira martinó,cir same for a motion to set aside the judgment steel dematteo const,cir same for the district court decision not to certify a question of law to the sjc.
a federal court may,in its discretion,certify to the sjc a question of massachusetts law that is determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the sjc.see also in re hundley,cir.for the reasons discussed above,this was not an instance in which there was no controlling precedent.in wynn wynn,the sjc established that the framework applies in chapter cases,and in haddad,the sjc implicitly affirmed the framework ongoing validity under massachusetts law.the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to certify the question to the sjc.
b.the statute of limitations instruction 
finally,jiten argues that the district court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the day statute of limitations under chapter.see.laws ch.diaz argues that jiten did not adequately object to the court failure to provide the instruction at trial and that we should therefore review for plain error see,sony bmg music entm t,at.because we find that the standard of review does not alter the outcome,we will assume for the sake of argument that jiten properly preserved the objection and review the claim de novo.id.we need not address whether the district court committed an error under massachusetts law by failing to instruct the jury on the applicable statute of limitations.even assuming that the court erred by omitting the instruction,jiten has not convinced us that the error was prejudicial based on a review of the record as a whole.id.quoting.eye ear infirmary,at.
under massachusetts law,where a plaintiff alleges a pattern of discriminatory conduct,as diaz did here,the continuing violation doctrine applies.pelletier town of somerset.that doctrine permits a person to seek damages for alleged discrimination occurring outside the usual statute of limitations period if the alleged events are part of an ongoing pattern of discrimination,and there is a discrete violation within the statute of limitations period to anchor the earlier claims.id.diaz filed with the mcad on august.thus,in order to recover for discriminatory acts that occurred outside of the statute of limitations period,she needed to demonstrate that at least one discriminatory act occurred no more than days before august,that is to say,on or after october,the alleged timely act or acts had a substantial relationship to the alleged untimely act or acts and any discriminatory acts that occurred outside of the statute of limitations period did not trigger diaz awareness and duty to assert her rights.see,windross barton protective servs,cir 
jiten only raises the first prong of the continuing violation test on appeal,arguing that the jury did not find at least one discriminatory act that took place after october,and thus that the district court failure to provide the instruction was prejudicial.jiten premises its argument on an assumption that t he only reasonable reading of the jury verdict is that it awarded diaz seven percent raises for the years and,when mitch patel was her supervisor,and thus that the last discriminatory act accepted by the jury was the denial of diaz raise in april of,six months too distant in time to support a claim of continuing violation.
however,the verdict form did not require the jury to specify how it was allocating damages between diaz disparate treatment claim and her hostile work environment claim,nor did it ask the jury to differentiate between damages related to lost wages and those related to emotional distress.jiten claims are thus purely speculative and draw too many conclusions from the jury verdict.crowley bean,cir.
