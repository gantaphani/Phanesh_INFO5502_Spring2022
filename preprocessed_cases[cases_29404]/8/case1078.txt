a civil rights suit by inmates in new hampshire state prison ultimately resulted in a consent decree,which was amended in.in response to a suit alleging contempt of that decree,and pursuant to the prison litigation reform act of the plra,prison officials successfully moved to terminate the decree.the principal issue on appeal is when,if ever,must the district court afford inmates who allege current and ongoing violations of federal rights the opportunity to supplement the existing record.
background 
this proceeding has a complex procedural history,which we summarize for the purpose of this appeal.
in,inmates at the new hampshire state prison in concord the prison filed individual civil rights actions later consolidated into a class action against state officials in federal district court pursuant to.laaman helgemoe.in an extensive opinion,the court made specific findings that prison conditions violated inmates eighth amendment rights,id.at,and issued a order specifying required relief,id.at.the order was implemented in a consent decree approved by the court on august,which was later amended by a second consent decree approved on may.judge devine,who had inherited the case from judge bownes,approved the second decree.the amended decree provided that the district court would retain jurisdiction for the purpose of assuring compliance until july.
two weeks prior to the expiration of the district court jurisdiction,the inmates filed a civil contempt motion alleging that prison officials had failed to comply with the decree.although the district court determined the necessary level of compliance to avoid a finding of contempt and held an evidentiary hearing in december of,no order issued.upon judge devine death in february of,the case was reassigned to judge barbadoro,with the motion for contempt still pending.mindful that the plra had significantly changed the rules governing consent decrees addressing prison conditions,judge barbadoro ordered the plaintiffs to explain why the consent decree should not be terminated and the pending motion for contempt be deemed moot.laaman powell,civil b,b,b april,hereinafter laaman,april order.the district court then terminated the decree in a june,order,holding that t he findings called for in b were never made,and that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that a basis currently exists for finding that the decree extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,or that the decree is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct any alleged violations of the plaintiffs federal rights.laaman powell,civil june,hereinafter laaman,june order.plaintiffs,noting that b limits termination in certain cases of current and ongoing violations of federal rights,and claiming that the delay in disposition had prejudiced them unfairly,appealed to this court.
discussion 
first,appellants argue that the plra,specifically b,requires that a district court allow plaintiffs an opportunity to present evidence prior to exercising its termination power under b,and that they were denied this opportunity.second,in the absence of such a statutory mandate,they suggest that the district court abused its discretion here by failing to provide plaintiffs an opportunity to supplement the existing record.third,two remaining issues not directly considered by the district court actual rationale and the scope of further attention.
whether the plra requires that inmates be given an opportunity to supplement the existing record is purely a question of statutory interpretation,and as such,we afford it de novo review.rouse,at.we begin with the language of the statute itself.stowell ives,cir.in so doing,we assume that the words of the statute comport with their ordinary meaning,and that their ordinary meaning accurately expresses legislative intent,fmc holliday,d,only resorting to legislative history or other aids of statutory construction in the case of ambiguity or an unreasonable result,united states charles george trucking,cir.
the plra does not specifically provide for an evidentiary hearing prior to termination of a consent decree.cagle hutto,cir,cert.denied,d.b provides for the immediate termination of prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.however,b expressly limits the court termination power,noting that p rospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the federal right,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation emphasis added.several courts have read these two sections together as creating a gap that might be filled by an evidentiary hearing.see benjamin jacobson,cir,cert.denied sub nom.benjamin kerik,d noting that the b requirement of written findings meant that the immediate termination of b was necessarily less than instantaneous see also berwanger cottey,cir immediate in b does not mean instant,given that court needs time to make finding called for in b.because the plra does not on its face address whether the district court must make these written findings when the conditions of b are met,nor does it explain how a court could make written findings of current conditions on the basis of a stale record,courts have suggested that there are circumstances in which additional evidentiary findings are appropriate or even necessary prior to termination.see hadix johnson,cir gilmore california,cir cagle,at loyd alabama dep t of,cir,cert.denied,d benjamin,at evidence presented at a prior time can not show a violation that is current and ongoing.as a result,the record referred to in b must mean a record reflecting conditions as of the time termination is sought.
the other courts of appeals that have assessed whether the plra requires an evidentiary hearing prior to termination of a consent decree have reached somewhat different results as to when such a hearing is required.in benjamin,the second circuit interpreted b to mean that,when the plaintiffs so request the district must allow the plaintiffs an opportunity to show current and ongoing violations of their federal rights.id.emphasis added see also hadix,at t he party opposing termination must be given the opportunity to submit additional evidence.the eleventh circuit,although it did not find that an evidentiary hearing was mandated by statute,found that a district court refusal to hold such a hearing constituted an abuse of discretion,even when current reports were being provided to the court.see loyd,at.the fourth circuit has placed a higher burden on the plaintiff,holding that a district court may,in its discretion conduct a pretermination evidentiary hearing,but that it at a minimum must hold such a hearing when the party opposing termination alleges specific facts which,if true,would amount to a current and ongoing constitutional violation.cagle,at emphasis added.
although we did not specifically address this issue in rouse,we suggested a similar approach to that taken by the eleventh circuit in loyd,albeit with more weight given to the district court familiarity with the consent order and subsequent proceedings.the rouse plaintiffs had argued that in the absence of findings to satisfy the b burden,the district court should have conducted an inquiry into whether a violation of a federal right exists currently.rouse,at.we noted the district court intimate familiarity with this protracted litigation and its informed evaluation of current prison conditions.id.at.our decision not to require further evidentiary findings was based partly on the fact that the rouse court had been receiving periodic reports as to the incidents covered by the consent decree.id.
we think the approach hinted at in rouse is the correct one.as the
