by july,the parties to this action had settled the underlying dispute,which involved alleged sex discrimination by the,deutsche bank ag and bankers trust company together,the bank,against the,virginia gambale.the parties had therefore entered into a settlement agreement in the united states district court for the southern district of new york reflecting the terms of the settlement.in it,they had agreed that the terms of the settlement would be maintained in confidence.they had also filed with the clerk of court a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to.a ii.
on july,the district court harold baer,judge publicly disclosed some of the settlement terms in the course of ordering,sua sponte,the unsealing of several sealed documents relating to the action.the bank appeals from the district court order,asserting that after the stipulation of dismissal was filed,the court lacked jurisdiction to issue such an order.it also asserts that even if the court had jurisdiction,the order was improper.we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the order unsealing the documents and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.we remand the action to the court,however,with an instruction to maintain under seal the transcript of a conference in which the parties revealed to the court the confidential amount that the bank was to pay gambale in accordance with the confidential settlement agreement,unless all confidential information and direct and indirect references to confidential information are first redacted and no party has otherwise carried its burden of establishing that the document should be sealed in its entirety.
background 
on june,virginia gambale,a former managing director of the bank,brought an action against the bank in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.she alleged that the bank had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and had retaliated against her for complaining about it,in violation of the new york state and new york city human rights laws.on october,during the initial discovery phase of the litigation,the parties executed and the district court so ordered a stipulation and order governing the protection and exchange of confidential material the stipulation of confidentiality.the stipulation of confidentiality permitted the parties to designate any produced documents,information,or deposition testimony as confidential if they thought that such material contained confidential or proprietary information.it also permitted a party producing material labeled as confidential to move for a protective order before the opposing party filed the material.
during the course of discovery,the bank produced documents,some of which it labeled confidential.those documents included the compensation planning charts relating to two bank employees,the compensation history of two bank employees,and four pages of an internal bank study of diversity at the bank,which contained information about the gender composition of the bank employees.gambale deutsche bank ag,civ.hb,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.gambale filed these documents as exhibits to her response in opposition to the bank motion for summary judgment.
on march,based on the stipulation of confidentiality,the bank sought from magistrate judge douglas eaton a protective order requiring that those documents be sealed in the court files.the magistrate judge entered an order providing that u ntil such time as judge baer rules on defendants request that the items be placed permanently under seal,plaintiff will remove the documents from the opposition papers that she files with the court clerk and will file such documents under seal with the clerk.march,stipulation and order pertaining to the filing of documents under seal,at.the order also provided 
upon resolution of the summary judgment motion by judge baer or the trial of the matter,whichever comes first,defendants shall renew before judge baer the request set forth in their march,letter to magistrate judge eaton.this order shall remain in effect pending judge baer issuing a ruling on defendants renewed request.
gambale subsequently requested that magistrate judge eaton order that the entire diversity study be disclosed to her for purposes of discovery.the magistrate judge declined to order full disclosure,concluding that most of the study was privileged.instead,he ordered the bank to produce four additional pages of the study because those pages were not privileged.see april,memorandum and order.the bank did not object to the order.as part of her opposition to the bank motion for summary judgment,gambale filed with the district court the documents that the bank had disclosed pursuant to the magistrate judge order.
by order dated may,the district court granted the bank motion for summary judgment as to gambale claim regarding the allegedly discriminatory appointment of another bank employee to head a particular steering committee.the court denied the motion for summary judgment on gambale many other claims.
according to the bank,on may,the parties jointly advised the court that they had reached a settlement of the action in principle.the bank asserts that the settlement was motivated significantly by its desire to avoid public disclosure at trial of the temporarily sealed documents.the bank also asserts that the district court then advised the parties to appear before it four days later to present a stipulation of discontinuance pursuant to the settlement agreement.by may,the bank says,the parties had executed a confidential settlement and general release agreement the settlement agreement.according to the bank,the settlement agreement contains a of liability clause a confidentiality provision that covers the entire settlement agreement,including the amount that the bank would pay to gambale in settlement of her claims and a clause that provides that any documents filed under seal with the district court shall remain permanently under seal.
on may,the parties appeared before the district court.they advised the court that the litigation had been settled on a confidential basis.they asked the court to retain jurisdiction over the action in order to permit it to appoint a special master to hear future disputes,if any,about settlement payments.
the district court then asked the parties to share with it the specific dollar amount of settlement since at the moment it all confidential.may,transcript,at.the parties did so,with counsel for the bank reiterating that he was disclosing it s ince at the moment it all confidential.id.
the district court judge wondered aloud why the public should not know about discrimination at a major banking institution.a lawyer for one of the parties answered,first,that the settlement agreement contains no admission of liability and,second,that such a disclosure would deter settlement.the district court asked the parties to file letters with it addressing whether the settlement terms should be made public.the transcript of the conference was filed with the district court clerk office under seal.
on may,the bank submitted a letter in support of its position that the settlement agreement should be kept confidential.the bank argued that both parties had agreed that the information would be maintained in confidence and that no public interest favored public disclosure.
according to the bank,at a june,conference,the district court refused to adhere to the parties agreement that the terms of the settlement agreement remain confidential.according to the bank,the court declared that it would disclose the contents of the settlement agreement unless the bank agreed to conduct a global gender review through a third party during several subsequent years.under the district court proposal,the bank would be required to bind itself to provide the results of the review to the court.the court would then either accept the report or reject it and require further affirmative steps to combat discrimination.the bank refused to agree to these conditions.
two days later,on june,the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice the stipulation of dismissal pursuant to.a ii.the bank then sent the district court a letter asserting that,as a result of the stipulation of dismissal,the court no longer had jurisdiction over the action between gambale and the bank.in the bank view,the district court therefore had no authority to permit disclosure of the settlement terms or to unseal any documents related to the action or the settlement.
on june,the district court issued an order permitting the bank to make a motion on or before june,to have magistrate judge eaton protective order made permanent.on june,the bank wrote to the district court restating its position that,in light of the settlement between the parties and the stipulated dismissal,the district court no longer had jurisdiction to consider the status of the sealed documents the bank set forth no argument on the merits as to why,if the district court did indeed retain jurisdiction,the settlement documents should be maintained under seal.
on july,the district court issued an opinion and order unsealing the sealed documents filed by gambale in opposition to the bank motion for summary judgment the unsealing order.gambale,wl,at,dist.lexis,at shortly thereafter,the unsealing order became publicly available from the online databases of westlaw and lexis.despite the settlement agreement confidentiality provisions,the unsealing order explicitly referred to the magnitude of the amount the bank paid gambale in settlement.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at on the eve of trial,the parties agreed to a dollar settlement.the court also disclosed,in general terms,the subjects of the sealed documents,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court reasoned that despite the parties settlement and stipulation of dismissal,the court retained jurisdiction over the documents filed in court in connection with the litigation and access to them,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the court then turned to the merits.it concluded 
first,the sealed documents were judicial documents because the court relied on them in denying in part the bank motion for summary judgment,wl,at,dist.lexis,at detailing the relevance of each of these documents to its ruling on the bank summary judgment motion.as judicial documents,they were entitled to the presumption of public access,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
although the court had given the bank ample opportunity to demonstrate that its privacy interests overcame the presumption of access,it had provided the court with nothing to meet its burden,perhaps under the erroneous hope that if it did not renew its motion to seal documents,the court would have no power to sua sponte unseal the records.the bank is incorrect.
wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court therefore ordered that the documents be unsealed,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court nonetheless ordered the clerk of court to maintain the documents under seal for nearly two weeks,until july,to provide the bank with an opportunity to seek a stay from this court or to resolve before this court on the merits the propriety of the unsealing order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on july,the bank made a motion in this court for a stay of the unsealing order,for an order prohibiting the district court from taking any further action in the case,and for an order blocking any further release of the unsealing order that would reveal details of the settlement or the documents at issue.a day later,on july,we temporarily stayed the unsealing order until a motions panel of the court could hear and decide the bank motion.on august,a motions panel granted the bank motion for a stay but denied the bank motion to seal the district court published unsealing order.
because gambale,her settlement in hand,did not take a position with respect to public access to the documents at issue,the motions panel,sua sponte,appointed pro bono counsel to brief and argue as amicus curiae the issue of public disclosure we now address the merits of the bank appeal with respect to the unsealing of the documents addressed in the unsealing order,the sealing of the transcript containing the settlement amount,and the district court disclosure of the settlement amount magnitude in the unsealing order.
discussion 
contentions of the parties 
the bank contends that the district court had no jurisdiction to issue the unsealing order after the parties had filed the stipulation of dismissal,thereby dismissing the case under the terms of.a ii.even if the court had jurisdiction,the bank maintains,the unsealing of the sealed documents was improper,as was the court disclosure of the magnitude of the settlement amount in the unsealing order.the bank argues primarily that the district court erred in unsealing the documents because there is no presumption of access to the sealed documents because they are not judicial documents,and even if they are judicial documents,ordering them unsealed was an abuse of the court discretion.
pro bono counsel asserts to the contrary that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the unsealing order because a court always has the power to modify protective orders relating to documents in its files.counsel maintains that the district court,asserting that jurisdiction,did not abuse its discretion in unsealing the documents because the bank,having relied on its position with respect to the district court absence of jurisdiction,did not advance any interests to overcome the presumption of public access to the judicial documents at issue.and,counsel argues,even if we were to consider the interests that the bank declined to assert,the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering the order to unseal.as for the court disclosure of the magnitude of the settlement amount in the unsealing order,counsel asserts that the motions panel of this court had already decided not to order sealed the public order.finally,with respect to the sealed transcript of the may,conference,counsel,who was of course not present during the course of those proceedings,concedes that he does not know why the transcript was or remains sealed or why the court did not rule on the continued sealing of the transcript in the unsealing order.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court legal determination that it has subject matter jurisdiction over a matter brought before it or upon which it acts.see lyndonville sav.bank trust lussier,cir.we review a district court decision to vacate or modify a protective order for abuse of discretion.sec,cir.
iii.jurisdiction to unseal documents 
the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal in the district court pursuant to.a ii.rule provides 
subject to the provisions of rules inapplicable here and of any statute of the united states,an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court ii by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action.
generally,as the bank suggests,a plaintiff filing in the district court of a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties pursuant to rule a ii divests the court of its jurisdiction over a case,irrespective of whether the district court approves the stipulation.see hester,tyson foods,cir holding that a case is dismissed when the parties file a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to rule a ii,cert.denied,d accord marques fed.reserve bank,cir a judgment on the merits that is entered after the plaintiff has filed a proper rule a notice of dismissal is indeed void.meinecke h r block,cir per curiam holding that the district court grant of summary judgment to a party after the parties filed a stipulation pursuant to rule a ii was void hinsdale farmers bank trust,cir holding that a dismissal pursuant to rule a ii terminated the district court jurisdiction except for the limited purpose of reopening and setting aside the judgment of dismissal within the scope allowed by rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
it simply does not follow,however,that the filing of a stipulation of dismissal divests a court of jurisdiction either to dispose of material in its files as it thinks appropriate or to modify or vacate its own protective orders with respect to such documents.
the public has a common law presumptive right of access to judicial documents,see united states amodeo,cir amodeo i,and likely a constitutional one as well as to the former,we have said 
the public exercise of its common law access right in civil cases promotes public confidence in the judicial system as with other branches of government,the bright light cast upon the judicial process by public observation diminishes the possibilities for injustice,incompetence,perjury,and fraud.furthermore,the very openness of the process should provide the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system and a better perception of its fairness.
united states amodeo,cir amodeo ii ellipsis in original quoting leucadia,applied extrusion,cir quoting republic of the philippines westinghouse,cir citation omitted.we have observed that,consistent with this rationale for public access,the presumptive right to public observation is at its apogee when asserted with respect to documents relating to matters that directly affect an adjudication.id.at.such documents include those relating to the decision of a motion for summary judgment,such as the grant and denial of partial summary judgment by the district court here.see joy north,cir,cert.denied,d.in part because they relate to a court adjudication process,documents used by parties moving for,or opposing,summary judgment should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons.id.although parties to litigation may thus overcome the presumption of access by supplying most compelling reasons,they can not expunge the public interest by the simple expedient of filing a stipulation of dismissal with the court.the public stake in the propriety and particulars of the court adjudication does not evaporate upon the parties subsequent decision to settle.
it is,moreover,fundamental that e very court has supervisory power over its own records and files.nixon warner communications,d united states graham,cir quoting nixon.it is undisputed that a district court retains the power to modify or lift protective orders that it has entered.in re agent orange prod.liab,cir,cert.denied,d.the first circuit has observed that 
a protective order,like any ongoing injunction,is always subject to the inherent power of the district court to relax or terminate the order,even after judgment.
this retained power in the court to alter its own ongoing directives provides a safety valve for public interest concerns,changed circumstances or any other basis that may reasonably be offered for later adjustment.
poliquin garden way,cir citation omitted.the court supervisory power does not disappear because jurisdiction over the relevant controversy has been lost.the records and files are not in limbo.so long as they remain under the aegis of the court,they are superintended by the judges who have dominion over the court.see united nuclear cranford ins,cir,cert.denied,d as long as a protective order remains in effect,the court that entered the order retains the power to modify it,even if the underlying suit has been dismissed.
as we have held and as the bank concedes,a district court can modify a protective order when a third party requests judicial documents after the parties have filed a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to settlement.see agent orange,at we have never ruled on the district court jurisdiction,to which the bank pointedly objects,to modify a protective order sua sponte after the parties have filed a stipulation of dismissal.but we see no reason why the absence of a motion of a party to the litigation or some third party requesting that a seal or protective order be lifted should remove a federal court ability to monitor and modify its previous orders in exercise of its supervisory power over its own records and files.nixon,at.see stern trs.of columbia,cir requiring,sua sponte,that the district court review records filed wholesale under seal to determine whether their confidential treatment was warranted,without considering whether there was a person or entity that had a specific interest in gaining access to them or maintaining them in the public files of the court citizens first bank cincinnati ins,cir the judge is the primary representative of the public interest in the judicial process and is therefore to review any request to seal the record or part of it.estate of martin luther king,cbs,d,t he existence of public scrutiny or active media interest in a case does not control whether a protective order is warranted.
a district court that concludes that there is a public right of access to judicial documents thus acts within its jurisdiction when it modifies or vacates a protective order to allow that access,irrespective of whether it does so before or after a stipulation of dismissal has been filed.we therefore conclude that the district court here acted within its jurisdiction when it issued the unsealing order even though the order followed the parties filing of the stipulation of dismissal.
iv.unsealing of documents 
summary judgment documents 
c permits a district court to make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense upon a showing by a movant for the order of good cause.t he party seeking a protective order has the burden of showing that good cause exists for issuance of that order.it is equally apparent that the obverse also is true,if good cause is not shown,the discovery materials in question should not receive judicial protection and therefore would be open to the public for inspection.agent orange,at.
here,the bank relied in the district court entirely on its position,with which,as we have explained,we disagree,that the district court had no jurisdiction to modify the protective order and thereby unseal the summary judgment documents.as we have noted,these documents,which related to the court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,were presumptively subject to public access the bank made no effort to rebut that presumption by establishing that there was a continuing compelling reason to require that the documents remain under seal.no such showing having been attempted,let alone made,the district court was well within its discretion to order that the seal on the documents be lifted.
b.the amount of the settlement the published unsealing order and the may,transcript 
the amount paid by the bank to gambale in connection with the settlement of her lawsuit stands on starkly different footing.that amount is set forth in settlement documents that were entered into on a confidential basis between the parties and are not themselves part of the court record.there is no established presumption of access of which we have been made aware with respect to the information contained in them.united states glens falls newspapers,cir holding that there is no presumptive right of access to settlement discussions and documents pansy borough of stroudsburg,cir concluding that when a settlement agreement is not filed with,interpreted by,or enforced by a court,it is not a judicial record presumed to be accessible sec van waeyenberghe,cir once a settlement is filed in district court,it becomes a judicial record.the presumption in favor of the public common law right of access to court records therefore applies to settlement agreements that are filed and submitted to the district court for approval.citation omitted.we can not and do not conclude that there can never be a circumstance or a showing that would require such disclosure.at the same time,however,there may well be valid reasons in this and other cases terminated by settlement for maintaining the amount of settlement in confidence when the settlement itself was conditioned on confidentiality and when the settlement documents were not filed with the court and were not the basis for the court adjudication.if nothing else,honoring the parties express wish for confidentiality may facilitate settlement,which courts are bound to encourage.see glens falls newspapers,at approving the sealing of settlement documents and drafts because of,inter alia,the court responsibility to encourage and facilitate settlements.
the confidential settlement amount was disclosed to the co
