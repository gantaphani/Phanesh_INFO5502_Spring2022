monique jackson appeals from judge chatigny grant of summary judgment dismissing her medical leave,disability,employment discrimination,and retaliation claims and denial of her pro se request to reopen discovery.we write to clarify the obligations of a district court in granting summary judgement under.we affirm.
background 
we view the record in the light most favorable to appellant.gallo prudential residential,cir on de novo review of summary judgment,all ambiguities must be resolved and all inferences drawn in favor of the party.the following facts are undisputed,unless noted otherwise.
appellant is an african american woman who worked as a senior service agent at federal express fedex from to may.in,appellant filed an internal human resources hr complaint against her manager,franklin benjamin,claiming that he sexually harassed her,and against the operations manager,billy lipscomb,claiming that he ignored her complaints.both managers were subsequently transferred to different facilities.after a short interval during which appellant was supervised by new managers,ralph sylvester became appellant direct manager.
fedex termination policy provides that if an employee receives any combination of three warning letters or performance counseling letters in a period,the employee is subject to termination.after appellant was disciplined five times between september and may,fedex terminated her.
on march,appellant filed the present complaint against fedex alleging,inter alia,that sylvester and benjamin were friends and that sylvester terminated her in retaliation for complaining about benjamin sexual harassment.the complaint further alleged that sylvester used racial slurs in her presence,pressured her to return to work while she was on medical leave recovering from an automobile accident,refused to accommodate her work to lingering injuries after she returned,and terminated her in part because of her age and race.the complaint asserted claims for i retaliation for filing an internal complaint of sexual harassment,a ii termination because of her race,a iii violation of the family and medical leave act,et iv violation of the americans with disabilities act,et and v age discrimination,et.
after the schedule of seven months for discovery had expired,fedex moved for summary judgment on all claims.in compliance with.c and local rule a,it submitted a statement of facts that fedex claimed to be undisputed.the motion was accompanied by sworn declarations from sylvester and two fedex hr managers and excerpts from appellant deposition.each of the factual assertions cited specific support in the record.appellant,through counsel,responded with a local rule a statement of undisputed and disputed facts,additional documentary evidence,and an opposition brief.appellant rule a statement explicitly admitted of fedex statements of undisputed facts and denied.the admitted facts included numerous matters undermining appellant claims.details are discussed infra.the denials concerned the investigation of benjamin conduct,sylvester use of racial epithets,and the circumstances of appellant termination.part ii of her response to fexex statement of undisputed facts claimed that the following issues of material fact were disputed 
plaintiff filed a harassment complaint against a fedex employee in february of sic,after which,her performance rating declined the decline was motivated,in part,by the filing of the internal complaint.
when plaintiff zeroed timecards in march of,and was reprimanded for it,she did so under the express instruction of sylvester sylvester motivation to and subsequently terminate jackson was motivated,in large part,to retaliate against jackson for filing an internal complaint against benjamin.
her opposition brief stated that d iscovery has yielded the existence of issues of fact with respect to one of appellant claims title vii retaliation,and argued that summary judgment should be denied as to that claim.
the district court concluded that appellant tacitly admits that there are no issues of fact with regard to the claims,and dismissed them in the absence of opposition.it also noted that it had r eview ed appellee statement of undisputed facts and confirmed the lack of a dispute as to those facts.the district court then discussed the title vii retaliation claim in detail and granted summary judgment in favor of fedex on that claim.
while the motion for summary judgment was briefed and pending,appellant,acting pro se although still represented by counsel,filed a request to reopen discovery in order to permit the deposition of certain fedex employees,including ralph sylvester,and to obtain reports famis reports that appellant had prepared.appellant stated in a letter to the court that her attorney failed to subpoena her former operational manager ralph sylvester and allow ed discovery to close on february.the letter was returned to appellant because it was not signed by her counsel.counsel responded with a letter to the court explaining that he had previously requested production of the famis reports,but fedex counsel had stated that they were not in possession,custody,or control of this document.he further stated that the deposition of sylvester was largely unnecessary because it likely would be favorable to fedex.
appellant had sent a letter to her counsel,which predated the letter to the court,asking him to withdraw because she did not think he had her best interest at heart and that she was truly dissatisfied that he allowed discovery to close without the famis reports.appellant counsel moved to withdraw,and the district court granted the request on october.appellant then filed a pro se motion to reopen discovery reiterating the reasons given in her previous letter.the court denied the motion in the order granting summary judgment.
appellant then brought this appeal pro se.on november,we dismissed appellant retaliation claim as lacking an arguable basis in law or fact,but we appointed pro bono counsel to brief the grant of summary judgment on the claims deemed abandoned by the district court 
discussion 
a summary judgment on the non retaliation counts 
we review a district court grant of summary judgement de novo,because such a motion may be granted only when the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.amaker foley,cir.
relying on vermont teddy bear beargram,cir,appellant argues the district court failed to carry out its responsibilities in entering summary judgment when,after a review of the assertions of undisputed facts,it dismissed the claims as unopposed.we disagree.
rule allows a party to seek a judgment before trial on the grounds that all facts relevant to a claim s or defense s are undisputed and that those facts entitle the party to the judgment sought.teddy bear,at.a statement of facts deemed by the moving party to be undisputed must be submitted by that party for each such fact.c.local a.such a statement must reference admissible evidence when presented at trial in the form of testimony or other permissible method in the record tending to prove each such fact,deposition testimony,admissions,answers to interrogatories,affidavits,see.c nonmovant may object that cited material is inadmissible.local a specific citation to evidence must be to the affidavit of a witness competent to testify as to the facts at trial or to evidence that would be admissible at trial raskin wyatt,cir only admissible evidence need be considered by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment,and the federal rules of evidence govern such admissibility.the party need not respond to the motion.however,a runs the risk of statements of undisputed facts proferred by the movant being deemed admitted.e see,jones lamont,civ,wl,at s.in view of pro se plaintiff failure to respond to the motion,the well supported factual allegations set forth in defendants rule statement are deemed admitted,aff,fed.app x cir.
a does not risk a default judgment,however see.teddy bear,at contrasting rule default with summary judgment requirements.before summary judgment may be entered,the district court must ensure that each statement of material fact is supported by record evidence sufficient to satisfy the movant burden of production even if the statement is unopposed.id.at district court must examine an unopposed motion for summary judgment to determine if it has met its burden of demonstrating that no material issue of fact remains for trial and that the citation to evidence in the record supports the unopposed assertion internal quotations omitted.in doing so,the court may rely on other evidence in the record even if uncited.c.and,of course,the court must determine whether the legal theory of the motion is sound.thus,rule does not allow district courts to automatically grant summary judgment on a claim simply because the summary judgment motion,or relevant part,is unopposed.however,as discussed infra,a partial response arguing that summary judgment should be denied as to some claims while not mentioning others may be deemed an abandonment of the unmentioned claims.
in the present case,the district court fulfilled all these requirements.it r eview ed the statement of undisputed facts submitted by appellee,which included relevant citations to the record.based on those statements,it concluded that appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and granted summary judgment.appellant argues,not that substantive error was committed,but that the district court failed to write a sufficiently elaborate essay.
much of appellant argument rests on an overreading of vermont teddy bear.that decision involved a pro se defendant who failed to oppose a rule motion and had a judgment entered against him that included,inter alia,a permanent injunction,statutory damages of,and reimbursement for litigation expenses.at.although the legal claims involved balancing tests,the district court had simply endorsed the notice of motion as granted,with slight modifications.id.we vacated and remanded.id.at.
we do not quarrel with vermont teddy bear.we simply hold that it has no bearing on this case.
first,vermont teddy bear involved a pro se litigant,and we are less demanding of such litigants generally,particularly where motions for summary judgment are concerned.see ruotolo irs,cir district court should have afforded pro se litigants special solicitude before granting the motion for summary judgment tracy freshwater,cir discussing various forms of solicitude shown to pro se litigants.second,the district court decision appeared to be the equivalent of a default judgment.third,this court was left without a record sufficient for appellate review.none of these critical elements is found in the present appeal.
first,appellant was represented by counsel during discovery and at the time of the motion for summary judgment.moreover,counsel responded to the motion,and the motion was fully submitted before the conflict with appellant over discovery developed.therefore,the concern we show over ensuring that a pro se litigant understands the stakes in such a motion,see ruotolo,at the failure of a district court to apprise pro se litigants of the consequences of failing to respond to a motion for summary judgment is ordinarily grounds for reversal,is simply irrelevant in the present matter 
second,there is nothing in the record of this matter that suggests that the district court was entering a default judgment.the motion for summary judgment complied with rule and,unlike the circumstances in giannullo city of new york,cir,each statement of proposed undisputed facts was supported by a citation to the record sufficient to prove each such fact.appellant,who bore the burden of proving the facts essential to each of her claims,made no proffer with regard to any of her claims except for the retaliation claim.the district court noted that its review of fedex statements of undisputed facts confirmed the lack of any dispute of material facts with regard to the claims.the court use of the term unopposed does not necessarily suggest a default rationale it simply reflects the plain consequences of an appellant failing to make a sufficient response to a properly supported rule motion.
moreover,there is a relevant distinction to be drawn between fully unopposed and partially opposed motions for summary judgment in counseled cases.while the opponent to such a motion is free to ignore it completely,thereby risking the admission of key facts and leaving it to the court to determine the legal merits of all claims or defenses on those admitted facts,a partial opposition may imply an abandonment of some claims or defenses.generally,but perhaps not always,a partial response reflects a decision by a party attorney to pursue some claims or defenses and to abandon others.pleadings often are designed to include all possible claims or defenses,and parties are always free to abandon some of them.moreover,preparation of a response to a motion for summary judgment is a particularly appropriate time for a party to decide whether to pursue or abandon some claims or defenses.indeed,rule is known as a highly useful method of narrowing the issues for trial.
where abandonment by a counseled party is not explicit but such an inference may be fairly drawn from the papers and circumstances viewed as a whole,district courts may conclude that abandonment was intended.such an inference would have been proper here.appellant counsel responded to each of fed ex proposed undisputed facts appellant opposition brief noted that discovery has yielded the existence of issues of fact with respect to one claim and the brief argued only that summary judgment should be denied as to that one claim.
in contrast,vermont teddy bear involved a motion totally unopposed by a pro se party,and the district court failure to analyze any of the complex legal and factual issues suggested that it had entered a default judgment.moreover,even if a partial response had been made in vermont teddy bear,an examination of the legal validity of an entry of summary judgment should have been made in light of the opposing party pro se status.
rule also requires that a grant or denial of summary judgment is accompanied by an explanation.a.however,absent some indication of a material issue being overlooked or an incorrect legal standard being applied,we do not require district courts to write elaborate essays using talismanic phrases.see,e,united states cossey,cir strong presumption on review of sentencing that the district court considered all arguments properly presented to it,unless the record clearly suggests otherwise in re mazzeo,cir.a explanation of reasoning does not require punctilious detail or slavish tracing of the claims issue by issue and witness by witness internal quotations and alterations omitted badgley santacroce,cir same.all that is required is a record sufficient to allow an informed appellate review,the subject to which we now turn.
unlike vermont teddy bear,the record here is easily sufficient to allow an informed appellate review.appellant claims did not turn on balancing legal tests or mixed issues of fact or law on which the movant bore the burden of proof.here,the district court legal reasoning is perfectly obvious.even a cursory examination of the record reveals that plaintiff case,apart from the retaliation claim,collapsed with her deposition.plaintiff deposition testimony contradicted important allegations in her complaint,she testified that she never heard sylvester use a racial epithet did not believe that her termination was based on race or age,was not denied medical leave,was simply asked about her expectations for returning to work when on that leave,and was not asked to do work that her injury prevented.most of the critical facts asserted by fedex as undisputed were,therefore,referenced to appellant deposition testimony.
in such a case,there is no need for a district court to robotically replicate the statement of undisputed facts and references to the record or otherwise serve as an assistant to our law clerks.see miranda bennett,cir an opinion or lengthy order is not required in every case,and review will proceed even in the face of inadequate findings by the district court if we are able to disce
