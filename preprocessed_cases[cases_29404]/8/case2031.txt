in this appeal,evandro santini and his real estate development firm,santini homes,challenge a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut warren eginton,judge in favor of the connecticut hazardous waste management service the service.after unsuccessfully pursuing a takings claim in the connecticut courts,santini sued in federal court,alleging that the service announcement that his property was one of three sites under consideration for the location of a radioactive waste disposal facility constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment the district court dismissed santini complaint on three grounds the doctrine collateral estoppel,and the merits of the takings claim.
because santini did not raise,and could not have raised,his federal takings claim in the state court action,we conclude that the doctrine and res judicata do not apply.moreover,we recognize an exception to the applicability of collateral estoppel for plaintiffs who litigate takings claims in state court solely to comply with the ripeness requirement of williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank,d,as santini did.we hold that litigants who pursue inverse condemnation actions in state court in order to comply with williamson county may reserve their federal takings claims for later resolution in federal court.because we announce this reservation rule for the first time,we apply the requirement prospectively only and deem santini to have reserved his federal claim,rendering collateral estoppel inapplicable.but because we believe that the service is entitled to summary judgment on the merits of santini takings claim,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the material facts are undisputed.santini develops residential real estate in the area surrounding hartford,connecticut.in,he purchased,for,a parcel of land in ellington,connecticut.santini obtained approval from the ellington planning and zoning commission to subdivide the parcel,to be known as ellridge estates,into sixteen lots.beginning in,santini built an access road to the development,installed storm drainage and sewer systems,and,in all,spent approximately developing infrastructure.
in,santini purchased,for,a parcel the pinney street property adjacent to the ellridge estates parcel,intending to develop the two parcels into a unified residential village consisting of approximately homes.santini began building model homes in,constructing houses on four lots of the ellridge estates parcel.he also made other investments in the properties,including completing engineering studies and preliminary layouts for the pinney street property and borrowing funds for the construction of its infrastructure.because of a recession in the real estate market,construction proceeded slowly until.when market conditions improved,santini renewed his efforts to sell homes in ellridge estates he lowered prices,established a mortgage program customized to the development,and began advertising aggressively.by june,he had identified likely buyers for two of the homes,spent million in acquiring and developing the ellington properties,and borrowed million that was earmarked for further construction on the pinney street property.
the service is a governmental agency established pursuant to connecticut general statutes et and charged with siting a radioactive waste disposal facility.the radioactive waste policy act of,et,required the states to make adequate provision for the disposal of radioactive waste generated within their borders by entering into regional compacts,and it imposed financial penalties on those states that failed to do so.in,with few states complying with the act,congress passed the radioactive waste policy amendments act,et,which required the states by the end of to dispose of their domestically generated radioactive waste either or through compacts with other states.in order to comply with the federal requirements,connecticut entered into a regional compact and enacted legislation directing the service to locate a disposal facility within the state.see.
the service developed a plan which first required it to locate sites that were likely to be suitable.of these,the service would then identify those sites that would actually be suitable.the list of potential sites would be winnowed to eight,with the service board of directors selecting three of the eight as finalists.once three finalists were identified,examinations would be conducted and one site would be selected as the preferred site.the preferred site would then be monitored for at least twelve months,in accordance with federal nuclear regulatory commission nrc regulations.see santini.hazardous waste mgmt.the service never got beyond the identification of three finalist sites.
on june,after secret deliberations,the service announced that it had identified three sites.the service later identified five other sites.two were located in ellington,and the third was located in a neighboring town.one of the ellington sites included the undeveloped portion of santini ellridge estates and the entirety of his pinney street property.santini did not know,prior to the service june announcement,that his property was under consideration.on june,the three potential sites,including santini property,were depicted in the hartford courant below the international symbol for radioactivity and the headline,nuclear waste where should it go the hartford courant,june,at.in late,the service eliminated one of the three sites from consideration,leaving santini property as one of two finalists.
after vocal public opposition in and around ellington to the service siting plan,the connecticut legislature passed,and the governor signed into law,public act,which directed the service to develop a new plan for locating a disposal facility.public act,which took effect may,effectively overruled the service june,siting announcement.ultimately,neither santini property nor any other connecticut site was selected as the preferred site,a necessary prerequisite to the state exercise of its eminent domain power to take private property such as santini for the construction of a disposal facility 
notwithstanding the enactment of public act,however,santini property remained economically idle until,and he continued to incur additional carrying costs,including interest on debt and property taxes,until.in santini sued the service in connecticut superior court,alleging that its june,siting his property one of three a temporary taking of his property without just compensation in violation of article i,of the connecticut constitution.santini complaint alleged that the service siting announcement had prevented him from selling the homes and lots in ellridge estates prevented him from completing development of ellridge estates and the pinney street property denied him any economic return on his investments in the two parcels caused him to incur additional costs and incidental damages and left him with no alternative use of his property.santini brought only a takings claim because he believed that,under the supreme court decision in williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank,d,a federal takings claim would not be ripe until he had sought,and been denied,just compensation in a inverse condemnation action 
the superior court held an bench trial in early.in addition to fact witnesses,santini and the service both presented expert appraisal testimony concerning the economic impact of the siting announcement on santini property.santini appraiser,edward heberger,testified that santini damages as a result of the june,siting announcement were for the ellridge estates property and for the pinney street property,for a total loss of.heberger appraisal was based on his conclusion that the siting announcement had paralyzed santini construction and sales efforts for two years,a period including the eleven months that the siting designation was in effect as well as a stigma period that followed.the service appraiser,william kinnard,testified that the siting announcement had diminished the value of the ellridge estates property by and the pinney street property by,for a total loss of.
following trial,the superior court found that,although santini had suffered an economic loss as a result of the siting announcement,the announcement was part of the state planning process,and s uch planning is not actionable.santini.hazardous waste mgmt,no.cv s,wl,at.july.the superior court found no evidence that the state intent to condemn santini property had ever become fixed and irreversible,id.at citation and quotation marks omitted,and concluded that there was no unconstitutional taking of any kind,id.at.accordingly,the superior court entered judgment for the service.id.
santini appealed to the appellate court of connecticut,but before that court could act the supreme court of connecticut transferred the case to itself.santini,at.the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the superior court by a vote of five to two.id.at.echoing the superior court,the supreme court held that the service siting announcement constituted mere governmental planning and preliminary steps in anticipation of condemnation,not a fixed and irreversible decision by the state to exercise its power of eminent domain regarding santini property.id.at,see also id.at.the supreme court of the united states denied santini petition for certiorari.santini.hazardous waste mgmt,d.
following his loss in state court,santini sued the service in the district court,alleging a takings claim under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and.the service moved to dismiss the complaint and for summary judgment,and santini also moved for summary judgment.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine,concluding that santini federal takings claim was inextricably intertwined with the judgment of the connecticut supreme court dismissing his takings claim.the court also noted that,even if did not apply,it would grant the service motion for summary judgment on the basis of collateral estoppel and on the merits of santini takings claim.the court concluded that collateral estoppel barred santini federal takings claim because the issue necessary to the connecticut supreme court extent or finality of the defendant identical to the consideration required for the instant federal takings claim.ruling on mot.to dismiss and for summ,at.the district court also noted that the service was entitled to summary judgment because it had not made a final decision as required by williamson county and because the selection of santini property as one of three finalists left open the possibility that santini property would not ultimately be selected as the radioactive disposal site.id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the service defends the judgment of the district court on three grounds.it argues that santini takings claim is not ripe because the service did not make a final decision with respect to his property the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under and santini takings claim is barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.we review de novo the decision of the district court,which granted the service motions to dismiss and for summary judgment and denied santini motion for summary judgment.see,manning utils.mut.ins,cir.
in williamson county,the supreme court established a test for determining whether a fifth amendment takings claim is ripe.the first prong requires the government entity charged with enforcing the regulations at issue to have rendered a final decision,and t he second prong requires the plaintiff to have sought compensation if the state provides a reasonable,certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation.southview,bongartz,cir quoting williamson county,at.since the service concedes that santini pursuit of a takings claim in the connecticut courts satisfies the second prong,the dispute over ripeness focuses on the first prong whether the service rendered a final decision with respect to santini property.
under the first williamson county prong,a takings claim is not ripe until the appropriate government entity has reached a final decision regarding the property at issue.williamson county,at.the service argues that santini takings claim is unripe because it never made the final decision to acquire santini property and to locate a disposal facility there,and because t he only action by the government was a public announcement that certain sites were to be considered for possible future acquisition.br.of at.implicit in the finality requirement of williamson county is the notion that a takings claim is unripe if,before seeking just compensation through an inverse condemnation claim,the plaintiff could have taken some action to prevent the challenged governmental regulation from depriving him of an economically viable use of his property.in williamson county itself,for example,a jury had found that the respondent,hamilton bank of johnson city,would be denied the economically feasible use of its property if it were forced to develop the property in conformity with each of eight objections raised by the petitioner,the williamson county regional planning commission.id.at.finding the bank inverse condemnation claim unripe,the supreme court noted that i t is not clear whether the jury would have found that the respondent had been denied all reasonable beneficial use of the property had any of the eight objections been met through the grant of a variance.see also palazzolo rhode island,d holding that regulatory takings claim was unripe until property owner had followed reasonable and necessary steps to allow regulatory agencies to exercise their full discretion in considering development plans for the property.significantly,the service does not suggest any action that santini could have taken to ripen his takings claim,and we are aware of none.see,hall city of santa barbara,cir it is not clear what the city would have the halls do to perfect their claim t he halls have no further administrative recourse available.
in any event,the service misconstrues the ripeness inquiry in two ways.first,it erroneously assumes that,under williamson county,the particular governmental decision of which a takings plaintiff,the siting itself constitute a final decision.that is not the case.rather,the first prong of williamson county requires only that the government entity have rendered a final decision.see williamson county,at.once it does so,a takings claim based on an earlier step of the regulatory process is ripe though not necessarily meritorious.second,the service erroneously assumes that a takings claim is not ripe unless the government entity final decision is adverse to the plaintiff.this assumption no doubt explains the service misplaced reliance on the fact that the state of connecticut never made the final decision to acquire santini property.for ripeness purposes,it does not matter that the service ultimate to acquire santini favorable to santini.rather,all that matters is that the service made a final decision.thus,regardless of whether the siting announcement was itself a final decision and despite the fact that the service never made the final decision to acquire santini property,the service did made the final decision not to acquire santini property.that is all that williamson county requires.
ii,res judicata,and collateral estoppel 
the service argues that,as a result of the connecticut supreme court judgment in its favor on santini takings claim,the doctrine deprives the district court and this court of subject matter jurisdiction over santini fifth amendment takings claim and,in the event that does not apply,res judicata and collateral estoppel bar santini from litigating his takings claim in the federal courts.santini counters that,even if,res judicata,and collateral estoppel would otherwise apply,the unique procedural posture of county takings claims requires us to carve out exceptions to the preclusion doctrines.before deciding whether to create the exceptions that santini requests,however,we must determine whether any of the three preclusion doctrines applies.
the essence of the doctrine is that inferior federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over cases that effectively seek review of judgments of state courts and that federal review,if any,can occur only by way of a certiorari petition to the supreme court.moccio state office of court,cir.bars those claims that were adjudicated in a prior state court action,as well as those claims that are inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment.id.at.we have held that inextricably intertwined means,at a minimum,that where a federal plaintiff had an opportunity to litigate a claim in a state proceeding,subsequent litigation of the claim will be barred under the doctrine if it would be barred under the principles of preclusion.id.at.
santini fifth amendment takings claim was not litigated in the connecticut state courts,where santini asserted only a takings claim.in order for and res judicata to apply,then,santini must have had the opportunity to litigate his federal takings claim in the state court action.both federal and connecticut law make clear that santini did not have this opportunity.first,according to santini,the only reason he brought a takings claim before pursuing a federal claim is because he believed that williamson county required him to do so.the supreme court held in williamson county that,because the fifth amendment proscribes takings without just compensation,a takings claim is not ripe until the property owner has sought compensation through the procedures that the state provides.williamson county,at.the court indicated that,if state law permits a property owner to bring an inverse condemnation action to obtain just compensation for an alleged taking,then the property owner must pursue such an action before bringing a fifth amendment takings claim under.id.at.
applying williamson county,we held in southview associates,at,that the plaintiff regulatory takings claim was not ripe because the plaintiff had not pursued an inverse condemnation action under vermont law in state court.like the plaintiffs in williamson county and southview associates,santini could not have brought a fifth amendment takings claim in federal court until after he brought a state law inverse condemnation action in state court.moreover,under connecticut law santini could not have litigated his fifth amendment takings claim in the state court action.in melillo city of new haven,the connecticut supreme court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to consideration of their federal takings claim in state court because of the existence of a legally sufficient procedure,under article first,of the constitution of connecticut,to obtain just compensation for the alleged taking of their property.thus,because santini neither brought,nor could have brought,a fifth amendment takings claim in the connecticut state court action,and res judicata do not apply.see moccio,at isaac truck.
whether to apply collateral estoppel is a more difficult question.collateral estoppel differs from and res judicata in at least one significant respect.collateral estoppel may preclude the relitigation of an issue that was actually litigated in a previous action,even if the claim in which the issue arises in the subsequent action was not brought and could not have been brought in the previous action whose judgment gives rise to the estoppel.see,gladysz planning zoning comm of town of plainville,see also restatement second of judgments when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment,the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties,whether on the same or a different claim.emphasis added.
ordinarily,collateral estoppel would apply if an issue that is an essential element of santini fifth amendment takings claim was actually litigated in the state court action and the connecticut supreme court made a determination that was necessary to its judgment with respect to that issue.r r pool patio,zoning bd.of appeals of town of ridgefield.the connecticut supreme court rejected santini takings claim because it concluded that the june siting announcement constituted mere governmental planning,not an actionable taking.it is undisputed that this issue was actually litigated in the state courts and was necessary to the supreme court decision.in addition,for the reasons discussed in section iv,infra,the issue is essential to santini fifth amendment takings claim as well.nevertheless,we decline to apply collateral estoppel here for an independent reason.
the requirement of williamson county that a property owner must pursue compensation through available state procedures,such as a inverse condemnation action,before bringing a fifth amendment takings claim has created a for takings plaintiffs.under williamson county,a plaintiff may not bring a fifth amendment takings claim without first having unsuccessfully pursued a takings claim.under traditional notions of collateral estoppel,however,the state court adverse judgment will often preclude the plaintiff subsequent fifth amendment takings claim.see,dodd hood river county,cir stating that collateral estoppel bars federal takings claim if state court earlier decision on takings claim was an equivalent determination under the federal taking clause.though application of the preclusion doctrines deprives a large class of plaintiffs of the opportunity to pursue fifth amendment takings claims in federal,in many cases,of the circuits to have addressed this issue have declined to create an exception to render res judicata and collateral estoppel inapplicable in this situation.see,wilkinson pitkin county bd.of county comm rs,cir we conclude the williamson ripeness requirement is insufficient to preclude application of res judicata and collateral estoppel principles in this case.palomar mobilehome park ass city of san marcos,cir holding that res judicata bars federal takings claim peduto city of wildwood,cir same see also barefoot city of wilmington,cir holding that doctrine deprived district court of jurisdiction over federal takings claim but see anderson charter township of ypsilanti,cir holding that doctrine bars federal takings claim brought by plaintiff who had initially brought both state and federal takings claims in state court and,after removal and remand,failed to reserve federal claim in state court fields sarasota manatee airport,cir recognizing a limited exception to the applicability of res judicata and collateral estoppel to federal takings claims.
although we are not prepared to declare res judicata and collateral estoppel wholly inapplicable to takings claims,we part ways with most of our sister circuits in favor of a middle ground.in england louisiana state board of medical examiners,d,the supreme court recognized a procedure whereby parties who are involuntarily litigating claims in state court may reserve their federal claims for a later determination by a federal court.the plaintiffs in england filed a complaint in federal court raising claims under both federal and state law,and the district court abstained pursuant to railroad commission pullman,in order to permit the louisiana state courts to resolve issues of state law.england,at.temple of lost sheep abrams,cir.the plaintiffs then brought an action in state court,raising the federal and state claims.england,at.after losing in state court,plaintiffs returned to federal court,where they sought to pursue their federal claims anew.id.at.the district court dismissed the claims as precluded by the state court judgment,and the plaintiffs appealed directly to the supreme court.id.at.
concerned that litigants would otherwise be deprived of the opportunity to litigate their federal claims in federal court,the england court created a mechanism whereby litigants could reserve their federal claims and deprive the state court judgment of preclusive effect in federal court.the court stated,there are fundamental objections to any conclusion that a litigant who has properly invoked the jurisdiction of a federal district court to consider federal constitutional claims can be compelled,without his consent and through no fault of his
