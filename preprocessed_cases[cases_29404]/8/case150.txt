facts background 
james and kathleen biltcliffe purchased a home in bridgewater,massachusetts in.the biltcliffes mortgage was ultimately assigned to defendant citimortgage.the mortgage agreement allows for acceleration of the debt in the event of default,provided the mortgagee gives the mortgagor notice and the opportunity to cure.the agreement permits citimortgage to invoke the statutory power of sale if the borrower fails to cure the default or pay the accelerated debt.the mortgage document also provides that the lender may accept any payment or partial payment without waiver of any rights hereunder.
the biltcliffes defaulted on their mortgage payments in.while plaintiff avers that the couple never received written notice of default,defendant provided the district court with two demand letters addressed to plaintiff home,one dated september,and the other september.both letters gave the biltcliffes ninety days to make up missed payments and late fees warning that f ailure to cure may result in the acceleration of all sums due.plaintiff did not make up the payments and citi accordingly accelerated the debt,notifying the couple by letter dated april,and addressed to their home.although plaintiff complaint alleged that he can find no record of notice of any such acceleration ever having occurred,defendant submitted an affidavit from one of its attorneys verifying the authenticity of the acceleration notice and confirming that it was sent.
plaintiff and his wife filed for chapter bankruptcy in march of.five months later,in august,defendant sent the biltcliffes a home affordable modification program hamp modification offer.the hamp offer stated explicitly that the loan documents will not be modified unless and until the lender accepts this agreement by signing and returning a copy of it to the borrower.plaintiff and his wife signed the hamp agreement and returned it to defendant.though defendant never returned a signed copy to the biltcliffes,the couple began making a lower monthly payment on their mortgage.

ii.analysis 
scope of plaintiff appeal 
plaintiff notice of appeal presents the court with a preliminary jurisdictional quandary.although plaintiff now asserts that he appeals from both the district court summary judgment decision and the denial of his motion for reconsideration,plaintiff notice of appeal states only that he appeals from final order denying reconsideration of entry of judgment,entered in this action on november.the district court clerk entered the notice of appeal only as to docket entry,order on motion for reconsideration plaintiff did not seek to correct that docket entry.however,plaintiff docketing statement in this court,filed twenty days after his notice of appeal,lists july,the date of the district court summary judgment decision as the d ate of entry of judgment or order appealed from.
a party notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.rule c requirements are jurisdictional in nature,and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review.smith barry,d.while the supreme court instructs us to interpret these requirements broadly,it has warned litigants that the principle of liberal construction will not excuse noncompliance with the rule.see also chamorro puerto rican cars,cir noting that while courts are not invariably bound to read the notice of appeal literally,rescue missions are not automatic,and litigants will do well to draft notices of appeal with care.as a general rule,appellate jurisdiction is limited to review of orders and judgments specifically described in the notice of appeal.rojas velázquez figueroa sancha,cir.thus,failure to include a particular issue in a notice of appeal can be fatal to this court jurisdiction over that issue.constructora andrade gutiérrez,am.int l ins.of,cir see also mariani giron acevedo ruiz,cir a n appeal from the denial of a rule e motion is not an appeal from the underlying judgment.
at oral argument,plaintiff counsel characterized his notice of appeal designation as an accident caused in part by the short amount of space provided on the form to write in the order being appealed from.counsel argued that plaintiff notice of appeal,read in the context of the full record,including the docketing statement,fairly put citimortgage on notice that he intended to appeal both the summary judgment and the reconsideration decisions.see kotler am.tobacco,cir.we are not persuaded that this is so.
past cases have construed a notice of appeal solely referencing the denial of reconsideration as encompassing appeal from the final judgment where the appellant motion for reconsideration largely rehashed the arguments it made in opposition to the original judgment.díaz aviation airport aviation,cir see also town of norwood new england power,cir reviewing both reconsideration decision and underlying dismissal where rule e motion covered more or less the same points as opposition to dismissal and district court tersely denied the motion for reconsideration relying on its original decision emphasis in original.other recent cases in this circuit have declined to reach this jurisdictional question when the denial of reconsideration specifically listed in the notice of appeal presents issues intertwined with the underlying judgment such that full as opposed to limited review does not alter the outcome of the case.mckenna wells fargo bank,cir markel am.ins.díaz santiago,cir.here,while the plaintiff motion for reconsideration pointed to flaws in the earlier grant of summary judgment,the motion also raised new and unique issues related to the district court procedural handling of the case.plaintiff brief on appeal challenges the reconsideration denial on grounds distinct from argument concerning the summary judgment decision.to the extent he revisits certain substantive bases for the district court summary judgment order,he argues only that the court made manifest errors of law and,as a result,abused its discretion in other words,he makes arguments we can properly resolve on appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.those arguments,however,do not give us license to extend our analysis and reconsider the summary judgment order in full.
while we do not doubt that plaintiff may well have hoped to appeal both decisions,it is the notice afforded by a document,not the litigant motivation in filing it,that determines the document sufficiency under rule c
