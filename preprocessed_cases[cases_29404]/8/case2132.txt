hyundai mipo dockyard,hmd,a korean shipyard,appeals from judge owen order enjoining it from proceeding with a declaratory judgment action in korea.see in re complaint of rationis,cv,wl july.hmd argues that i the district court gave undue weight to improper factors when it decided to issue the antisuit injunction ii the court erred by refusing to conduct a evidentiary hearing and iii the evidence was insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over hmd appellees,three american cargo companies,dispute these contentions and argue further that hmd forfeited the jurisdictional defense both by not timely asserting it and by engaging in activity,including discovery.
we can not determine from the record whether hmd forfeited its defense of lack of personal jurisdiction.we further conclude that,if the defense was not forfeited,a evidentiary hearing was required because essential facts related to whether the court had personal jurisdiction over hmd were in dispute.we therefore vacate the injunction and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the forfeiture issue and,if appropriate,the merits of hmd jurisdictional defense.because the jurisdictional issues must be resolved first,we do not decide whether the issuance of an antisuit injunction was proper.
background 
the facts are set out in detail in the district court various opinions in this matter,see,rationis,wl,at schreiber foods int l,intercargo napoli,cv,wl,vacated by mediterranean shipping.geneva,cir in re complaint of rationis,cv,wl,as well as in our previously published decision on a related claim,see mediterranean shipping,at,familiarity with which are assumed.we therefore summarize only the facts relevant to the present appeal.
on november,the msc carla,a ship carrying more than shipping containers,broke in half en route from france to the united states.half of the vessel sank,along with its cargo.hmd had elongated the carla in by installing a insert.when the carla split,it did so near one of the seams joining the original hull with hmd insert.
on december,the ship owner filed a petition under the limitation of shipowners liability act,app.et,in the southern district of new york.that act provides a procedure in the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction that allows a single federal court to determine all relevant issues related to liability and limits the shipowner liability to the salvage value of the vessel plus the value of freight then pending,should exoneration be denied.
hmd was brought into this action in january,when the approximately cargo claimants in the limitation proceeding put the shipyard on notice that they intended to hold it jointly and severally responsible for the casualty.hmd responded by seeking a declaratory judgment of from the ulsan district court of korea in june.in the korean action,hmd served only three of the cargo claimants,namely,the three appellees in this appeal.the three cargo claimants served were apparently selected because they are essentially the first three alphabetically.
in september,various cargo claimants began serving complaints on hmd,at hmd new jersey office.in november,three cargo claimants sued by hmd in in the southern district to enjoin hmd korean action against them.
the district court granted the injunction.the grounds primarily relied on were that i the unusual size and complexity of the case made it preferable that all claims be settled in one action to the extent possible,rationis,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted,and ii the fact that hmd brought its korean action against only three of the cargo claimants might create difficult problems of collateral estoppel unless the court enjoin ed the risk of them occurring,id.
the district court also found no merit in hmd claim that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.the court found that 
hmd with its sales office in englewood cliffs,new jersey,as observed,right across the hudson river from new york city,and a new york manhattan telephone listing in the white pages,has been served in this proceeding,filed an answer,and participated in the case,has not moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and has availed itself of the united states at large.
id.at.it therefore held that personal jurisdiction had been properly established because hmd had sufficient contacts in the bulge area.see.k service of a summons is effective to establish jurisdiction over the person of a defendant who is a party joined under rule or rule and is served at a place within a judicial district of the united states and not more than miles from the place from which the summons issues salamon motor vessel poling,cv,wl,at june,the circuit courts have uniformly concluded that if a party delineated in rule k has minimum contacts with the bulge area,the district court in the forum state gains personal jurisdiction over him through service of process pursuant to rule.the district court also noted that hmd had participated in discovery in the united states.see rationis,wl,at.
this appeal followed.hmd contends that the injunction should not have been issued in light of china trade development choong yong,cir.we held there that,in cases like the present one involving requests for an antisuit injunction,courts should give more consideration to whether the foreign action threatens the jurisdiction of the enjoining forum and whether strong public policies of the enjoining forum are threatened by the foreign action than to other factors,such as procedural convenience,considered by the district court in hmd case.hmd also argues,inter alia,that the district court should have held a evidentiary hearing.
discussion 
the requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states and is inflexible and without exception.steel citizens for a better env t,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d holding,as between and personal jurisdiction,there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy.we therefore turn first to hmd claim that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.see fid.partners,first trust,cir recognizing supreme court rejection of approach whereby courts assume jurisdiction to decide merits in favor of party challenging jurisdiction see also marra papandreou,holding personal jurisdiction is threshold determination that must precede merits.
a forfeiture of objections to the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
the cargo claimants contend that hmd has forfeited its lack of personal jurisdiction defense see ruhrgas,at.s jurisdiction is nonwaivable while restrictions on a court jurisdiction over the person are waivable.specifically,appellees argue that hmd missed the deadline imposed by a magistrate judge scheduling order for filing motions to dismiss.however,the scheduling order is ambiguous.in may,lawyers representing the largest cargo interests submitted a proposed scheduling order to the magistrate judge that required that a ny motions to dismiss based on jurisdictional or forum issues should be filed by september.the magistrate judge order adopted the cargo interests proposed schedule in part,subject to the modifications indicated below.in re complaint of rationis,d scheduling order.among those modifications was the following statement dispositive motions,seeking either dismissal,summary judgment or dispositive relief on any other basis,if any,shall be served and filed no later than july.id.at.hmd argues that this modification extended the time for filing motions to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds beyond the deadline suggested by the cargo interests.appellees,however,argue that the magistrate judge modification concerned only substantive,not jurisdictional,motions.the district court did not address this issue,and we are unable to determine,from either the proposed order or from the order the magistrate judge adopted,which deadline the judge intended to impose for the filing of jurisdictional motions.
appellees also claim that,even if hmd did not miss the filing deadline,it otherwise forfeited its jurisdictional defense under standards set out in our decision in hamilton atlas turn
