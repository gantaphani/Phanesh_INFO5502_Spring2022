mortgage electronic registration systems,mers appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york eric vitaliano,judge granting the motion of the putative class member plaintiffs,to remand this case to new york state court on the ground that mers notice of removal was untimely.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs complaint contained sufficient information to put mers on notice of the size of the putative class and amount in controversy to establish subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to d,and it held that mers notice of removal,filed more than days after receipt of the complaint,was therefore untimely under b.
we reverse and hold that,in class action fairness act cafa cases,the day removal periods of b and b are not triggered until the plaintiff serves the defendant with an initial pleading or other paper that explicitly specifies the amount of monetary damages sought or sets forth facts from which an amount in controversy in excess of can be ascertained.we also hold that where a plaintiff papers fail to trigger the removal clocks of b and b,a defendant may remove a case when,upon its own independent investigation,it determines that the case is removable thus,the day removal periods of b and b are not the exclusive authorizations for removal in cafa cases.
here,neither the plaintiffs initial complaint nor their response to mers demand for a bill of particulars in the state court explicitly specified the amount of damages sought or provided mers with sufficient information to conclude the threshold amount in controversy was satisfied.the named plaintiffs identification of their damages and their allegation that the potential class includes hundreds,and likely thousands,of persons and entities,were not adequate to trigger the day removal periods of b and b.we also hold that mers properly filed its notice of removal after determining upon its own investigation that the amount in controversy,number of plaintiffs,and diversity between itself and at least one plaintiff class member satisfied the cafa subject matter jurisdictional requirements set forth in d.we accordingly vacate the order of the district court and remand.
background 
the parties and the class complaint 
plaintiffs brian cutrone and jessica cervone filed the present putative class action against mers in the supreme court of the state of new york,kings county on february.their complaint asserts causes of action against mers under new york state law for common law breach of implied warranty,deceptive business practices in violation of new york general business law section nygbl,and false advertising in violation of nygbl,allegedly committed in connection with mers facilitation of the provision of esign mortgages to.
according to the plaintiffs complaint,mers is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in virginia.mers created an electronic process through which borrowers can obtain paperless esign mortgages and engage in refinancing of mortgages,and members of the real estate mortgage industry can more easily securitize and bundle mortgages.to facilitate these transactions,mers acts as the mortgagee of record in local recording offices regardless of the number of times a mortgage is refinanced or the relevant lenders change.
when a party executes an esign mortgage,no physical mortgage document,such as a mortgage note,is created.instead,the mortgage documents exist as electronic records registered on mers eregistry.when a party later wishes to refinance an esign mortgage or otherwise assign it to another party,mers inputs the applicable changes into its eregistry.thus,although mers never physically holds a mortgage note or related instrument,mers asserts that it facilitates mortgage and note assignments,including refinancing,utilizing its electronic database.
new york state courts have held that a lender does not have standing to commence a foreclosure action when its assignor,mers,neither received the right to transfer the mortgage note nor physically possessed the underlying mortgage note.see,bank of silverberg,dep t.esign mortgages acquired through mers electronic system may be,which limits mers customers ability to refinance their mortgages electronically and avoid recording fees,as well as mers ability to transfer pools of mortgages as securities.
cutrone and cervone obtained their first mortgage on their home in brooklyn through an esign mortgage that listed mers as the nominee and mortgagee on march,and paid in taxes as required by new york mortgage recording tax see tax law.four years later,they refinanced their mortgage.they were unable to utilize a new york consolidation,extension and modification agreement cema,which permits a mortgagor to consolidate his original and refinanced mortgages and pay only the difference in mortgage recording tax between the two mortgages.a cema could not be used because mers could not effectuate the assignment between the original and new lenders.the plaintiffs thus paid a second mortgage recording tax of on their refinanced mortgage on january.
in their putative class action complaint,which alleges that other borrowers were also required to pay additional recording taxes because of their esign mortgages,the plaintiffs do not specifically enumerate either the expected number of class members that will join them or the total amount of additional mortgage recording taxes paid by class members.the plaintiffs merely provide the amount of the mortgage recording tax they paid on their refinanced mortgage and estimate that the class includes hundreds,and likely thousands,of persons and entities.the plaintiffs also failed to specify in their response to the defendant demand for a bill of particulars in the state court the number of members in the putative class,estimating again that there were more than likely plaintiffs and,as to the damages sought by the class,that they can not reasonably state the precise amount in controversy.
federal district court proceedings 
on may,more than days after the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in new york state court,mers filed a notice of removal in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york asserting diversity jurisdiction under cafa,d.the notice alleges that mers examined its own records and concluded that its eregistry contained more than registered promissory notes in electronic form secured by mortgages on real property located in new york.the notice also estimates that,given the large number of relevant promissory notes in mers eregistry,even using a conservative estimate of damages for each possible class member,there is a reasonable probability that the matter in controversy exceeds the value of as required by d.finally,the notice states that mers is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business located in virginia and that the named plaintiffs and all members of the purported class are citizens of new york,thus satisfying minimal diversity requirements.
on june,the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand,asserting that mers removal was untimely under b because the plaintiffs complaint provided mers with sufficient information to determine the likely number of plaintiffs and total amount in controversy.by order dated october,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion,concluding that,although the complaint filed on february,did not specify either the total amount of damages sought or an exact number of class members,it provided mers with all it needed to know in order to enable it to make an intelligent assessment as to cafa removability.cutrone mortg.registration,cv env vms,wl,at.because mers did not file its notice of removal within days of receiving the complaint,the court held,its notice was untimely pursuant to b.id.at.
the district court rejected mers argument that our holding in moltner starbucks coffee,cir per curiam,that the removal clock does not start to run until the plaintiff serves the defendant with a paper that explicitly specifies the amount of monetary damages sought should be applied to cafa cases.cutrone,wl,at.the district court also reasoned that tying the removal clocks of b to the serving of an explicit statement of damages would be problematic here because it would mean that the jurisdictional amount in controversy requirement of d was never satisfied.id.at.thus,the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and remanded the case to the supreme court of the state of new york,kings county.id.at.
appellate proceedings 
on november,mers petitioned this court for permission to appeal the district court remand order pursuant to c and federal rule of appellate procedure a.it argued that its notice of removal was timely because plaintiffs initial complaint failed to trigger the day removal clock of b and urged this court to extend the rule of moltner to cafa cases.we granted mers petition for permission to appeal on february.we instructed the parties to brief the following two questions whether this court decision in moltner applies to cases removed under cafa and whether a defendant may remove a case under cafa if neither of the two day periods set forth in b and b is triggered because the initial pleading and other documents are indeterminate with respect to removability but the defendant later asserts removability on the basis of its own investigation.as explained below,we now answer both questions in the affirmative.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to c,which provides that a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not more than days after entry of the order.see also ditolla doral dental ipa of,cir.here,the district court entered its order on november,and mers filed a petition for leave to appeal on november,thus satisfying the applicable day filing requirement.
we review de novo a district court subject matter jurisdiction determination.see id.at.
ii.applicability of moltner to cafa cases 
we begin with a brief explication of the relevant statutory framework for the removal of cafa cases.in,congress enacted the class action fairness act,stat.codified,in part,at d,which conferred federal jurisdiction over any class action involving or more class members,an aggregate amount in controversy of at least,exclusive of interest and costs,and minimal diversity,where at least one plaintiff and one defendant are citizens of different states.blockbuster,galeno,cir citing d,b.in cafa cases,the defendant bears the burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction.see id.at.to establish the requisite amount in controversy for cafa jurisdiction pursuant to d,a defendant must show that it appears to a reasonable probability that the aggregate claims of the plaintiff class are in excess of million.id.internal citation omitted.
a defendant ability to remove any case satisfying federal jurisdictional predicates,including a cafa case,is subject to time limits.the general removal statute delineates two day periods during which removal may occur.see generally b.the first statutory provision requires that a defendant file its notice of removal within days of the service or receipt of the initial pleading b.the second section provides that if the case is not immediately removable,the defendant may file a notice of removal within days of receiving a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.b emphasis added see moltner,at.
neither provision specifies the information that must be included in a plaintiff initial pleading or other paper to trigger the day periods of b or how a defendant should ascertain removability.see moltner,at.the issue therefore arises,as it did in this case,of whether an indeterminate complaint or subsequent document triggers the removal clocks of b in cafa cases.
we addressed this issue in moltner starbucks coffee,at,a personal injury suit initially filed in new york state court.there,the plaintiff allegedly suffered severe burns while drinking tea purchased from the defendant.id.at.it was only in response to a letter from the defendant three months after the plaintiff filed suit that the plaintiff disclosed she sought more than in damages,the threshold amount for diversity jurisdiction under a.id.at.the defendant filed a notice of removal within days of receiving the plaintiff letter.id.in determining whether removal was timely under b,we rejected the plaintiff argument that the defendant should have concluded from the state court complaint that the amount in controversy would exceed by applying a reasonable amount of intelligence to the complaint general description of the plaintiff severe injuries.id.at.instead,we held that the removal clock does not start to run until the plaintiff serves the defendant with a paper that explicitly specifies the amount of monetary damages sought.id.at.we stated that a bright line rule is preferable to the approach the plaintiff advocates.requiring a defendant to read the complaint and guess the amount of damages that the plaintiff seeks will create uncertainty and risks increasing the time and money spent on litigation.id.
under the moltner standard,defendants must still apply a reasonable amount of intelligence in ascertaining removability.see whitaker am.telecasting,cir see also kuxhausen bmw fin.servs.na llc,cir.however,defendants have no independent duty to investigate whether a case is removable.see whitaker,at observing that the reasonable amount of intelligence standard does not require a defendant to look beyond the initial pleading for facts giving rise to removability.if removability is not apparent from the allegations of an initial pleading or subsequent document,the day clocks of b and b are not triggered.
in drawing a bright line rule requiring service of a document explicitly stating the amount in controversy to trigger either day period in b in moltner,we joined the eighth circuit.see at citing in re willis,cir per curiam we find the time limit of section b begins running upon the receipt of the initial complaint only when the complaint explicitly discloses the plaintiff is seeking damages in excess of the federal jurisdictional amount t his rule promotes certainty and judicial efficiency by not requiring courts to inquire into what a particular defendant may or may not subjectively know.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.that bright line rule was also consistent with the approach adopted by the tenth circuit.see akin ashland chem,cir we disagree with cases from other jurisdictions which impose a duty to investigate and determine removability where the initial pleading indicates that the right to remove may exist.rather,this court requires clear and unequivocal notice from the pleading itself,or a subsequent other paper such as an answer to interrogatory.emphasis in original footnote omitted.
since we decided moltner,at least three of our sister circuits have also adopted a rule requiring that the initial pleading or other subsequent paper contain an unequivocal statement from the plaintiff regarding the damages sought to trigger the removal clocks of b and b.walker trailer transit,cir see mumfrey cvs pharmacy,cir kuxhausen,at.two of those decisions involved actions brought pursuant to cafa.
in walker trailer transit,the seventh circuit held that t he day removal clock does not begin to run until the defendant receives a pleading or other paper that affirmatively and unambiguously reveals that the predicates for removal are present.at.with respect to the amount in controversy,the seventh circuit explained that the pleading or other paper must specifically disclose the amount of monetary damages sought,id,and held that,with reference to b,the removal clock commences only when the defendant receives a pleading or other paper that affirmatively and unambiguously specifies a damages amount sufficient to satisfy the federal jurisdictional minimums,id.at emphasis in original.the seventh circuit explained that this rule promotes clarity and ease of admini
