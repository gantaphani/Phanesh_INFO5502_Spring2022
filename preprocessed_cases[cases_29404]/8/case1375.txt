background 
the following facts,which we assume to be true,are drawn from the amended complaint and documents incorporated by reference.see tellabs,makor issues rights,d litwin blackstone,cir.in november,regions financial corporation regions,a regional bank holding company operating in the south,midwest,and texas,acquired another bank holding company,amsouth bancorporation amsouth,in a stock transaction valued at approximately billion.the proxy statement issued in connection with the acquisition disclosed that following the acquisition,regions would record amsouth assets and liabilities at fair value,and that any excess of purchase price over net fair value would be recorded as goodwill.
in february,regions filed its form k wherein it reported billion in goodwill,of which billion was attributed to the amsouth acquisition.the k also reported that regions had increased its loan loss reserves from million in the previous year to million.in explaining this increase,the k stated 
two primary factors led to the increase.most notably,included just two months of provision for loan losses added to the portfolio as a result of the november merger with amsouth,while the provision recorded in reflected the results of the newly merged regions for the full year.additionally,the provision rose due to an increase in management estimate of inherent losses in its residential homebuilder portfolio,as well as generally weaker conditions in the broader economy.
in april regions financing trust iii the trust,a delaware statutory trust and wholly owned subsidiary of regions,issued million shares of trust preferred securities hybrid securities with characteristics of equity and debt the securities in a registered public offering the offering.the registration statement and prospectus for the offering the offering documents incorporated by reference regions form k and certain additional sec filings.
in sec filings reporting its financial results for the first three quarters of the fiscal year,regions continued to report goodwill of billion and moderate increases to its allowance for credit losses.however,in its fourth quarter results released in january,regions reported a billion net loss,largely driven by a billion charge for impairment of goodwill,and doubled its loan loss provision to billion as compared to a year earlier.in the months following these disclosures,the price of the securities and regions stock fell,and credit rating agencies downgraded the company debt.
following the amsouth merger,serious problems emerged in the housing and residential mortgage markets.beginning in late,several large mortgage lenders,particularly those making predominantly subprime loans,either filed for bankruptcy protection or significantly scaled back their operations.by,the mortgage market problems had spread to larger,more longstanding banks and lenders.this period was also characterized by rising rates of delinquency and foreclosure on home mortgage loans,and slowed housing sales.
following the decline in regions stock price,alfred fait,who purportedly acquired trust preferred securities,filed a putative complaint against regions,the trust,and other defendants.pursuant to a district court order,rensin was later appointed lead plaintiff and filed an amended complaint on november.the amended complaint also named as defendants individual members of the board of directors of regions who signed the registration statement and regions form additional defendants included ernst young e y,which served as regions independent public accountant and certified financial statements in regions form k,as well as the underwriters of the offering.
the complaint alleges,in essence,that despite adverse trends in the mortgage and housing markets,particularly in areas where amsouth mortgage loans were concentrated,regions failed to write down goodwill and to sufficiently increase loan loss reserves.as a consequence of these failures,the complaint contends,the offering documents either explicitly or by reference to other filings contained negligently false and misleading statements concerning goodwill and loan loss reserves.in particular,the complaint asserts that regions overstated goodwill and falsely stated that it was not impaired,and vastly underestimated regions loan loss reserves and failed to disclose that they were inadequate.
relying on these allegations,the complaint further contends that the offering documents incorporated false and misleading certifications by management that regions financial statements complied with the sarbanes oxley act sox and were prepared in accordance with gaap.it also alleges that e y falsely certified that regions financial results were presented in accordance with gaap,that e y audits complied with generally accepted accounting standards gaas,and that regions maintained effective internal controls.the complaint alleges that these misleading statements and omissions violated sections a,a,and of the securities act of securities act or act.see a,l a.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the challenged statements regarding goodwill and the adequacy of loan loss reserves were matters of opinion,which were not actionable because the complaint failed to allege that those opinions were not truly held at the time they were made.concluding that the challenged statements were ones of judgment and opinion,rather than fact,judge kaplan granted defendants motions and dismissed the complaint.fait regions fin,d.with respect to goodwill,judge kaplan observed that the goodwill reflected in regions k was the excess of the acquisition price,an objective fact,over the fair value of amsouth assets at the time of the acquisition,which was not a matter of objective fact.id.at.instead,the goodwill stated on regions balance sheet reflected judgments as to values that were not objectively determinable.id.at.thus,t he truth or falsity of that statement was a matter of opinion.id.similarly,judge kaplan observed that loan loss reserves reflect management opinion as to the likelihood of future loan losses and their magnitude.id.at.thus,w hether regions had adequate reserves for its predicted loan losses is not a matter of objective fact,but instead,t he reserves were statements of opinion by defendants as to the portion of the stated value of regions loans that would prove to be uncollectable.id.for these reasons,judge kaplan held that the statements in question were not actionable because the complaint failed to allege that defendants did not honestly hold those opinions at the time they were expressed.this appeal followed.
