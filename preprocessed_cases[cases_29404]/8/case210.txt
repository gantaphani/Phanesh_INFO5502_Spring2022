building,appeals from the entry of a preliminary injunction restricting its use of the word swarovski in newspaper advertising to a certain font size.the case is ongoing in the district court,with requests for permanent injunctive relief pending.the dispute began when building obtained a number of swarovski crystal figurines that it hoped to resell,and in order to promote the sale designed a newspaper advertisement emblazoned with the name swarovski in large print font.alerted to the proposed advertisement,swarovski aktiengesellschaft and swarovski north america limited collectively,swarovski sought a preliminary injunction barring building from using the swarovski name or mark in its advertising.after a hearing,the district court issued an oral opinion that granted the preliminary injunction in part by limiting building use of the swarovski name to a much smaller font size.
building is an retail store that acquires products through secondary,channels and then resells them at discounted prices in its stores located throughout new hampshire,massachusetts and rhode island.the business is known by its motto,good stuff cheap,and aside from swarovski crystal figurines,building has previously acquired and resold collectible merchandise made by companies such as thomas kinkade and hummel.building spends millions of dollars on newspaper advertising in new england to market itself as a vendor of salvage,overstock and discontinued merchandise these ads often feature descriptions of the advertised goods alongside humorous cartoons.
swarovski is a manufacturer and distributor of crystal,jewelry and other luxury products.it holds several registered federal trademarks for the mark swarovski,which it has used in the united states since at least.swarovski monitors and polices the use of its mark through a dedicated unit.it sells its crystal products online,in swarovski retail stores including stores in new hampshire,massachusetts and rhode island,in small independent retailers and in authorized national retailers such as macy,bloomingdale and nordstrom.swarovski merchandise may also be purchased through secondary channel,ebay and other discount retailers.
in december,building acquired a number of swarovski crystal figurines,with a total retail value of approximately,from an insurer salvage sale after a severe storm damaged the warehouse where they had been stored by their prior owner.the figurines were apparently unaltered and free from damage,and came boxed in their original packaging with the swarovski certificate of authenticity.although industry practice varies,in this case the salvor placed no restrictions on building ability to use the swarovski name or product label.swarovski itself never directly authorized building to use its trademark or name.
that same month,building conducted two,sales of its swarovski merchandise.it promoted the events through newspaper advertisements,one of which was headlined with the word swarovski in,capitalized,bold,and distinctive lettering.the bodies of the ads included cartoons of a tornado wrecking a warehouse,several pictures of crystal figurines,a list of the available items along with their prices and other text describing the details of the sale.the name building also appeared at the bottom of the advertisements in,capitalized,bold and distinctive lettering.at the events themselves,building set up a separate,display and sales area for the crystal along with various decorations featuring the word swarovski.
on december,swarovski sent building a cease and desist letter objecting to the ads,and a week later,on december,swarovski filed a complaint against building in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.it alleged various claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act and rhode island statutory and common law.in response,building agreed to voluntarily refrain from further advertising or sale of the swarovski crystal in its possession.
all was well until april,when building provided swarovski with a copy of a proposed newspaper advertisement that it intended to run to promote a mother day sale of its remaining swarovski crystal,and invited swarovski to suggest any further steps it could take to avoid consumer confusion.the advertisement came crowned with a headline that read one day event to,tornado hits warehouse containing genuine swarovski r crystal collectibles.the word swarovski appeared in,capitalized,bold and distinctive font.like the previous ads,the body of the advertisement contained several images and text giving details on the sale.the name building ran at the bottom of the add in,capitalized,bold and distinctive font.a disclaimer,in much smaller,unbolded font,also appeared near the bottom of the ad,reading disclaimer building is selling genuine swarovski r crystal products but building is not an authorized dealer,has no affiliation,connection or association with swarovski r and the standard swarovski r limited warranty is not available to our customers.the lawyers told us we should add that big but.
in response,swarovski filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to forbid building from using the swarovski trademark or name or any other marks or names or logos confusingly similar thereto in advertisements,promotions,customer cards or signage of any kind,and doing any act likely to induce the mistaken belief that swarovski products or services are in any way affiliated,connected or associated with or sponsored by building,including creating display areas tending to imply a store within a store event.
on may,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on swarovski motion,during which it heard arguments from counsel as well as witness testimony from several building employees and two swarovski employees who attended the first crystal sale.after a brief recess,the district court acknowledged the need for an expedited determination,due to building wish to advertise before mother day on may,and so the court departed from its usual practice of issuing a written decision and instead engaged in a little more rough justice by providing an oral decision today.ultimately,the court granted swarovski motion only to the extent that the capitalized word swarovski at the top of the proposed advertisement could be no larger than the font used for the name swarovski in the disclaimer at the bottom of the proposed advertisement.neither party raised any objection to this decision at the time.
building now appeals the district court order,arguing that it failed to include the necessary findings that its use of the swarovski mark was likely to confuse consumers and that swarovski would suffer irreparable harm as a result of its use of the mark.we agree,and therefore reverse the grant of the injunction and remand so that the district court may make further findings on these points.
a district court faced with a motion for a preliminary injunction must weigh four factors the plaintiff likelihood of success on the merits the potential for irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than denying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs and the effect,if any,on the public interest.united states weikert,cir.we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.see peoples fed.sav.bank people united bank,cir.within that framework,we review fact findings for clear error and issues of law de novo.bos.duck tours,lp super duck tours,llc,cir.
we begin with the district court approach to the first prong of the preliminary injunction analysis,swarovski likelihood of success on its infringement claim against building,because while each of the four factors is important,the cynosure of this test is more often than not the movant likelihood of success on the merits.borinquen biscuit trading,cir.this is so especially in a trademark infringement case,since the resolution of the other three factors will depend in large part on whether the movant is likely to succeed in establishing infringement.id.
to establish infringement successfully,a trademark plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant used an imitation of its protected mark in commerce in a way that is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a historically,the subject of trademark confusion has been the source of the good or service to which the mark is attached.see new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir.for instance,a shoddy crystal manufacturer might label its goods swarovski or something similar in order to fool consumers into thinking they were buying the luxury product.the typical situation in a trademark case involves the defendant having passed off another mark as its own or having used a similar name,confusing the public as to precisely whose goods are being sold.century real estate lendingtree,cir.in this circuit,we evaluate the likelihood of such confusion through the analysis laid out in pignons de mecanique de precision polaroid,cir 
but the confusion at issue in this case is of a different kind.building has not labeled its own products with the swarovski mark,but instead wants to use the swarovski mark to describe actual swarovski crystal.because some trademarked products are so and so unique,many goods and services are effectively identifiable only by their trademarks.new kids on the block,at.as the district court found,swarovski crystal is among them.unlike typical trademark infringement,where the defendant uses the plaintiff mark to refer to the defendant product,this nominative use involves building use of swarovski mark to refer to swarovski own product id.at.
the potential for confusion in a nominative use case is not one of source here,the crystal really was manufactured by swarovski but rather one of endorsement or affiliation.the fear is that a consumer glancing at building proposed advertisement might mistakenly believe that swarovski had some official association with the sale perhaps that swarovski sponsored the sale and so stood behind the goods as a direct seller,or that it had partnered with building in a way that might detract from its luxury status.see century real estate,at new kids on the block,at.
because this kind of confusion does not implicate the traditional function of a trademark,other circuits,most notably the ninth and the third,have developed a distinct nominative fair use analysis to identify unlawful infringement in cases like this one although these courts differ on the precise articulation of the doctrine and on whether it should replace the standard analysis or should serve as an affirmative defense,they generally evaluate the lawfulness of a defendant nominative use of a mark through the lens of three factors whether the plaintiff product was identifiable without use of the mark whether the defendant used more of the mark than necessary and whether the defendant accurately portrayed the relationship between itself and the plaintiff.see toyota motor sales,tabari,cir century real estate,at.in the first circuit,we have recognized the underlying principle of nominative fair use,but like several other circuits,we have never endorsed any particular version of the doctrine.see universal commc,lycos,cir see also rosetta stone google,cir tiffany nj ebay,cir,cert.denied.paccar telescan,cir.
given the uncertainty in this area of the law,the district court made an admirable attempt to evaluate the likelihood that swarovski would succeed on its infringement claim against building.ultimately,however,the district court opinion,perhaps because it was delivered to provide an expedited resolution of the interlocutory motion contemporaneously with the hearing,did not include a finding on whether building use of the swarovski mark in its proposed advertisement was likely to confuse consumers in order to support the issuance of the preliminary injunction nor are we able to infer such a finding from the court reasoning.
there is a need for greater clarity on the matter of likely confusion in this case.a trademark holder claim over his mark extends to uses of the mark likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a see also mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed describing likelihood of confusion as the k eystone of trademark infringement.swarovski may not charge infringement against all unauthorized uses of the swarovski name,but only those uses likely to cause consumer confusion,mistake or deception.the supreme court has made clear that a trademark infringement action requires a showing that the defendant actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers,with the burden placed firmly on the plaintiff.kp permanent make up,lasting impression i.without such a showing,no trademark infringement has occurred and so the trademark holder has no cause of action.
in this case,there is no indication from the record that the district court found a likelihood of confusion either under the traditional pignons test or under the nominative fair use test.the court first stated that swarovski had tried to shoehorn this case into the analysis laid out in pignons,but that pignons was a very different case from this.the court then applied the pignons analysis,as it felt it was required to do by our precedent.it found that only the first,second and eighth factors weighed in swarovski favor while the third,fourth,fifth,sixth and seventh factors either benefitted building or did not help either party the court ultimately concluded that it was not so sure that plaintiff met its burden under the pignons test.while this statement may not be a negative finding on the matter,it certainly does not indicate a positive finding that swarovski had met its burden under the traditional pignons confusion test.
the court next analyzed the advertisement through the three nominative fair use factors,as building urged it to do in its opposition motion to swarovski motion for a preliminary injunction,and which the court believed were more appropriate to the facts of this case.yet the court never explained if it was using those factors to measure the likelihood of consumer confusion.the court described the three nominative fair use factors as whether the product was readily identifiable without use of the mark,whether the defendant utilize d more of the mark than was necessary,and whether the defendant falsely suggested that it was sponsored or endorsed by the trademark holder.it found that the first and third factors weighed in favor of building swarovski crystal was not readily identifiable without use of the swarovski name,and the proposed ad made clear the product origin,how it came into the hands of building and that the sale was not sponsored by swarovski.presumably,then,these factors did not suggest a likelihood of confusion to the district court.
in its application of the second factor,on which its decision against building must have turned,the district court stated that in the headline of the proposed advertisement,the name swarovski is larger than any other font in that ad.it larger than the name building.it larger than the words event.it is clearly,i think,more use of the mark than is necessary to make the point.nevertheless,the court apparently believed that the font and size of the word swarovski as it appeared in the advertisement disclaimer was sufficient to attract the attention of anyone reading the advertisement.the court concluded that defendant has some issues with its burden under the nominative fair use test because i think that they are wanting to use more of the mark than is necessary to describe the product.
this analysis does not mention consumer confusion,but merely decided that building used more of the mark than necessary to effectively communicate its message.but as we have explained,a trademark holder has no right to police unnecessary use of its mark.whether necessary or not,a defendant use of a mark must be confusing in the relevant statutory sense for a plaintiff to raise a viable infringement claim.see prestonettes,coty,holmes,when the mark is used in a way that does not deceive the public we see no such sanctity in the word as to prevent its being used to tell the truth.it is not taboo.dow jones,int l sec,cir while a trademark conveys an exclusive right to the use of a m
