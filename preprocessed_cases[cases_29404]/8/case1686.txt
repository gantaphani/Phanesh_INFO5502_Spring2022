this appeal is taken from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,denying the motion by a debtor in foreign bankruptcy proceedings to enjoin actions brought against it in the united states.in re parmalat sec,d.the debtor is the entity that emerged from parmalat italian bankruptcy proceedings.because the district court acted within its sound discretion,we affirm.
background 
following its financial implosion in the wake of a colossal fraud,parmalat finanziaria,and several of its subsidiaries and affiliates old parmalat filed for bankruptcy protection under italy marzano law.the bankruptcy court in parma the parma court declared old parmalat insolvent,and italy minister of finance appointed appellant enrico bondi to serve as extraordinary commissioner of old parmalat bankruptcy estate,a role analogous to chapter trustee.
almost immediately after old parmalat filed for bankruptcy in italy,purchasers of old parmalat debt and equity securities the securities fraud plaintiffs filed securities fraud class action lawsuits in the united states the securities fraud actions against old parmalat and against various banks and auditing firms that had allegedly participated in the fraud.among the defendants were grant thornton international gti and grant thornton,llp collectively gt.
in june,bondi,in his capacity as extraordinary commissioner of the old parmalat bankruptcy estate,petitioned the southern district of new york bankruptcy court to enjoin actions against the old parmalat estate with respect to any property involved in its italian bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to of the bankruptcy code,repealed.section permitted a representative of a foreign bankruptcy estate to commence a bankruptcy case in the united states in order to enjoin litigation against the foreign debtor in courts it instructed courts to fashion relief guided by what will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of the foreign bankruptcy estate consistent with,inter alia,just treatment of all holders of claims against the estate,and comity.c.the bankruptcy court entered a preliminary injunction shielding old parmalat from american lawsuits injunction,and the securities fraud plaintiffs dropped old parmalat as a defendant.
once the injunction was in place,old parmalat went on the offensive in united states courts.among other initiatives,old parmalat sued gt for malpractice the recovery actions.
all the while,old parmalat italian bankruptcy proceedings continued.pursuant to his duties as extraordinary commissioner,bondi proposed a restructuring plan,the concordato,which became effective upon approval both by a majority of old parmalat creditors and by the parma court under the concordato,the assets of the companies that composed old parmalat were transferred to a newly formed entity,appellant parmalat,new parmalat,of which bondi is the ceo.in marked contrast to bankruptcy norms in the united states,new parmalat assumed all of the legal liabilities of its predecessor companies.under the concordato,
eligible unsecured creditors with a title cause that predates the date when individual old parmalat companies were declared eligible for extraordinary administration proceedings,including creditors whose claims were not included in the sum of liabilities but whose claims are later verified by a court decision that has become final and,therefore,can no longer be challenged creditors 
are entitled to receive new parmalat stock.concordato new parmalat thus functions as a claims administrator,converting approved claims against old parmalat into equity interests in new parmalat.in re parmalat sec,d at.liquidated claims are discharged upon receipt of new parmalat equity.
after new parmalat came into being,the district court permitted the securities fraud plaintiffs to amend their complaint to join new parmalat as a defendant in the securities fraud actions as the successor to old parmalat.new parmalat appealed on the mistaken premise that the district court order was tantamount to denying new parmalat protection against direct securities fraud claims.but the district court explained that it had not yet considered whether to grant relief to new parmalat because the court had never received a motion seeking that relief.new parmalat withdrew its appeal and moved in the district court to expand the existing injunction to bar the securities fraud plaintiffs from bringing direct claims against new parmalat the expansion motion.
while the expansion motion was pending,the district court granted another one brought by gti and bank of america,narrow the injunction to permit certain parties who were defendants in both the recovery actions and the securities fraud action to file third party contribution claims against new parmalat based on old parmalat securities fraud the narrowing order.the narrowing order contained a special feature to the extent that any judgment in favor of gti,bank of america,or any other third party plaintiff,exceeds what the third party plaintiff owes new parmalat,enforcement of the contribution claims will be allowed only in italy.in other words,while the third party plaintiffs can use american judgments to set off their liability to new parmalat,they may collect no money from new parmalat unless and until the italian courts choose to enforce the american court judgment.new parmalat appealed,and we eventually affirmed.see in re parmalat sec.cir.
while the appeal from the narrowing order was pending in this court,the district court denied new parmalat expansion motion,a decision which effectively let the securities fraud plaintiffs bring direct in addition to contribution claims against new parmalat.in re parmalat sec,d expansion denial order.this is the order now on appeal.
in explaining the expansion denial order,the district court referred to its narrowing order then on appeal,and later affirmed,see infra,and the five considerations that drove its decision there that economical and expeditious administration of the old parmalat estate would best be served by liquidating liability in the united states,where relevant facts were already being litigated in the securities fraud litigation that comity would be served because,while plaintiffs would be allowed to liquidate their claims in the united states,they would be enforced only in italy,if at all that the narrowing order does not unfairly advantage gt because its contribution claim will be permitted in some forum in any not in the united states,then in italy that bondi equitable claim to protection is weakened by his affirmative recovery actions against parmalat auditors and banks in the american courts rather than in italy and that settlement would be facilitated by having all potentially liable parties before the district court.
in denying the expansion motion,judge kaplan wrote that t he same considerations weigh against section relief here.in re parmalat sec,d at.specifically,judge kaplan reasoned since the narrowing order permitted gti contribution claims against new parmalat,new parmalat was already before the court to litigate its fault for the securities fraud as to comity,the italian courts would benefit from an american court determination of new parmalat liability under american securities law an issue the parties were already litigating,and plaintiffs seek to liquidate their claims in the united states,but would seek to enforce any judgment only in italy bondi claim to equitable relief was no stronger than it was at the time of the narrowing order and denying relief would facilitate settlement.id.the district court concluded while denying section relief undoubtedly would impose some expense on new parmalat,the court is persuaded that the benefits in efficiency and expeditiousness outweigh the costs.id.
in sum,when motion practice concluded,new parmalat was subject both to contribution claims and to direct claims for securities fraud in the district court.
shortly after the district court denied new parmalat expansion motion,we affirmed the narrowing order.in re parmalat sec.we emphasized that the district court decision to leave the enforcement or not of any judgment against to the italian courts was a sufficient measure of deference and comity.id.at.
discussion 
we review the expansion denial order for abuse of discretion,see id.at accord bank of new york treco in re treco,cir,mindful that courts enjoy broad latitude in fashioning an appropriate remedy under,koreag,controle et revision refco,in re koreag,controle et revision,cir.
subsection c of required that,
in determining whether to grant injunctive relief,the court shall be guided by what will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of such estate,consistent with 
just treatment of all holders of claims against or interests in such estate 
protection of claim holders in the united states against prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of claims in such foreign proceeding 
prevention of preferential or fraudulent dispositions of property of such estate 
distribution of proceeds of such estate substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by this title 
comity and 
if appropriate,the provision of an opportunity for a fresh start for the individual that such foreign proceeding concerns.
c repealed.new parmalat contends that the expansion denial order violated instruction to assure an economical and expeditious administration of the foreign estate,and that it was inconsistent with both just treatment of all claimholders and comity.
we can not say categorically that allowing the american securities fraud litigation to proceed before judge kaplan will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of the old parmalat bankruptcy estate.it depends.on one hand,american litigation costs can be exorbitant on the other,it may cost new parmalat less to litigate the securities fraud litigation here and now,given the risk that the securities fraud plaintiffs will bring their american claims in the parma court.the governing law is that of the united states,and the frauds alleged were conducted in english.if the securities fraud action were to be litigated in italy some time in the future,the parma court would confront a foreign legal and regulatory scheme to which we are informed there is no italian analog,a large number of documents in a foreign language,and no doubt conflicting expert affidavits on what american securities law requires.all that said,we can not say with assurance that,if excluded from american courts,the securities fraud plaintiffs would proceed in italy at all.
so there are good reasons on either side of the proposition that granting the expansion motion would best assure an economical and expeditious administration of the old parmalat estate.the question is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the expansion motion.
of course,if we believed that the parma court would view the district court as lacking jurisdiction and that the parma court would treat any american judgment as a nullity,then we would reverse.under that circumstance,we assume the district court would not have entered its order in the first place.but,to our knowledge,the parma court has made no statement regarding the district court jurisdiction to liquidate the securities fraud actions.
new parmalat contends that the expansion denial order is inconsistent with just treatment of all claimholders,c,and comity,id.c.
new parmalat emphasizes that its shareholders are all claimholders,and argues that the expansion denial order thus treats other claimholders unjustly by imposing litigation costs on new parmalat without any potential benefit.but the detriment is the same as that suffered by shareholders in any company that is made the defendant of a legitimate lawsuit.and it would do no injustice to other claimholders if the securities fraud plaintiffs win a judgment,the direction of the parma in issuance of new parmalat stock.true,issuance of stock to the securities fraud plaintiffs would dilute new parmalat equity,thus reducing the value of existing share holdings but there is no cognizable injustice to one claimholder in the satisfaction of claims properly presented by another.
appellants argue as they did when appealing the narrowing order that denying the expansion motion violates policy of comity.on new parmalat appeal from the narrowing order,we considered the nature of parmalat italian bankruptcy proceedings and the concordato,and we concluded that to leave the enforcement or not of any judgment against to the italian courts was a sufficient measure of deference and comity.in re parmalat sec.at.since the expansion denial order makes clear that the courts of italy will decide whether or not to enforce any judgment that the securities fraud plaintiffs win in their direct suits against new parmalat,we adhere to the view that international comity is respected.
this appeal is distinguishable factually from new parmalat appeal of the narrowing order,but the differences do not compel a different result on comity grounds.the narrowing order allowed the defendants in bondi recovery action to assert counterclaims,and thus to set off any judgment bondi might win against them,whereas the expansion denial order opens new parmalat to suit by parties unconnected to the recovery actions.in both cases,however,the orders are consistent with comity because no third party plaintiff would be permitted to collect on an american judgment without the italian courts approval.
finally,the district court order does not violate the dictate of italian bankruptcy law that the bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to satisfy creditors claims.the securities fraud plaintiffs are not yet creditors of new parmalat.only if the securities fraud plaintiffs prevail in district court will they become judgment creditors of new parmalat and,as creditors,they will be required to submit their claims to the italian courts for enforcement.
new parmalat complains that the district court considered two factors not properly a part of the analysis settlement potential and bondi offensive litigation in the united states.
we are naturally inclined against judicial decisions calculated to force a defendant to settle.see,in re visa antitrust,cir jacobs,dissenting.but it is hard to dispute the district court idea that consolidating american securities claims before a single court would make it easier for the parties to settle their differences without a judicial determination of liability.see in re parmalat sec,d at expansion denial order.this may or may not be true.indeed,it is unclear whether the concordato would allow for any such settlement at all.but,in any event,since it is often thought that settlement is more economical and expeditious than litigation,the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in considering likelihood of settlement.
finally,we see nothing improper about weighing bondi offensive litigation in the united states it is incrementally harder for bondi to contend that it is a hardship for him to be where he has chosen to come.
in dissent,judge wesley states that it is imprudent to issue this opinion now because in the parties words the parties do not believe that a disposition of the appeal at this time would advance the interests of either party,and because in judge wesley words the relevance of this court resolution of the appeal is entirely dependent upon the outcome of the settlement approval process in the southern district.we respectfully disagree for the following reasons 
first,the parties brought this controversy before us,and they have not moved to withdraw it.as the parties advise,this case is not no doubt it may become moot if left undecided long enough.
second,we expect that our opinion will be of use to the well as other persons and entitles the district judge may want to consider whether the case is properly before him as he decides whether to approve the proposed settlement,see.e the italian which we owe a duty of comity unaffected by the stated desires of the parties,and which would decide whether to enforce the resulting wish to know whether the case and settlement was properly before the district court and the class members,who must decide whether to object to the proposed settlement,see.e,or
