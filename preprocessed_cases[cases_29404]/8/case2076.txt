on this appeal,tlhc contends that in reaching their decisions,the bankruptcy and district courts erroneously interpreted b of the bankruptcy code,which states that a party in interest may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter.b.tlhc argues that this provision creates an unconditional statutory right for parties in interest to intervene in adversary proceedings that occur in connection with a chapter bankruptcy case.because we find that the plain text of the statute indicates congress intended to grant such a right,we reverse the lower courts decisions and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
caldor constituted one of the largest discount retailers in the corridor,operating stores in ten east coast states.on september,caldor filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.pursuant to and of the bankruptcy code,caldor remained in possession and control of its businesses as a debtor in possession.
tlhc represents the holders of a term loan under a credit agreement dated october,term loan holders and the holders of a real estate loan under a credit agreement dated august,real estate loan holders.at the time of caldor bankruptcy petition,the term loan,worth approximately million,secured by a first lien against caldor inventory and proceeds,and the real estate loan,worth million,was secured by real estate owned by caldor.as part of caldor financing plan,the term loan holders were granted a second lien against most of caldor real estate interests,and the real estate loan holders were granted a third lien against such interests.the term loan holders and real estate loan holders both looked toward the proceeds from the sale of caldor inventory and leases to satisfy their secured claims.
after unsuccessfully attempting to reorganize,caldor decided in early to wind down its operations and liquidate its assets.by a january,order,the bankruptcy court approved caldor decision.
pursuant to a settlement agreement among the term loan holders,the real estate loan holders,and caldor,approved by the bankruptcy court on february,the term loan holders and the real estate loan holders were paid certain proceeds of their collateral and were granted,and still hold,allowed administrative claims aggregating million.
as part of its,caldor decided to sell substantially all of its inventory in the remaining stores the merchandise.caldor solicited bids for the right to purchase the inventory and chose to sell its merchandise to the joint liquidators,who had formed a joint venture.the joint liquidators and caldor negotiated a purchase and license agreement the purchase agreement,executed on or about february.by application dated february,the application,caldor sought an order from the bankruptcy court approving the purchase agreement.tlhc filed a limited objection to the fee requested in the application and participated at the hearing to approve the application on february.after the hearing and competitive bidding in open court,the bankruptcy court approved an amended version of the purchase agreement by an order dated february,the approval order.
pursuant to the purchase agreement and the approval order,the joint liquidators transferred over million to caldor and conducted sales at caldor stores,selling all of caldor remaining inventory to the public.the sales commenced on february,and were completed in.
thereafter,caldor allegedly refused to honor certain purchase price adjustment provisions of the purchase agreement.based on this refusal,the joint liquidators initiated this adversary proceeding against caldor on july,alleging breach of contract and related claims,and seeking over million in damages.caldor answered the joint liquidators complaint by stating various affirmative defenses and counterclaims for,among other things,reformation of the contract based on mutual mistake and fraud in the inducement.
on august,tlhc moved to intervene in the adversary proceeding under b and federal rule of civil procedure frcp tlhc sought intervention as a matter of right under frcp a,arguing that b conferred on it a right to appear and be heard.tlhc asserted furthermore that its constituents administrative claim for million constituted the largest single administrative claim in caldor chapter case,and since caldor estates were administratively insolvent,the outcome of the joint liquidators adversary proceeding seeking million from caldor would necessarily impact upon the amount of property of the estates available for the benefit of creditors.tlhc mot.to intervene.in light of its pecuniary interest in the outcome of the adversary proceeding,tlhc argued that it was the true party in interest in caldor c hapter case.id.tlhc also sought permissive intervention under frcp b.
the joint liquidators opposed tlhc motion,denying there were any grounds for tlhc to intervene as of right or permissively.in particular the joint liquidators argued that b provided a party in interest with a right to be heard in a case only and that it stated nothing about intervention in an adversary proceeding.
caldor,for its part,urged the bankruptcy court to grant tlhc motion,acknowledging that it had solicited and encouraged the active participation of tlhc in this adversary proceeding.caldor.resp.to tlhc mot.to intervene.
on september,the bankruptcy court denied tlhc motion and read its opinion into the record.noting that the joint liquidators did not dispute that tlhc was a party in interest under b,the bankruptcy court acknowledged the split in authority over whether b applies to a chapter case only or to adversary proceedings commenced in such a case as well.the bankruptcy court cited official unsecured creditors committee michaels in re marin motor oil,cir cert.denied,d and sarah neuman foundation,garrity in re neuman,for the proposition that b grants a right to intervene in adversary proceedings,and fuel oil supply and terminaling gulf oil,cir and fifth avenue associates,new york state department of taxation and finance in re fifth avenue associates,for the opposing view that b is applicable only to the chapter case.the bankruptcy court concluded that the latter cases state the better view and held that b therefore provided no basis for tlhc to intervene under frcp a.
with regard to frcp a,the bankruptcy court reasoned that caldor,as a,was a fiduciary of its creditors and that in liquidating its assets,caldor was obligated to act in the best interests of its creditors.the court found that tlhc failed to allege or adduce any evidence that caldor would not adequately represent tlhc interests in the adversary proceeding and rejected tlhc bid to intervene under frcp a.the bankruptcy court also denied tlhc permission to intervene under frcp b,concluding that tlhc interest in maximizing its recovery in caldor administratively insolvent case was not a claim or defense within the meaning of frcp b.
tlhc appealed,and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision in term loan holder comm.ozer group,llc in re caldor,b jlg,wl may.the district court reviewed the cases identified by the bankruptcy court on the application of b to adversary proceedings and agreed with the bankruptcy court that fuel oil and fifth avenue provide d slightly more persuasive reasoning than marin and neuman.id.at.the district court explained 
as those decisions point out,legislative and judicial signposts demonstrate that congress did not create an absolute statutory right to intervene in bankruptcy adversary proceedings through b but instead intended courts to apply rule a to applications to intervene in bankruptcy proceedings under b.

in further support of its decision not to follow marin,the district court pointed out that marin reasoning followed the version of collier on bankruptcy.id.the court observed that since marin was decided,the treatise had changed its position several times through its various revisions,from favoring a view that b covered adversary proceedings to opposing such an view and then back again to favoring it.collier over the past twenty years undermines its authoritativeness,though it is also an indication of the closeness of the question.id.
the district court also noted that in light of fuel oil and other opinions critical of marin,the third circuit itself had subsequently questioned whether or not marin is the better view.id.quoting,coopers lybrand,cir.the court stated that in,the third circuit suggested it might have rejected marin position were it not for the circuit internal operating procedures requiring the court to sit en banc to depart from a prior panel decision.id.

after concluding that b provided tlhc no avenue to intervene under frcp a,the district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court decision not to grant tlhc leave to intervene under frcp a or b.id.at 
tlhc now appeals from the district court holding solely on the issue of whether b confers on a party in interest an unconditional right to intervene in an adversary proceeding within the meaning of frcp a.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to d.

in this appeal from a district court affirmation of a bankruptcy court ruling,our review of the bankruptcy court decision is independent and plenary,bell bell in re bell,cir,and we review the bankruptcy court interpretation of the bankruptcy statute de novo,capital communications fed.credit union boodrow in re boodrow,cir.
prior case law 
whether b confers on parties in interest an unconditional right to intervene in adversary proceedings is a question of first impression in this circuit to date,the third and fifth circuits are the only courts of appeals to have ruled on the issue.
in official unsecured creditors committee michaels in re marin motor oil,cir,the third circuit answered the instant question in the affirmative.looking first to the text of b,the marin court found that the language of the statute would seem clearly to favor the position espoused by the creditors committee that the provision accorded it an absolute right to intervene in an adversary proceeding instituted in connection with the chapter case.id.at.
the marin court buttressed its interpretation of the statutory language with a detailed account of the statutory and legislative history of b,showing that b was derived from of chapter x of the predecessor bankruptcy law.id.at.the court explained that former had granted creditors the right to be heard on all matters arising in a proceeding under this chapter and had been construed by courts and commentators to provide an absolute right to appear and be heard in adversary proceedings.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the marin court reviewed the existing bankruptcy court case law on b and determined that it generally supported the view that b should be given as broad and absolute a reading as had received.id.at.
in fuel oil supply terminaling gulf oil,cir,the fifth circuit rejected marin and held that b was not addressed to adversary proceedings.the fuel oil court explained 
at first blush,prior bankruptcy practice and the legislative history of b appear to support the view of the third circuit that b requires a bankruptcy court automatically to allow a party in interest to intervene in adversary proceedings furthermore,as the marin court pointed out,the bankruptcy code makes no distinction between case and adversary proceeding for intervention purposes.based on the bankruptcy code alone,therefore,the argument that b creates an absolute right to intervene in adversary proceedings appears strong.
the fifth circuit concluded,however,that the marin court reasoning based on the text of the statute,legislative history,and prior bankruptcy practice loses much of its force when b is juxtaposed with the procedural rules governing intervention.id.at.the fuel oil court observed that courts are hesitant to find unconditional statutory rights of intervention and tend to construe frcp a narrowly.in light of the fact that t he statutes that do confer an absolute right to intervene generally confer that right upon the united states or a federal regulatory commission,the court found that b is not the type of statute generally considered to provide an absolute right to intervene.id.
the fuel oil court further noted that congress had drawn distinctions between bankruptcy cases and the proceedings related to them in several provisions in title of the united states code and in the bankruptcy rules.id.in particular,the court pointed out that the advisory committee note to frbp provided that i ntervention in a case and intervention in an adversary proceeding must be sought separately.fed.advisory comm.note.according to the court,this note makes no sense if intervention in the case provided entrance to the adversary proceeding as well.id.
finally,the fuel oil court reasoned on policy grounds that congress must have intended courts to apply frcp a rather than frcp a to applications to intervene in adversary proceeding.id.at.by applying frcp a,the bankruptcy court is permitted to control the proceeding by restricting intervention to those persons whose interests in the outcome of the proceeding are not already adequately represented by existing parties.id.
although no other circuit courts have directly addressed this issue,the first,fourth,and tenth circuits have indicated in dicta that they favor the fifth circuit view.see richman first woman bank in re richman,cir adopting fuel oil policy arguments concerning intervention in the context of a chapter proceeding vermejo park kaiser coal in re kaiser steel,cir kowal malkemus in re thompson,cir citing fuel oil for the proposition that b does not afford a right to intervene under frcp a.
the task of resolving a dispute over the meaning of a provision of the bankruptcy code begins where all such inquires must begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair,d.a s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute.id.at.our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.we thus begin by inquiring whether the plain language of the statute,when given its ordinary,common meaning,tyler douglas,cir,is ambiguous.
the text of b states in relevant part that a party in interest may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter.b.the crucial issue before us is whether we should read the term case in b to exclude adversary proceedings.in re marin,at.we therefore first consider the meanings of case,proceeding,and issue.
case,as used in the bankruptcy code,refers to litigation commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under the appropriate chapter of title.see,b,a.the bankruptcy case remains open until an estate is fully administered and the court has discharged the trustee.as one court has explained,t he case is the basis for taking control of all pertinent interests in property,dealing with that property,determining entitlements to distributions,establishing the procedures for administering the mechanism,and discharging the debtor.menk lapaglia in re menk,cir.
while case is a term of art in the bankruptcy context,it is a term that is.indeed,the joint liquidators have pointed to no authority that disagrees with the commonplace notion that the case triggered by a bankruptcy petition is an umbrella litigation often covering numerous actions that are related only by the debtor status as a litigant.sonnax indus.tri component prods.in re sonnax indus,cir see,bank united manley,a title case is the umbrella under which all of the proceedings that follow the filing of a bankruptcy petition take place.internal quotation marks and citation omitted collier on bankruptcy a i ed.a bankruptcy case is in colloquial terms,the whole ball of wax.
the term proceeding,too,has a generally accepted meaning in the bankruptcy context.black indicates that a bankruptcy proceeding is a particular dispute or matter arising within a pending opposed to the case as a whole.black law dictionary ed.this definition is in accord with one of the primary understandings of the term proceeding outside of bankruptcy as simply a n act or step that is part of a larger action.see,in re,a proceeding can be thought of as a step within the bankruptcy case.the term encompasses all disputes that rise to the level of a litigated or contested matter.citation omitted 
finally,an issue is a point in dispute between two or more parties.black law dictionary ed.
with this understanding of the relevant terms in mind,we turn to the text of b.it is important to recognize,as the third circuit did,that the exact language of b grants a right to appear and be heard not in a case but on any issue in a case.marin,at emphasis added.the issues referred to in b occur in proceedings,which themselves occur in and constitute part of the case.while the bankruptcy rules distinguish between different types of litigated matters that arise during the pendency of a bankruptcy case and divide them into contested matters and adversary proceedings,collier on bankruptcy at ed,the plain text of b does not distinguish between issues that occur in these different types of proceedings within a chapter case we hold,therefore,that the phrase any issue in a case plainly grants a right to raise,appear and be heard on any issue regardless whether it arises in a contested matter or an adversary proceeding.other courts that have similarly focused on the text of b have reached the same conclusion.see,neuman,at hadar leasing int l overmyer telecasting in re overmyer telecasting,the language of b clearly provides an equity security holder with the right to be heard in an adversary proceeding.any other construction given to the statute would be contrary to the accepted principles of statutory interpretation.internal citation omitted.
despite this straightforward reading of b,the joint liquidators contend that the statutory language is ambiguous and that we must look to the statute as a whole and construct an interpretation that comports with its primary purpose and does not lead to anomalous or unreasonable results.appellees br.at quoting united states dep t of the interior,cir.we reject the joint liquidators effort to construct a narrow interpretation of b based on various materials extrinsic to the text for the following reasons.
the joint liquidators argue first that the mere fact that various courts have reached divergent results on the question of b applicability to adversary proceedings indicates that the text of the provision must be ambiguous.this argument is unpersuasive because the courts that adopted a narrow view of b based their decisions on grounds other than the text of b,relying,for example,on the bankruptcy rules,advisory committee notes,legislative history,or policy concerns.see,fuel oil,at fifth,at sarah neuman,garrity in re neuman,this court views the issue as one which implicates broad issues of bankruptcy policy rev rollert charter crude oil in re charter,marin can be distinguished by a subsequent change in the rules of bankruptcy procedure.first.bank terex in re terex,marin misreads the legislative history to section,and considers the issue from too narrow a perspective.as noted above,even the fuel oil court conceded that b ased on the bankruptcy code alone,the argument that b creates an absolute right to intervene in adversary proceedings appears strong.at.the fact that a number of courts have elevated other sources above the text does not prove that the text is ambiguous.
the joint liquidators further contend that failing to construct an interpretation of case in b that excludes adversary proceedings would render b inconsistent with the bankruptcy rules and advisory committee notes.there appear to us to be at least two problems with this line of argument.first,as a general matter,forsaking the plain meaning of a provision of the bankruptcy code solely because that meaning conflicts with a bankruptcy rule would run afoul of.second,we disagree,in any event,that the bankruptcy rules or the advisory committee notes require the interpretation of case advocated by the joint liquidators.
the rules enabling act rea provides in relevant part that t he supreme court shall have the power to prescribe by general rules,the forms of process,writs,pleadings,and motions,and the practice and procedure in cases under title.such rules shall not abridge,enlarge,or modify any substantive right.emphasis added 
the joint liquidators argue that courts interpreting b narrowly have simply used the rules as evidence of congress intent.concerning the fuel oil court reliance on the rules,we are urged to follow fifth,which concluded,f ar from using frbp to modify or enlarge a substantive right,the fifth circuit merely looked to to help it ascertain congress intent regarding the scope of b.at because b does not grant parties in interest the absolute right to intervene in adversary proceedings the joint liquidators assert,the district court decision did not violate.appellees br.at.in other words,according to the joint liquidators,only if we assume from the outset that the term case includes adversary proceedings would we be in danger of using the rules to modify a substantive right.if we refrain from adopting a view of the scope of b before turning to the rules,this reasoning goes,then we are merely using the rules to assist our understanding of congressional intent as to the breadth of the intervention right conferred in the code.
fortunately,we need not puzzle long over this chicken and the egg dilemma.the rea admonishes us that the code rather than the rules provides the controlling indication of congress intent with regard to substantive rights in light of the rea placement of the rules in a subsidiary position to the code,we believe that the proper interpretive approach is to give the language of b its most natural reading in the context of the code first.just as under the rea we must not read the rules to abridge rights granted in the code,we believe that we must also refuse to use the rules to create ambiguity in an otherwise clear code provision.
although we conclude that we need not resort to the rules and advisory committee notes to discern congress intent in b,we add that we find no tension between our reading of b and the rules and notes relied on by the joint liquidators.
two bankruptcy rules deal with intervention,frbp and.frbp governs intervention in an adversary proceeding and directs simply that rule civ.applies in adversary proceedings.fed.the joint liquidators assert that a broad interpretation of b would render frbp a nullity.they suggest that reading b to confer an unconditional right to intervene within the meaning of frcp a would make frcp a and b superfluous in adversary proceedings.this argument is flawed for the simple reason that b,by its express terms,pertains only to parties in interest other entities seeking intervention in an adversary proceeding may well find it necessary to enter those proceedings by way of frcp a,b,or b.see.a,b,b.
frbp governs permissive intervention in a case the joint liquidators appear to concede that frbp is not inconsistent with a broad interpretation of b because frbp applies to entities that are not parties in interest and not entitled to intervene as of right under b.appellees br.at in re addison cmty.hosp,rule a provides for intervention by entities not otherwise having a right to participate in the bankruptcy case under or other provisions.consequently,an entity given the right to be heard under need not seek leave under rule a to intervene in a case.citation omitted.
although apparently conceding the consistency of frbp,itself,with our interpretation of b,the joint liquidators do contend that the advisory committee notes to both frbp and indicate that congress intended the term case in b to exclude adversary proceedings.the advisory committee note to frbp states 
a person may seek to intervene in the case under the code or in an adversary proceeding relating to the case under the code.intervention in a case under the code is governed by rule and intervention in an adversary proceeding is governed by this rule.intervention in a case and intervention in an adversary proceeding must be sought separately.
fed.advisory comm.note.
the advisory committee note to frbp states in relevant part 
this rule implements and of the code.pursuant to of the code,parties in interest have a right to be heard this rule does not apply in adversary proceedings.for intervention in adversary proceedings,see rule subdivision a of this rule permits intervention of an entity not otherwise entitled to do so under the code or this rule.such a party seeking to intervene must show cause therefor.
fed.advisory comm.
although the bankruptcy rules and the advisory committee notes envision separate formalities for intervening in cases and adversary proceedings,they do not necessitate that the term case in b be construed to exclude adversary proceedings in marin,the third circuit confronted a comparable argument that adversary proceedings could not fall within the scope of the term case on the ground that a case is commenced by the filing of a petition and an adversary proceeding commenced separately by the filing of a complaint.the marin court concluded this distinction proved little an adversary proceeding is commenced in a different manner from the case with which it is connected no one has ever questioned this.at.likewise,although the manner for obtaining leave to intervene in an adversary proceeding differs under the rules from the manner for obtaining leave to intervene in the case,this difference is irrelevant to the question of whether an entity possesses a right to intervene.here,as everyone agrees,b grants parties in interest the right to raise and appear and be heard on any issue in a chapter case nothing in frbp and is inconsistent with the conclusion that issues raised in an adversary proceeding are issues in the chapter case within the plain meaning of b.
the joint liquidators argue that the statutory scheme supports the inference that congress regarded cases and adversary proceedings as distinct concepts for intervention purposes.appellees br.at.they point to and to several provisions in title ii of the bankruptcy reform act of,stat.the reform act or act.
with regard to,the bankruptcy code provides that the united states trustee may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding under title.the joint liquidators argue that had congress intended the phrase issue in a case in b to embrace adversary proceedings,it would not have been necessary for congress to have included the phrase or proceeding in.we note,however,that was added to the code in,subsequent to the conflicting decisions in marin and fuel oil on the meaning of b.see bankruptcy judges,united states trustees,and family farmer bankruptcy act of,stat.rather than conclude congress intended to grant the united states trustee intervention rights significantly greater than those granted parties in interest by virtually identical statutory language,we find it more likely that congress simply added the word proceeding to to alleviate doubts that the intervention rights extend to all proceedings in a case.
the remaining provisions identified by the joint liquidators as evidencing a statutory scheme in which case excludes adversary proceedings appear in the reform act amendments to title of the united states code.as the joint liquidators and several courts have pointed out,the distinctions drawn by congress between cases and proceedings under title include separate provisions dealing with jurisdiction,a and b abstention,d and venue,and and jury trials,a.fuel oil,at see also fifth,at relying on the distinctions in title as a basis for reading b narrowly assocs.niagara mohawk power in re assocs,same kenan fdic in re george rodman,same.we disagree that these distinctions occur within the statutory scheme relevant to discerning congress intent in b.
with the reform act,congress conducted a massive overhaul of both the bankruptcy law and the judicial system within which it was administered.pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,d.title i of the reform act enacted title of the united states code,creating the new substantive law of bankruptcy,while title ii of the act consisted of amendments to title of the united states code,creating a new bankruptcy court system.collier on bankruptcy ed.the joint liquidators focus on distinctions that appeared in title ii,in which congress established courts possessing jurisdiction to render final decisions in all proceedings that would affect the outcome of a bankruptcy case,including proceedings related to the case but based on state law.
under the law prior to the reform act,district courts had jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases and typically referred bankruptcy matters to referees.marathon,at.under this system,bankruptcy referees played a dual role deciding disputes and administering bankruptcies,at.the referees had limited jurisdiction to decide issues that were tangentially related to the bankruptcy case.marathon,at.one of the primary goals of the reform act,therefore,was to ensure adjudication of all claims in a single forum and to avoid the delay and expense of jurisdictional disputes.id.at.to achieve this,congress created a system of bankruptcy courts having jurisdiction over all cases under title as well as all civil proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to cases under title.see reform act,title ii,a a c,reprinted in collier on bankruptcy app.at pt.ed.the house report called the expanded jurisdiction of these courts a significant change from current law and stated that the bankruptcy courts would have the broadest grant of jurisdiction to dispose of proceedings that arise in bankruptcy cases or under the bankruptcy code,reprinted in.concerning the term proceeding in these provisions,the house report explained 
the bill uses the term proceeding instead of the current matters and proceedings found in the bankruptcy act and rules.the change is intended to conform the terminology of t itle,under which anything that occurs within a case is a proceeding.thus,proceeding here is used in its broadest sense,and would encompass what are now called contested matters,adversary proceedings,and plenary actions under the current bankruptcy law.it also includes any disputes related to administrative matters in a bankruptcy case.
id.at,reprinted in.the house report further stated that the provisions granting jurisdiction over proceedings arising under title,arising under a case under title,and related to a case under title,were intended to leave no doubt as to the scope of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over disputes.id.at,reprinted in.
as the congress collected different types of those based on state the fold of the bankruptcy court system,it was indeed aware of the distinction between cases and proceedings for purposes of jurisdiction,venue,and abstention.these distinctions,however,do not demonstrate that congress,in the different context of deciding parties rights within the substantive bankruptcy law,intended the term case to exclude adversary proceedings.
finally,the joint liquidators argue that refusing to recognize an unconditional right under b for parti
