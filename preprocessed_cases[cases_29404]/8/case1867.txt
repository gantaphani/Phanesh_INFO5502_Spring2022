the republic of congo appeals from judge preska order directing it to post security for the costs and expenses of plaintiff kensington international limited.the congo argues that the order violates the foreign sovereign immunities act.fsia.
we dismiss the appeal because the order is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.construing the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus,we deny the petition.
background 
kensington holds overdue congolese debt.it sought payment on the debt in england,and,in,an english court ordered the congo to pay approximately million plus interest.
kensington then sought to have the english judgment recognized in the united states,and it filed a complaint against the congo in new york state court.on the congo motion,the case was removed to the southern district of new york.kensington complaint asserted five claims for relief.first,kensington sought recognition of the english judgment.in the alternative,kensington alleged,second,breach of the loan agreement and sought recovery of the unpaid principal and interest.third,it sought injunctive relief based on the congo violation of the pari passu and negative pledge provisions in the loan agreement.fourth,it requested a declaratory judgment that two particular organizations are the alter ego of the congo.fifth,kensington sought costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the congo obligations.
on september,judge preska granted summary judgment to kensington on its claim for recognition of the english judgment.on march,judge preska granted kensington motion to require the congo to post security for costs and attorneys fees.the congo had argued that it was protected from such an order by the fsia,which establishes that the property of foreign states are immune from attachment,arrest,and execution.judge preska concluded that in the loan agreement the congo had explicitly waived any protection against prejudgment attachment under the fsia.the congo appeals.
discussion 
a appealability of the order 
the threshold issue is whether judge preska order is appealable.we conclude that it is not.
orders denying or requiring security are obviously interlocutory,and questions regarding their appealability turn on the applicability of the collateral order doctrine established in cohen beneficial indus.loan.caribbean trading fid.nigerian petroleum,cir.t he collateral order doctrine accommodates a small class of rulings,not concluding the litigation,but conclusively resolving claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action.will hallock,d quoting behrens pelletier,d.to be among that small class of appealable interlocutory rulings appealable under the cohen doctrine,an order must i conclusively determine the disputed question ii resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and iii be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal citations omitted.
we have held that orders granting security are not appealable because they fail to satisfy the third prong of the collateral order doctrine test the party ordered to post security may obtain complete relief on appeal from final judgment.see seguros banvenez oliver drescher,cir.in caribbean trading,we made clear that an order to post security is not appealable even where the subject party asserts immunity from prejudgment attachment under the fsia.at.in that case,a corporation owned by the government of nigeria appealed from an order requiring it to post security,arguing that the order was barred by section of the fsia.id.at.we concluded that appellate jurisdiction did not exist.id.at.we distinguished between claims of fsia immunity from suit under section,denials of which are appealable collateral orders,and claims of fsia immunity from attachment,denials of which are not appealable.id.at.a denial of the claim of fsia immunity from suit is immediately appealable because any ultimate success on appeal from a final judgment would not redress the erroneous denial of an immunity from the trial itself.id.at.in contrast,denial of a claim of fsia immunity from attachment would not subject a foreign state to a proceeding that could be avoided by a successful appeal.id.at.thus,invocation of fsia immunity from attachment is irrelevant to whether an order is appealable.
since caribbean trading,banque nordeurope,banker,cir per curiam,considered whether a district court decision to dissolve an attachment was appealable as a collateral order.banque nordeurope noted that a n impression has been generated in the federal courts that an order denying an attachment is appealable,but one granting an attachment is not.id.at.the court further noted that that easy test has been repeated even recently in this court,id.citing caribbean trading,at,and acknowledged a separate trend,both in our circuit and elsewhere,toward more flexibility in dealing with attempted appeals involving attachments.id.at citing charles alan wright,et,federal practice and procedure.banque nordeurope offered the following supplement a critical factor in appealability is whether the appeal presents an important question of law whose resolution will guide courts in other cases,or whether it involves merely the application of principles of law to particular facts.id.
after banque nordeurope,we took up this issue again in result shipping,ferruzzi trading usa,cir.in result shipping,we applied banque nordeurope holding that appealability rests,in part,on the importance of the issue.id.at.we concluded that we did possess jurisdiction because,first,the instant appeal present ed issues concerning the interplay of the arbitration act,on the one hand,and the supplemental rules governing the availability of security and countersecurity on the other and the resolution of these issues will provide necessary guidance to trial courts in this potentially recurring context,and,second,the other requirements of the cohen doctrine were clearly satisfied.id.at.thus,result shipping provides an explanation of what was meant by a more flexible approach even if an order vacating,dissolving,or denying an attachment satisfies cohen,courts have leeway to determine whether the issue on appeal is an important issue of law,the resolution of which may have relevance for future cases.
thus,rulings are appealable as collateral orders when they i satisfy cohen and ii present an important question of law.this is the only consistent reading of the cases because both banque nordeurope and result shipping involved orders that otherwise satisfied the cohen doctrine.banque nordeurope was an appeal from a dissolution of a prejudgment attachment,at,and result shipping was an appeal from a denial of a motion for security,at.both rulings involved district court orders that could not be redressed on appeal at the conclusion of the action,unlike an order to post security,which generally cause s no irreparable loss in that parties posting security will be repaid with interest if they prevail.caribbean trading,at.
while banque nordeurope may have seemed skeptical of the easy test that orders denying security are appealable and orders granting security are not,it did not in any way erode the requirements of cohen.instead,it established an additional requirement for appealability above and beyond the standard cohen test importance.the holding of caribbean trading therefore stands unchanged an order granting security is not appealable because the aggrieved party may obtain complete relief on appeal from final judgment.this appeal falls squarely within the holding of caribbean trading.
the congo argues that caribbean trading is distinguishable because judge preska order here would require the congo to bring immune assets into the jurisdiction,thereby vitiating the immunity of those assets and making them attachable under the fsia.this harm,it argues,would be irreparable and effectively unreviewable.
we are not persuaded.there is no unreviewable harm here because judge preska order does not have the breadth the congo attributes to it.her order requires the congo to either pay into the court the amount of,or post a bond in a for
