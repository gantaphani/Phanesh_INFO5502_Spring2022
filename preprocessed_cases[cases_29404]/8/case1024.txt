b.the dispute

in its decision and order dated august,the board noted ford position that the application of rsa,iii o to its franchise agreement with meredith would be an unconstitutional retrospective application of law because the contract predates the adoption of sections,i and,iii o.the board then examined the legislative purpose behind iii o and found that it merely made express the result that logic and fairness naturally implied from the bad faith language included in the statute predecessor.the board concluded that i t would be illogical to conclude that rsa,iii o should be inapplicable because it was enacted after though it did not elaborate on its rationale,the board also stated that subjecting ford to the requirements of impair ed no vested private contract right of ford.finally,the board concluded that,on the merits,ford failed to act in good faith when it decided to realign meredith dealer locality for reasons other than the criteria specified in the franchise agreement,and by not disclosing its true intentions regarding plymouth to meredith before december.ford appealed the board decision to the new hampshire superior court,where it is currently pending.
