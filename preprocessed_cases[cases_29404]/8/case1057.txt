plaintiff appeals from the denial of his motion to reconsider an order issued on august,by the federal district court,remanding the case to the state court.plaintiff real argument on appeal is with that portion of the order which purported to hold that the plaintiff was judicially stopped,when the case was on remand to the state trial court,from recovering more than in damages.we conclude we have jurisdiction to review that portion of the order and hold that once the district court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case,it did not retain jurisdiction to make such an estoppel determination.we order the estoppel language only stricken from the august,remand order.
this is a case that was originally filed in massachusetts state court,essex county,on june.plaintiff benjamin christopher alleged that injuries suffered to his ankle as a result of an accident with a nail gun were attributable to,the manufacturer of the gun.specifically,christopher charged with failing to exercise reasonable care in the design of the nail gun,in breach of implied express warranties of fitness and merchantability.while claiming severe and permanent damages in the complaint,christopher did not quantify his damages with a dollar amount 
on june,the essex county superior court remanded the action to the district court of lawrence,massachusetts,because christopher had failed to allege special damages in excess of.christopher promptly moved to the case to superior court,a motion that was again denied for failure to allege special damages.christopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to,this time attaching a photograph and of the injured ankle and a report from a treating physician.the report stated that permanent damage had been done to the ankle which caused chronic pain and rendered christopher permanently disabled from the type of work that he had performed prior to his injury.on july,the court granted the motion for reconsideration,and the case was transferred back to superior court.
while these events unfolded in the state courts,on july,filed a notice of removal to federal court pursuant to a.claimed federal jurisdiction under diversity of citizenship,alleging that christopher was a citizen of massachusetts and that was a citizen of delaware incorporation and rhode island principal place of business.as evidence that the amount in controversy exceeded,offered that christopher had received workers compensation benefits in excess of for his ankle injury.
in response to removal action,christopher filed an opposition to defendant request for removal effectively a motion to remand,c.christopher motion claimed that had not met its burden of proof that the amount in controversy exceeded.christopher made several assertions designed to imply that the value of the case did not exceed.first,he attached the superior court notice remanding the case to lawrence district court,characterizing that action as based on a factual determination by the superior court judge that the plaintiff damages could not exceed.christopher also pointed out that the information regarding the workers compensation settlement that had been cited by was not attributed to any source,reliable or otherwise.finally,christopher made the legal assertion that recovery of any lost wages that may have been part of the workers compensation claim was barred by.laws ann.ch,west.
opposed christopher motion to remand.first,revealed the omissions and misstatements made by christopher regarding the superior court remand of the case to lawrence district court.for example,despite christopher citation to the superior court factual determination,the only factor motivating the court remand was christopher failure to provide a statement regarding special damages.christopher neglected to mention that,following remand,christopher had twice petitioned the superior court to the case to superior court on the grounds that damages have greatly exceeded.most importantly,christopher did not reveal to the federal district court that the case had been to the superior court from the state district court five days before christopher filed his motion to remand.put in this context,christopher statement that the superior court had made a factual determination that the case was not worth more than was,at best,misleading and demonstrated a questionable lack of forthrightness to the federal court.
also provided an affidavit and a letter from cigna property casualty attesting to the in workers compensation that was paid out for christopher injury.argued that,despite christopher assertion to the contrary.laws ann.ch,west,does not prevent recovery of christopher lost wages.if christopher recovered lost wages from,cigna,the insurer,would be entitled to reimbursement under.reimbursement,asserted,would not affect the calculation of the amount in controversy for purposes of determining diversity jurisdiction.
the day after filed its opposition,august,the district court issued the following order 
this case is ordered remanded to the massachusetts superior court sitting in and for the county of essex.the plaintiff due to the position he has asserted herein,is judicially stopped from recovering more than in this action.
on august,the notice of transfer of the records to essex superior courthouse was filed,and the parties found themselves back in state superior court.
on november,more than one year after remand to state court christopher filed a motion for clarification with the superior court.the motion requested that the superior court disregard the portion of the district court remand order that stopped christopher from seeking more than in recovery.as grounds for this request,christopher asserted that once the district court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case,it lacked the authority to prevent christopher from seeking more than.opposed the motion for clarification,characterizing the district court action as an estoppel order,and arguing that the elements for judicial estoppel were present.after a hearing,the superior court denied christopher motion for clarification on february.
it was at this point,march,more than a year and a half after the federal district court remanded the case to superior court,that christopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the remand order with the federal district court.christopher asked the district court either to vacate the portion of the order limiting damages or,in the alternative,to revoke the remand and allow the case to proceed in federal court.in support of this motion,christopher stated that he had never argued that the case was worth less than,but only that had failed to meet its burden regarding the amount in controversy.in fact,according to christopher,the plaintiff has always contended that the value of this case was over.as proof of this,christopher attached his motion filed in the superior court to the case from the lawrence district court,the very motion that christopher had declined to reveal to the federal court in his original motion to remand.the next day,the district court denied christopher motion for reconsideration without elaboration.christopher appeals the denial of reconsideration to this court.
appellate jurisdiction 
we start with the question about this court jurisdiction over such an appeal.the district court remanded the case to state court.at the time that the court issued its order remanding the case,the only ground pending for such a remand was lack of subject matter jurisdiction,either because the amount in controversy was not met,or because there was not a sufficient showing that it was met 
congress has expressly limited the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal over remand orders,providing that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise excepting certain civil rights cases.d.this limitation is intended to prevent prolonged litigation of the remand issue,see united states rice,and to minimize interference in state court proceedings by the federal courts,for reasons of comity,see in re la providencia dev,cir.this limitation on
