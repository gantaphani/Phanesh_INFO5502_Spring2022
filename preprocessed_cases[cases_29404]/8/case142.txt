appellee t was an asbestos manufacturer that faced significant liability after the deadly qualities of its product became clear.like many other asbestos manufacturers,it chose to address this liability through a chapter bankruptcy reorganization plan the plan.t n plan,among other things,created the federal mogul asbestos personal injury trust the trust.the plan transferred to the trust certain of t n assets and rights,with which the trust was to pay asbestos claims brought by persons who could have sued t n but for its bankruptcy.while bankruptcy reorganization plans typically discharge all of a reorganizing company liability upon plan confirmation,this plan provided that t n asbestos liability would continue,and that the trust would bring asbestos suits against t n as the agent of the actual claimants.the purpose of this provision was to allow the trust to take advantage of a particular t n insurance policy.
in this lawsuit filed in,the trust brought an asbestos claim that had accrued roughly a decade earlier.when t n raised a statute of limitations defense,the trust argued that the reorganization plan allows it to bring this claim and any other asbestos claims that had not become stale prior to t n filing for bankruptcy protection whenever it wishes to do so until all of the proceeds of t n insurance policy are exhausted.the district court disagreed.having reviewed the plan documents and relevant provisions of the bankruptcy code,we now affirm the district court dismissal of the trust suit on statute of limitations grounds.
background 
a.the barraford claims 
daniel barraford died in of mesothelioma,a cancer generally caused by asbestos inhalation.barraford had been exposed to asbestos products manufactured by t n,among others,when he worked as an electrician and engineer on the construction of the prudential center in boston,massachusetts.in,his widow nora barraford brought suit against a number of asbestos manufacturers on her own behalf and as executrix of his estate.barraford did not name t n as a defendant because t n had filed in for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the code.et.under the code,the filing of a bankruptcy petition triggers a automatic stay that bars the commencement of suit against the debtor on any claim that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case.id.a.the stay covered barraford claims because,for bankruptcy purposes,any claim for personal injury arising from exposure to a product arises when the claimant was first exposed to the product.see in re grossman,cir en banc.
under massachusetts law,barraford claims would have expired at the latest in,three years after his death.mass laws ch,ch.the code,however,delays the expiration of any limitations period that would otherwise end during the duration of the automatic stay until thirty days have passed after notice of termination of the stay.c.the question posed by this case is whether that stay was terminated no later than december,the effective date of t n reorganization plan such that the barraford claims became thirty days thereafter,or whether the plan modified and extended the stay indefinitely,such that the claims were not when this suit was brought in.the answer to this question lies primarily in the language of the plan.
b.the t n reorganization plan 
to explain the pertinent terms of t n reorganization plan,we focus first on its creation of the trust.a personal injury trust is a special tool authorized by congress for dealing with the long latency period of mesothelioma.see g in re federal mogul global,cir.a trust allows a reorganizing asbestos manufacturer to wash its hands of further asbestos liability by,in addition to satisfying other statutory requirements,assigning all liability for asbestos claims to the trust and conveying at least fifty percent of its equity or the right to acquire that equity to the trust.id.g b.customarily,or so the parties tell us,a reorganizing company also assigns any applicable insurance policies to the trust.see,in re federal mogul,at.upon plan confirmation,the reorganized manufacturer receives a discharge of all liability for the claims.b,d.current and future claimants then proceed solely against the trust.id.g b.
here,we are told,two impediments to this customary course loomed.first,a million liability policy owned by t n the hercules policy could not be assigned to the trust under controlling united kingdom law.second,no proceeds under the hercules policy could be reached until t n satisfied a retention basically,a deductible of million in order to try to get around these impediments,the plan adopted an arrangement that the parties tell us is in some significant respects unusual.we briefly summarize that arrangement,albeit ignoring for a moment any twists created by statute of limitations issues.
first,although confirmation of a reorganization plan typically discharges the reorganized company liability,d,see also united states white,cir,plan instead provides that the liability of the hercules protected entities,including t n,would continue in full for asbestos claims until the hercules policy is exhausted the hercules policy expiry date 
second,the plan precludes the claimants themselves from actually bringing any asbestos claims against t plan a.rather,the plan assigns all of the asbestos claims to the trust,which is then allowed to sue t n as agent for the claimants.plan a.the plan allows such claims to proceed in the ordinary course to judgment or settlement.plan f ii.the plan also provides that when the trust brings such claims,t n refers the trust to its insurers,who control the defense.plan.f i.hence,the trust brings this action as agent for barraford against t n,whose defense is managed by its insurers.
third,to the extent that the trust prevails in a claim against t n,its recovery initially takes the form of a reduction in a million payment obligation to t n under a stock subscription agreement.plan,a i.this agreement is,in part,how the trust acquired the fifty percent equity in the reorganized company required by the bankruptcy code when the retention is satisfied,the trust may seek recovery directly from the hercules policy.plan,a iv.upon the hercules policy expiry date essentially,the date on which the retention is met and the million policy is exhausted t n will be discharged and released from all asbestos liabilities.plan a ii.
fourth,the trust net assets are used to pay those claimants who successfully pursue an administrative claim through a process defined in the trust distribution procedures.plan.as best we can tell,under these procedures,barraford recovery from the trust is not contingent on the trust recovery from t n.at the same time,all claimants,including barraford,presumably have an interest in the trust ability to prevail on enough claims so as to eliminate the trust debt to t n and exhaust the hercules policy 
the parties briefs substantially share this characterization of the plan.where they differ is on the question of when the trust needed to have brought asbestos claims against t n that would have been stale but for the automatic stay.the trust argues that the intent of the plan was to preserve all asbestos claims for as long as it takes to exhaust the hercules policy.t n argues that the plan contains nothing that would extend applicable limitations periods,so claims had to be filed before their limitations periods expired or,if that period expired during the bankruptcy proceedings,then within thirty days of notice of the plan effective date.we are told by counsel for the trust that there may be thousands of claims that the trust did not file in time to qualify as timely under t n reading of the plan 
c.the present suit 
on november,nine years after daniel barraford death and more than three years after the plan became effective the trust filed suit against t n in massachusetts state court,asserting negligence,breach of warranties,wrongful death,and other tort claims on behalf of nora barraford and her husband estate.t n removed the case to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts t n moved for judgment on the pleadings under.c,arguing that the trust suit was barred by massachusetts statute of limitations.laws ch,ch.treating the motion as one for summary judgment,as is allowed by.d,the district court granted t n motion,holding the claims.barraford t n,d.the trust appealed.it argues that the interaction of the code and the plan preserved barraford claims through the continued operation of the automatic stay imposed by code a.
ii.standard of review 
in this appeal from a grant of summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds,our review is de novo,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.genereux am.beryllia,cir.the district court interpretation of code provisions is also reviewed de novo.in re christo,cir.
a plan of reorganization is a binding contract between the debtor and the creditors and is subject to the general rules of contract construction and interpretation.in re new seabury,cir.the plan provides that it is governed by delaware law.plan.under delaware law,construction and interpretation of contract language,including the question of whether ambiguity exists,is a question of law.see in re olympic mills,cir applying delaware substantive law.if the language of the contract is clear,it will be the sole source for determining the parties intent terms are ambiguous only if they are reasonably susceptible of different meanings.id.
iii.analysis 
the dilemma facing the trust is that it needs to find in the interaction between the plan language and the code something that kept the stay in force or otherwise extended the limitations period until the trust brought this suit against t n,but that also allowed this suit to be brought notwithstanding that stay.the language of the plan clearly accomplishes the latter by authorizing the trust to bring suit in any appropriate forum,plan a,and by stating that such claims shall be allowed to proceed in the ordinary course to judgment or settlement,plan f ii.but nowhere does the plan even mention continuance of the stay,or any type of extension of any limitations period.
for its argument that the plan left the stay in place even though the plan expressly allowed suit to be brought,the trust first hangs its hat on the fact that the plan provided that only upon the hercules policy expiry date would t n be discharged and released from liability on the asbestos claims.plan a ii.the trust then points to two provisions of the code code c c,which provides that the stay continues until a discharge is granted or denied,and code c,which provides that the stay extends the limitations period for any stayed claims until days after notice of termination or expiration of the stay.from these provisions,the trust argues that even though the plan provided for the discharge of claims upon plan confirmation,because it did not discharge the asbestos claims,the stay has not been lifted for those claims and if the stay has not been lifted on the claims,the window to bring suit triggered by the termination or expiration of the stay has therefore not closed.t n contests this reading of code c c,and argues that the provision means that discharge of any claim in a bankruptcy case terminates the automatic stay for all claims in that case.under that reading,the discharge of t n claims on the plan effective date,plan,lifted the stay for all claims against t n.the district court sided with t n on this question of how the discharge operated,while a rhode island state court has since sided with the trust.see gallagher american insulated wire,no.pc,wl,podedworny am.insulated wire,no.pc,wl.
we need not determine who is correct about the effect of the plan delayed discharge provisions for the simple reason that code c c,the provision that continues the automatic stay until discharge,expressly recognizes an exception the entry of an order under code d terminating,annulling,modifying,or conditioning such stay.that language directs our attention back to the court order approving the plan.does the order,by approving the plan,terminate the stay with respect to asbestos claims as we note above,it plainly does so by unambiguously allowing the trust to bring claims against t n and by allowing,also unconditionally,for those claims to proceed in the ordinary course to judgment or settlement.plan a,f ii.indeed,if the plan were not read as terminating the automatic stay for these claims,then they could not yet have been brought.thus,regardless of the effect of a delayed discharge on the automatic stay under the code,here,the plan itself terminated the stay,triggering the window in code c.
the trust argument to the contrary is that the plan unconditional allowance to sue in the ordinary course is a modification of the stay under code d,rather than a termination.under the trust view,this modification extends the stay until the moment at which the trust brings suit,at which point the stay disappears with respect to that claim.this reading would accomplish two things it would get around the language in code c that provides that the window is triggered when the stay terminat es,and it would presumably explain how the plan could achieve the counterintuitive feat of simultaneously extending the stay and allowing suit.
this modification of the stay argument stretches beyond the plan reach.before the plan became effective,the stay had one relevant effect on unfiled asbestos claims it prevented suit.once the plan became effective,that single effect entirely disappeared.and because the plan discharge of liability for claims indisputably eliminated the effect of any stay on those claims,upon plan confirmation there remained no stay at all that even arguably could be modified.in other words,once the plan became effective,nothing was being stayed.
in contrast to this straightforward reading of the plan,the trust would have us infer a meaning that seems anything but straightforward.in substance,the trust would have us read a grant of a right to sue in the ordinary course as the equivalent of something that is hardly in the ordinary course a right to sue whenever the trust unilaterally decides to sue,no matter how long it waits,at least until the hercules policy expiry date.even if we assume that the parties could have agreed on such a provision,the plan language provides no clue that they did so.in this regard,we note that the trust itself appears to have developed on the fly its textual argument for how the plan provides for an extension and modification of the stay,rather than putting it forward in the district court as a reading that was accepted at the time the plan was agreed on.the trust also does not point to a single case in which an unconditional allowance to file suit was deemed to be something other than a lifting of the automatic stay with respect to the claims subject to that allowance.
the trust failure to present language in the plan either continuing the stay or getting to the real issue otherwise tolling the running of limitations periods is particularly significant given that it presumably would have been quite simple to include such language.this complete absence of any language extending the statute of limitations for claims brought by the trust against t n speaks especially loudly because the trust distribution procedures do expressly toll applicable limitations periods with regard to claims brought against the trust see federal mogul form of asbestos personal injury trust distribution procedures a.
in contrast,the plan provision that speaks most clearly to the issue of defenses cuts against the trust position.plan e explicitly preserved t n right and that of its reinsurers to assert any defenses,counterclaims,offsets,rights of contribution or any other rights and remedies for the purpose of reducing or defeating their liability for any claim,which by its plain terms includes the affirmative defense that a given claim is.see.c.the trust argues that the right to bring a defense does not mean the right to bring a successful defense.this is correct,but beside the point.even if one could otherwise read into the mere authority to bring suit a de facto waiver of any statute of limitations,the explic
