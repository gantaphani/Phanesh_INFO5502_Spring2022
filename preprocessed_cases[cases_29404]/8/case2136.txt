background 
the district court set forth in detail the facts relevant to this dispute in its opinion and order,see stock,d,familiarity with which is assumed.we restate here only those facts relevant to the appellate arguments or otherwise necessary for context.
in barbara new york stock,cir,we detailed the role the nyse plays the securities and exchange commission sec in the regulation of securities transactions executed on the floor of the nyse and the initiation of disciplinary proceedings in cases where a member person or firm fails to comply with the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder 
the nyse is a nonprofit new york corporation registered with the sec as a national securities exchange pursuant to section of the exchange act.as an association of securities dealers,the nyse authorizes its members to effectuate securities transactions on its auction market,known as the nyse floor.under the exchange act,the nyse is a organization sro,see a,which means that it has a duty to promulgate and enforce rules governing the conduct of its members,see id.b,g.these rules are subject to sec approval.see b.in accordance with the statutory scheme,the nyse conducts disciplinary proceedings when a member,or a person associated with a member,is suspected of violating federal securities laws or internal nyse rules or regulations.see id.d.the exchange act requires that these disciplinary proceedings be conducted in compliance both with the exchange act and with the nyse rules and regulations.see id.g.notice of any final disciplinary sanction imposed by the nyse must be provided to the sec,see id.d,and the imposition of a sanction is subject to review by the sec on its own motion or at the instance of an aggrieved party,see id.d.
id.at internal citation omitted see also sparta surgical ass of sec.dealers,cir the exchange act requires organizations to comply not only with the exchange act,but also with the association own rules.the failure of a sro to comply with these requirements carries serious repercussions the sro risks being subject to the sec broad sanctioning power that includes suspension or revocation of the sro registration,or a censure or limitation upon the activities,functions,and operations of the sro.h.
the instant appeal arises out of investigations conducted by the sec and the united states attorney office targeting groups of independent floor brokers,commonly referred to as brokers,who regularly execute trades on the nyse floor.the government suspected some of these brokers of violating section a of the exchange act and sec rule promulgated thereunder,as well as various rules of the nyse by engaging in illegal schemes of trading on the nyse floor while sharing in the profits or losses generated from those trades.in re stock,exchange act release,wl,at june.as part of its investigation,the government examined the trading activities of,who functioned as a floor broker at the nyse during this time.the investigations focused specifically on arrangement with the oakford corporation oakford,a former member of the national association of securities dealers and the american stock exchange.
the mechanics of the trading scheme were not complicated would purchase a particular security on behalf of a customer and thereafter sell that same security at a higher price,resulting in a net gain for the customer.received as a commission a percentage of the profits generated on these flip trades based on the spread between the bid and ask prices for the securities,typically of a point on each share of stock.exact share was determined by the individual agreements that he maintained with his customers.while there was no guarantee that these flip trades would result in a profit,as a floor broker,enjoyed a distinct advantage over other market participants because he had access to information regarding the performance of a particular security and the direction of its share price.
as a result of these activities,in february,the united states attorney office indicted for willfully violating various statutes and regulations that prohibited a floor broker from trading for his own account or for an account in which he exercised investment discretion.the sec and the nyse brought parallel charges against arising out of the same conduct.specifically,the government charged with illegally sharing in the profits generated by trades he executed on the floor of the nyse on behalf of oakford see,d at.although the criminal charges ultimately were dismissed pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement,the nyse charges ultimately led to suspension from the floor of the nyse,resulting in economic losses to.
in december,personally,and his company,securities,commenced an action against the nyse in the supreme court of new york,new york county,alleging that the nyse and various senior officials employed by the nyse conspired to violate applicable statutory and regulatory prohibitions governing unlawful trading,to wit,section a,rule and various rules of the nyse,by concoct ing a phoney interpretation of these provisions and knowingly disseminating that incorrect interpretation to the detriment of and other floor brokers.contends that he relied on the nyse interpretation at the time he engaged in trading practices that were later determined to be illegal.alleges that the nyse,in an effort to keep its activities secret and curry favor with law enforcement authorities,assisted the united states attorney office and the sec in their investigation and prosecution of by providing them with false,misleading and inaccurate information about.further alleges that the nyse failed to disclose to these authorities that it had approved and encouraged the practice of flipping,the specific type of unlawful trading for which had been charged.attributes the nyse inaction to the substantial fees earned by the nyse and clearing members on the high volume of flipped trades and a desire to increase the daily volume of trading activity on the nyse.contends that,as a result of the nyse alleged misconduct,he has incurred legal difficulties and has been unable to work as a floor broker on the nyse.
based on these and related allegations,brought numerous tort claims against the nyse and its various officers for injurious falsehood and concealment,fraudulent deceit and concealment,negligent misrepresentation and concealment,and,as to the nyse only,breach of contract.in connection with these claims,sought compensatory and punitive damages.
on january,the nyse filed a notice of removal of the action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to.notably,did not challenge removal of the action to federal court at that time or otherwise challenge the district court jurisdiction over the action.indeed,the issue of federal jurisdiction was not raised until the district court raised it sua sponte in a related case also before the district court see frayler stock,d.thereafter,the nyse moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to.c.relying on our decision in barbara,the district court granted the nyse motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice on the ground that the nyse and its senior officials enjoyed absolute immunity in the performance of regulatory functions delegated to them under the exchange act.see,d at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the present appeal raises two questions first,whether the instant action implicates a federal interest sufficient to sustain removal of the action to federal court,and second,whether employees of the nyse who,pursuant to statutory delegation,perform regulatory functions that would otherwise be performed by the sec are entitled to the same immunities from suit to which comparable sec employees would be entitled.id.at.the district court answered both questions in the affirmative.we agree,and therefore affirm the district court decision.

whether a substantial federal interest exists 
before we address the merits of the nyse claim of immunity from suit,we first must consider whether the action was properly removed to federal court.
pursuant to b,a state court defendant may remove a case to federal court only if the plaintiff claims could originally have been brought there.barbara,at.here,the nyse sought removal premised on federal question jurisdiction under section of the exchange act,based on allegations that the nyse conspired to violate,and encouraged to violate,section a of the exchange act and sec rule promulgated thereunder,as well as various rules of the nyse.t he propriety of the removal in this case thus turns on whether the case falls within the original federal question jurisdiction of the federal courts.merrell dow pharms.thompson,d merrell dow.section invests in the district court original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.while the mere presence of a federal issue in a state cause of action does not automatically confer jurisdiction,merrell dow,at.footnote omitted,a case is deemed to arise under federal law where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turn s on some construction of federal law.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d noting that l eading commentators have suggested that for purposes of an action arises under federal law if in order for the plaintiff to secure the relief sought he will be obliged to establish both the correctness and the applicability to his case of a proposition of federal law internal quotation marks omitted harms eliscu,cir even though the claim is created by state law,a case may arise under a law of the united states if the complaint discloses a need for determining the meaning or application of such a law.federal jurisdiction in these circumstances is predicated on the presence of a federal issue in a cause of action.merrell dow,at.consequently,in cases where state law creates the cause of action,we ask whether that cause of action poses a substantial federal question.commercial owners,cir see also merrell dow,at.noting that commentators have framed the jurisdictional inquiry in these cases as an evaluation of the nature of the federal interest at stake franchise tax,at.the arising under language in section tracks similar language in art.iii,of the constitution,which has been construed as permitting congress to extend federal jurisdiction to any case of which federal law potentially forms an ingredient.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.

each of the four causes of action in state court complaint alleges claims under the common law of the state of new york.this point is undisputed by the parties.argues that a finding that federal jurisdiction is lacking is mandated by our prior decision in barbara,in which we held improper the removal of an action challenging the propriety of internal disciplinary proceedings conducted by the nyse.in response,the nyse argues that removal was proper because the federal issues underlying state law claims are sufficiently substantial to confer jurisdiction.these federal issues include the interpretation and application of the federal securities laws and the statutory requirement that the nyse ensure that its members comply with the securities laws and exchange rules,areas of undisputed strong federal interest.because the parties rely heavily on barbara to support their respective positions,we briefly outline the relevant facts of that case.
in barbara,the sec initiated an investigation into alleged misconduct by barbara,a floor clerk at the nyse,and his employer,mabon,nugent securities.at.after the sec filed disciplinary charges against barbara,the nyse suspended barbara from working on the floor of the nyse pending a formal hearing.id.at.barbara petitioned for,and was granted,a stay of the floor ban pending the outcome of his hearing.id.in a subsequent decision,the board of directors of the nyse reversed all charges brought against barbara because he was denied adequate discovery.id.notwithstanding,the nyse enforcement division continued to bar barbara from working on the nyse floor,causing him to leave the securities industry.id.
barbara commenced an action in state court alleging state law claims for,inter alia,tortious interference with contractual relationships,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,negligent supervision and breach of the covenant of fair dealing within an implied contract.id.the nyse removed the action to federal court,which barbara apparently did not challenge.on motion of the nyse,the district court dismissed barbara suit on the ground that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.id.at.on appeal,we raised the question of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte,and held that barbara claims were insufficiently substantial to arise under federal law within the meaning of section.our holding rested primarily on two factors first,the absence of a private right of action under the applicable federal statute counsel ed against a finding of federal question jurisdiction,id.at,and second,the claims raised by barbara in his complaint involved the internal rules of the nyse,which are contractual in nature,and thus interpreted pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law,an area in which the federal courts have no special expertise.id.at.we nevertheless sustained the district court subject matter jurisdiction over the action based on barbara amended complaint,which alleged violations of federal law.id.at.
we find the facts present in this case distinguishable from those in barbara,and conclude that the instant suit implicates a federal interest sufficiently substantial to confer subject matter jurisdiction under section.
in barbara,the plaintiff claims required the district court to determine whether disciplinary proceedings initiated by the nyse were consistent with its own internal rules and its contractual obligations to its members.as such,the claims required an examination of the various internal rules of the nyse in accordance with well settled principles of contract task uniquely within the province of state law.
in contrast,here,the federal interest is more substantial because complaint does not simply challenge the propriety of disciplinary proceedings conducted by the nyse.concedes this distinction,stating the complaint makes no allegations about disciplinary proceedings at all.rather,an examination of the allegations contained in the complaint establishes that suit is rooted in violations of federal law,which favors a finding that federal question jurisdiction exists.specifically,the gravamen of state law claims is that the nyse and its officers conspired to violate the federal securities laws and various rules promulgated by the nyse and failed to perform its statutory duty,created under federal law,to enforce its members compliance with those laws see,sable motors,cir arising under jurisdiction existed where plaintiff state law tort claim was premised on defendants breach of a duty created under federal law.thus,resolution of claims requires a court to construe federal securities laws and evaluate the scope of the nyse duties,as defined under the exchange act and the regulations and rules thereto,in enforcing and monitoring a member compliance with those laws see,sparta surgical,at holding,in an action where plaintiff alleged state claims for,inter alia,breach of express and implied contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,gross negligence,intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and interference with economic relations that,b ecause the complaint sought relief based upon violation of exchange rules,subject matter jurisdiction was specifically vested in the federal district court under the exchange act marcus,at federal jurisdiction proper where plaintiffs state law breach of warranty claim sought to enforce the terms of tariff agreements between at t and its customers created by federal law merrell dow,at.arising under jurisdiction did not exist where plaintiffs alleged five common law theories of recovery and a single violation of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,which violation,if proven,constitute d a rebuttable presumption of negligence and directly and proximately caused the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs children internal quotation marks omitted commercial,at noting that,in merrell dow,the federal statute was merely incorporated by reference as a standard of conduct in a state negligence action.to that end,the complaint is replete with allegations that the nyse conspired to violate the federal securities laws and concocted a phoney interpretation of these laws and applicable nyse rules that it knowingly communicated to and other floor brokers to their detriment.thus,we agree with the district court conclusion that the central premise of complaint is that the nyse and its various senior officials violated and purposely encouraged and others to violate a of the exchange act by promulgating erroneous and misleading interpretations of that statutory provision.frayler,d at.
this determination compels our resolution of the question of jurisdiction because the nyse alleged violations of the federal securities laws and its improper interpretation of those laws underlie state law claims,the federal issue is substantial.u pon the federal statute construction the vindication of rights and definition of relationships created by federal law depends.commercial,at,arising under jurisdiction established where plaintiff state law claims encompass a substantial federal question under the condominium and cooperative abuse relief act see also caterpillar,at.federal question jurisdiction did not lie under section of the labor management relations act where the resolution of the plaintiffs breach of an individual employment contract claims did not substantially depend upon interpretation of the agreement sparta surgical,at a lthough plaintiff theories are posited as state law claims,they are founded on the defendants conduct in suspending trading and the offering,the propriety of which must be exclusively determined by federal law.accordingly,we conclude that the federal ingredient in the present action is far more significant than the federal interest present in barbara.commercial,at.
our conclusion in favor of federal jurisdiction is bolstered by allegations in the complaint of malfeasance on the part of the nyse in the performance of its general oversight function.specifically,alleges that the nyse failed to satisfy its duty to its members to abide by and enforce its rules,and to accurately advise its members with respect to the securities laws and regulations and its own rules.this duty is imposed on the nyse by sections g and h of the exchange act,see g,h in re stock,wl,at the nyse has an affirmative obligation to be vigilant in surveilling for,evaluating,and effectively addressing activity that could involve violations of the exchange act,the rules and regulations thereunder,and the rules of the nyse,and was the focus of sec administrative proceedings,which examined whether the nyse undertook adequate procedures for the purpose of detecting securities law violations and enforcing compliance by its members.in re stock,wl,at.
while claims are cast as state law claims,they are premised,in large part,on the nyse failure to enforce and monitor compliance by its members with the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder,as well as the rules promulgated by the nyse pursuant to the exchange act.see id.at exchanges violate section g when they fail to be vigilant in surveilling for,evaluating,and effectively addressing issues that could involve violations of the securities laws.internal quotation marks omitted.the source of the duty imposed on the nyse as well as other sros is found in federal law namely,in the exchange act.thus,it is the propriety of the nyse actions,as prescribed under federal law,that is at the heart of allegations.moreover,resolution of claims necessarily requires an inquiry into whether the nyse satisfactorily performed its duty in identifying potential violations of the federal securities laws and assisting in any criminal or civil investigation arising from a member noncompliance with those laws,both areas of strong federal interest.see,barbara,at spear,leeds kellogg cent.life assurance,cir friedlander troutman,sanders,lockerman ashmore,cir the comprehensive scheme of statutes and regulations designed to police the securities industry is indicative of a strong federal interest.frayler,d at t he question of whether the nyse properly interpreted a of the exchange act is wholly a matter of federal law and,indeed,a matter of intense federal concern given the importance of federal regulation of the stock market.in recognition of that interest,section of the exchange act vests in federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims alleging violations of the securities laws and actions brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder.in sum,because claims necessarily require a court to construe both the federal law governing securities trading on a national exchange and the nyse role,as defined under federal law,in enforcing and monitoring a member compliance with those laws,we conclude that the federal interest underlying claims is sufficiently substantial to arise under federal law within the meaning of section.
whether the nyse and its officials enjoy absolute immunity from suit 
having determined that removal was proper,we proceed to the second inquiry whether the nyse and its officers possess absolute immunity with respect to claims.because the facts relevant to the questio
