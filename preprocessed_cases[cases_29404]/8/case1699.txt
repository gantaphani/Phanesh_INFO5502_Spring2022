this case construes certain provisions of the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of title,united states code.one purpose of cafa is to provide a federal forum for securities cases that have national impact,without impairing the ability of state courts to decide cases of chiefly local import or cases that concern traditional state regulation of the state corporate creatures.cafa does that by expanding federal diversity jurisdiction,by allowing removal of securities cases of national impact from the state courts,and by conferring appellate jurisdiction to review orders granting or denying motions to remand such removed cases.
this putative class action was commenced in new york state supreme court,and was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue.the action alleges that officers of an by the issuer to disclose,while marketing certain debt certificates,that the issuer was insolvent.plaintiffs seek relief under new york consumer fraud statute.the main question for this appeal is whether such a claim falls within an exception to cafa grant of original and appellate class actions that solely involve claims that relate to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security.d c id.d.this is a question of first impression in the circuit courts.
although the matter is not entirely clear given the imperfect wording of the statute,we hold that the present suit does not fall within this exception to cafa jurisdiction.consequently,we have authority to accept an appeal from the district court order granting plaintiffs motion to remand this action to the state court.we elect to grant defendants petition for permission to appeal and,on the merits,we reverse the district court remand order.
agway,an agricultural supply and marketing cooperative,sought to raise capital by issuing money market certificates certificates unsecured,debt instruments.later,agway suspended sale of the certificates,and ended its practice of repurchasing them prior to maturity.agway filed for bankruptcy in september.this is the second litigation brought by these plaintiffs over these certificates.
the lawsuit.plaintiffs,seeking to represent a class of individuals who purchased the agway certificates between september and september,filed a lawsuit in new york supreme court against agway officers donald cardarelli and peter,as well as agway auditor,pricewaterhousecoopers,llp defendants.that complaint was predicated on the federal securities particular,a of the securities act of,a and it asserted that misrepresentations in agway financial statements fraudulently concealed that agway was insolvent and could only discharge its previous debt through the issuance of new debt instruments.
defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the northern district of new york.plaintiffs then amended the complaint to plead essentially the same acts of concealment under new york consumer fraud law,which creates a private right of action for victims of d eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business,trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service,bus.law a.see id.h.
as to the federal securities claim,judge mordue granted defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice.see pew cardarelli,wl,at.judge mordue declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claim,dismissing without prejudice.id.at.we affirmed by summary order,ruling that no reasonable investor could have been misled about the nature and extent of the risks associated with investing in agway certificates.pew cardarelli,cir summary order.
the lawsuit.the present lawsuit,filed in new york supreme court,makes essentially the same factual allegations,but seeks relief only under the state consumer fraud statute,bus.law.defendants removed the action to federal court under cafa,which in some circumstances permits removal of class actions based wholly on state law.plaintiffs moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that their suit falls within an exception to cafa removal provision for actions that relate to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security,and that the district court therefore lacks jurisdiction over it,d c,and can not accede to removal,id.d.chief judge mordue agreed,and remanded.estate of pew cardarelli,wl.
defendants filed the present petition pursuant to c,seeking permission to appeal the district court remand order.we advised the parties that were we to grant defendants motion for leave to appeal,we might also elect to decide the merits simultaneously.
cafa requires that any petition for review of an order granting or denying a motion to remand be made to the court of appeals not less than days after entry of the order.c emphasis added.as the third circuit concluded,this is surely a typographical error,because the uncontested legislative intent behind c was to impose a deadline for appeals,not a waiting period.morgan gay,cir emphasis added.we join our sister circuits in interpreting the statute to mean not more than days.see also miedema maytag,cir reaching same interpretation amalg.transit union local laidlaw transit,cir same pritchett office depot,cir same.defendants petition is timely because it was filed on the seventh business day after the entry of the district court order.
ordinarily,an order of remand is unappealable.see d.plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction to decide the present appeal because defendants failed to make a timely application to the district court to stay its order of remand.section conditions the right of appeal on a timely filing,without mention of a stay.see c.we therefore hold that in granting the federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review remand orders notwithstanding section d,congress did not require a defendant to seek a stay.id.c.
plaintiffs contend that we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the order of remand,by virtue of d.
as always,we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction.see kuhali reno,cir.section provides,in pertinent part 
b in class action may be removed to a district court of the united states without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought 
c review of remand orders.
in shall apply to any removal of a case under this section,except that notwithstanding section d,a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not less than days after entry of the order.
time period for the court of appeals accepts an appeal under paragraph,the court shall complete all action on such appeal,including rendering judgment,not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed 
d section shall not apply to any class action that solely involves 
a claim that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security 
as explained in detail infra,d mirrors d c,which provides an exception to cafa grant of original federal jurisdiction.
subsection b permits defendants who are new york residents to remove the action from new york supreme court.subsection c gives defendants the right to petition this court for an appeal of the district court remand order.compare d an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.
the plain language of subsection d this section shall not apply emphasis added limits all of,including subsection c,which delineates the scope of our authority to accept an appeal from a remand order.therefore,d limits our jurisdiction to review the district court remand order 
within our bounded appellate jurisdiction we nevertheless retain discretion to decline to hear such appeals.section c provides that a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand c emphasis added.a sound exercise of discretion will be guided by consideration of the importance and novelty of the issues raised by the case.see,hart fedex ground package,cir exercising discretion to accept an appeal to address an important question under cafa.here,we elect to entertain defendants appeal because the question of whether a deceptive practices claim predicated on the sale of a security is removable under cafa is important and consequential,and a decision of the question will alleviate uncertainty in the district courts.
lastly,because we grant defendants petition for leave to appeal,see infra,we also elect to decide the merits of the appeal simultaneously.this approach finds support in the caselaw,see,wallace.citizens prop.ins,cir although this case comes to us as a petition to accept the appeal,the parties sufficiently address the basis for the underlying appeal,thus allowing us to rule on the merits,and it is permitted by the federal rules of appellate procedure,see fed.plaintiffs urge us to decide now only the motion for leave to appeal,and decide the merits later.that course would be inefficient because in order to decide whether we have appellate jurisdiction we must construe the same statutory language upon which the district court rested its remand order and because the parties have already briefed their positions on that virtually identical statute.moreover,once leave to appeal is granted,the court has only days to render a decision.see ditolla doral dental ipa of,llc,cir cafa clock for rendering judgment starts running on the day that the court order granting permission to appeal is filed.rather than spin wheels,we elect to decide the merits of the appeal now.
to determine whether the district court properly remanded to state court and whether we lack appellate jurisdiction under c,we must consider an exception to cafa grant of original federal jurisdiction,for any class action that solely involves a claim that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security.d c.if plaintiffs consumer fraud claim falls within this exception,the district court lacks jurisdiction and properly remanded the case to state court and we lack appellate jurisdiction to review that determination.
we first look to the statute plain meaning if the language is unambiguous,we will not look farther.see connecticut bank germain,d.here,because the imperfect drafting of the statute makes it ambiguous,we read the wording,consider the statutory context,and consult the legislative history.and we conclude that all modes of analysis agree.
cafa amends the diversity jurisdiction statute by adding d,which confers original federal jurisdiction over any class action with minimal diversity,where at least one plaintiff and one defendant are citizens of different states and an aggregate amount in controversy of at least million exclusive of interest and costs.see d.however,to keep purely local matters and issues of particular state concern in the state courts,lowery alabama power,cir,congress excluded from cafa expanded jurisdiction inter alia certain class actions,described in three subsections set out in the margin subsection a of d carves out class actions for which jurisdiction exists elsewhere under federal law,such as under the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa,fraud claims in connection with the purchase or sale of securities traded on a national stock exchange,see f b.subsection b of d carves out class actions that are within the states purview of corporate law and governance.it is undisputed that the exception to federal jurisdiction in subsection a of d is inapplicable here because the certificates are not traded nationally,nor are they listed on any national securities exchange.likewise,subsection b of d is inapplicable because plaintiffs claims do not concern corporate governance.
the bone of contention is subsection c of d,which carves out any class action 
that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security as defined under section a of the securities act of and the regulations issued thereunder.
as explained supra,the same wording is used in d,which provides an exception to defendants power to remove an action,see b,and an exception to our jurisdiction to review a district court remand order,see id.c.thus cafa jurisdictional and removal provisions operate in tandem.if there is original jurisdiction for plaintiffs underlying claim,we have appellate jurisdiction,we reverse the remand order,and this action remains in federal district court.if the district court lacked jurisdiction over the underlying claim,we would dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,the remand order would stand,and the action would be consigned to state court.accordingly,both original and appellate jurisdiction depend on whether plaintiffs allegations fall within cafa exception for claims that relate to rights,duties and obligations related to or created by or pursuant to a security.
to aid analysis,it is useful to break down the wording of d c and d into numbered phrases as follows 
i section d and section b and c shall not apply to any class action that solely involves a claim that relates to 
ii the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations 
iii relating to or created by or pursuant to 
iv any security 
the sentence as a whole can not be read to cover any and all claims that relate to any security,because that would afford no meaning to ii and iii,which are evidently terms of limitation.if the limitation is to rights,duties and obligations those that relate to,are created by or arise pursuant to a security,what are those rights,duties and obligations 
the statute gives clues as to the import of each term.the word duties expressly includes fiduciary duties,which reinforces the common understanding that duties are owed by persons whether human or artificial.obligations can be owed by persons or by instruments,but the natural reading of this statutory language is to differentiate obligations from duties by reading obligations to be those created in instruments,such as a certificate of incorporation,an indenture,a note,or some other corporate document.and certain duties and obligations of course relate to securities even though they are not rooted in a corporate document but are instead superimposed by a state corporation law or common law on the relationships underlying that document.finally,the rights are those of the or their trustees or agents to whom these duties and obligations run.thus,an instrument that creates an obligation generates a corresponding right in the holder.
plaintiffs argue and the dissent essentially agrees that the term rights relating to any security includes the right to bring any cause of action that relates to a security.but this would defeat any limitation that was intended by the use of the term.moreover,this interpretation would render superfluous d a excepting class actions concerning a covered security and d same,because all covered securities are of course securities.see d c excepting suits relating to rights,duties and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security.
the agway the parties agree are securities under create obligations,and therefore corresponding rights in the holders.for example,the certificates create rights in the holders to a rate of interest and to principal repayment at certain dates.but the present suit does not relate to those rights rather,it is a consumer fraud action alleging that agway fraudulently concealed its insolvency when it peddled the certificates.claims that relate to the rights and obligations created by or pursuant to a security must be claims grounded in the terms of the security itself,the kind of claims that might arise where the interest rate was pegged to a rate set by a bank that later merges into another bank,or where a bond series is discontinued,or where a failure to negotiate replacement credit results in a default on principal.the present a debt security was fraudulently marketed by an insolvent not enforce the rights of the certificate holders as holders,and therefore it does not fall within d c and d.
our interpretation arguably renders the words relating to superfluous.but forced as we are to construe cafa cryptic text,lowery,at,we prefer an interpretation that preserves the meaning of an entire subsection.in any event,the words relating to are repetitive and lack any predictable or precise effect.see d c excepting from federal jurisdiction any class action solely involving a claim that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security emphases added.
interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text and considering the purpose and context of the statute dolan postal,d.review of slusa and cafa confirms an overall design to assure that the federal courts are available for all securities cases that have national impact including those that involve securities traded on national exchanges,without impairing the ability of state courts to decide cases of chiefly local import or that concern traditional state regulation of the state corporate creatures 
thus,although slusa bars class actions from all courts if the class alleges a fraudulent statement or omission or manipulative device in connection with the purchase or sale of a security traded on a national exchange,see b,it carves out an exception for actions that are based on the law of the state in which the issuer is incorporated or organized and that concern transactions with or communications to persons who already hold the securities of the issuer,see id.d a b,thereby creating concurrent jurisdiction in cases that are likely to have both national and local impact.
cafa amendments to the diversity its along similar lines,granting federal courts jurisdiction over all class actions with regard to securities and otherwise over million in the aggregate if the class members are largely out of state,see d.reading the provisions in context,we infer that diversity jurisdiction is created under cafa for all large,securities class actions,subject to the three exceptions discussed above.
the legislative history confirms our reading of cafa.see,at,reprinted in.this circuit has expressed some skepticism as to the probative value of the senate report because it was issued after cafa enactment by ten days.blockbuster,galeno,cir.however,as the eleventh circuit has pointed out,the report was submitted to the senate on february,while that body was still considering the bill.lowery,at emphasis added citing cong.rec,daily ed.we therefore think it appropriate in this case to examine the legislative history of these particularly knotty provisions.
certain passages from the senate judiciary committee report speak directly to the issue here 
t he act excepts from its grant to the district courts of original jurisdiction those class actions that solely involve claims that relate to matters of corporate governance arising out of state law by corporate governance litigation,the committee means only litigation based solely on the rights arising out of the terms of the securities issued by business enterprises.
the subsection d exemption to new section d jurisdiction is also intended to cover disputes over the meaning of the terms of a security,which is generally spelled out in some formative document of the business enterprise,such as a certificate of incorporation or a certificate of designations.
at emphases added.these passages demonstrate that congress intended that d c and d should be reserved for disputes over the meaning of the terms of a security,such as how interest rates are to be calculated,and so on.this is entirely consistent with our interpretation of d c and d as applying only to suits that seek to enforce the terms of instruments that create and define securities,and to duties imposed on persons who administer securities.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court remand order.furthermore,we grant defendants leave to appeal,reverse the district court remand order,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
the majority opinion misconstrues the plain language of a statute and reaches an incorrect result.because i believe we are bound by the text of the enactment,i am constrained,respectfully,to dissent.
we are called upon in this case to apply certain provisions of the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of.there is no dispute that cafa general purpose is to significantly expand federal court jurisdiction over multistate class action litigation.as united states district judge sarah vance,of the eastern district of louisiana,has commented,cafa represents the largest expansion of federal jurisdiction in recent memory.sarah vance,a primer on the class action fairness act of,tul.cafa,however,contains certain exceptions to the expansion of federal jurisdiction over multistate class actions.i believe that one of these exceptions,by its plain terms,is applicable to the instant case.by contrast,the majority appears to believe that cafa contains little in the way of plain terms.that is,we are told of the imperfect wording of the statute,opinion at it is asserted that the imperfect drafting of the statute makes it ambiguous,id.at and that we are forced to construe cafa cryptic text,id.at quoting lowery alabama power,cir.but i fear that a reader of the majority opinion must be forgiven if he or she comes to the conclusion that the generally opaque quality of cafa has been merely asserted rather than demonstrated.more importantly,with respect to the specific provision of cafa that i believe governs this case,i expect that this reader may conclude that the majority has simply departed from the statutory text in favor of a dubious consideration of the supposed legislative intent of the statute drafters.accordingly,and respectfully,i am compelled to dissent.
i.the applicability of section d c.
i agree with the majority that the central issue on this appeal is the exception,now codified at section d,which states that cafa broad grant of federal court jurisdiction over multistate class action litigation shall not apply to any class action that solely involves a claim 
a concerning a covered security as defined under f of the securities act of f and section f e of the securities exchange act of f e 
b that relates to the internal affairs or governance of a corporation or other form of business enterprise and that arises under or by virtue of the laws of the state in which such corporation or business enterprise is incorporated or organized,or 
c that relates to the rights,duties including fiduciary duties,and obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security as defined under section a of the securities act of a and the regulations issued thereunder.
i agree with the majority that the exemption to federal jurisdiction set forth in section d a is not applicable here.that provision reach is expressly limited to claims involving covered securit ies as defined under f of the securities act of.as recognized by the district court,covered securities as defined by the securities act are securities that are traded nationally or listed on a regulated national exchange.see b,cited in f f e.pew cardarelli,wl at.there is no assertion by either of the parties that the agway certificates are traded nationally,nor that they are they listed on any national securities exchange.
i also agree with the majority regarding the inapplicability of section d b.that section speaks of suits relating to the internal affairs or governance of the firm against which the suit is brought.the claims asserted by the plaintiffs here only go to the integrity of their investment in the agway money market certificates the certificates they do not seek to alter the course of agway management.our disagreement is therefore over the proper construction of the terms of section d c.
the majority correctly asserts that section d c can not be read to cover any and all claims that relate to any security opinion at.for example,as the
