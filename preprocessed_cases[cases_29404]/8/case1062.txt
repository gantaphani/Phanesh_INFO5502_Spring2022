gabriel eduardo and his mother,rosa leonor,appeal from the entry of summary judgment on their claims against several federal law enforcement agents who arrested abreu.abreu was detained for several months.the arrest was largely based on information from an informant,who had identified abreu as junior,a participant in a drug conspiracy.the government later dropped all charges against abreu.
in this civil rights action,plaintiffs say abreu arrest violated his fourth amendment rights and his subsequent detention was unlawful.they brought claims under bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d,for alleged constitutional violations,and under the federal tort claims act,b,for false arrest,false imprisonment,and malicious prosecution.we affirm judgment in favor of all defendants.
in january,dea agents steve riley,jay stoothoff,and others began investigating a suspected conspiracy to transport large amounts of cocaine from puerto rico to new york.one of those arrested decided to cooperate.he provided information to the agents about a known as junior.the informant gave agents a physical description of junior and provided a cellular telephone number belonging to junior.agent riley obtained information from the phone company identifying gabriel as the number subscriber.agents riley and stoothoff then obtained an old driver license photograph of abreu.the informant selected that photo out of a photo lineup,saying it was the man he knew as junior,but at a much younger age.hotel records also showed that an alleged,daniel nu√±ez,at the time of the criminal activity,had placed two calls from his hotel room to abreu cell phone number.phone company records of abreu account confirmed that there was no evidence of fraudulent claims or cloning of abreu cellular phone number.
on the basis of this information,on april,a federal grand jury returned indictments on drug conspiracy charges against two named defendants and a john doe,also known as junior.on may,a warrant for abreu arrest issued,on the basis he was the junior in the indictment.agent alicia ford and special agent ana saulnier set out to arrest abreu on may.agent ford was provided with the informant physical description of junior a black,hispanic male,approximately six feet to six feet two inches tall,weighing approximately to pounds,black hair,clean shaven,to years old,driving a gray nissan.also,agent ford was given the two addresses where junior might be found.no one was home at either address,so agents showed abreu picture to neighbors and advised them that the agents were looking for him.
that afternoon,the agents were notified that abreu was waiting for them at dea headquarters.agent ford and special agents saulnier,izquierdo,and reginald cheney found abreu and two women waiting for them in the reception area.ford placed abreu into custody and explained the nature of the charges against him.abreu and one of his companions insisted that the agents were arresting the wrong person 
abreu was shown a photocopy of the license photograph used to identify him with the informant.he acknowledged the photo was him and stated that it was an old photo.he was photographed and his description noted him as being puerto rican,black,seventy inches tall,weighing pounds,and years old.thus,he was shorter,heavier,and younger than the description of junior.at abreu detention hearing on the same day as his arrest,a magistrate judge ordered abreu committed to the puerto rico state penitentiary.abreu was released on september,pursuant to several conditions,including that he wear an electronic monitoring device.on february,the united states moved for voluntary dismissal of all charges against abreu.the motion said only that further investigation produced information which compels the united states to promptly seek the dismissal of the indictment as to defendant gabriel only.
on february,plaintiffs filed a complaint under bivens and the federal tort claims act against federal law enforcement agents alicia ford,john doe,and jane doe,alleging violations of abreu fourth amendment rights.abreu sought in damages,and his mother,sought.plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to add federal tort claims against the government for false arrest,false imprisonment,and malicious prosecution by federal agents acting within the scope of their employment.they also sued the agents individually for alleged violations of abreu fifth and sixth amendment rights.in,plaintiffs again amended their complaint,adding as parties agents william mitchell,jay soothoff,steve wiley,waldo santiago,francisco alvarez,reginald cheney,ivan rios,richard escalara,and ana saulnier.
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs bivens claims on qualified immunity grounds,and also granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs claims under the ftca.plaintiffs appeal.
a.the bivens claim and qualified immunity 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,and affirm if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.hegarty somerset,cir.the analysis of a qualified immunity defense is identical for actions brought under and bivens.graham connor,d.the supreme court has set forth a preferred method of analysis,most recently reinforced in wilson layne,d.first,the court must determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right.id.at,quoting conn gabbert,d.second,the court must proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.id.only if these two questions are answered in the affirmative does the court address the particular conduct in question.the question there is whether an objectively reasonable officer,performing discretionary functions,would have understood his or her conduct violated that clearly established constitutional right.harlow fitzgerald,d see also britton,d.
here,the first two questions are easily answered in the affirmative.it has been clearly established for a very long time that the fourth amendment requires that arrests be based on probable cause.see,beck ohio,d.
this case turns on the third question whether an objectively reasonable officer would have understood that the arrest of the plaintiff violated these clearly established constitutional rights.harlow,at.this question itself is subject to certain ground rules.evidence concerning the officer subjective intent is simply irrelevant to a qualified immunity defense,at.it is objectively reasonable for officers to seek an arrest warrant so long as the presence of probable cause is at least arguable.prokey watkins,cir.when officers make an arrest subject to a warrant then,even if probable cause is lacking,officers are entitled to qualified immunity unless the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.hilaire laconia,cir,quoting malley briggs,d.similarly,an officer who conducts an arrest pursuant to a warrant is liable only where the officer should have known that the facts recited in the affidavit did not constitute probable cause.rodriques furtado,cir.
abreu argues that the officers should have known that there was no probable cause because the photographic identification by the informant of junior from abreu old license picture was tainted.plaintiffs claim that agents altered considerably abreu learner permit photograph,adding a moustache and an afro hairdo,before presenting it to the informant,and they altered it in order to make it conform to the informant description of junior.as the district court observed,there is no evidence to support abreu allegation other than abreu affidavit.that affidavit is inconsistent with abreu earlier sworn statement that agent ford showed him a photocopy of a photo and asked me if i was the person,i replied that it was me and inquired where they had obtained that photo,since it was very old.we have repeatedly held that a party opposing summary judgment may not manufacture
