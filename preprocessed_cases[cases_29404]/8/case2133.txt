plaintiff colleen russman appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york ralph smith,magistrate judge granting a motion for summary judgment by defendant board of education of the enlarged city school district of the city of watervliet the board and dismissing the complaint.on appeal,russman argues that the free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution and section of the new york education law require the board to fund services for colleen at a private parochial school.we conclude that the case has become moot and accordingly vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on the merits and remand with direction to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
because this case has been here before,our discussion of the facts and proceedings presumes some familiarity with our prior decisions.see russman bd.of,cir russman ii russman sobol,cir russman i,vacated sub nom bd.of educ.russman,d.
in,the russmans notified the board that they intended to enroll their daughter colleen,who is mentally retarded,in a local parochial school,brigid regional catholic school,and requested that the board fund services at brigid.the board declined to do so.because of the board refusal and her parents inability to pay for those services,colleen has been enrolled in the watervliet public schools throughout this litigation.under an individualized education program iep prepared pursuant to educ.law,colleen attended classes with students with the assistance of aides and therapists.at the end of the school year,colleen received an iep diploma from watervliet high school certifying completion of her iep.since then,colleen has not been enrolled in any school,public or parochial,and her parents have not indicated any intention to her in such a school.
on being denied their request for services at brigid,the russmans pursued available administrative remedies without success and then brought suit on colleen behalf in district court on july.they claimed that the board was obligated by the first amendment of the united states constitution,the individuals with disabilities education act idea,and new york state law to provide services on site at brigid.the board responded in a summary judgment motion not only that it was not required to provide such services,but also that the first amendment establishment clause prohibited it from doing so.
the lawsuit has since made two appearances in this court and one in the united states supreme court.earlier iterations of the case have settled the following points the establishment clause of the first amendment does not bar the board from providing services at parochial schools,see russman i,at,and the idea does not mandate that the board provide such services,see russman ii,at.in russman ii,we expressly left to the district court on remand the task of deciding whether the free exercise clause of the first amendment or section of the new york education law mandates provision of the services.id.the district court concluded that neither provision does so and granted the board motion for summary judgment on the merits.the russmans appealed.
discussion 
because we conclude that the case is moot,we are no longer faced with a justiciable controversy and therefore do not address the merits of the case.
the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,their powers circumscribed at their most basic level by the terms of article iii of the constitution,which states that they may hear only cases or controversies.const.art.iii,cl.although the case or controversy requirement has itself been a fertile ground for controversy through the years,at its uncontroverted core lies the principle that,at all times,the dispute before the court must be real and live,not feigned,academic,or conjectural.
the requisite dispute must persist throughout the a case such as this,from first filing in the district court through its many ascents and descents of the appellate if the dispute should dissolve at any time due to a change in circumstances,the case becomes moot.see defunis odegaard,d per curiam fox bd.of trustees of the state of,cir.whenever mootness occurs,the trial,appellate,or jurisdiction over the suit,which therefore must be dismissed see,fox,at.
the supreme court has recognized an exception,however,where the dispute is capable of repetition,yet evading review.pac.terminal icc.the principle applies only where the following two circumstances are simultaneously present the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.spencer kemna,d internal quotation marks omitted.a recurrent dispute will evade review if it could not be entirely litigated before again becoming moot,including prosecution of appeals as far as the supreme court.see,honig doe,d noting the likely mooting by the time review can be had in this court of any future lawsuit brought by plaintiff.given these strictures,it has been said that the exception applies only in exceptional situations,spencer,at,and is severely circumscribed,knaust city of kingston,cir.see also muhammad city of dep t of,cir holding that the exception is applied only in exceptional situations.
mootness is a recurring phenomenon in students suits to vindicate constitutional rights associated with the conditions of their education a student graduation ends his individual interest in the conditions of education at his former school.see,bd.of sch.comm rs of indianapolis jacobs,d per curiam altman bedford cent.sch,cir,petition for cert.filed,june,fox,at cook colgate,cir.as the student interest evaporates,so does the requisite case or controversy.moreover,the finality of graduation means that in the absence of a class action,the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception is not available when the issue is students rights and the complaining students have graduated from the defendant institution.altman,at.
in the present case,colleen has received her iep diploma from watervliet high school.she is no longer attending school,public or parochial,and her parents have expressed no intention to her in the future.for these reasons,a favorable decision from this court would not immediately inure to her benefit,rendering the case moot.see united states constr.prods.research,cir.
the russmans nevertheless urge that the case is capable of repetition,yet evading review because an iep diploma,unlike an ordinary diploma,does not terminate a recipient entitlement to a free appropriate public education fape.a school district may award a high school iep diploma upon a finding that a student has achieved the educational goals specified in the student current iep.regs.tit,c.the iep diploma does not mean that the student has graduated in the traditional sense,however 
its recipient shall continue to be eligible to attend the public schools of the school district in which the student resides without the payment of tuition until the student has earned a high school diploma or until the end of the school year of such student birthday,whichever is earlier.
regs.tit,e see also regs.tit,b iii stating that e arning an iep diploma shall not be deemed to be equivalent to receipt of a high school diploma and shall not terminate a student entitlement to a free public education.colleen is thus entitled to additional public schooling until she graduates or completes the school year that includes her birthday.see regs.tit,e.if she were to resume her schooling,the russmans argue,she could return to a parochial school,request public funds,and be denied those funds by the board.therefore,they contend,the case is capable of repetition.they further argue that,in such event,the board denial would evade review because colleen could not challenge the denial,including prosecution of all necessary appeals,before she would become statutorily ineligible for those funds.
the russmans argue that the supreme court decision in honig doe is controlling.there,the plaintiff had been expelled from public school bec
