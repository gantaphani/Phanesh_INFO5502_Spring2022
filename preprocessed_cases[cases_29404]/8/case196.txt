most people make investments in the expectation or at least the hope of turning a profit.but investments sometimes go sour.that happened here,and the appellants are trying to recoup their losses through a novel interpretation of an exemption in the trust indenture act of tia,construing the exemption as a matter of first impression,we conclude that the appellants interpretation fails.their suit fails with it.federal courts do not have jurisdiction to redress every perceived wrong,and we agree with the court below that this case falls outside the encincture of federal subject matter jurisdiction.
the appellants,césar calderón serra and teresita palerm nevares,purchased and still own nonrecourse notes the notes in the face amount of approximately two million dollars,issued by the puerto rico conservation trust fund prctf.the prctf operates as a nonprofit organization,see c,with the stated purpose of protecting and enhancing puerto rico natural resources.
the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used by the prctf to acquire preferred securities and to pay the costs of issuance of the notes.the notes were not registered under the securities act,see,based on an exemption from registration.
after the notes went into default,the appellants sued the appellees banco popular de puerto rico bppr,trustee of the notes,and wilmington trust company wtc,indenture trustee of the securities that the prctf purchased with note proceeds alleging that they were deceived into believing that the n otes were backed by the government of puerto rico.they brought their suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.see.after amending their complaint once as of right,see.a b,the appellants premised their assertion of subject matter jurisdiction on both the edge act,and the tia 
each appellee moved to dismiss the first amended complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.the appellants opposed these motions.some five months after the first amended complaint was filed while the fully briefed motions to dismiss were under advisement,the appellants sought leave to file a second amended complaint.the district court denied that motion and summarily rejected a motion for reconsideration.then,the court,in a thoughtful opinion,granted the motions to dismiss.see calderón serra wilmington trust,wl,at.this timely appeal followed.
we begin with bedrock.federal courts,as courts of limited jurisdiction,may not presume the existence of subject matter jurisdiction,but,rather,must appraise their own authority to hear and determine particular cases.cusumano microsoft,cir.t he party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court carries the burden of proving its existence.murphy united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.where,as here,a district court grants a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction on the pleadings,its order of dismissal engenders de novo review.see fothergill united states,cir.in performing this task,we take as true all facts in the plaintiffs complaints,scrutinize them in the light most hospitable to the plaintiffs theory of liability,and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiffs favor.id.
in this venue,the appellants do not pursue their claim that the edge act confers federal subject matter jurisdiction.this is a wise decision in order for that statute to supply a basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction,one party to the action must be an entity that owes its existence to the federal sovereign.viqueira first bank,cir see.typically,that would be a nationally chartered bank.here,however,both defendants are banks wtc is organized under the laws of delaware and bppr is organized under the laws of puerto rico.hence,the edge act does not afford a basis for subject matter jurisdiction here.
the appellants propose that there is federal subject matter jurisdiction under the tia.the district court rejected this proposition,see calderón serra,wl,at,and so do we.
congress enacted the tia in as a means of combating unsavory practices related to the public offering of bonds,notes,and debentures.see b see also sec capital gains research bureau,d.the district courts have jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability arising under the tia,subject to an exception not relevant here.see a.but the tia does not have a limitless scope.for example,it does not apply to any security exempted from the provisions of the securities act of,by,among other provisions,paragraphs through of.a id.a a.
pertinently,paragraph exempts charitable organizations from the reach of the securities act,see id.a,and thus from the reach of the tia that provision reads 
t he provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to a ny security issued by a person organized and operated exclusively for religious,educational,benevolent,fraternal,charitable,or reformatory purposes and not for pecuniary profit,and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any person,private stockholder,or individual 
id.this,in effect,comprises a test.
in this case,the notes were issued by the prctf,which the appellants concede is a section c nonprofit organization.consequently,the notes come within the first part of the charitable organization exemption to the securities act.
in an effort to soften the bite of this reasoning,the appellants posit that the notes have an individual effect that places them outside the charitable organization exemption.they insist that as long as have a noncharitable purpose in purchasing notes say,a desire to earn interest,the exemption is inapposite.this construction of the charitable organization exemption is antithetic to the plain meaning of the unambiguous statutory language.we explain briefly.
we think it is obvious that the purpose on which the first part of the exemption hinges is the purpose for which the organization exists,not the parochial motivations of particular.see,sec children.the critical determinant under the first part of the test,then,is whether the issuing organization is structured and operated as a charitable organization and not for pecuniary profit.in this connection,the pecuniary profit of which the charitable organization exemption speaks relates to the organization purpose,not the investment returns.see sec universal serv.ass n,cir.the prctf unarguably satisfies this eleemosynary requirement.
there is,of course,a second requirement that must be satisfied if any part of the net earnings of the charitable organization inures to the benefit of any person,private stockholder,or individual,the exemption does not apply.a.in our view,it is equally obvious that this net earnings inures to the benefit language does not refer to interest payments made by a charitable organization on funds borrowed in the ordinary course of business from outside investors and intended to allow the organization to fulfill its mission.see warfield alaniz,cir sec am.found.for advanced educ.of.properly construed,this language does not encompass interest payments to outside,or.sec world radio mission,cir discussing notes issued by nonprofit religious organization.
the appellants contrary reading turns the charitable organization exemption inside out and,if implemented,would unravel the fabric of the exemption.there is no dispute that the prctf disclosed its intention to use the note capital to purchase preferred stock and to use dividends from the preferred stock to finance the notes.this investment approach is common practice among charitable organizations.the offering circular does not suggest let alone support any basis for the appellants assertion that a majority of the proceeds generated by the prctf securities transactions would be directed to private stockholders.we therefore disregard that assertion as implausible.
virtually every person who purchases a bond,a note,or a debenture is motivated,at least in part,by the prospect of earning interest and basing the legal status of a nonprofit organization upon the motives of those who purchase its securities defies common sense.we can not conceive that congress intended so bizarre a result.
