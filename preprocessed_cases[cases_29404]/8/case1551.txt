the united states appeals from a january,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nina gershon,judge.the district court dismissed the united states in an action brought by interworks systems,interworks against merchant financial corporation merchant.the underlying action by interworks,originally filed in the southern district of new york and later transferred to the eastern district of new york,sought to recover funds that merchant had allegedly diverted in violation of new york lien law article.in the,the united states alleged that merchant,through its first priority lien on all of interworks accounts receivable,had received and improperly diverted article trust funds that had been paid to interworks pursuant to certain public works contracts,and was therefore liable to the united states for interworks unpaid federal employment taxes related to work stemming from those contracts.
the district court dismissed the on the ground that the government had not complied with,and was not excused from compliance with,two separate procedural requirements for bringing an action under article that there be no prior pending article action,and that the article suit be brought in a representative capacity on behalf of all other beneficiaries of the article trust.interworks,merchant fin,d.on appeal,the government does not dispute that it failed to meet these requirements.it argues instead that article procedural requirements do not apply to the united states and that,even if they did,the united states power to enforce federal tax law in federal court either excuses it from compliance with or preempts these requirements.
we agree with the district court that where the united states brings an action pursuant to article,it is bound by article procedural requirement that there be no prior pending action.inasmuch as this conclusion provides a sufficient basis for us to affirm the judgment of the district court,we do not reach the question of whether the united states should be excused from compliance or allowed to amend its complaint so as to allege compliance with article representative capacity requirement.
background 
this case arises out of several improvement contracts entered into by interworks,a new york corporation in the business of selling,installing,and servicing private telephone switchboard systems and large structured cabling systems,to provide data and cabling services to customers in the greater new york metropolitan area,and the relationship of those contracts to new york lien law,generally known as article.the dispute in this case does not concern the rights of any of the direct parties to the data and cabling contracts themselves.instead,at issue here are the rights of three other parties colonial surety company colonial,the company that acted as a surety for interworks in the data and cabling contracts merchant,the company that provided financing to interworks in relation to the data and cabling,as well as other,contracts and the united states government,which alleges an interest in unpaid employment taxes stemming from the data and cabling contracts.it is the respective rights of these three parties under article that we are faced with here.
article is a new york state statute designed to protect subcontractors,tax collectors,and parties who expend labor or extend financing in construction projects,by impressing with a trust any funds paid to a contractor or received by an owner in connection with an improvement of real property in the state.see aspro mech.contracting,fleet bank,article of the lien law creates trust funds out of certain construction payments or funds to assure payment of subcontractors,suppliers,architects,engineers,laborers,as well as specified taxes and expenses of construction.internal citations and quotation marks omitted lechase,llc goebert,t he primary purpose of article and its predecessors is to ensure that those who have directly expended labor and materials to improve real property or a public improvement at the direction of the owner or a general contractor receive payment for the work actually performed internal citation and quotation marks omitted,alterations incorporated.

it is undisputed that the funds paid to interworks in connection with the public improvement contracts for data and cabling services at issue in this case were article trust assets.
the financing and surety contracts 
interworks entered into two related contracts in connection with the data and cabling services contracts that provide the basis for the underlying lawsuit in this case one provided for financing of the data and cabling services contracts,and one provided a surety should interworks prove unable to perform its obligations under those contracts.in order to obtain financing,interworks entered into a security agreement with merchant on february,under the terms of which merchant promised to lend interworks in return for a first priority lien on substantially all of interworks personal property,including all accounts receivables.as a result,all instruments representing payments under the data and cabling contracts were made out to interworks but sent directly to merchant.interworks alleges that merchant received at least in its capacity as a lien holder over its accounts receivable.
new york law generally requires a contractor like interworks to enter into a surety agreement to ensure completion of its contracts.see titan indem.triborough bridge and tunnel,cir.to meet this obligation,interworks contracted with colonial to act as a surety on its public improvement contracts,pursuant to which colonial would issue performance and payment bonds for the public improvement contracts.
the united states interest in this litigation 
interworks failed to pay federal employment taxes in connection with both the public improvement contracts that are the subject of this litigation and other contracts.on august,the internal revenue service irs filed a tax lien against interworks in the amount of.the government later estimated interworks tax obligations to total,at least of which allegedly arose out of public improvement contracts for which merchant had provided interworks accounts receivables plus percent of interworks inventory.financing to interworks in return for a first priority lien on interworks accounts receivable and other property.
colonial lawsuit 
on july,interworks and two of its affiliates filed petitions for relief pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code with the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of new york.because interworks was unable to complete performance of its public improvement contracts,colonial,pursuant to the surety agreement,made payments to subcontractors and fulfilled interworks other obligations under the public improvement contracts.between interworks debts to subcontractors,suppliers,and laborers,and interworks federal and state tax obligations for which colonial,as surety,is potentially liable,colonial allegedly incurred financial obligations of and suffered claims against the bonds it had issued for interworks in an amount thought to be in excess of.
as a provider of surety bonds in connection with interworks public improvement contracts,colonial is a beneficiary of the article trust funds that arise from payments made pursuant to those contracts.if those funds are diverted,colonial is entitled to recover the amount it is owed from whomever diverted the funds,provided that such person was on notice,at the time the funds were diverted,that the funds were trust assets.lien law.
in an effort to recoup its expenses and satisfy the liabilities it incurred as a result of interworks default on its public improvement contracts,colonial brought suit against merchant in new york state supreme court in may.colonial alleged that under article,the funds merchant received that had been paid to interworks under the public improvement contracts were trust funds that merchant,standing in interworks place as fiduciary to the trust,was required to pay to trust beneficiaries,and that instead of paying the beneficiaries of the trust created by the public improvement contracts,merchant had in fact used the assets to satisfy interworks obligations to merchant arising from their separate financing agreement.see second amended compl.filed.colonial,as a beneficiary of the trust,sought to be recognized as an authorized class representative of all beneficiaries of the article trust.the court allowed colonial to join another putative class representative,but held the motion in abeyance pending the outcome of a further hearing on class certification.
for reasons that are not readily apparent from the record,the united states did not seek to intervene in this state court action in an attempt to collect the unpaid employment taxes that merchant,standing in interworks place as a result of the financing agreement between the two parties,owed on work stemming from the public improvement contracts.
interworks federal lawsuit and the united states 
in july,interworks brought a parallel suit under article against merchant in the united states district court for the southern district of new instant,among other things,the same relief colonial sought in the new york state court action.interworks complaint alleged that the article beneficiaries to the public improvement contracts were required to be paid from the proceeds of interworks accounts receivables,which the financing agreement had placed in the custody and control of merchant,and that merchant failure to satisfy interworks obligations to the article trust fund beneficiaries amounted to a diversion of assets.
unlike the lawsuit in new york supreme court,in which the united states did not participate,the united states filed a in this federal suit.it asserted that merchant failure to use assets to satisfy the or more that interworks owed in employment taxes violated article the united states brought the in its own capacity,rather than as a representative of all article beneficiaries.
the case was transferred from the southern district to the eastern district of new york in april.in november,the eastern district court dismissed the underlying complaint with prejudice after interworks indicated its intent to voluntarily discontinue the and failed to respond to an order to show cause.this left the issues raised in the united states and the by colonial as the only surviving issues for the district court consideration.
colonial and merchant then jointly moved to dismiss the united states on the grounds that the united states had failed to comply with two procedural requirements of article suits that there be no prior pending article action,and that such suits be brought in a representative capacity.without denying that these requirements were provided for by statute and had not been satisfied,the government opposed the motion to dismiss on the grounds that article does not apply to the united states and that,even if it did,the united states power to enforce federal tax law in federal court either exempts it from compliance with or preempts the procedural requirements of article.
the district court,finding the government to be in procedural default,granted the motion to dismiss.interworks,d at.based largely on the fact that the united states had brought suit to enforce its article rights under new york law,rather than to enforce a tax lien under federal law,the court rejected the government argument that federal statutes that provide federal courts with original jurisdiction over actions brought to enforce the federal tax laws excuse the government from compliance with article procedural requirements.id.at.
the government appeals.
discussion 
merchant liability under article for diversion of trust funds is not in dispute on appeal.nor does any party contest the united states standing as a beneficiary of the trust to enforce its claim against merchant for unpaid taxes,or the united states priority relative to colonial in recovering the diverted trust funds through a properly filed lawsuit and the government concedes that its claim was not brought in conformance with the requirements set forth in article.
the sole issue on appeal,then,is whether the united states is excused from compliance with two article procedural requirements that a claimholder to an article trust bring a representative action for the benefit of all beneficiaries of the trust,and that no other such action be pending at the time of the commencement of the article claim.lien law.the government does not contend that it complied with these requirements.it asserts instead that its compliance is unnecessary.we conclude that where the united states brings an action pursuant to article,it is bound by the procedural requirement that there be no prior pending article action.because the united states procedurally defaulted by not meeting this requirement,we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.we need not decide whether the government was bound by,or should have been granted leave to comply with,the representative capacity requirement.
standard of review

ii.the no other pending action requirement of article 
the united states did not intervene in colonial prior article state action.instead,it intervened in the federal action brought by interworks two years after the action in new york state supreme court had begun.the district court concluded that this was improper under article,which provides in relevant part that successive actions may be maintained from time to time provided no other such action is pending at the time of the commencement thereof.lien law interworks,d at t he united states is subject to article prohibition against prior pending actions when asserting its article rights.
the government does not contend that colonial prior state court action was not a prior pending action for the purposes of section nor could it,see,premier constr.sec.bank of long island,dep t interpreting section to apply to a subsequent action brought by a new plaintiff who could be said to be a member of the class which the plaintiff bringing the first action intended to benefit.instead,the united states offers three separate reasons why it should be excused from compliance with article procedural requirements article does not apply to actions by the united states even if article applies to actions by the united states,the united states has an unqualified right to bring this action in federal court pursuant to its power to enforce the federal tax code under and to the extent that article conflicts with,article is preempted.
application of article to the united states 
the united states first argument,relying primarily on leiter minerals,united states,is that article does not apply to it because the statute lacks express words so indicating.we implicitly rejected this argument in united states certified,cir,where we assumed that the united states would be subject to article statute of limitations.we now explicitly reject the argument,joining at least one district court in our circuit that has,in analyzing article representative capacity requirement,found the statute procedural requir
