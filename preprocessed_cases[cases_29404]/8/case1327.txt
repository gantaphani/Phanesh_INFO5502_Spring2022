defendant city of syracuse syracuse or the city appeals from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,david hurd,judge,as orders the city to pay plaintiff therese lore,a member of the syracuse police department spd or the department,a total of,including in attorneys fees and costs,following a jury verdict a finding that the city,because of her complaints of gender discrimination,retaliated against lore in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,and the new york state human rights law hrl,exec.law et,and b awarding her compensatory damages against the city totaling for pain,suffering,emotional distress,and injury to her reputation as a result of the retaliation.on appeal,the city contends principally that as a matter of law lore was not entitled to damages for injury to her reputation,that she did not prove that any emotional distress she suffered was caused by acts found to have been performed by the city or its employees,that there were various errors in the court submission of the case to the jury,and that the damages awarded for emotional distress were excessive.
lore,principally challenging so much of the judgment as dismisses her retaliation claims against individual defendants,dismisses her gender discrimination claims against the city and the individual defendants,and denies her additional damages and attorneys fees.she contends principally that the district court erred in having the jury decide whether defendant rick guy was entitled to qualified immunity,in failing to rule that he was not entitled to such immunity,and,given the jury findings that guy had intentionally retaliated against lore and caused her injuries totaling,in not awarding her that amount in addition to the awarded against the city in granting summary judgment dismissing her gender discrimination claims in failing to impose sanctions on defendants for noncompliance with discovery orders and in failing to award higher attorneys fees.lore also contends that she is entitled to a new trial on her retaliation claims against defendants daniel boyle and mike kerwin on the ground that the court improperly excluded evidence relevant to those claims.
for the reasons discussed in part ii below,we conclude that the city appeal considered without reference to any relief to which lore may be entitled on her provides no basis for overturning the judgment against the city.for the reasons discussed in part iii below,we conclude that lore has merit only in its challenges to a the dismissal,on qualified immunity grounds,of her hrl claim against guy,and b the grant of summary judgment dismissing her main discrimination claims under the hrl against the city and defendant roy bernardi,and that lore was entitled to trial of those discrimination claims.however,because of the substantial overlap in the evidence relevant to lore retaliation claims against the city,which were tried,and her main hrl discrimination claims,which were summarily dismissed,and considering the intertwined nature of her retaliation claims against the city and those against guy,we conclude that a trial of the erroneously dismissed hrl discrimination claims alone could lead to an award of damages that would be duplicative,in whole or in part,of the compensation lore is awarded in the present judgment.accordingly,as set out in part v below,we conclude that if there is to be a trial of the hrl discrimination claims,that trial,in order to avoid an unjust outcome,must be combined with a retrial of lore title vii and hrl retaliation claims against the city and her hrl retaliation claim against guy.because we see no other basis for disturbing the judgment against the city,and because we recognize that lore may prefer to forgo pursuit of the hrl discrimination claims and retain the present award,we will only conditionally vacate so much of the judgment as dismisses the pertinent hrl discrimination claims and as awards damages,costs,and fees against the city.the vacatur will become effective if lore elects to proceed to trial as indicated above.
background 
as there has been a trial in this case,the following description includes facts that have been established by the jury verdict see trial transcript tr.at,as well as pertinent allegations in lore final amended complaint complaint.as lore claims of gender discrimination were dismissed on summary judgment,the record with respect to those claims is described in the light most favorable to lore.
a.the parties and lore claims 
at all times pertinent to this case,lore was a member of spd.she joined the department as an officer in she was promoted to the rank of sergeant in.in january,of police timothy foody invited lore to join his staff as spd public information officer pio,serving as liaison between the department and the media,the spokesman for the department.
in may,lore was removed from her position as pio.see complaint.in june,she was transferred to spd technical operations section in august she was transferred to the uniform patrol division.see complaint.lore,a member of the spd force union the union or police union see complaint,whose collective bargaining agreement or cba with the city prohibited the city from subjecting union members to unlawful discrimination or retaliation see id.plaintiff exhibit px mmm,b,filed a grievance with the union after she was removed from the pio post.this grievance was settled in december settlement agreement,with the city agreeing,inter alia,to assign lore to the department community relations division crd and to give her overtime assignments comparable to those of other crd sergeants.
in june,lore discovered that she was receiving fewer overtime assignments than the other crd sergeants.routinely,spd employees retrieved their biweekly paychecks from an open,uncovered box in the department audit budget and control office abc office a common area accessible to all spd personnel see complaint and an in that office testified that spd employees routinely saw each others checks as they searched for their own see,tr.attached to each check was a pay stub that separately itemized the employee current and cumulative regular pay and overtime pay.lore complained that the city had breached the settlement agreement by not giving her equal overtime assignments and to document the disparity,she photocopied the three other crd sergeants pay stubs.an arbitration hearing was held on the claim in september september arbitration hearing.
in the meantime,in july and august,lore filed verified complaints with the eeoc against spd,the city mayor,and the department top officials,complaining principally of gender discrimination and of retaliation for her complaints of gender discrimination.her july eeoc complaint alleged,inter alia,that those defendants,motivated by her gender,had caused her removal from the pio position without justification.it alleged that in retaliation for her complaints of discrimination,they had subjected her to,inter alia,a series of job transfers to less desirable positions had assigned males who were junior to lore in rank and seniority to positions that she had requested and for which she was qualified and had denied lore perquisites,such as overtime work,an office key,a computer,and a vehicle,that were given to males in comparable spd positions.her august eeoc complaint alleged that boyle had retaliated against her for filing the july eeoc complaint.
at the september arbitration hearing on lore complaint that the city had breached the settlement agreement by depriving her of equal overtime assignments,lore offered into evidence the photocopies she had made of the other crd sergeants pay stubs to support her claim of disparity.a city attorney threatened lore with criminal prosecution for having copied the pay stubs but told her attorney that the city would forego sic criminal and administrative charges against her if she dropped her eeoc complaints and grievances complaint.lore refused to withdraw her eeoc complaints and grievances,and on november,she was charged administratively with personal use of a department copier and was suspended for days without pay.see complaint.defendant rick guy,corporation counsel for the city,informed the news media that lore had been suspended and stated that she had copied checks and that her claims were intended to divert attention from the real issue,which was her poor job performance.id.see id.
in the present lawsuit,commenced in december under title vii and the hrl for employment discrimination and retaliation,and under for violations of her rights under the due process and equal protection clauses and the first amendment,lore asserted principally that her removal from the pio position was motivated by gender discrimination and that she thereafter suffered retaliation because of her complaints to the union and to the eeoc about gender discrimination.lore complaint,as finally amended,was filed in mid after she was subjected to additional allegedly discriminatory treatment,including being deprived of her spd beeper,vehicle,and cell phone,being deprived of opportunities for overtime assignments and other benefits,and receiving threatening and harassing messages on her home telephone answering machine see complaint.the complaint asserted claims against the city,spd,eight named individuals in their personal and official capacities,and a john doe.the individuals,and their positions at the times of their alleged actions,were 
roy bernardi,who,as mayor of syracuse in and,was principally alleged to have ordered foody to remove lore from the pio position because bernardi believed that she had too much power or visibility with the police department,and that women should be seen and not heard complaint,and to have made false statements to the press about lore in retaliation for her complaints of discrimination see,id,
john falge,the chief of spd beginning in august,who was alleged to have been responsible for,inter alia,the training,supervision,and discipline of other defendants and to have retaliated against lore by orchestrating postcomplaint criticisms of her job performance see complaint,
robert tassone,a deputy chief of spd,who was alleged to have been responsible for,inter alia,the training,supervision,and discipline of other defendants see complaint 
daniel boyle,first deputy chief of spd,who the jury found had banned lore from the normally accessible abc office and imposed on her certain conditions not applicable to others see tr,and who allegedly said he was imposing those conditions since lore is suing us complaint 
mike rathbun,an spd lieutenant who was alleged to have denied lore requests for overtime work and to have told her that if she wanted such work she should withdraw her claims of discrimination,and to have retaliated against lore by fabricating postcomplaint criticisms of her job performance see complaint,
mike kerwin,an spd captain,who the jury found had threatened to give lore miranda warnings or charge her with a crime see tr.
rick guy,the city corporation counsel,who the jury found made negative comments to news reporters about lore in retaliation for her having complained of discrimination see tr.
michael lemm,a retired spd officer who lore believed had left an anonymous harassing message on her telephone answering machine see complaint and 
john doe,an alleged spd officer who was another anonymous harassing caller see complaint.
against the city,the complaint principally asserted claims for discrimination,including creation of a hostile work environment,and retaliation under title vii and the hrl.against the individual defendants,the complaint asserted discrimination and retaliation claims under title vii and the hrl,and claims for violations of lore first amendment,due process,and equal protection rights.it also asserted,inter alia,claims against all defendants for intentional infliction of emotional distress and claims against bernardi,guy,and the city for defamation.
the case was originally assigned to judge howard munson.it was reassigned to judge hurd in.
b.the granting of partial summary judgment 
following several years of discovery,the city and most of the individual defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint against them on several legal grounds.they contended principally that lore had no viable retaliation claim they pointed out that she had not suffered any decrease in rank or salary,and they argued that she therefore could not show that she had suffered any materially adverse employment action.lemm moved for summary judgment dismissing the claims against him on the ground that there was no proof that he had made any allegedly harassing telephone call.in a memorandum decision and order dated october,reported at d lore i,the district court granted the motions in part and denied them in part.see d at.the court denied lemm motion insofar as it sought dismissal of lore hrl claim against him,ruling that his opposition to that claim,his assertion that he was not the person who made the harassing call presented factual issues to be tried.see id.at.as to the other defendants,the court granted their motions in large part,dismissing all of lore claims against falge,tassone,and rathbun,and dismissing most of her claims against the other individual defendants,on various grounds.see id.at.
lore title vii claims against the individual defendants were dismissed on the ground that title vii does not impose liability on individuals.see id.at.although individuals may be held liable under the hrl,whose prohibitions against employment discrimination are similar to those of title vii,the court also dismissed lore hrl discrimination claims against the individual defendants as well as all of her hrl and title vii discrimination claims against the city on the ground that,because her rank and pay had not been reduced when she was removed from the pio position,lore had suffered no materially adverse employment action.see id.at.see part.below.the court also ruled that all of lore claims against the city under title vii for acts prior to september,the date calculated to be days prior to the initiation of her complaints to the eeoc were.and it dismissed all of lore claims except those alleging reputational injury and emotional distress resulting from retaliation in violation of the hrl.see id.at.
both sides moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment decision.the court denied the city motion on the ground that it was untimely.see memorandum decision and order dated december,reported at wl lore ii,at.the court granted lore motion for reconsideration of various aspects of lore i but adhered to its original decisions.see id.at.
by the time of trial,the factual issues as to alleged retaliatory conduct had been narrowed,and lore factual allegations against the remaining defendants were described as follows in court exhibit as amended,see tr.
boyle barring lore from an office within the police department and requiring her to submit internal memorandums 
bernardi making negative comments about lore to newspaper reporters 
kerwin reading lore miranda warnings and threatening her with criminal charges 
lemm leaving a harassing telephone message on lore answering machine 
the city offering to forgo criminal or administrative charges in exchange for lore withdrawl sic of her complaints of discrimination suspending her for ten days and investigating her conduct.
court exhibit also noted lore assertion that the city was liable for the retaliatory acts of the officers of spd other than lemm,who had retired prior to lore receipt of harassing telephone messages and for breach of the cba provision prohibiting unlawful retaliation in response to complaints of discrimination.
lore evidence at trial 
at trial,lore described her removal from her position as spd spokesman and testified that she filed grievances with respect to that removal.she testified that defendants had engaged in the conduct that was outlined in court exhibit,and she described the series of transfers she endured from the pio position to less desirable and less prestigious job assignments.
as to her claims against boyle,lore testified that after she complained of discrimination,he banned her from spd abc office and required her,unlike other spd employees,to submit any requests for information in written memoranda.the of the abc office testified that after lore photocopied other officers pay stubs,boyle,who was then spd first deputy chief,came into that office and angrily said something to the effect of,keep lore the heck out of here.tr.see id.at,if teri lore ever comes in this office again,throw her the heck out.the testified that she had never before been instructed to give directions to police officers or sergeants.id.at.she testified that a gate was subsequently erected at the abc office door because spd wanted to make sure that from now on,there was some control of who just wandered into our office id.at,and that that gate became generally known as the teri lore gate id.at.
as to her claims against kerwin,lore testified that in november,she reported to kerwin,a captain in spd training division,that she had aggravated an existing injury while she was moving targets at spd firing range.she testified that kerwin rejected her injury report and threatened to give her miranda warnings for attempting to file a false injury report a response that lore attributed to her having filed eeoc complaints.see tr.
as to her claim against lemm,lore testified that she recognized the voice in one of the harassing telephone messages she received as the voice of lemm,with whom she had worked for years.see tr.
as to her claims against guy,lore testified that when she was suspended for using a department copier after refusing to withdraw her claims of gender discrimination,guy made untrue and demeaning comments about her to the local media.she introduced,inter alia,newspaper articles quoting him and a videotape of his comments to a local television station.these exhibits included a article from the november,edition of a syracuse newspaper,the post standard,which was headlined city suspends sergeant accused of check copying.px bb november post standard article or november article.that article,on the front page of the local news section,stated as follows 
a syracuse police sergeant was suspended without pay for days thursday after being accused of taking others paychecks from the budget office,copying them and using them as evidence in her grievance hearing,corporation counsel rick guy said.
teri lore,had filed a grievance saying others are allowed more overtime hours,he said.she was suspended after she turned in the copied documents,guy said.
id.an article in the december,edition of the same newspaper px ee december post standard article reported the filing of lore present action and reported guy comments on it.that article,headlined police sergeant sues for,included the following paragraphs 
city corporation counsel rick guy denied lore allegations.he said lore has filed eight grievances against the department in the past years.
she has been denied at every single avenue she gone down and rightly so,guy said.the allegations in this thing are ridiculous.the whole thing is an absolute waste of taxpayer money.it reeks of a frivolous and meritless lawsuit.there was no discrimination because of her gender.she was doing her job.
px ee.guy televised comments on lore lawsuit included the statement that t his matter has been adjudicated in the administrative side of things several times each time in favor of the police department.frankly,we consider this to be a red herring a distraction,if you will,from the real issue here which is her poor job performance.px ff.
lore testified that there was no basis for guy statements that she was doing her job or that her performance was poor.she testified that,prior to her copying of the pay stubs of three other sergeants to document her claim that the city had breached its agreement with respect to overtime assignments,she had never before been disciplined or even criticized for not doing her job.see tr.
q.so when guy said you were doing your job,do you have any idea what he is referring to 
i have no idea.
id.at.although in his opening statement defense counsel had argued that guy could not properly be sued for publicly commenting on something that is truthful tr,the city introduced no evidence at trial as to lore job performance except guy testimony that he had been told that lore performed poorly in the pio position see,id.at that lore had temperature sic tantrums with members of the media.the only documentary evidence introduced as to lore job performance was introduced by lore a selection of letters of praise and commendation that she had received during the course of her career at spd.nearly of the odd letters that were introduced had come from spd chief of police or a deputy chief or the office of the district attorney.see tr.px nnn.
lore testified that her reputation was spotless until the appearance of the november post standard article citing guy.id.at.although she had copied only pay stubs,she received n egative attention tr.in the wake of that article reporting that she had been suspended for taking and copying others pay checks px bb emphasis added.she testified that she was approached in public by people who asked why would you copy people checks or w hat did you need to steal checks for tr.lore testified that despite her protests that she had not copied checks,and had not stolen anything,her reputation was t otally damaged.it went from one extreme to the other.id.at.
lore testified that there were many spd officers who no longer wanted to associate with her as a result of what was going on in and.lore mother testified that lore fellow officers,who used to congregate with lore at the mother house at night after their shifts ended,stopped coming around.see tr.
lore testified that the events from early until august turned her,emotionally,into a totally different person,one who could deal with the stress,the anxiety,who had t ension headaches and stomach problems and was vomiting,and who could sleep because she was fearful.tr.stress had prompted lore to consult a doctor in february or march,and her doctor had prescribed an antidepressant.see id.at.while taking the medication she suffered side effects including vomiting and diarrhea her use of the medication was gradually reduced,and she ceased taking it in late or early.see id.at.
lore and her mother described lore as a gregarious person prior to the events of see,id.at,they testified that as a result of those events lore became reclusive see,tr.lore mother testified that lore cried and cried and cried id.at and seemed ready for a nervous breakdown,causing the mother to be afraid lore wa s going to do something to hurt herself id.at.
lore testified that in late or early,she stopped seeking advancement within spd,declining to renew,for example,her request for a transfer to the criminal investigation division,where the responsibilities would be greater see,tr.because she knew,based on the attitudes of her superiors,that her transfer requests would be denied see,tr.in late june,lore doctor notified spd that lore needed to be taken out of work for about a week to be treated for recurrent depression.px zz.
at the close of lore case,her retaliation claims against bernardi were dismissed as a matter of law,over her objection,for lack of evidence as to any statements about lore to the press by bernardi.see tr.the remaining individual defendants testified that they had not engaged in the conduct described by lore,or had had no knowledge of her complaints of discrimination at the time of their acts,or had had no intent to retaliate against her.
d.the jury verdicts 
the jury was instructed to return verdicts with answers to written questions with respect to lore claims under and the hrl against boyle,kerwin,and guy,her claim under the hrl against lemm,and her claims under the hrl and title vii against the city itself,claims not asserted against any individual defendant.with respect to each of those defendants,a series of interrogatories asked principally whether the defendant had engaged in specified conduct if so,whether the defendant was aware of lore discrimination complaints at the time of that conduct if so,whether the defendant conduct constituted a material adverse employment action against lore if so,whether lore complaints of discrimination were a motivating factor in the defendant acts of retaliation if so,whether lore sustain ed any actual damages because of the defendant acts of retaliation and if so,what amount of actual damages,if any,the jury awarded lore as a result of being retaliated against by that defendant.verdict form,may,at.
the court,after instructing the jury with respect to burdens of proof and the elements of lore claims,also charged the jury on federal law governing qualified immunity see tr.it instructed that if the jury found that lore had been subjected to unlawful retaliation by boyle,kerwin,or guy,the remaining defendants who were spd employees at the time of their alleged jury must then consider whether that defendant was entitled to qualified immunity.see part.below.the verdict form submitted to the jury included that contingent qualifiedimmunity question.see verdict form at.
after deliberating for less than three hours,the jury returned a verdict in favor of lore against the city.the jury rejected lore retaliation claims against boyle because,although the jury found that he had banished lore from the abc office and required her to submit future information requests in writing,it found that lore had not proven that boyle was aware of her discrimination complaints when he did so.see verdict form at.the jury rejected lore retaliation claims against kerwin,finding that although he was aware of her complaints of discrimination and threatened to give lore miranda warnings or to charge her with a crime,and although this constituted a material adverse employment action,lore had not proven that kerwin threats were motivated by her discrimination complaints.see verdict form at.the jury rejected lore claim against lemm because it found that lore had not proven that he left a harassing message on her answering machine.see verdict form at.
as to guy,the jury found that he made negative comments about lore to news reporters that he was aware at that time that lore had filed an eeoc complaint that guy comments constituted materially adverse employment action that lore discrimination complaints were a motivation for guy acts of retaliation and that as a result of his retaliatory acts,lore suffered actual damages in the amounts of for harm to her reputation and for pain,suffering,and emotional distress.see verdict form at.however,the jury answered yes to the question of whether guy was entitled to qualified immunity.see id.at.
as to the city,the jury answered yes to the question of whether the city,through the conduct of its employees or representatives,engage d in the following actions a offering to forgo criminal and administrative charges against lore in exchange for her withdrawal of her complaints of discrimination or b suspending lore for ten days and seeking a criminal investigation of her conduct.verdict form at.the jury found that the city,through its employees and representatives,was aware of lore complaints of discrimination with the eeoc at the time either of the acts occurred that the city acts or,through the conduct of its employees and representatives,constitute d material adverse employment actions that lore complaints of discrimination were a motivating factor for the city acts or of retaliation and that because of the city acts of retaliation,lore suffered actual damages in the amounts of for harm to her reputation and for pain,suffering,and emotional distress.verdict form at.
the court ruled that,based on the jury various findings,there is a verdict of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars against the city of syracuse and a verdict of no cause for action against defendants boyle,kerwin,guy,and lemm.the verdict of no cause against guy is based on the verdict of him being entitled to qualified immunity.tr.lore and the city thereafter made posttrial motions asking the court to set aside the parts of the jury verdict that were,respectively,adverse to them.in an order dated august,reported at wl lore iii,the district court denied the motions,ruling principally that they were either untimely or meritless,see id.at.for example,the court noted that the jury found that the city knew in july that lore had made copies of other officers pay stubs,and that the jury likely found the city belated suspension of lore suspicious 
the jury could well have concluded that if plaintiff had actually engaged in the serious criminal conduct as alleged by the police department,charges would have immediately been filed against her and the matter would have immediately been referred to the district attorney office.by waiting over two months after the september hearing to file charges and refer the matter to the district attorney office,and only after plaintiff refused to withdraw her eeoc complaint the jury was justified in concluding that the city employees and representatives were motivated by retaliation against her in violation of the human rights law and title vii.
lore iii,wl,at.
in an order dated september,reported at wl lore iv,the court granted in part lore request pursuant to for attorneys fees and costs,awarding a total of,see id.at see part.below.
on the basis of the jury verdict,the orders of dismissal prior to trial,and the dismissal of the claims against bernardi during trial,the court entered a final judgment dismissing lore claims against all defendants other than the city.on the basis of the jury verdict awarding lore in compensatory damages against the city and the court award of fees and costs,the court entered judgment ordering the city to pay lore a total of.execution of the judgment was stayed pending appeal,with the city being required to post a supersedeas bond.
issues on appeal 
the city has appealed,challenging the judgment against it on legal,procedural,and evidentiary grounds see parts ii and iv below.lore filed a stating that she wished to challenge all parts of the judgment and the prejudgment and postjudgment orders that were adverse to her.however,not all such decisions are discussed in lore briefs on appeal.for example,other than apparently referring to all individual defendants in contending that the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing her hrl discrimination claims on the ground that she had suffered no materially adverse employment action,lore briefs contain no mention of tassone and rathbun at all.lore briefs also contain no discussion of the dismissals of her title vii claims against any individual defendant of her due process claims against any defendant of her claims against any defendant for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress or of her title vii claims against the city for hostile work environment,or retaliation in the form of unfavorable performance reviews after she filed complaints of discrimination,or loss of overtime pay,or any conduct predating september.we regard as waived any challenges by lore to adverse decisions that are undiscussed.see generally jackler byrne,cir day morgenthau,cir.and although lore criticizes the district court rulings that she failed to show a custom,policy or practice of the city of syracuse such as would be necessary to maintain a claim against the city and failed to allege a cause of action under the equal protection clause lore reply brief on appeal at,such criticisms appear only in lore reply brief.as lore herself points out with respect to an argument first made by the city in its reply brief issues not raised in a party opening brief are considered abandoned lore brief on appeal at.in parts iii and iv below,we discuss only lore principal contentions that are properly presented.
in assessing each side contentions on appeal,we bear in mind,inter alia,that lore had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence each of the elements of her claims against each defendant that a defendant has the burden of proof with respect to affirmative defenses,and qualified immunity is such a defense,see,gomez toledo,harlow fitzgerald,jules rabin associates,landon,that the weight of the evidence,while a basis for argument to the jury,is not a ground for reversal on appeal,see,robinson cattaraugus county,cir piesco koch,cir schwartz capital liquidators,cir and that a jury is entitled to believe part and disbelieve part of the testimony of any given witness,see,robinson cattaraugus county,at fiacco city of rensselaer,cir,cert.denied,and its assessments of witness credibility and its choices between competing factual inferences are not to be,see generally anderson bessemer city,where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.with respect to factual findings by the jury that were favorable to lore,we view the trial record in the light most favorable to her.
ii.the city challenges with regard to liability 
the city urges that we reverse or vacate the judgment entered against it on various grounds.it contends,inter alia,that the district court should have granted judgment as a matter of law or jmol dismissing lore claim and dismissing so much of her retaliation claims as sought damages for reputational injury on the ground that reputation damages are unavailable as a matter of law and it contends that it was entitled to jmol dismissing lore claims for emotional injury or injury to her reputation on the ground that there was insufficient trial evidence to support findings that any such injuries were caused by culpable acts that the jury found had been committed by the city or its employees.alternatively,the city contends that it is entitled to a new trial because of errors in the admission of evidence,in instructions to the jury,and in the form of certain questions in the jury interrogatories.the city also contends,as discussed in part iv below,that,even if there were no trial errors,the jury award of in damages for emotional distress was excessive and that this court therefore should either order a new trial limited to such damages or order a new trial unless lore agrees to accept a reduction of that award from to.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that although the trial was not without flaws,the city arguments present no basis for disturbing the judgment against it.
a.the city legal arguments 
the city contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law dismissing lore claims for breach of its contract with the police union,for injury to her reputation,and for pain,suffering,and emotional distress.some of these contentions are not preserved for appellate review and none of them provides a basis for reversal.
we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.see,sanders new york city human resources administration,cir.and whether conducting review de novo or under a less sweeping standard,we must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party substantial rights.a substantial right is not implicated if there is no likelihood that the error or defect affected the outcome of the case.see,tesser board of education,cir.
the breach of contract claim 
after both sides had rested at trial and before any claims were submitted to the jury,the city moved pursuant to.a for judgment as a matter of law dismissing,inter alia,lore claim that the city retaliation against her for filing complaints of discrimination breached its collective bargaining agreement with the police union.the city argued principally that since lore was not a party to the cba,she was not entitled to sue the city for its alleged breach.see tr.the district court denied the rule a motion,allowing the claim to be submitted to the jury.following the jury verdict,the city moved pursuant to.b for the entry of jmol in its favor on a number of issues,but it did not mention the issue until it filed a reply brief in support of that motion.in lore iii,the court rejected the city contention that it was entitled to relief because of the submission of the contract claim to the jury,stating as follows 
it appears as if the defendant city of syracuse may not have raised an appropriate or timely objection to submissions of the breach of contract claim to the jury.in any event,in view of the evidence of human rights law and violations by the city,the submission of the breach of contract claim to the jury,even if incorrect,was harmless error.however,it is unclear from the verdict form whether or not the jury actually made a specific finding of breach of contract against the city.therefore,prejudgment interest will not be awarded.
lore iii,wl,at.
the city objection to the submission of lore claim to the jury has merit.under new york law,
when an employer and a union enter into a collective bargaining agreement that creates a grievance procedure,an employee subject to the agreement may not sue the employer directly for breach of that agreement but must proceed,through the union,in accordance with the contract.unless the contract provides otherwise,only when the union fails in its duty of fair representation can the employee go beyond the agreed procedure and litigate a contract issue directly against the employer 
board of education ambach,cert.denied.so long as the discrete fair representation question still needs to be litigated,there can be no resolution on the employee claim against the employer.matter of obot.no claim against the union was asserted by lore in this case.thus,we agree with the city that lore claim against the city should have been dismissed as a matter of law.
we agree with the district court conclusion,however,that even if the city challenge to the submission of the claim to the jury was preserved,despite its not being made in the city main memorandum of law in support of its rule b motion,the submission of that claim to the jury was an error that was entirely harmless.the pertinent section of the verdict form bore the heading claims of retaliation against defendant city of syracuse human rights law,title vii,and breach of contract.verdict form at.despite the mention of breach of contract in this heading,all of the questions that followed see part above were directed only toward the elements of lore claims under title vii and the hrl,whether the city,through its employees or representatives,engaged in specific conduct,whether that conduct constituted materially adverse employment action against lore,whether the city knew of lore complaints of discrimination at the time of the adverse action,and whether the retaliatory conduct was motivated by those complaints.no interrogatory posed any question about a contract issue.the jury answers to the questions that were posed in that section sufficed to support findings that the city violated title vii and the hrl and the district court made no award of prejudgment interest,which would have been mandatory if the judgment against the city had been for breach of contract,see a interest shall be recovered upon a sum awarded because of a breach of performance of a contract emphasis added.
we conclude that neither the inclusion of breach of contract in the verdict form section heading nor any instructions to the jury on the subject of breach of contract affected the city rights.
the reputational injury claims 
the city contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law dismissing lore claims for injury to her reputation.in its brief on appeal,the city initially argued that damages for injury to reputation are not available as a matter of law city brief on appeal at,or are not available without proof of some injury in addition to the injury to reputation see id.at the stigma plus contention,or were not proven a because t here is no evidence in this record of any harm to plaintiff reputation id.at,and b because lore failed to show that acts of the city for which it was held liable proximately caused any harm to her reputation see id.at.after oral argument of the present appeals,the city submitted a letter brief in response to questions from this court and seemed to retreat from its first contention,that reputational damages simply are unrecoverable in an action under title vii or the hrl,and rested its jmol request on the insufficiency of lore evidence.the city letter suggests that its challenge to the award of reputational damages may be merely that lore is not entitled to reputation damages under the facts of this case because no damages were proved.letter from gabrielle mardany hope dated november,city postargument letter,at emphasis in original.none of the city arguments provides ground for reversal.
in order for a party to pursue a request for jmol on appeal,the party must have made timely motions for jmol in the district court.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides in part that a motion for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury.a.the principal purpose of the requirement that any such motion be made before the case is submitted to the jury is to assure the responding party an opportunity to cure any deficiency in that party proof,piesco koch,at see,baskin hawley,cir.to ensure that that opportunity is a fair one,piesco koch,at,rule a also provides that t he motion must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle the movant to the judgment.a emphases added.t he specificity requirement is obligatory.holmes united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a rule a motion requesting judgment as a matter of law on one ground but omitting another is insufficient to preserve a jmol argument based on the latter.see,id.at kirsch fleet street,cir.
if the rule a motion is not granted,the movant may,no later than days after the entry of a judgment,file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.b emphasis added.however,
b ecause the rule b motion is only a renewal of the preverdict motion,it can be granted only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion.the earlier motion informs the opposing party of the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and affords a clear opportunity to provide additional evidence that may be available.the earlier motion also alerts the court to the opportunity to simplify the trial by resolving some issues,or even all issues,without submission to the jury.
advisory committee note emphasis added see,id.advisory committee note a motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the motion holmes united states,at.as to any issue on which proper rule motions were not made,jmol may not properly be granted by the district court,or upheld on appeal,or ordered by the appellate court unless that action is required in order to prevent manifest injustice.see,kirsch fleet street,at galdieri ambrosini national realty development,f d,cir.
although the city made two rule a motions one after lore rested,and the second after the defendants rested,neither of them asserted either that reputational damages are unavailable to a title vii or hrl plaintiff or that lore could not be awarded such damages because of an insufficiency in her evidence.the city a motions requested jmol on the ground of lack of evidence on other specified issues see tr.or on the inappropriate ground that several individual defendants testimony disputed lore testimony as to various events see,id.at,see also id.at citing testimony by a nondefendant witness that certain statements had not been made.but there was no argument in either of the city rule a motions that reputational damages were unavailable as a matter of law,or that lore had failed to prove stigma plus,or that lore had failed to present evidence of causation.indeed,there was no mention of reputation at all.
the city postverdict motion pursuant to rule b did include a section asserting that lore was not entitled to reputational damages as a matter of law and proffered the city doctrinal and sufficiency bases for that assertion.see city post trial memorandum of law at.it asserted,inter alia,that to recover for loss of reputation,plaintiff would have had to offer more evidence than just her own testimony.id.at.but this argument was not a renewal of any argument made in the city rule a motion,and its assertion postverdict plainly did not give lore the requisite opportunity to cure any perceived deficiency in her proof before the case was submitted to the jury.the district court,in ruling on the city rule b motion,did not address the challenge to reputational damages except implicitly in its observation that some of the city arguments ha d been waived by failing to timely object,or to raise the issue,lore iii,wl,at.we conclude that the city request for judgment as a matter of law dismissing lore claims for injury to her reputation was not properly preserved because it was not raised in the city rule a motion.
nor can we conclude that justice requires that we overlook the city procedural default,on the basis of either the law or the state of the record.as to the law,eeoc guidelines with respect to private actions under title vii state that 
d amages are available for the intangible injuries of emotional harm such as emotional pain,suffering,inconvenience,mental anguish,and loss of enjoyment of life.other nonpecuniary losses could include injury to professional standing,and injury to character and reputation 
eeoc,enforcement guidance compensatory and punitive damages available under of the civil rights act of july,http last visited,emphases added.although a showing of stigma plus is required with respect to claims under the due process clause,see,patterson city of utica,f d,cir neu corcoran,cir.paul davis,has been widely interpreted as holding that stigma plus is required to establish a constitutional deprivation emphasis added,cert.denied,the eeoc guidelines contain no suggestion that stigma plus is a prerequisite to recovery for reputational injury on a claim under title vii.
as to the record,the district court found that t he jury verdict was justified by the law and the evidence,lore iii,wl,at,and the city contention that t here is no evidence in this record of any harm to plaintiff reputation city brief on appeal at is frivolous.the record includes testimony by lore that,as a result of the retaliation that followed her complaints of discrimination,she was shunned by many fellow spd members and was approached by civilians in public who interpreted the news reports of guy statements as indicating that lore had stolen other officers paychecks.the city argument that lore did not,for example,give the names of the persons who shunned or criticized her goes not to the admissibility of the evidence but rather to its weight,which is not a ground for appeal.we see no proper basis for disturbing the jury assessment of that evidence or its conclusion that defendants retaliatory actions caused lore reputational injury.
the emotional distress claims 
the city contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law dismissing lore claims for emotional distress on the ground that she failed to present evidence that any such distress was caused by the conduct in which the city was found to have engaged.this contention suffers the same flaws as the city contention that it was entitled to jmol on the claims for reputational injury.neither of the city rule a motions mentioned any perceived insufficiency in lore evidence that she suffered emotional distress as a result of the retaliatory treatment by the defendants.
the city also argues that the jury award to lore of for her emotional distress was excessive.that contention is discussed in part iv below.
b.the city claims of trial error 
the city argues alternatively that it is entitled to a new trial on the grounds that the district court erroneously admitted testimony as to the dismissed discrimination claims and testimony by lore expert witness that it failed to instruct the jury that the discrimination claims had been dismissed and failed to instruct the jury properly on the issue of causation and that the verdict form given to the jury inappropriately contained compound questions.we see no basis for a new trial in the court instructions.and although we question the court admission of the expert testimony,and we find error in the verdict form use of compound questions,the former was harmless,and the city did not preserve its right to appeal the latter.
lore expert witness 
the city complains that,over defense objections,the court allowed lore to present expert testimony by william kenneth katsaris,a former police officer and county sheriff with a master degree in science,who had fulfilled all the requirements for a doctorate in public administration,and who was a state police academy instructor on,inter alia,issues relating to civil rights,discrimination,harassment retaliation for issues of complaints that may be lodged within the law enforcement agency tr.see id.at.katsaris,testifying as an expert in law enforcement tr,was allowed to opine that spd treatment of lore reflected retaliation for her having filed complaints of discrimination.see,id.at i believe very strongly there was sic elements of retaliation,between four and five occasions at least,for what appeared to be her filing of grievances and her eeoc complaint.katsaris gave his opinion,with a reasonable degree of certainty,that lore was subjected to retaliation for making a complaint of discrimination id.at see id.at when defendants,inter alia,prevented her from entering the abc office or from filing an injury report,or threatened her with criminal charges see,id.at.
we apply review to a trial court evidentiary rulings,see,old chief united states,united states abel,including those as to the admissibility of expert testimony,see,general electric joiner.the hallmark of review is deference,see,id.at and a ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony is to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous,salem united states lines.further,an erroneous evidentiary ruling warrants a new trial only when a substantial right of a party is affected,as when a jury judgment would be swayed in a material fashion by the error.arlio lively,cir see hester bic,cir.a.
the city argues that the admission of katsaris opinions was error on the ground that testimony that embraces the ultimate conclusion to be reached in a case is impermissible.city brief on appeal at see also id.at.we reject that contention,given the provision in rule a of the federal rules of evidence that,with an exception not applicable here,opinion testimony that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the factfinder.a.rather,our difficulty with the admission of katsaris testimony is that his opinions did not seem likely to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.while the matter of whether a given defendant impermissibly retaliated against lore had several components a did the defendant perform the acts alleged by lore,b at the time of those acts did the defendant know of lore complaints of discrimination,c were those acts motivated by lore complaints of discrimination,and d did those acts constitute materially adverse actions those components are relatively straightforward.
however,we need not decide whether the admission of katsaris testimony constituted an abuse of discretion,for even if it did,the admission of his opinions was harmless,as the jury quite clearly was not unduly influenced by them.contrary to katsaris stated opinions,the jury found that lore had not proven her retaliation claims against three of the four individual defendants under consideration.further,the jury answers to the interrogatories reflected a painstakingly focused approach that resulted in no two sets of answers being the same.thus,while finding that lore had proven all the elements of her retaliation claims against guy,it found that lore had failed a to prove that lemm engaged in the conduct of which he was accused,b to prove that boyle,when engaging in conduct adverse to lore,had known of lore complaints of discrimination,and c to prove that kerwin,when engaging in conduct adverse to lore while knowing of her complaints of discrimination,was motivated by her complaints.given the jury findings on lore claims of retaliation,we can not conclude that katsaris testimony swayed the jury in any material fashion.
instructions to the jury 
with respect to the charge to the jury,the city does not point to any allegedly erroneous statement but complains that the court did not instruct the jury a that lore discrimination claims had been dismissed see city brief on appeal at,and b that lore was obligated to prove intent on her retaliation claims or that lore had to prove her damages were proximately caused by the incidents for which a particular defendant was found liable id.at emphases in original.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.perry ethan allen,cir perry internal quotation marks omitted.a jury instruction will be deemed adequate if the charge is correct and sufficiently covers the case so that a jury can intelligently determine the questions presented to it.schermerhorn local,transport workers union of america,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we review a claim of error in the district court jury instructions de novo,and will reverse on this basis only if the appellant can show that the error was prejudicial in light of the charge as a whole.perry,at.an omission,or an incomplete instruction,is less likely to be prejudicial than a misstatement of the law.henderson kibbe.if the instructions,read as a whole,presented the issues to the jury in a fair and evenhanded manner,they do not warrant reversal.see,new york pullman,cir,cert.denied.
a.the prior dismissal of lore discrimination claims 
within the above framework,we reject the city contention that the court was required to inform the jury that lore discrimination claims had been dismissed.that dismissal even if it had been entirely correct,which it was not see part.below would not be material to lore claims of retaliation.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,an employee must show that she was engaged in protected activity the employer was aware of that activity the employee suffered a materially adverse action and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action.see generally kessler westchester department of social services,cir kessler galdieri ambrosini national realty development,at.however,in order to recover for retaliation for having filed such a complaint,the plaintiff need not prove that her underlying complaint of discrimination had merit.see,reed lawrence,cir manoharan columbia university college of physicians surgeons,cir.
of necessity,given the nature of the claims of retaliation,the fact that lore had filed complaints of discrimination would be mentioned at trial in order to place her retaliation claims in context.and each side stretched to present that context in an advantageous light.see,part v below.but throughout the trial,the court told the jurors that they were not to concern themselves with whether lore discrimination complaints had merit.the court began by so informing the prospective jurors during voir dire,stating that lore had filed two claims of discrimination against the city police department,that we are not getting into the merits of those claims because that not at issue here,and that federal and state law forbid a public employer to retaliate against an employee for filing a claim of discrimination,regardless of the merits of what you have filed.tr.
after jury selection,the court informed the jurors that there was no dispute that lore had filed a claim with the eeoc alleging discriminatory conduct and it stated that the issue before you will not be whether or not she was discriminated against at all.the issue before you is after she filed those claims,was she retaliated against because she filed the claims.the merits of those claims that she filed are not before you.tr.emphases added.and again,before the parties opening statements,the court reiterated that lore had filed complaints of discrimination but stated 
i have instructed counsel,and i am instructing you that there will be no discussion about the results of her filing of the complaints.as i said,that irrelevant to the issues in this case.you are here only for retaliation.the results are immaterial whether they are valid or invalid.
we are not going to have any evidence about that.you are not to speculate.you are not to consider what was the results of her complaints.
the court thereafter also repeatedly admonished counsel in the presence of the jury,and reminded the jury,that the trial was not concerned with the merits of lore complaints of discrimination.for example,when defense counsel in his opening statement told the jury that lore had not suffered sexual harassment,loss of rank,or loss of pay,the court promptly reminded him not to get into that tr.and stated 
the court again,smith,we are not talking about the merits of this claim.
m embers of the jury,the merits of her discrimination claim s are irrelevant.we are talking about retaliation.
id.when lore was questioned by her own attorney about her complaints of discrimination see id.at,the court ruled that lore was not to go into the details of her complaints it allowed her to answer to the extent that if she wants to say it was gender discrimination,yes or no.that all.id.at see also id.at y ou are getting close to the merits of those filings,and i am not going to allow it.we are not here to decide the merits of any of the grievances filed.id.at w e know she filed a complaint for gender discrimination.i told you we are not getting into the details because this is a retaliation cause of action that we are talking about.and in its final charge to the jury the court again instructed,t he merits of plaintiff complaints of gender discrimination are of no concern to you.instead,your task is to determine whether plaintiff was unlawfully retaliated against for complaining of gender discrimination.tr.emphasis added.given that the trial was focused on lore claims of retaliation,the court properly instructed that the merits of her claims of discrimination were of no proper concern to the jury.
to the extent that the city argues that such an instruction might have been needed to avoid jury confusion as to precisely what was at issue,we note that defendants must bear some responsibility for such confusion as may have occurred.loose and inapposite language,conflating the areas of discrimination and retaliation,was repeatedly used by defense counsel,who,instead of referring to retaliation for complaints of discrimination,referred to retaliation based upon gender,id.at,and sexual retaliation,tr.and,disregarding the court repeated admonitions not to get into the merits of lore discrimination complaints,defense counsel in his summation stated as follows 
i think when we review this evidence together,you will conclude at the end of this case that there were no acts of discrimination and certainly no acts of retaliation against sergeant lore.
so where does it begin where does it begin we frankly know it goes back to may of when sergeant lore then held the position of public information officer,and for reasons that you heard but reasons,frankly,that are not before you in this trial,she was transferred.and frankly,as a result of that transfer out of that position,that everything starts and ends with therese lore that she has been discriminated against,that she has been retaliated against.set aside for the moment that the mayor of the city of syracuse or the chief office has absolutely every right to transfer whatever employee they want.
for instance,if there are complaints about the public information officer,the public information officer gets in tantrums,temper tantrums,shouting fights,cussing fights with members of the media,i suggest to you that might be one good reason to transfer her out of her position as the public information officer.
tr.emphases added.
the court instructions eliminating the merits of lore complaints of discrimination from consideration by the jury were clear and appropriate.and if the court had,as the city wishes,told the jury that lore discrimination claims had been dismissed,such an instruction in light of the fact that the dismissal of some of those claims was erroneous see part.below might well have entitled lore to a new trial.
b.the element of causation 
nor do we see any unfairness in the court instructions to the jury as to the element of causation.the court informed the jury that plaintiff must prove there was a causal connection between her complaint of discrimination with the eeoc and a materially adverse employment action.tr.the court instructed,in part,that 
plaintiff must prove that her complaints of discrimination w ere a cause of the alleged acts of retaliation.you must determine whether the defendant under consideration acted with a retaliatory motive,or alternatively,whether they acted for,permissible reasons.you have heard at trial various explanations from the defendants for their actions.your task now is to determine whether plaintiff has proven that the defendants more likely acted in retaliation than in accordance with their proffered reasons if you determine that plaintiff complaints of discrimination and other events both served as motivating factors for the alleged acts of retaliation,you must find for the plaintiff against the defendant under consideration.on the other hand,if you find that plaintiff has not proven that her complaints of discrimination served as a motivating factor for the alleged acts of retaliation,you must find for the defendant under consideration.
tr.the court thereafter elaborated on the issue of 
proximate cause of plaintiff damages.should you find that the plaintiff has proven that defendant violated lore first amendment right to complain of gender discrimination,you must next determine whether plaintiff injuries were caused by the defendants alleged retaliatory actions.plaintiff has the burden to prove that her injuries would not have occurred without defendants retaliatory conduct.therefore,if plaintiff injuries would have occurred absent the alleged acts of retaliation,you must find for the defendant under consideration.
tr.the court instructed that damages were appropriate only as necessary to compensate lore for harm she sustained as a direct result of the defendants actions id.at emphasis added and as the direct result of any retaliation she may have suffered id.at emphases added.the verdict form itself asked whether lore sustain ed actual damages because of defendant city of syracuse acts of retaliation.verdict form at emphases added.
considering the court instructions as a whole,we see in them no basis for a new trial.
the verdict form 
the city also contends that it is entitled to a new trial because the section of the verdict form with regard to the city posed compound questions.thus,the first interrogatory called for a single yes or no answer to the question whether the city a offer ed to forgo criminal and administrative charges against plaintiff therese lore in exchange for her withdrawal of her complaints of discrimination or b suspend ed plaintiff therese lore for ten days and s ought a criminal investigation of her conduct.verdict form at emphasis added.subsequent questions asked about knowledge,motivation,and the employment effect materially adverse or not of either of those acts,or.id.at.
decisions as to the format and language to be used in a special verdict form are committed to the trial court discretion,see,e,smith lightning bolt productions,cir,and there is no abuse of discretion if the verdict form,when read in conjunction with the instructions to the jury,clearly presents the material factual issues raised by the pleadings and evidence,see,cutlass productions,bregman,cir.a party that fails to object at trial to the substance or ambiguity of special verdict questions to be put to the jury waives its right to a new trial on that ground and has no right to object to such matters on appeal,see,united states football league national football league,cir bohack iowa beef processors,cir,unless the error is fundamental,see generally shade housing authority of new haven,cir.an error is fundamental under this standard only if it is so serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.id.at quoting modave long island jewish medical center,cir.
although the posing of compound questions is inappropriate because it normally will cause the jury answers to be ambiguous,the city concedes that it did not object to the verdict form on this ground.see city postargument letter at.the city states that it objected to the entire verdict form id.but in order to preserve an issue for appeal,an objection must be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error,palmer hoffman.an objection to the entire verdict form does not suffice to alert the court to a specific error in a particular question.
although the city also states that it had proposed its own set of interrogatories which did not contain a compound question city postargument letter at,its proposed questions could not have alerted the court to a need to require separate answers to disjunctive possibilities,for the city proposed questions did not set out any possibilities separately the city did not request separate findings as to whether it a offered to forgo criminal charges if lore would withdraw her discrimination complaints,or b suspended her for refusing to do so and attempted to have her prosecuted.the city proposed liability interrogatories aside from inappropriate legal questions with regard to qualified immunity see generally part.below asked simply whether a given defendant intentionally retaliated against lore for filing complaints of gender discrimination and if so whether lore was thereby injured.thus,despite the fact that some of the individual defendants had testified that they did not engage in the conduct described by lore and on the basis of their own evidence moved,inappropriately,for judgment as a matter of law see,tr,not one of the city proposed questions asked the jury to make a finding as to whether lore had proven that a given defendant had in fact performed a particular alleged retaliatory act.
it was well within the court discretion not to adopt the city proposed blunderbuss interrogatories and the city present objection to the compound questions in the interrogatories that were adopted is not preserved for review.given that there was ample evidence upon which the jury could find that the city both a offered to forgo criminal and administrative charges against lore if she would withdraw her complaints of discrimination and b suspended her for days and attempted to subject her to criminal investigation after she refused,ample evidence to permit the jury to answer the initial question affirmatively had it been phrased as a conjunct rather than a disjunct,we can not conclude that the compound questions in this case warrant a new trial.
iii.lore cross appeal with respect to issues of liability 
lore,in her,argues principally a that the court should have determined that guy was not entitled to qualified immunity,rather than submitting that ultimate issue to the jury and dismissing her claims against guy on the basis of the jury determination,and b that the court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing her principal gender discrimination claims based on her removal from the pio position.lore contention that,on the basis of the jury factual findings against guy,the district court should have entered judgment in her favor for the in injuries guy was found to have caused,in addition to the the judgment awarded against the city,is discussed in part iv below.
lore additional contentions with regard to issues of liability are principally that the district court erred in summarily dismissing her claims against falge that she is entitled to a new trial on her retaliation claims against boyle and kerwin on the ground that the court improperly excluded evidence relevant to those claims and that she was entitled to a default judgment against all of the defendants for their noncompliance with discovery orders.those contentions,along with the argument that lore was entitled to an award of higher attorneys fees,are discussed in part.below.
for the reasons set out in parts.and below,we find merit in some aspects of lore contentions with respect to the liability of guy,and we agree that the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing her principal gender discrimination claims under the hrl on the basis that lore had suffered no materially adverse employment action.however,for the reasons stated in part v below,we only conditionally vacate the dismissal of lore hrl discrimination claims.
lore contentions as to guy and the city 
over lore objection,the district court instructed the jury on federal law principles governing public officials entitlement to qualified immunity with respect to lore claims,and the verdict form included a question to be answered,if the jury found that guy retaliated against lore,as to whether guy was entitled to qualified immunity.lore contends that the ultimate question of guy entitlement to qualified immunity was a legal question for the court,not a question for the jury,and that the court should have ruled,based on the jury factual findings,that guy was not entitled to immunity.we agree in part.once any material factual questions had been answered by the jury,the ultimate matter of guy entitlement to qualified immunity should have been determined by the court.bearing in mind that the claims submitted to the jury against guy were both those asserted under for violation of lore first amendment right to file grievances and complain of discrimination and those asserted under the hrl,we conclude that the court should have determined that guy a was entitled to qualified immunity on the claim but b did not establish his entitlement to immunity for violation of the hrl.
submission of qualified immunity issues to the jury 
the principles governing entitlement to qualified immunity with respect to alleged violations of the constitution are well established.qualified immunity protects public officials performing discretionary functions from personal liability in a civil suit for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow,at.w hether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action,harlow,at,assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken,id,at.anderson creighton.
the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.see wilson layne,a s we explained in anderson,the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it was clearly established.
saucier katz,emphasis added.thus,w hether a defendant officer conduct was objectively reasonable is a mixed question of law and fact.zellner summerlin,cir.if there are unresolved factual issues which prevent an early disposition of the defense,the jury should decide these issues on special interrogatories.warren dwyer,cir,cert.denied,see,manganiello city of new york,cir kerman city of new york,cir oliveira mayer,cir,cert.denied.
here,questions as to what situation confronted guy,what acts he performed,and his motivation in performing those acts were questions of fact they were to be and were answered by the factfinder.in light of those factual findings,the question of whether it would be clear to a reasonable public official,engaging in that conduct in that situation,that his conduct was unlawful was a question of law.we conclude that although the district court properly put the fact questions to the jury,it erred in having the jury decide the ultimate legal question,in light of the facts established,of whether guy,in his personal capacity,was entitled to qualified immunity.that legal question should have been answered by the court.
guy entitlement to qualified immunity 
lore contends that the court should have ruled that guy was not entitled to qualified immunity.we disagree with respect to lore retaliation claim based on federal law,her claim under that guy retaliated against her in violation of her first amendment right to file grievances and complaints of discrimination but we agree with respect to her claim under the hrl.
immunity with respect to lore claim 
as indicated in part.above,federal law accords a public official qualified immunity from personal liability in a civil suit for damages if his performance of a discretionary function did not violate clearly established federal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person in his position would have known.in order to prevail on her retaliation claim,lore was required to prove and the jury found that she had proven,inter alia,that because of her exercise of her first amendment rights,she suffered a materially adverse action.see,cox warwick valley central school district,cir.
prior to,our decisions in cases involving first amendment retaliation claims brought by public employees against their employers under had not made clear that the element of such a claim need not involve adverse action related to the plaintiff employment.some of our opinions did not refer to the need for an employment connection,perhaps because there was no dispute that there in fact was such a connection,see,locurto safir,cir termination of employment heil santoro,cir day suspension without pay.in,however,a year before guy retaliation against lore through his comments to the media,we had held that a plaintiff employee complaining of retaliation by his employer for exercise of his first amendment rights similarly to one complaining of retaliation in violation of title vii,see generally kessler,at discussing cases was required to show an adverse action that was related to employment,see morris lindau,cir.in morris,which involved claims under,not title vii,we affirmed the dismissal of one of the claims,stating that morris does not allege that the transfer here involved any change in job description,days and hours,duties,benefits,or opportunity for promotion.it follows that the transfer was not an adverse employment action.at.
in,the supreme court in burlington northern santa fe ry.white,burlington,ruled that even on a retaliation claim under title vii,the materially adverse action that must be proven need not be squarely tied to the terms or conditions of the plaintiff employment.see id.at the scope of the title vii antiretaliation provision extends beyond or retaliatory acts and harm.id.at.the burlington court reasoned that a n employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace,such as by fil ing false criminal charges against a former employee who complained about discrimination.id.at emphasis in original.a provision limited to actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take.id.at.thus,the court ruled that the proper interpretation of the adverse action requirement in title vii is that 
a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court stated,our holding today makes clear that the jury was not required to find that the challenged actions were related to the terms or conditions of employment.id.at.if the element of a title vii retaliation action can be satisfied by an action causing the employee harm outside the workplace,a fortiori an act in retaliation for the employee exercise of a constitutional right need not be tied to harm in the workplace.
in the present case,the district court jury charge which apparently inadvertently imposed on lore the unduly high burden of proving the element beyond a preponderance straddled the pre and post analyses of the controlling principle 
to constitute a materially adverse employment action,plaintiff must prove beyond a preponderance of the evidence that she was subject to an employment action which would discourage a reasonable employee from coming forward with a complaint of discrimination.in other words,plaintiff must prove that the alleged acts of retaliation would cause a reasonable employee to hesitate when deciding whether to complain of discrimination at the workplace.as with the other elements,you must find for the defendant on each claim,if any,for which you determine the alleged act of retaliation was not materially adverse.
tr.emphases added.
as the jury could reasonably conclude that a public comment by the municipality top lawyer implying or confirm ing tr.that lore,a police officer,had stolen fellow officers paychecks,though not affecting the terms or conditions of lore employment,might well have dissuaded a reasonable police officer from making a complaint of discrimination,guy was properly found to have unlawfully retaliated against lore.but our express ruling in morris lindau in impedes the conclusion that the principle that the element could be satisfied by harmful effects outside the workplace would have been clear to a reasonable corporation counsel at the time of guy comments to the media in.and as we have not been pointed to any trial evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that those comments caused a material change in lore employment status or the terms and conditions of her employment,we must conclude that guy was entitled to qualified immunity on lore claim against him for his retaliatory comments to the media in.
we note that the city contends that if guy is entitled to qualified immunity,the city is immune from responsibility for his actions.we reject this contention because qualified immunity is a defense only on a claim asserted against an individual in his personal capacity.a suit against an individual in his personal capacity is not a suit against the governmental entity.see,kentucky graham.a claim asserted against an individual in his official capacity,on the other hand,is in effect a claim against the governmental entity itself,rather than a suit against the individual personally,for suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent,monell department of social services.but municipalities have no immunity from damages for liability flowing from their constitutional violations.owen city of independence,see,morris lindau,at municipalities have no immunity defense,either qualified or absolute,in a suit under.thus,with respect to an claim,qualified immunity is simply not a defense.see,hafer melo,kentucky graham,at.however,the city is not liable for guy violation of lore constitutional rights for the reasons discussed in part.below.
immunity with respect to lore hrl claim 
we reach a different conclusion with respect to the matter of qualified immunity for guy on lore claim under the hrl.while the analyses of claims of employment discrimination or retaliation are the same under title vii and the hrl,see,farias instructional systems,cir raskin wyatt,cir,the principles of new york law governing the availability of qualified immunity for violations of state law differ somewhat from the above federal principles applicable to violations of federal law.
preliminarily,we note that guy and the city,citing only mon.city of new york,and barrett united states,cir,contend that guy is entitled not just to qualified immunity but even to absolute immunity for his comments to the press on the ground that guy comments were made in his capacity as corporation counsel and were made in defense of the city of syracuse in pending civil litigation.defendants reply brief on appeal at.we are unpersuaded.
new york law does recognize absolute immunity with respect to the performance of discretionary functions that are judicial,prosecutorial,or,see,arteaga state of new york,della pietra state of new york,della pietra tarter state of new york,and perhaps it would deem an attorney who is defending a governmental entity in ongoing litigation to be entitled to immunity similar to that of a prosecutor,barrett united states,at,affirming,under federal law,the dismissal of a defense attorney for the state of new york who,on behalf of the state of new york during the course of and in connection with ongoing litigation,had withheld certain information from the plaintiff.but here we focus principally on guy first set of comments to the media,for defendants did not seek separate questions as to which of guy sets of comments caused lore injury,and we think it highly likely that the jury viewed the implication that a police officer was a thief,stealing from her fellow policemen,as inherently far more damaging to the officer reputation and prospects for occupational advancement,and far more upsetting,than the statements that she simply was not doing her job well.guy first comments to the press resulting in the november post standard article erroneously stating that lore had taken other officers checks and implying that she had stolen them were made before there was any pending litigation,and his comments had no discernable judicial character.indeed,in testifying at trial,guy characterized his november statements to the press as merely responding to a request.see tr.
further,the authorities cited by guy and the city are inapposite neither barrett united states nor mon city of new york involved statements by a government attorney to the media.and the latter,an action brought by a plaintiff who was shot by a policeman,did not involve either an attorney defendant or any question of individual immunity.rather,mon dealt with the question of whether a municipality ha d governmental immunity from liability for negligence in hiring.at.at.guy has not shown any entitlement to absolute immunity.
nor can we conclude that new york law entitled guy to qualified immunity.in contrast to the federal standard,which is objectively reasonable reliance on existing law,kentucky graham,at see,harlow,at,the new york standard for entitlement to qualified immunity has both objective and subjective components.the objective component distinguishes between official acts that are discretionary and those that are ministerial although the line between the two categories is not always clear,see,tangocross tulevech,making such immunity available only with respect to those that are discretionary,see,mon city of new york,at,at.the subjective component makes qualified immunity entirely unavailable if there are undisturbed findings of bad faith,della pietra,at.at see also jules rabin associates,landon,at,at affirmative defense of qualified privilege may be overcome by malice established by showing recklessness with regard to the truth or falsity of otherwise defamatory statements.
we need not decide whether guy initial statements to the media were discretionary or ministerial,however,for even if they were more than ministerial,guy plainly can not be said to have met his burden of proof on the subjective component of the new york standard,the burden of showing that his statements to the media were not made in bad faith.to begin with,we note that although defendants were insistent that the district court should instruct the jury to make the ultimate determinations if any were needed with respect to qualified immunity,defendants proposed instructions to the jury which included one relating to qualified immunity on claims under contained no proposed instruction with respect to immunity on claims under the hrl,and they did not mention guy burden of proving lack of bad faith in order to prevail on that defense.similarly,defendants proposed interrogatories to the jury included no question on the issue of good or bad faith.
moreover,guy testimony at trial fell well short of a meaningful attempt to show lack of bad faith.guy testified that he received a call from a reporter seeking confirmation that an spd officer had been suspended for copying payroll or personnel records see tr,that he had spoken to falge,who informed him that an employee had been suspended for copying paycheck stubs id.at,and that guy informed the reporter that her information was accurate id.at.but guy did not testify to exactly what information the reporter told him she had.the ensuing article referred to check s rather than pay stubs it stated that lore was suspended for taking them,easily lending itself to the inference that she had stolen them and every statement in the november article was expressly attributed to guy.guy did not testify that the article in any way went beyond what he had confirm ed to the reporter.and it may not have been lost on the jury that guy failure to attempt to distance himself from the article implication that lore had stolen checks was entirely consistent with his attorney arguments at trial that lore copied other officers checks,tr,that lore engaged in a check scheme id.at,that lore took her fellow sergeants paycheck s id.at see id.at that lore went to the abc office to take payroll checks id.at and that at the september hearing lore show ed that she stole the checks id.at.the jury,which evidently credited lore testimony that she had not taken checks,had not stolen anything,and had only copied pay stubs,was easily entitled to infer that guy was responsible for the november article indication that lore had stolen her fellow officers paychecks.
ironically,the jury,while being inappropriately asked to determine the legal question with regard to qualified immunity on the claim,was not asked to make a factual finding as to whether guy had acted in good faith,a fact that was essential to his defense of qualified immunity on the hrl claim.not being given a question on that issue,and not being instructed on the issue of bad faith,the jury made no finding as to whether guy had met his burden of proving that he did not act in bad faith.in circumstances in which a jury has been asked to return a special verdict in the form of answers to fact questions,see.a,but,without timely objection,has not been given a question on a material fact,that question is to be answered by the court,see,cullen margiotta,cir,cert.denied,u,overruled on other grounds by agency holding malley duff associates.in many cases,the court in answering an omitted question will theoretically be free to make a finding favoring either side.however,given the parties seventh amendment rights to have factual issues decided by a jury,the jury verdict on the common factual issues precludes a contrary finding of fact by the court wade orange county sheriff office,cir see also leblanc sternberg fletcher,cir court can not,given principles of collateral estoppel,make its own findings that are inconsistent with the findings of the jury.
here,the jury,having been instructed that lore was required to prove each element of her claims against each defendant by a preponderance of the evidence see,tr,found expressly that lore had proven that guy made negative comments about her to news reporters,that when he made those comments he knew she had made complaints of discrimination,and that her complaints of discrimination were a motivating factor for defendant corporation counsel rick guy acts of retaliation verdict form at.given the jury finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that guy was motivated to retaliate against lore because of her protected activity in making complaints of discrimination,the court would not have been free to make a finding that guy had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he had not acted in bad faith.
accordingly,guy did not establish his entitlement to qualified immunity with respect to lore claim that he retaliated against her in violation of the hrl.we agree with lore that the judgment should not have dismissed that claim.
liability of the city for the actions of guy 
lore contends that the jury findings that guy unlawfully retaliated against her should be imputed to the city and that the district court should have entered judgment in her favor not only requiring the city to pay her in damages on account of the jury findings against the city itself,but also requiring the city and guy to pay her an additional in damages on account of the jury findings as to the conduct of guy.lore imputation contention has merit only with respect to her claim under the hrl and we can not conclude that the imputation of hrl liability to the city for guy conduct would justify an increase in the award of damages.
the jury findings against guy on lore claim can not properly be used to impute liability for his acts to the city.although guy was sued in both his personal and official capacities,a suit against an official in his official capacity 
is not a suit against the official personally,for the real party in interest is the entity.thus,while an award of damages against an official in his personal capacity can be executed only against the official personal assets,a plaintiff seeking to recover on a damages judgment in an suit must look to the government entity itself.
kentucky graham,at emphasis in original.a claim against a municipality or against an official sued in his official capacity,however,can not be sustained unless the plaintiff shows that the violation of her federal rights was the result of a municipal custom or policy.see,monell,at.
although to establish personal liability in a action,it is enough to show that the official,acting under color of state law,caused the deprivation of a federal right,m ore is required in an action,for a governmental entity is liable under only when the entity itself is a moving force behind the deprivation thus,in an suit the entity policy or custom must have played a part in the violation of federal law.
kentucky graham,at first emphasis in original second and third emphases added.
the district court dismissed lore claim against the city in lore i,see d at,and no substantial evidence was introduced to show that the acts of guy or other individual defendants were performed pursuant to a custom or policy of the city.thus,the claims against individual defendants in their official capacities could not be sustained.guy could be found liable only in his personal capacity,and such liability assuming he were not entitled to qualified immunity on the claim could not result in a judgment against the city.only in an action is a plaintiff who prevails entitled to look for relief,both on the merits and for fees,to the governmental entity.kentucky graham,at.
the story begins differently with respect to lore claim under the hrl,however.no municipal custom or policy need be proven to establish the liability of the city for violation of that state law,for m unicipalities surrendered their tort immunity for the misfeasance of their officers and employees long ago,tango tulevech,at,at.guy violation of lore rights under the hrl may properly be imputed to the city.indeed,the court advised the jury that if it found any of the individual defendants other than the lemm to have retaliated against lore in violation of the hrl,then the city is responsible.tr.see also id.at if you find against any individuals,that will also be a finding against the city of syracuse.with respect to lore claims asserted under the hrl,those instructions were correct.accordingly,to the extent that the jury found that guy violated the hrl in making negative retaliatory comments about lore to the press,the city is liable for that violation.the consequences of the city responsibility for the acts of guy in this case are discussed in part iv below.
lore challenge to summary judgment dismissing her hrl discrimination claims 
the principal employment action that lore alleged constituted gender discrimination was her removal as spd spokesman in mid.there appears to be no dispute that lore was removed from the pio position by foody upon the orders of bernardi.in support of her contention that her removal was motivated by gender discrimination,lore testified in deposition that she was replaced by a male and that foody later told her,in sum and substance,that mayor bernardi told foody that lore had too much influence and that a woman should be seen and not heard.deposition of therese lore lore dep,at.
on the summary judgment motion by the city and most of the individual defendants,the district court dismissed lore title vii and hrl discrimination claims on various grounds.see lore i,d at.because title vii does not impose liability on individuals,see,mandell county of suffolk,cir wrighten glowski,cir tomka seiler,cir tomka,abrogated on other grounds by burlington industries,ellerth,the court dismissed all of lore title vii claims against the individual defendants.see lore i,d at.because under the relevant provision of federal law lore was required to file her eeoc complaint no more than days after the allegedly discriminatory employment practice,see e,the court dismissed all of her title vii claims as to events prior to september,on the ground that they were.see lore i,d at.
under the hrl,in contrast,liability for employment discrimination may be imposed on individuals,see,mandell.county of suffolk,at tomka,at,and the limitations period for bringing an hrl claim is not days but rather is three years,see,bonner guccione,cir.accordingly,the court concluded that lore gender discrimination claims that her removal from the pio position and her transfers to technical operations and patrol units violated the hrl were cognizable against the individual defendants and were timely.see lore i,d at.
because discrimination claims under the hrl are evaluated using the same analytical framework used in title vii actions,the district court considered lore hrl discrimination claims within the framework established by mcdonnell douglas green.to show a prima facie case within that framework,a plaintiff must proffer evidence that she is a member of a protected class,that she is qualified for the position at issue,that she was subject to a materially adverse employment action,and that the circumstances give rise to an inference of invidious discrimination.see id.at.the district court concluded that lore could not meet the third prong of this test 
with respect to the may,removal of plaintiff from her position as public information officer,plaintiff fails to establish how this removal constituted an adverse employment action under the applicable case law.it is undisputed that plaintiff salary did not change as a result of her removal.although plaintiff could nevertheless demonstrate an adverse employment action by showing a substantial reduction in material responsibilities,plaintiff does not submit any evidence of a reduction in responsibilities following the may,transfer.much to the contrary,plaintiff was given the opportunity in her deposition to explain whether she had fewer responsibilities after her removal from the public information officer position,but plaintiff expressly declined to characterize her responsibilities as fewer and instead described her new responsibilities as different.
lore i,d at quoting lore dep.emphases ours.although noting that the fact that lore was given different,rather than fewer,responsibilities does not remove the possibility that the alleged discriminatory act was sufficiently adverse,so long as a reasonable person would believe their working conditions were worsened by the change in responsibilities,lore i,d at,the court concluded that lore had not shown that a reasonable person would have that belief.it dismissed lore hrl claims of discrimination based on her removal from the pio position,stating that 
plaintiff admits in her deposition that she received the same benefits,salary,and work schedule following the may,transfer and fails to direct the court attention to any evidence of why a reasonable person,let alone herself,believed her employment conditions had been worsened by the may,transfer.
on appeal,lore contends that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that her removal from the pio position was not a materially adverse employment action.we agree.t he protections provided by title vii are not limited to instances of discrimination in pecuniary emoluments.de la cruz new york city human resources administration,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the transfer of an employee from an elite position to one that is less prestigious with little opportunity for professional growth is sufficient to permit a jury to infer that the transfer was a materially adverse employment action.see,burlington,at a jury could reasonably conclude that a reassignment from a position carrying an indication of prestige to one imposing duties that were by all accounts more arduous and dirtier would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee internal quotation marks omitted brady.wal mart stores,cir evidence of a transfer that did not affect the plaintiff wages or benefits,but resulted in a less distinguished title and significantly diminished material responsibilities,is sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the transfer constituted an adverse employment action patrolmen benevolent association city of new york,cir.a lateral transfer that does not result in a reduction in pay or benefits may be an adverse employment action so long as the transfer alters the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment in a materially negative way,cert.denied,u.rodriguez board of education,cir transfer of art teacher from junior high school to elementary school held to be an adverse employment action.
in the present case,in the pio position,lore was assigned to the office of the chief of police,dealt with the media,and was the spokesman for the department.when she was removed from that position,her duties for several weeks entailed merely doing odds and ends in the chief office lore dep.she was then reassigned to technical operations,see lore i,d at.shortly thereafter,she was again reassigned,this time to supervise the uniformed patrol units,see and in little more than half a year,she herself was required to wear a uniform while serving in a community relations unit in which none of the male sergeants was required to wear a uniform,see id.at.we conclude that a rational juror could find that,even though lore rank and salary were not reduced,a reasonable police officer could easily view the change from the position of public information officer in the office of the chief of police,to that of general factotum in that office and thence to equipment,patrol,and uniformed positions,as materially adverse changes.accordingly,lore hrl claims for gender discrimination based on her removal from the pio position should not have been summarily dismissed on the ground that she failed to proffer sufficient proof of a materially adverse employment action.
however,lore has not argued on appeal that any individual defendant other than bernardi was involved in the decision to remove her as pio.in her deposition,lore laid her removal from the pio position squarely at the door of bernardi see lore dep,and she has not called to our attention any proffer in the district court to show that any other individual was involved in her removal from that position.thus,with respect to that removal,we see no basis for vacating the summary dismissals of any defendants other than bernardi and the city.as to those two defendants,we will conditionally vacate the dismissal of lore hrl claims of gender discrimination in her removal from the pio position and we will give lore the option to pursue those claims in accordance with the conditions set out in part v below.
lore other contentions 
lore other contentions,aside from her contention that she should be awarded an additional in damages on the basis of the jury findings against guy,do not require extended discussion.she contends principally that the district court erred in summarily dismissing her claims against falge and that she is entitled to a new trial on her retaliation claims against boyle and kerwin on the ground that the court improperly excluded evidence relevant to those claims.she also contends that the district court should have entered a default judgment against all of the defendants for noncompliance with discovery orders.finally,she contends that she was entitled to attorneys fees calculated at an hourly rate higher than.we are unpersuaded.
lore argues that the district court granting of summary judgment dismissing her claims against falge deprived her of the opportunity to recover punitive damages.lore brief on appeal at.her explanation as to the basis for this challenge states simply that the district court improper and super technical construction of plaintiff complaint a was error.id.this argument fails to meet the requirement of the federal rules of appellate procedure that an appellant brief on appeal must contain not only the party contentions,but also the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities,fed.a a see id.rule c principal brief of must comply with rule a,except that the brief need not include a statement of the case or a statement of the facts.we decline to address lore unenlightening challenge to the dismissal of falge.
the jury found that lore had not proven her retaliation claims against boyle because she did not show that,at the time he barred her from the abc office and insisted that her future informational requests be in the form of memoranda,he knew of her complaints of discrimination.lore contends that she is entitled to a new trial of her claims against boyle because the district court refused to allow her to introduce a document which she characterizes as direct evidence that boyle banned lore from the abc office as retaliation for her complaints of discrimination lore brief on appeal at to show that he had that knowledge.this contention and characterization are meritless.
lore conceded at trial that boyle issued the instructions barring lore from the abc office and imposing the requirement on july.see tr.the document that lore claims was wrongly excluded an interoffice memorandum comparing the overtime assignments given to lore and others was dated july.the document states nothing about the boyle knowledge as to lore filing of complaints of discrimination and does not indicate when boyle requested the information provided.as such the document was not competent to fill the gap in lore proof,and it was well within the trial court discretion to exclude it.
the jury found lore claims against kerwin unproven because,although he knew of lore complaints of discrimination,lore had not proven that his conduct was motivated by them.lore contends that she is entitled to a new trial of her retaliation claims against kerwin on two grounds.first she argues that the credible evidence received during trial does not support the jury finding that defendant michael kerwin was not motivated by lore eeoc charge when he attempted to read lore her miranda warnings over the phone.lore brief on appeal at see id.at the jury finding that kerwin was not so motivated lacks a sufficient basis in the record to support the jury verdict.second,she argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow her to call as a witness spd officer katherine lee,who had sued kerwin for retaliation see lore brief on appeal at.we reject these arguments.
in connection with her contention that the jury finding in favor of kerwin on the motivation issue was unsupported by the evidence,lore argues that she satisfied her burden in showing that kerwin knew about her eeoc complaint and took an adverse action against her.id.at.this argument misperceives,inter alia,the elements of a retaliation claim and the allocation of the burden of proof.as the claimant,lore had the burden of proving not only that the defendant in question had knowledge of her complaints of discrimination and took materially adverse action against her,but also that that action was motivated by her complaints of discrimination.see part.above.the jury found,apparently based on its assessments of the credibility of the witnesses,that lore did not meet her burden of proving that kerwin had a retaliatory motivation.lore contention that the jury should have disbelieved kerwin testimony or weighed the evidence differently provides no basis for undoing the verdict.
lore also contends that the testimony of lee would have provided additional evidence that kerwin actions were motivated by an intent to retaliate on account of lore complaints of discrimination lore brief on appeal at.even a sound proffer in support of such a contention would not be dispositive,for the court may exclude even evidence that is relevant if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of,inter alia,unfair prejudice,or confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or wasting time.the court i s not required to allow the trial to be diverted into an inquiry into an entirely different incident involving to a significant extent different people,places and events.barrett orange county human rights commission,cir.a decision to exclude evidence following a rule balancing analysis is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.see,barrett,at perry,at.
here,judge hurd who was familiar with lee case,as he was the judge to whom it was assigned declined to allow lee,who had filed her eeoc claim in,to testify in lore case under the limited issues that are before this court regarding the allegations of retaliation back in the year tr.see also id.at.in support of her contention that this was an abuse of discretion,lore submits documents or arguments that are of doubtful utility or reliability.
first,in her main brief on appeal,she cites an affirmation by lee describing testimony that would have been elicited from lee lore brief on appeal at.however,that affirmation which is dated june,nearly three weeks after the end of lore trial,and hence was not before the district court at the time it barred lee from testifying states that lee is aware that kerwin has made statements and committed acts which reflect a bias against me and other women who filed complaints of discrimination affirmation of katherine lee dated june,the affirmation does not mention lore.nor does it specify when the events it describes took place,except to say that one incident occurred in april see id.we can not conclude that lore should have a new trial based on a document created after trial,citing experiences of lee that apparently occurred several years later than the events at issue here.
second,lore states that she and lee were women who had filed complaints of gender discrimination and both were subjected to retaliatory conduct by defendant kerwin lore reply brief on appeal at emphasis in original that the lee action was tried in march and resulted in a favorable verdict for officer lee id.and that judge hurd sustained the verdict on the basis that the evidence revealed,including defendant kerwin,retaliated against lee for opposing discrimination.see lee city of syracuse,et,cv,dkt.lore reply brief on appeal at.there is no question that both lore and lee filed complaints against kerwin containing discrimination and retaliation allegations.however,lore statement that the lee action resulted in a favorable verdict for officer lee omits the facts that that favorable verdict was only against the city,see lee city of syracuse,cv march,verdict form,and that all of lee claims against kerwin had in fact been dismissed in,see lee city of syracuse,d.further,the document cited by lore in support of the statement that judge hurd upheld the judgment in favor of lee on the basis that kerwin had retaliated against lee dkt.turns out to be a transcript of an argument before the district court in which kerwin name is nowhere mentioned.
we see no basis for reversal in the court exclusion of the testimony of lee.
request for discovery sanctions 
lore contends that the district court erred in refusing to impose discovery sanctions on defendants for what she calls repeated,multiple and flagrant abuses of the court discovery orders.lore brief on appeal at see id.at.she states that her attorney affirmation filed with the district court sets forth in detail the gross and repeated discovery violations of these defendants.id.at.however,she provides neither the date of that affirmation nor a record citation for where it can be found.
we assume that the affirmation referred to is the affirmation of bosman dated may.this affirmation accuses defendants of deceit and misrepresentations id,complaining principally a that lore made a demand in april for a list of all employees who ha d been reprimanded,counseled,or reported as having violated any and all rules of the city of syracuse police department for the immediate past three years id.internal quotation marks omitted b that d efendants persistently maintained that the request was unduly burdensome id.see id.and c that bosman had discovered in,in a different lawsuit,that d efendants in fact had such a list id.lore requested that the court punish defendants by entering a default judgment against them.
although bosman affirmation suggests that lore had been denied repeated requests for sanctions id,the affirmation gives no dates of or record citations to such requests or denials nor has any such information been provided in lore briefs on appeal.we have found in the record a letter to the magistrate judge to whom discovery matters were referred,requesting the imposition of sanctions for what even then was called a flagrant or at least cavalier disregard of a discovery order letter from bosman to magistrate judge david peebles dated january,bosman letter,at.that request was denied by endorsed order dated january,stating that the denial was without prejudice to lore right to make a sanctions motion pursuant to.
so far as we are aware,lore did not make such a motion until more than three years later,when,on may,citing evidence discovered in,she moved for a default judgment days before the start of trial.
we review a denial of a motion for rule discovery sanctions for abuse of discretion.see residential funding degeorge financial,cir perry,at,applying standard to denial of request,based on allegedly abusive discovery and vexatious tactics,for sanctions pursuant to,inter alia.and.in analyzing a district court ruling on a request for sanctions,we giv e recognition to the premise that the district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the legal standard that informs its determination as to whether sanctions are warranted.perry,at internal quotation marks omitted.
lore has called nothing to our attention that suggests that the district court denial of her motion for sanctions on the eve of trial,apparently based on information received years earlier,was an abuse of discretion.
request for additional attorneys fees 
following the district court denial of the parties posttrial motions,lore moved for an award of in attorneys fees,which included fees for bosman based on an hourly rate of.pursuant to,the district court awarded lore in fees and costs,which included fees for bosman at the hourly rate of.see lore iv,wl,at.on this appeal,lore contends that t he hourly rate no longer represents the prevailing hourly rate for experienced attorneys in the northern district lore brief on appeal at and that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to award her fees based on that rate.we disagree.
we review a district court award of attorneys fees under for abuse of discretion,see,bergerson new york state office of mental health,cir bergerson,mindful that a buse of discretion already one of the most deferential standards of review takes on special significance when reviewing fee decisions because the district court,which is intimately familiar with the nuances of the case,is in a far better position to make such decisions than is an appellate court,which must work from a cold record,mcdaniel county of schenectady,cir other internal quotation marks omitted.
in bergerson which involved a trial before judge hurd of title vii and hrl claims brought by a plaintiff represented at trial by the same attorney who represents lore the successful plaintiff requested a fee award based on an hourly rate of.the district court made its fee award on the basis of an hourly rate of.see at.we affirmed,stating in part as follows 
here,the district court,quoting picinich united parcel,cv,wl,at,found that t he prevailing hourly rates in this district,which are what a reasonable,paying client would be willing to pay,are per hour for an experienced attorney,per hour for an attorney with more than four years experience,per hour for an attorney with less than four years experience,and per hour for paralegals.the study upon which picinich ultimately relies was undertaken by a district court in the northern district in.see arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,cv,wl,at.since that time,more recent surveys in northern district cases have indicated that,for a civil rights matter,the prevailing rate in the northern district is higher than.see,luessenhop clinton county,d,martinez thompson,cv,wl,at.
in other cases,however,courts in the northern district have continued to apply the rates set forth in arbor hill.see,lewis city of albany police,d,paramount pictures hopkins,cv,wl,at.given that these courts have continued to adhere to the rates set forth in arbor hill,the district court award of attorney fees at per hour is located within the range of permissible decisions and does not rest on an erroneous view of the law.see sims,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus because our review is for abuse of discretion,we hold that the district court award,while perhaps lagging behind the market,was not an abuse of the court discretion.
bergerson,at emphasis added.
in the present case,the district court fee decision,rendered before its decision in bergerson,relied on essentially the same authorities to reach the same decision,to wit,that 
t he prevailing hourly rates in this district,which are what a reasonable,paying client would be willing to pay,are per hour for an experienced attorney,per hour for an attorney with more than four years experience picinich,wl,at.
lore iv,wl,at.we can not conclude that the district court calculation of fees here,using the same analysis it would thereafter use in bergerson,applying the same hourly rate for the same attorney in the same type of case tried shortly before bergerson,was an abuse of discretion.
iv.the parties contentions with respect to the amount of damages to which lore is entitled 
not surprisingly,the parties have widely differing views as to the amount of damages to which lore is entitled.as alternatives to its requests for judgment as a matter of law,the city contends that this court should overturn the district court denials of its requests to a reduce the jury award of against the city for reputational damages to as nominal damages,on the ground that lore failed to prove any damage to her reputation,and b grant a new trial as to lore emotional distress damages unless lore accepts a remittitur of the award to,on the ground that the jury award of against the city for emotional distress is excessive.
lore,in opposition,contends that not only is she entitled to the the jury awarded her against the city,but that she is entitled to an additional against guy and the city because the jury awarded her that amount for the retaliatory conduct of guy.she thus seeks judgment awarding her compensatory damages totaling,and she seeks a trial on her summarily dismissed hrl claims for discrimination.we can not agree with either side,for we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the city request for an order of remittitur,but we reach that conclusion largely in light of the intertwined nature of lore claims against the city and guy,and we can not conclude that such interrelated conduct warrants the doubling of an already generous award.
it is well established that the trial judge enjoys discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict appears to the judge to be against the weight of the evidence,and that t his discretion includes overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new trial without qualification,or conditioned on the verdict winner refusal to agree to a reduction remittitur.gasperini center for humanities,internal quotation marks omitted.a conditional order of remittitur,requiring a plaintiff to choose either a new trial or a reduced verdict,may be granted where,inter alia,the award is intrinsically excessive in the sense of being greater than the amount a reasonable jury could have awarded,although the surplus can not be ascribed to a particular,quantifiable error.shu tao lin mcdonnell douglas,cir internal quotation marks omitted see kirsch fleet street,at.where there is no particular discernable error,we have generally held that a jury damage award may not be set aside as excessive unless the award is so high as to shock the judicial conscience and constitute a denial of justice.id.quoting krzeminski,cir other internal quotation marks omitted.under new york law,which is pertinent to the extent that lore was found entitled to recover under the hrl,see,gasperini,at,an award is deemed excessive if it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation,c.
in the present case,the district court denied the city posttrial motion for a conditional remittitur,stating that,b ased upon evidence at trial,the jury award of compensatory damages was fair and reasonable,and did not shock the conscience.lore iii,wl,at.we review that determination for abuse of discretion,see,gasperini,at,taking into account amounts awarded in other,comparable cases,see,disorbo hoy,cir,and we will not vacate or reduce a jury award merely because we would have granted a lesser amount of damages,nairn national passenger,cir.
neither cases arising under federal law nor those arising under state law provide a clear line as to whether an award of for emotional distress on the basis of a trial record such as that created in the present case deviates so materially from what would be reasonable compensation as to shock the judicial conscience.this court has,however,affirmed awards of each to plaintiffs for emotional distress resulting from age discrimination where the evidence of emotional distress consisted only of testimony establishing shock,nightmares,sleeplessness,humiliation,and other subjective distress,as well as awards of each where in addition there were either physical sequelae,secondary physical results or consequences or professional treatment,meacham knolls atomic power laboratory,cir meacham,vacated and remanded for further consideration on other grounds,see id.at.in meacham,in which the emotional distress damages were awarded under the hrl,we rejected the defendant contention that those damage awards,for garden variety emotional distress claims,should have been reduced to between and,id.at.we observed that
