petitioners worklis luna and tasmann anthony thompson have filed petitions for review of final orders of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals bia.the government has moved to dismiss the petitions as untimely.petitioners luna and thompson concede that their petitions are untimely,but allege that circumstances beyond their assistance of counsel and circumstances created by the government,them from filing timely petitions for review.
section b of title of the united states code requires that a petition for review must be filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal.this filing requirement is jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling.mukasey,cir citing malvosin ins,cir.prior to,an alien who missed the deadline could still file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.see luya liu ins,cir citing ins cyr.after the enactment of the real id act,a,stat.may,however,a petition for review became the exclusive means available for challenging a final order of removal.a,b.in,we held that the provisions of the real id act eliminating habeas jurisdiction over final orders of removal,combined with the deadline,did not facially violate the suspension clause of the constitution.at.

background 
luna holder,
in december,luna,a native and citizen of the dominican republic,was charged in a notice to appear with removability pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina section a b i,based on his conviction for a controlled substance violation,and section a a iii,based on his conviction for an aggravated felony.in a hearing before an immigration judge ij in napanoch,new york,luna,appearing pro se,argued that he was a united states citizen based on his father naturalization.in may,the ij determined that luna had not derived citizenship from his father,that his removability had been established by clear and convincing evidence,that he was statutorily ineligible for various forms of relief,and that he had not established a prima facie claim for deferral of removal under the convention against torture.accordingly,the ij ordered luna removed to the dominican republic.through counsel,luna appealed to the bia,arguing that the ij should have terminated his removal proceedings pending a decision on a motion to vacate his criminal conviction in state court.by an order issued july,the bia dismissed luna appeal.
on september,luna,pro se and detained at the buffalo federal detention facility in batavia,new york,filed a petition for review of the bia decision.luna sought an enlargement of time to file a petition for review because of his attorney neglect,sudden loss of interest,and giving luna the false impression that he would submit all the necessary papers and continue to represent luna.that same month,the government moved to dismiss the petition for review,noting that the petition had been filed sixteen days after the expiration of the filing period prescribed by b.in october,luna responded to the motion,explaining that his former attorney had sent a letter not to luna,but to his mother.the attorney letter,which luna attached to his opposition papers,stated that he did not believe that he could make any arguments in a petition for review that would warrant reversal of the bia decision and informed luna that the deadline for filing a petition for review was august.luna asserted that he should have been notified by counsel at his place of detention to make sure that luna received the correspondence in a timely manner,which would have allow ed him to file his petition within the filing deadline.
ii.thompson holder,
in september,thompson,a native and citizen of jamaica,was charged in a notice to appear with removability pursuant to ina section a a ii,based on his convictions for two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,and section a a iii,based on his conviction for an aggravated felony.thompson,appearing pro se before an ij in hartford,connecticut,filed no applications for relief.in january,the ij found him removable on the aggravated felony charge and ordered him removed to jamaica.thompson appealed to the bia,asserting that he was denied his right to counsel and that he was innocent of the crimes underlying his convictions the bia dismissed his appeal on april.in august,the bia denied thompson motion for a stay of removal pending a motion to reopen to seek cat relief,concluding that there was little likelihood the motion would be granted.on september,the bia denied thompson motion to reopen.
on october,thompson filed a motion asking for time to appeal,which was docketed in this court as a petition for review the construed petition challenged the bia april,order.thompson explained,inter alia,that he had been detained in the wyatt detention facility in central falls,rhode island,since june and that he was unable to get his legal documents at this facility.its sic prohibited.the government subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the petition for review as untimely

discussion 
the suspension clause of the constitution provides that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.const.art.i,cl.because of that clause,some judicial intervention in deportation cases is unquestionably required by the constitution.cyr,at internal quotation marks omitted.however,the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,at quoting swain pressley,boumediene bush,t he question becomes whether the statute stripping jurisdiction to issue the writ avoids the suspension clause mandate because congress has provided adequate substitute procedures for habeas corpus.
in the immigration context,congress has long sought to limit habeas review while at the same time ensuring that aliens have an alternate forum in which to seek review of final orders of removal.prior to,an alien could challenge a removal order either in a petition for review filed in the court of appeals or in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.see,at.in,congress enacted the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa and the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act iirira,both of which amended the jurisdictional provisions of the ina,et.section of aedpa,entitled elimination of custody review by habeas corpus,repealed,inter alia,a,which had provided that any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings.section a of iirira provided that final orders of removal would be subject to judicial review pursuant to the procedure governing review of final agency orders in.see a.section b contained a consolidation provision known as a zipper clause,reno,which consolidated all j udicial review of all questions of law and fact arising from removal proceedings into one action in the court of appeals.b.finally,iirira eliminated judicial review of final orders of removal against aliens convicted of certain criminal offenses.a c.
in ins cyr,the supreme court,relying on the longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction,at,held that neither aedpa nor iirira had eliminated habeas corpus review over final orders of removal under,id.at.while section of aedpa had repealed the grant of habeas jurisdiction in a,n either the title nor the text of section makes any mention of.id.at.likewise,the court concluded that the provisions limiting judicial review in section of iirira did not represent a clear and unambiguous repeal of habeas jurisdiction,reasoning that i n the immigration context,judicial review and habeas corpus have historically distinct meanings.id.at.the court noted that if it were clear that criminal alien subject to the provision in a c could raise his claims in another forum,it might be persuaded to interpret the zipper clause in b as precluding habeas review.but the absence of such a forum,coupled with the lack of a clear,unambiguous,and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas of such an important question of law,strongly counsels against adopting a construction that would raise serious constitutional questions.id.at 
in response to the supreme court decision in cyr,congress passed the real id act,which amended various subsections of to explicitly preclude habeas review under.at the same time,to avoid the serious constitutional questions identified by the supreme court in cyr,congress restored judicial review in the courts of appeals over constitutional claims or questions of law for all aliens,including criminal aliens who had been barred from seeking judicial review under iirira.a d.
after the real id act,it is now clear that a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with is the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal,id.a,and that habeas review is no longer available for claims arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states,id.b.in,we held that the real id act did not,on its face,violate the suspension clause because congress had provided an adequate and effective substitute for habeas review in the form of a petition for review,and that the filing period gave an alien a reasonable opportunity to seek review of a final order of removal.at.
here,however,we are faced with a different situation than in.petitioners could not have raised their claims regarding the timeliness of their petitions before the bia because their claims arose after the entry of the final orders of removal.nor could they have raised such claims in a timely petition in this court because they only arose upon the expiration of the period within which they could have filed a timely petition for review.thus,if the real id act is interpreted as precluding habeas review over petitioners claims,there is no forum in which petitioners could seek relief 
moreover,petitioners raise precisely the type of constitutional claims for which habeas review,or an adequate and effective substitute,is most essential.an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a constitutional claim that arises under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.omar mukasey,cir.likewise,a claim that the government prevented a petitioner from filing a timely petition for review calls into question whether the government has provided an adequate and effective substitute under the suspension clause and,therefore,whether there has been a suspension of the writ.see boumediene.at holding that the writ must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain bounds smith,t he state and its officers may not abridge or impair petitioner right to apply to a federal court for a writ of habeas corpus.quoting ex parte hull.if petitioners lack a forum in which to raise such claims,then we are confronted squarely with the serious constitutional questions raised by the supreme court in cyr.at.
we are mindful of the supreme court admonition in cyr that if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is fairly possible,we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problems.id.here,the question is whether petitioners claims that circumstances beyond their control prevented them from filing timely petitions for review can be accurately described as arising from their removal proceedings,b,or whether such claims may still be brought in a petition under.if a petition for review is the sole and exclusive means for petitioners to make their claims regarding the timeliness of their petitions for review,and if we are jurisdictionally barred from considering such claims because of the filing requirement,then we would have to decide whether the deadline,as applied to petitioners,would constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.because we conclude that the real id act can be construed to preserve habeas jurisdiction over petitioners claims,however,we need not decide that question.
we begin our statutory analysis with the text of the statute itself.united states nelson,cir.section a of title of the united states code,as amended by the real id act,provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter,except as provided in subsection e of this section.
section b states 
judicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.except as otherwise provided in this section,no court shall have jurisdiction,by habeas corpus under section of title or any other habeas corpus provision,by section or of such title,or by any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.
the aclu urges us to read these provisions as applying only to review of final orders of removal and not to collateral issues such as those presented by petitioners.we agree that petitioners claims regarding the timeliness of their petitions can not be characterized as a challenge to an order of removal under section a.the claims did not arise until after their orders of removal became final and could not have been raised before the bia,nor would review of such claims require any inquiry into the validity of the removal orders or the agency actions in ordering petitioners removal.
section b contains somewhat broader language,applying to any claim arising from petitioners removal proceedings.if we were to adopt an expansive interpretation of this provision,petitioners claims would fall within its scope.petitioners claims arise from their removal proceedings in the sense that if petitioners had never been placed in removal proceedings,they would not have sought review in this court,and we would not be confronted with questions regarding the timeli
