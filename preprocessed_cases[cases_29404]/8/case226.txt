on july,marcia liu filed a complaint in federal district court in massachusetts charging amerco,and its wholly owned subsidiary u haul international,collectively u haul with violating massachusetts general laws ch.the complaint asserted that u haul had engaged in what was in substance an attempted scheme and the complaint sought damages on behalf of both liu and a large class of persons who rented u haul vehicles for certain trips within a specified period.
ordinarily,when a seller of goods or services attempts to fix prices with a competitor but fails in that endeavor,no consumer is damaged but liu complaint alleged peculiar facts not uncovered by liu but recounted in documents stemming from an investigation by the federal trade commission ftc the documents included the summary of a proposed consent order between u haul and the agency made public in the month before liu filed her own law suit.federal trade commission,u haul int l,and amerco,june,hereinafter ftc summary.
according to the ftc complaint and the summary of the proposed consent order,in edward shoen the chairman and president of amerco and the chairman and chief executive officer of u haul planned and took steps to implement a scheme to collude with u haul major competitors avis budget group,budget and penske truck leasing,penske to raise prices in the market for truck rentals.as summarized by the ftc,the initial strategy was straightforward 
shoen instructed u haul regional managers to raise rates for truck rentals,and then contact budget to inform budget of u haul conditional rate increase and encourage budget to follow,or u haul rates would be reduced to the original level.
at about the same time,shoen also instructed local u haul dealers to communicate with their counterparts at budget and penske,with the purpose of the message that u haul had raised its rates,and competitors rates should be raised to match the increased u haul rates.

according to the ftc,this plan was communicated to u haul regional managers and local dealers in memoranda sent by shoen in october and november of the memoranda even included suggested talking points for managers making calls to competitors.the ftc recounted evidence from a u haul regional manager in tampa,florida,who corroborated the existence of the memoranda,confirmed that he acted in conformity with the plan as described,and wrote a email to u haul senior executives describing his actions to implement the plan.in re u haul int l,wl,at.
the ftc also set forth comments made by shoen during an earnings conference call with analysts that took place on february.shoen was allegedly aware that budget would monitor the call,so he announced u haul unilateral price increase and said that u haul would keep its prices at the elevated level if budget responded in kind with rates that were within to percent of u haul the ftc made no findings as to the consequences of the direct or indirect attempts,concluding that the overtures were unlawful regardless of whether the parties reached and successfully implemented an agreement to collude on prices.ftc summary.at.
the ftc concluded that u haul particularly egregious conduct,ftc summary.at,violated section of the federal trade commission act ftc act,a,which forbids u nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce,and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.the proposed consent order provided injunctive relief designed to prevent u haul from inviting collusion and from entering into or implementing a collusive scheme.ftc summary.at.u haul consented to the relief sought,but did not admit either to the conduct or to the violation.in re u haul int l,wl,at.
liu suit was a action brought after a proposed government consent decree fairly common in antitrust cases but,as the ftc act contains no private right of action and the sherman act which does create such a right is of doubtful application to a failed attempt to conspire on prices,see note,below,liu suit rested instead on chapter.chapter,like section,prohibits u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.laws ch,a,but also provides a right of action to consumers and permits class actions.id.
liu alleged that u haul intentional and purposeful anticompetitive acts pertinently,the invitations to collude and u haul price increases incident to those invitations caused her to pay at least percent more for two truck rentals than she would have absent u haul unlawful action.chapter is limited to transactions connected to massachusetts,b liu proposed class included a ll persons who purchased truck rentals from u haul for transportation to,from or within massachusetts between september and september.
u haul filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.b,which the district court granted in a short written opinion.the district court assumed arguendo that an invitation to collude was actionable under chapter but it found that liu had failed plausibly to allege injury,noting that she had failed to set forth any facts about her own transactions,such as what she paid or what available competitors rates were at the time.liu amerco,slip op.at.
liu has now appealed,contending that her complaint did set forth a claim under chapter and that it adequately alleged injury and should have survived the motion to dismiss.both issues raise questions of law that are reviewed de novo.poirier.dep t of,cir united states troy,cir.but we begin by noting sua sponte,as we are required to do,an unaddressed question as to the district court subject matter jurisdiction.
diversity of citizenship exists between liu and the defendants,but there is no likelihood that damages for her two rentals would meet the ordinary requirement for diversity cases that the amount in controversy exceed.a.however,the class action fairness act of,d,provides an alternative basis for jurisdiction so long as minimal diversity exists as it does here and the amount in controversy for aggregated claims of the whole class exceeds million.id.
liu has limited her class to rentals to,from or within massachusetts during the period in which u haul prices were allegedly elevated.questioned by the court at argument,liu contended that the minimum statutory damages under chapter per incident which could potentially be trebled under that statute to.laws ch,would exceed the minimum million figure given the thousands of u haul rentals to,from and within massachusetts that would likely be encompassed by the two year period 
given the good faith representations by liu counsel,which have not been challenged,see coventry sewage assocs.dworkin realty,cir,we find the jurisdiction to exist.further,the statutory damages are merely a minimum under chapter conceivably some of the class member rentals were for larger sums and the percent estimate of damages was seemingly a floor figure rather than a ceiling.it is not clear to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy is less than million.id.at.so we proceed to the merits.
the district court dismissal rested solely on the lack of an adequate allegation of harm the full,albeit brief,holding is quoted below but defendants,while agreeing with the court that injury was inadequately alleged,also suggest that the allegations of wrongdoing fail to state a cognizable claim under chapter.we decide both issues in the interest of judicial economy,see new hampshire motor transp.ass flynn,cir breyer,and begin with the question of whether the alleged acts violate chapter.
as alleged in the complaint,u haul is the largest provider of truck rentals with about percent of the market budget is their largest competitor,bringing their joint share to about percent.but market size and definition would not matter under the antitrust laws if u haul alleged proposal to fix prices had been accepted u haul and budget compete in truck rentals,and price fixing is a per se offense,united states socony vacuum oil,entailing both criminal and civil liability under section of the sherman act.
section of the sherman act,however,does not condemn an attempt to conspire nor a solicitation to conspire,compa
