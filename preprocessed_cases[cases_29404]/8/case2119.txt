this litigation is the latest of many legal battles stemming from perhaps history worst industrial catastrophe the toxic gas disaster at a chemical plant in bhopal,india.earlier actions included scores of individual and complaints filed in federal courts throughout the united states and consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.those claims were dismissed in deference to the indian government efforts on behalf of disaster victims to pursue a global resolution in india of claims related to the disaster.the ensuing litigation in india eventually produced a settlement agreement,which gained the final approval of the supreme court of india in.
the present action is in part an effort to obtain further redress for the bhopal disaster in united states courts.the plaintiffs assert that they are victims of the disaster,their,and groups representing victims.the defendants are union carbide corporation union carbide and its former chief executive officer,warren anderson.at the time of the disaster,union carbide was the majority owner of union carbide india limited ucil,which owned and operated the bhopal plant.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants conduct leading up to the disaster violated various norms of international law,and seek relief under the alien tort claims act,the atca 
we hold that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine,which the plaintiffs argue bars the defendants from asserting defenses or dispositive motions based upon indian law,is inapplicable to this case.and we hold that these claims are barred by the indian settlement,which encompasses all civil claims related to the disaster.
the plaintiffs also raise several claims seeking relief for environmental contamination at the bhopal plant allegedly unrelated to the gas leak.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs entire complaint without directly addressing these claims.we vacate and remand the district court order insofar as it granted summary judgment to the defendants on the additional environmental claims in order to permit the court to address them in the first instance.
background 
on the night of december,the ucil bhopal chemical plant leaked a large quantity of methyl isocyanate,a highly toxic gas,into the city of bhopal,state of madhya pradesh,union of india.winds blew the gas into densely populated neighborhoods,resulting in thousands of deaths and more than two hundred thousand injuries.see in re union carbide.gas plant disaster at bhopal,india,bhopal i.
shortly after the disaster,victims and their relatives began to seek recovery from union carbide in united states courts.on february,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation assigned purported class actions that had been filed in federal courts throughout the country to the southern district of new york.see id.a consolidated complaint was filed in that court on june.
on march,india adopted the bhopal gas leak disaster processing of claims act the bhopal act.that statute purported to give the indian government the exclusive authority to represent victims of the bhopal disaster in courts around the world.individual victims and groups of victims,including several of the plaintiffs in this case,later challenged the validity of the bhopal act under the indian constitution.the supreme court of india upheld the act.see sahu union of india,sahu.
on april,meanwhile,the indian government,acting pursuant to its authority under the bhopal act,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of all victims of the disaster.in may,the district court john keenan,judge dismissed the consolidated action,but made the dismissal contingent upon,among other things,union carbide submission to the jurisdiction of indian courts.see bhopal i.at.we affirmed in in re union carbide.gas plant disaster at bhopal,india,cir,cert.denied,d.
in september,the indian government filed suit against union carbide in bhopal district court.independently of that action,in november,india central bureau of investigation filed criminal charges against,among others,ucil,union carbide,and warren anderson,alleging culpable homicide,grievous hurt,and causing death by use of a dangerous instrumentality.
litigation in the civil suit proceeded for more than two years,during the course of which jurisdiction passed to the supreme court of india.acting pursuant to article of the indian constitution,which enables the supreme court to fashion settlements in some circumstances the court issued two orders,one dated february,the other dated the following day together,the settlement orders,which,among other things,memorialized the terms of a settlement agreement among the parties.see union carbide union of india,union of india i.the february,settlement order required union carbide to pay million to the indian government in full settlement of all claims,rights and liabilities related to and arising out of the bhopal gas disaster,and stated that all civil proceedings related to the disaster shall stand concluded in terms of the settlement.id.at.the february,settlement order reduced union carbide share of the liability by million to million and required ucil,instead,to pay that million.see id.
the settlement orders also quashed all related criminal proceedings.id.among the contested issues on appeal is whether this aspect of the orders constituted a term of the preliminary settlement or was an independent ruling by the supreme court of india.
the supreme court of india later rejected a challenge to the validity of the settlement orders.see union carbide union of india,union of india ii.the court affirmed its jurisdiction under the indian constitution to fashion the relief contained in those orders and concluded that the settlement was just and reasonable.the court modified the orders in one important respect,however.it overruled the portion of the order quashing additional criminal proceedings and ordered the criminal prosecution of union carbide,anderson,and others to proceed.id.at.
the criminal prosecution thereafter went forward in bhopal district court.neither anderson nor union carbide appeared for arraignment or any other proceedings in connection with that prosecution.in,the bhopal district court declared them absconders and ordered the attachment of union carbide remaining assets in india.
on the civil front,meanwhile,in two purported classes of plaintiffs filed new complaints related to the bhopal disaster in texas state courts.the complaints,among other things,challenged the validity of the settlement orders.union carbide removed the actions to two federal district courts in texas,and the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation then transferred the cases to the southern district of new york,where they too were assigned to judge keenan.that court dismissed the complaints,as it had the government of india,on forum non conveniens grounds.see in re union carbide.gas plant disaster,no.mdl,wl,dist.lexis.
we affirmed,although on different grounds.see bi union carbide chems.and plastics,cir,cert.denied,d.we held that the plaintiffs lacked standing in light of the bhopal act delegation to the indian government of the exclusive right to represent the victims.id.at.
the plaintiffs initiated the present action in the southern district of new york in november and filed an amended complaint in january.the amended complaint asserts fifteen claims falling into three broad categories.counts one through six collectively the atca claims seek civil damages under the atca to compensate for dangers caused by the gas leak disaster itself,and allege violations of various purported international norms of environmental,criminal,and human rights law.counts seven and eight seek judgments of civil contempt and fraud in connection with union carbide alleged failure to honor the conditions under which the southern district of new york dismissed the consolidated class actions in bhopal counts nine through fifteen collectively the additional environmental claims seek monetary and equitable relief under various theories for environmental harms allegedly attributable to the ucil plant in bhopal but not related to the gas leak disaster.this case,too,was assigned to judge keenan.
union carbide and anderson filed motions to dismiss pursuant to.b or for summary judgment pursuant to,and for an order denying class certification pursuant to fed civ.c.the plaintiffs responded with to strike the defendants dispositive motions and affirmative defenses pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.
in an order dated august,the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss in their entirety and denied the plaintiffs.see bano union carbide,civ.jfk,wl,dist.lexis.the court concluded that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine does not prevent the defendants from defending this action that the bhopal act deprives the plaintiffs of standing to maintain claims related to the bhopal disaster and in the alternative,that the settlement orders,as modified by the supreme court of india,bar all claims related to the disaster.without specifically addressing the additional environmental claims,the court ordered the entire case closed and removed from the docket.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
fugitive disentitlement doctrine 
we begin by affirming the district court denial of the plaintiffs based on the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.the plaintiffs contended in their original that the defendants,although present before the district court,are fugitives from criminal prosecution in india,and should therefore be barred from calling upon the resources of the district court to determine their motion s.notice of pls.cross mot.to strike dated,at.on appeal,the plaintiffs characterize their motions not as seeking to bar the defendants from appearing or raising any defense in this action on forum non conveniens grounds,but only as seeking to prevent defendants from invok ing in their defense the law and judicial processes of the very jurisdiction whose law they have flouted by fleeing prosecution.appellants reply br.at.
the law of fugitive disentitlement,enabling courts to refuse to hear assertions made on behalf of fugitives from justice because of their fugitive status,is based on the inherent power of federal courts to protect their proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging their traditional responsibilities.degen united states,d.we have applied the doctrine to dismiss appeals in both criminal and a variety of civil cases and proceedings.empire blue cross blue shield finkelstein,cir collecting cases.
we review a district court determination whether to apply the fugitive disentitlement doctrine for abuse of discretion.united states morgan,cir per curiam.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion because it correctly concluded that the doctrine is inapplicable here.
we have articulated four rationales for applying the fugitive disentitlement doctrine assuring the enforceability of any decision that may be rendered against the fugitive imposing a penalty for flouting the judicial process discouraging flights from justice and promoting the efficient operation of the courts and avoiding prejudice to the other side caused by the defendant escape.finkelstein,at citing united states dep t of justice,cir.no case has been called to our attention,and we have found none ourselves,in which the doctrine was applied by a court of the jurisdiction to which,rather than from which,the alleged fugitive had fled.that is not surprising.because the purpose of the doctrine is to allow courts to protect their proceedings and judgments,degen,at,a court will ordinarily employ it only to ensure the enforceability of its decisions to discourage flouting its process to discourage flights from its administration of justice or to avoid prejudice to the other side affecting litigation that is or may be before it 
the supreme court decision in united states,d,is instructive.there,a convicted criminal had fled the jurisdiction of a federal district court and been sentenced in absentia as a result.he was then recaptured and appealed his sentence.the court of appeals dismissed his appeal under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.the supreme court reversed,holding that disentitlement was improper because the defendant was in custody during the course of his appeal.the court rejected the faulty premise that any act of judicial defiance,whether or not it affects the appellate process,is punishable by appellate dismissal.id.at.rather,the court held,disentitlement is justified only where there is some connection between fugitive status and the fugitive appeal.id.at.morgan,at noting that disentitlement requires a sufficient nexus exists between the defendant fugitive status and the proceeding in which disentitlement is sought citing,at.because the defendant in had flouted the authority of the district court,not the court of appeals,it was the district court that had the authority to defend its own dignity,by sanctioning an act of defiance that occurred solely within its domain.at.the court of appeals thus did not have the power to dismiss the action in aid of the dignity of the district court,from which the defendant had fled,at least where the defendant former fugitive status had no material impact on the proceeding in the court in which disentitlement was sought.see also degen,at.holding that defendant flight from criminal prosecution did not justify disentitlement in related civil proceeding absent any impact on the course of such proceeding or the enforceability of any judgment therein.
here,similarly,there is no basis for a finding that the act of judicial defiance,the defendants absconding from india,affects the process of the district court,at.there is no question about the enforceability of any judgment the district court may render against the defendants the defendants alleged flight from justice has imposed no discernible prejudice upon the plaintiffs in this proceeding and the defendants are not alleged to have fled the jurisdiction of any court with jurisdiction over this action.there is therefore an insufficient nexus between the defendants alleged fugitive status and the proceedings in the district court to support the court use of fugitive disentitlement to deprive the defendants of their full right to appear in and defend this action.
of course,the courts of india and the indian government may have a legitimate interest in preventing or responding to the flight of the defendants and others from india and the jurisdiction of its courts.but,to paraphrase,the defendants at most flouted the authority of the courts of india,not the southern district of new york.it is the courts of india augmented perhaps by the powers of the indian government under,inter alia,treaties with the united states,not the united states district court for the southern district of new york,that would have the authority in this case to defend their own dignity by sanctioning the defendants alleged acts of defiance,which occurred solely within their domain.the district court was correct in recognizing that it had no authority to protect the dignity,efficiency,or efficacy of the courts of india by employing a doctrine that arises out of the court power to protect its own dignity,efficiency,and efficacy.
ii.the atca claims 
the defendants sought dismissal of the atca claims on three grounds that they were fully litigated and settled in india that the bhopal act deprived the plaintiffs of standing to seek remedies for the disaster and that the complaint failed to allege a violation of norms of international law as required under the atca.because we agree with the first contention,we need not reach the latter two.
the settlement orders,as modified by the supreme court of india,were meant finally to dispose of all claims arising out of,related to or connected with the bhopal gas leak disaster.union of india i,at see also union of india ii,at affirming the relevant aspects of the settlement orders.on its face,then,the settlement appears plainly to cover the plaintiffs atca claims.
the plaintiffs do not contest the validity of the settlement do not contend that india did not have the right to represent the bhopal disaster claimants or that the settlement was not entered into in good faith or was a sham or fraudulent in any way.nor do the plaintiffs assert that the orders should not be given effect in united states courts.they argue instead that the settlement does not bar their atca claims.first,they assert that those claims seek civil remedies pertaining to the defendants unaddressed criminal liability and thus fall outside the ambit of the settlement.second,they contend that the defendants materially breached the settlement agreement,which therefore has no preclusive effect in this case.
civil liability for criminal acts.
in arguing that their atca claims fall outside the ambit of the settlement,the plaintiffs rely principally on language from the supreme court of india decision in sahu,which upheld the constitutionality of the bhopal act.the court stated that while the bhopal act appointed the indian government as the exclusive representative of bhopal victims in civil actions,it did not curtail any right with respect to any criminal liability or deal with claims or rights arising out of such criminal li a bility.sahu,at.the plaintiffs interpret this language to mean that the indian government was not empowered by the bhopal act to litigate claims arising out of such criminal li a bility,and thus the settlement does not encompass such claims.id.and because the atca claims are based on the defendants criminal liability under international law,those claims are not barred by the settlement.appellants br.at.
we disagree.we understand the claims arising out of such criminal li a bility left open in sahu to be the rights under indian criminal law of victims of criminal misconduct to obtain restitution from the wrongdoer.as part of a criminal sentence,an indian court may order a defendant to pay a fine in the form of payment to any person of compensation for any loss or injury caused by the offence,when compensation is,in the opinion of the court,recoverable by such person in a civil court.indian code crim.proc.b.in fact,the bhopal district court has granted some of the group plaintiffs in this case standing to act as intervenors assisting the prosecution in the criminal proceedings against the defendants,based in part on their interest in obtaining such restitution.
in other words,the portion of sahu on which the plaintiffs rely holds only that the bhopal act,and thus the settlement,does not prevent disaster victims from receiving their share of restitution imposed as a criminal penalty.but such claims arising out of such criminal li a bility are not the atca claims being asserted in this case.the atca confers upon the district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.emphasis added.thus,the right retained by the bhopal victims to pursue restitution under indian criminal procedure law can hardly be said to encompass a right to pursue civil remedies under the atca for violations of international law.
on the contrary,the bhopal act and the settlement orders make it clear that the settlement precludes the sort of claims brought by the plaintiffs under the atca.section of the act grants the indian government the exclusive right to represent the disaster victims in all claim s related to the disaster section b i of the act broadly defines the term claim to include claims arising out of,or connected with,the disaster,for compensation or damages for any loss of life or personal injury which has been,or is likely to be,suffered.in sahu,the supreme court of india interpreted this provision to reach all claims for damages due to loss of life or personal injury related to the disaster.at emphasis added.sahu further characterized the act use of the expression claim for all purposes as categorical and clear.id.at emphasis added.
the language of the settlement is equally broad.the settlement orders were meant 
finally to dispose of all past,present and future claims,causes of action and civil and criminal proceedings of any nature whatsoever wherever pending by all india citizens and all public and private entities with respect to all past,present and future deaths,personal injuries,health effects,compensation,losses,damages and civil and criminal complaints of any nature whatsoever arising out of,relating to or connected with the bhopal gas leak disaster 
union of india i,at.the supreme court of india subsequently revised this order by allowing the criminal prosecution to go forward.see union of india ii,at.crucially,however,it otherwise left the settlement orders undisturbed.id.
we note,finally,that it is axiomatic that the law encourages settlement of disputes.see,williams first bank.compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts anita founds.ilgwu ret.fund,cir courts are wary of disturbing settlements,because they represent compromise and conservation of judicial resources,two concepts highly regarded in american jurisprudence.gavoni dobbs house,cir explaining that financial and judicial economy are at the core of,which governs proceedings manko united states,cir noting that t he primary purpose of,which provides that certain evidence of settlement offers and negotiations is inadmissible,is the promotion of the public policy favoring the compromise and settlement of disputes that would otherwise be discouraged with the admission of such evidence.internal quotation marks omitted.the public interest in amicable resolution of cases is particularly strong in the context of mass tort and similar litigation.see in re exxon valdez,cir t he general policy of federal courts to promote settlement before trial is even stronger in the context of class actions.in re general motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir noting the urgency of the public policy favoring settlements in complex actions that consume substantial judicial resources and present unusually large risks for the litigants.
union carbide bargained finally to dispose of all claims arising out of,relating to or concerned with the bhopal gas leak disaster.union of india i,at.were we to allow the plaintiffs action against the defendants to proceed without clearer proof that it is not covered by the settlement agreement,we would not only fail to vindicate the reasonable expectations of union carbide,but we would also risk undermining the ability of defendants generally to gauge in advance the finality of settlements,and might thereby jeopardize the effective and efficient settlement of future claims arising from other disasters.
union carbide alleged breaches.
the plaintiffs next contend that the settlement can have no preclusive effect in this case because union carbide materially breached it by refusing to submit to criminal prosecution and failing to pay for a new hospital in bhopal.again we disagree.
criminal prosecution.in addition to disposing of all civil claims related to the disaster,the settlement orders directed that all criminal proceedings related to and arising out of the disaster shall stand quashed.union of india i,at see also id.at.in union of india ii,the supreme court of india revisited the issue of criminal prosecution.the court left the settlement orders undisturbed as to the terms of settlement but reversed its prior position with respect to criminal prosecution,holding that the quashing of the criminal proceedings was not justified.the criminal proceedings are,accordingly,directed to be proceeded with.id.at.
we understand the plaintiffs to make the following argument union carbide provisionally agreed in to settle the civil claims against it in part in reliance on the indian government offer to quash the criminal prosecution as part of the settlement.the supreme court later struck down that provision of the settlement agreement in union of india ii and effectively fashioned a new settlement,a mandatory term of which was that the criminal prosecution would proceed against union carbide.the court then gave union carbide a chance to reject the new terms and withdraw from the settlement.having declined this invitation,union carbide implicitly acceded to the revised terms including the requirement that it appear in the criminal proceedings.t
