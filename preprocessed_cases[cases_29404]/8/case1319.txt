the defendants ly usa,coco usa,marco leather goods,chong lam,and joyce chan appeal from judgments entered september,and october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alvin hellerstein,judge granting summary judgment to the plaintiff louis vuitton malletier louis vuitton or vuitton on its claims of trademark counterfeiting and infringement,and awarding vuitton statutory damages in the amount of million,and more than in attorney fees and costs.
the defendants appeal from five separate decisions of the district court the grant of summary judgment on the trademark counterfeiting and infringement claims the award of statutory damages the denial of the defendants motion to adjourn oral argument to permit the defendants to examine purportedly new evidence the denial of the defendants motion to stay the proceeding pending the outcome of a related criminal proceeding and the grant of attorney fees in addition to statutory damages.we affirm the judgment of the district court on the first three of these issues by a summary order filed today.this opinion addresses only the denial of the motion for a stay and the award of attorney fees.
the defendants argue that the district court erred in denying the requested stay because the court did not give sufficient weight to the consequent impairment of the indicted defendants fifth amendment privilege against,and because it failed to consider the practical difficulties attendant on defending simultaneous criminal and civil proceedings.the defendants also contend that the district court lacked a statutory basis for awarding attorney fees because louis vuitton had elected to recover statutory damages,rather than actual damages,under the lanham act,and that in any event the attorney fees were excessive.
we disagree with the contentions of the defendants.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the stay.we also conclude that a plaintiff electing statutory damages pursuant to c may recover attorney fees pursuant to a,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion either in awarding attorney fees and costs in this case or in determining their amount.
background 
this case is about an alleged trademark counterfeiting operation conducted by the defendants lam and chan and several companies that they either controlled or were otherwise associated with.it involved the importation and sale of counterfeit luxury goods bearing trademarks owned by louis vuitton and others.after the conclusion of this civil case,the defendants were convicted in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia for their importation into the united states and sale of more than handbags,wallets,and other products that resembled goods produced by louis vuitton,burberry,coach,and other luxury goods manufacturers lam and chan used a variety of companies,including ly usa,coco usa,and marco leather goods,to facilitate their operation.whenever customs and border patrol cbp agents would identify one corporation as an importer of counterfeit goods,defendants would continue to import goods into the same port,but under a different corporate name.if defendants believed cbp agents could identify them as responsible for importing counterfeit goods into a port,they would ship the goods to a different port.united states lam,cr,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.goods allegedly imported by the defendants were seized between august and january in houston,los angeles,newark,new york,norfolk,and elsewhere.
this civil case comprises claims by louis vuitton against the defendants for the related counterfeiting and infringement of their trademarks.the district court determined that three of the defendants collections infringed or were counterfeit copies of five separate louis vuitton trademarks.the court based its conclusion on testimony,adverse inferences drawn from the failure of the corporate defendants to offer testimony,records of numerous customs seizures,and visual evidence.tr.of oral arg.on summ.mot.at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv august,summ.hr g tr.
the parties

louis vuitton trademarks 
louis vuitton owns many trademarks,some of which are widely recognized.five are at issue in this litigation the lv logo mark,three different geometric floral motifs the flower design marks,and a composite pattern consisting of repetitions of the lv logo mark centered inside the three flower design marks.louis vuitton has registered each of these marks with the patent and trademark office on the principal register,and each has become incontestable as a result of its continuous use in commerce for more than five years.see governing incontestability dooney bourke,at noting that these marks are incontestable.
the civil lawsuit 
on november,louis vuitton filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that the defendants sold counterfeit handbags and travel apparel bearing infringing versions of louis vuitton marks to retail kiosks and specialty stores,and on the internet to both wholesale and retail customers.in its complaint,vuitton asserted claims for trademark counterfeiting,trademark and service mark infringement,trademark dilution,and false designation of origin forbidden by sections and of the lanham act,a,c trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of new york state common law and violations of new york general business law,
louis vuitton alleged that the defendants had supplied tens of thousands of items bearing counterfeits and infringements of the louis vuitton trademarks to wholesalers and retail kiosks throughout the united states.vuitton alleged that customs officials had seized tens of thousands of counterfeit handbags,tote bags,cosmetic bags,and wallets imported by ly and marco because those products infringed louis vuitton marks.each of the defendants answered the plaintiff complaint and interposed against one another for indemnification and contribution.
after fruitless settlement discussions,discovery was begun.louis vuitton efforts were aimed at ascertaining the scope of the defendants counterfeiting and infringement in order to determine the appropriate amount of damages to seek.the first document production by the defendants in august resulted in the production of fewer than pages.on september,vuitton sent letters to all of the defendants outlining what it said were deficiencies with their production and also with contemporaneous interrogatory answers.vuitton also asked the district court to order the defendants to produce additional documents and to complete and verify interrogatory answers no later than the time of a status conference scheduled for january.
on october,the parties sent a joint letter to the district court noting that louis vuitton had noticed six depositions,and had notified the defendants of deficiencies with their written discovery.letter from michael allan,et,to alvin hellerstein at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv,ecf.the parties requested a stay of discovery pending a mediation before a magistrate judge.the letter read,in part 
t he defendants have agreed to provide louis vuitton with certain information sufficiently in advance of mediation to help facilitate an efficient and useful mediation.specifically,defendants will provide louis vuitton with complete sales,inventory and supplier information for all merchandise louis vuitton contends is counterfeit infringing of its trademarks as well as any other merchandise defendants may have manufactured,imported or sold that bear marks similar to or substantially indistinguishable from louis vuitton trademarks.
on december,louis vuitton counsel reported to the court that the mediation had not been successful,and that the defendants had not produced complete sales,inventory and supplier information in advance of the mediation as promised.letter from michael allan,to alvin hellerstein at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv,ecf december discovery letter.counsel requested an order compelling discovery or a conference to address the outstanding discovery issues.id.at.
a status conference was then held on january or,to address these disputes.no transcript or other record of this proceeding was created.
on february,lam and chan jointly wrote to the district court notifying it that they had been arrested elsewhere.they requested a stay of this lawsuit pending resolution of the federal criminal proceedings because,counsel said,in executing the search warrant at their business headquarters on january in connection with the criminal proceedings,federal law enforcement officials had remove d computers,documents and other records as a well as a significant amount of defendants merchandise from the premises.letter from angelo rios,et to alvin hellerstein at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv,ecf february letter requesting stay.counsel asserted that as a result,they no longer ha d access to the information,documents and other things necessary to conduct meaningful discovery.id.counsel also advised the court that access to our clients will be severely limited both by the constraints placed upon them by their criminal defense attorneys as well as conditions imposed by the court with respect to their release from custody.id.for those reasons,the defendants argued,it will be impossible to proceed with pretrial discovery in the instant action while the criminal action is pending,and they therefore request ed that all proceedings be stayed until conclusion of the criminal action.id.
louis vuitton responded with a letter opposing the stay,arguing that the defendants are using the criminal case inappropriately as a shield against the civil case.letter from michael allan,to alvin hellerstein at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv,february letter opposing stay request.vuitton explained that at the early january conference,the defendants had represented that they had no additional responsive documentation and they had fully answered the interrogatories.id.at.
on march,in a order,the district court denied the defendants motion for a stay.the court considered the defendants argument that the parallel criminal proceeding as well as the seizure of the defendants documents,goods,and computers by law enforcement officials would impede their ability to mount a defense to the civil action,or to engage in meaningful discovery.order den.mot.for stay at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv march,ecf order denying motion for stay.the court noted vuitton opposition to the stay on the grounds that the civil case had been pending for more than a year that any delay would hinder the plaintiff need for prompt redress and that c onsiderable discovery already has been had.id.the district court then ruled 
defendants motion is denied.plaintiff has an interest in the prompt prosecution of its case.its trademark is valuable,and counterfeit goods threaten the value of its trademark and cut into sales.if there is imposition involved,the court can deal with such matters as and when there is threat of imposition.
on march,defendants lam and marco filed a motion for reconsideration of their request for a stay.they then argued for the first time that they and the other defendants intended to assert their fifth amendment rights in the course of their depositions.
p laintiff insists on going forward with defendants depositions in an attempt to take advantage of defendants situation so that plaintiff can then move for summary judgment relying on the absence of testimony from defendants as well as the adverse inference which might be raised by defendants asserting their constitution al right not to incriminate themselves.

discovery continued.louis vuitton gave notices of deposition of the defendants lam and chan.they refused to appear,citing their intent to exercise their fifth amendment right against.vuitton then moved to compel their depositions.the district court granted the motion,and chan and lam appeared for depositions on april and april,respectively.but both asserted their fifth amendment privileges and refused to answer nearly every question asked of them.
on june,louis vuitton moved for summary judgment on all of its federal and claims.the same day,vuitton also moved pursuant to rule d to preclude the three corporate defendants ly,marco,and coco from submitting further evidence as a sanction for their failure to respond to the plaintiff demand for rule b depositions 
in responding to that motion,one of the defendants attorneys declared that marco and lam have responded to plaintiff requests for admissions,interrogatories,and other discovery requests.notably,plaintiff does not point to any specific written discovery requests to which defendants marco and lam did not fully respond.decl.of thomas torto in opp to mot.to preclude introduction of new evidence,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv june,ecf.
the parties briefed both the summary judgment motion and the motion to preclude.at oral argument on august,after hearing from all of the parties,the district court granted summary judgment to louis vuitton on the trademark counterfeiting and infringement claims,and granted louis vuitton a permanent injunction.the court did not appear explicitly to draw any adverse inference from lam and chan invocation of the fifth amendment.however,it did draw an adverse inference from the corporate defendants refusal to submit rule b witnesses for depositions.see summ.hr g tr.at.the district court granted summary judgment on the counterfeiting claims based on the testimony of a person who had been involved in the operation,and the absence of any opposition testimony by the defendants,and their indifference to the notices of deposition served on them,the goods found among the counterfeit goods seized by government immigration and customs enforcement,or ice,the catalog photographs of the defendants goods and so much else.summ.hr g tr.at.the court also granted summary judgment on the infringement claims,based on three separate product lines designed by the defendants to resemble various handbags produced by louis vuitton after an analysis of the factors laid out in polaroid polarad elecs,cir.

one of the defendants attorneys again protested that he would not be able to produce the sales records because they had been seized in connection with the criminal case.the district court instructed louis vuitton attorney to assist the defendants in responding by contacting the united states attorney to try to secure the seized records,and noted that if any orders or interventions from me would be helpful,i be glad to.id.at.
the district court entered a summary order formalizing its ruling on august,and entered a permanent injunction barring the defendants from infringing louis vuitton trademarks on september.
the district court proceeded to determine the amount of damages and attorney fees.louis vuitton confirmed in a letter to the district court that it was seeking the maximum statutory damages award of eight million dollars,plus attorney fees,costs,and investigative fees.the parties briefed these issues.
vuitton detailed its efforts to settle the case and avoid litigation,as well as its efforts to secure records detailing the scope of the defendants copyright infringement.louis vuitton argued for maximum damages because the defendants had hid from discovery the documents and other information that would reveal the full nature and extent of their counterfeiting enterprise and activities.mem.in supp.of appl.for statutory damages,attorney fees,investigative fees and costs at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv,ecf.

on october,the district court awarded louis vuitton million in statutory damages and in attorney fees and costs.the court noted that the d efendants,despite their protestations to the contrary,have produced limited records,accountings,and sales invoices regarding the merchandise at issue.their failure to do so invites an inference of a massive counterfeiting enterprise.order awarding statutory damages,attorney fees,and expenses at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cv,ecf order awarding statutory damages.the court concluded that an award of half the maximum statutory damages was appropriate for each of the lv logo mark and the three floral motifs x plus for the composite mark,and each for the three infringements of other types of goods x,for a total of million.id.at.
each of the defendants filed timely appeals from these judgments,which appeals were,however,withdrawn almost immediately by stipulation of the parties.it was agreed among them that the appeals would be subject to reactivation within days after the jury returned a verdict in the criminal prosecutions of lam and chan,or by august,whichever came first.subsequent stipulations extended the alternate deadline date to july.

the defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their request to stay the civil action pending the resolution of the criminal prosecutions of lam and chan in the eastern district of virginia.they assert that the weight of authority in this circuit favors a stay where,as here,an indictment has issued against a civil defendant in a substantially related criminal matter.moreover,they argue that t he prejudice to defendants was severe and clearly outweighed any inconvenience to plaintiff caused by the delay in prosecuting this matter therefore,lam and chan fifth amendment privilege should not have been made subordinate to the commercial interests of vuitton.br.of def.cross cl.cross def.appellants at,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,et,cir.
the defendants further contend that when lam and chan invoked their fifth amendment rights against self incrimination at their depositions,the district court drew adverse inferences against them inferences that supported the grant of summary judgment in louis vuitton favor.the defendants also assert that by denying the stay,the district court deprived the corporate defendants of the opportunity to offer testimony by lam and chan in their defense.the district court denial of the stay,they argue,thereby effectively doom ed both the individual and corporate defendants efforts to defend the action.id.at.

in evaluating whether the interests of justice favor such a stay,courts have generally been concerned about the extent to which continuing the civil proceeding would unduly burden a defendant exercise of his rights under the fifth amendment,which provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,const.amend.creative consumer concepts,kreisler,cir see also united states all assets of statewide auto parts,cir same when considering stay of civil forfeiture proceeding.a stay can protect a civil defendant from facing the difficult choice between being prejudiced in the civil litigation,if the defendant asserts his or her fifth amendment privilege,or from being prejudiced in the criminal litigation if he or she waives that privilege in the civil litigation.see united states,cir discussing the dilemma faced by criminal defendants forced to testify in a parallel civil forfeiture proceeding.as judge hellerstein,who presided in the district court in this case,has observed in his extrajudicial writing,t he greatest risk posed by parallel civil and criminal proceedings is that parallel proceedings may place significant burdens upon the fifth amendment privilege against.alvin hellerstein gary naftalis,private civil actions and concurrent or subsequent regulatory or criminal proceedings,ali aba.
a defendant in a civil proceeding who invokes the fifth amendment as a result of an overlapping criminal investigation or proceeding risk s the adverse inference arising from his or her assertion of the privilege.id.at.the supreme court has explained that the fifth amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.baxter palmigiano,d see also keating office of thrift supervision,cir observing that it is permissible for the trier of fact to draw such adverse inferences.a party who asserts the privilege against must bear the consequence of lack of evidence,and the claim of privilege will not prevent an adverse finding or even summary judgment if the litigant does not present sufficient evidence to satisfy the usual evidentiary burdens in the litigation,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also libutti united states,cir noting that it is permissible to give an adverse inference significant weight,as silence when one would be expected to speak is a powerful persuader.
but if civil defendants do not elect to assert their fifth amendment privilege,and instead fully cooperate with discovery,their testimony in their defense in the civil action is likely to constitute admissions of criminal conduct in their criminal prosecution.sec boock,civ.dlc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at june.indeed,e ven where it would not be direct evidence of wrongdoing with respect to the scheme charged in the criminal case,such testimony may be admissible as.b evidence in any criminal trial.see also milton pollack,parallel civil and criminal proceedings,hereinafter pollack,parallel proceedings explaining how a party participation in civil proceedings may prejudice his defense in parallel criminal proceedings.
despite these factors,such a stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been characterized as an extraordinary remedy.trs.of plumbers pipefitters pension fund transworld.a district court may stay civil proceedings when related criminal proceedings are imminent or pending,and it will sometimes be prudential to do so.id.at even if a court may constitutionally deny a request for a stay,a stay of a civil action may still be warranted in some instances.but the constitution rarely,if ever,requires such a stay.kashi,at t he constitution does not ordinarily require a stay of civil proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings.quoting dresser,at ellipses omitted accord united states int l of teamsters,cir nosik,at.a defendant has no absolute right not to be forced to choose between testifying in a civil matter and asserting his fifth amendment privilege.keating,at.the existence of a civil defendant fifth amendment right arising out of a related criminal proceeding thus does not strip the court in the civil action of its broad discretion to manage its docket.
district courts have formulated tests to apply in deciding whether,in light of these hazards to the defendants in the civil proceedings against them,to grant a stay of those proceedings.the district courts of this circuit,for example,have often utilized a balancing test first set forth by court judge chin 
the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil case the status of the case,including whether the defendants have been indicted the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay the private interests of and burden on the defendants the interests of the courts and the public interest.

these tests,however,no matter how carefully refined,can do no more than act as a rough guide for the district court as it exercises its discretion.they are not mechanical devices for churning out correct results in overlapping civil and federal proceedings,replacing the district court studied judgment as to whether the civil action should be stayed based on the particular facts before it and the extent to which such a stay would work a hardship,inequity,or injustice to a party,the public or the court.
we think the tests do little more than serve as something of a check list of factors we ought to consider as we review the district court action for abuse of its discretion.even if we were to choose or formulate a test and apply it,we would not be able to reverse the district court solely because we disagreed with its application of the test.the district court decision ultimately requires and must rest upon a particularized inquiry into the circumstances of,and the competing interests in,the case.banks yokemick,d,citing keating,at see also,at h ow a trial court should react to any motion precipitated by a litigant assertion of the fifth amendment in a civil proceeding necessarily depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case.volmar,new york post,balancing these factors is a determination,with the basic goal being to avoid prejudice.and our role is only to assure that the district court exercise of discretion was reasonable and in accordance with the law.a decision so firmly within the discretion of the district court will not be disturbed by us absent demonstrated prejudice so great that,as a matter of law,it vitiates a defendant constitutional rights or otherwise gravely and unnecessarily prejudices the defendant ability to defend his or her rights.there may well be cases where the constitution requires a stay.but a plausible constitutional argument would be presented only if,at a minimum,denying a stay would cause substantial prejudice to the defendant.keating,at internal quotation marks omitted.in the more common case,the fifth amendment privilege is implicated by the denial of a stay,but not abrogated by it 
indeed,so heavy is the defendant burden in overcoming a district court decision to refrain from entering a stay that the defendants have pointed to only one case in which a district court decision to deny a stay was reversed on appeal,and that case was decided more than thirty years ago 
application 
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in this case.
there were factors present here that would have supported the entry of a stay.for example,lam and chan had been indicted in the parallel criminal proceeding when they sought the stay.the criminal trial was therefore reasonably imminent.see trs.of plumbers pipefitters pension fund.at observing that a court need not rely upon fortuitous events to manage its dockets.there is considerable authority for the principle that a stay is most justified where a movant,like the defendants here,is already under indictment for a serious criminal offense and is required at the same time to defend a civil action involving the same subject matter 
and the individual defendants did face the prospect that any testimony they offered in the civil proceeding would be used against them in the course of the criminal prosecution.the criminal proceeding involved the same subject matter as the civil action the trafficking in counterfeit handbags and wallets,including those bearing the counterfeit louis vuitton marks.the defendants ability to make use of their fifth amendment privileges would therefore have been implicated by a decision to testify in the civil matter.see trs.of plumbers pipefitters pension fund.at.and while the corporate defendants could not avail themselves of the privilege,a stay would arguably have served their interests too because of the adverse inferences that the court might have drawn but apparently did not draw from the individual defendants silence,and because those defendants would have been the most appropriate rule b witnesses on their behalf.
also,even in the absence of this civil case,the criminal prosecution would have likely served to protect the interests of consumers and manufacturers interests that ordinarily favor prompt resolution of civil counterfeiting and infringement claims.see brock tolkow,w hile criminal investigations and prosecutions can take a woefully long time,a stay of discovery does not mean that enforcement of the public interests at stake in the civil case will be indefinitely deferred.for one thing,a criminal prosecution serves to enforce those same interests.volmar,at noting,in an antitrust case,that t he public certainly has an interest in the preservation of the integrity of competitive markets,and that the pending criminal prosecution serves to advance those same interests.
the defendants also urge that their inability to produce documents establishing records of sale,and the implication of their fifth amendment privilege,required a stay the burden placed on them by the january,seizure of documents and computers from their headquarters by customs officials,they say,favored a stay.they assert that the district court erred in not considering that burden.
parts of the defendants argument,however,ring hollow in light of the defendants plainly dilatory tactics in tendering discovery even prior to their indictments.and afterwards,the district court did not leave the defendants without remedy for the potential implications of the parallel criminal proceeding.the court explained that i f there is imposition involved,the court can deal with such matters as and when there is threat of imposition.order denying motion for stay at.the court presumably meant that it was open to considering further requests from the defendants for alternative forms of relief,such as tailored stays,protective orders,quashing or modifying subpoenas,sealing confidential material,or even a renewed motion for a stay if specific impositions presented themselves.pollack,parallel proceedings,at describing alternatives to a complete stay of the civil proceedings.the district court also offered assistance in securing the documents that had supposedly been seized by the government in the criminal prosecution.
we see nothing in the record to indicate that the defendants ever pursued such alternative relief.the defendants might have submitted b witnesses,other than the indicted defendants,who could have offered testimony to fill in the gaps assertedly left by the seizure of these documents.they did not.they might have sought the district court proffered help in obtaining records or copies of records gathered in the criminal prosecution for production in the civil proceedings.they did not.and we are unaware of any explanation,persuasive or otherwise,that the defendants have given as to the manner in which the unavailability of these documents,computers,or merchandise actually prejudiced them.
we think the defendants failure to make use of the ability they had,and the additional assistance the district court offered,to make meaningful disclosure is significant.it paints their insistence that the civil proceedings be stayed as part of a larger pattern of overall delay and obfuscation.
the district court noted that the failure of the defendants to produce records invited the inference of a massive counterfeiting enterprise.order awarding statutory damages at.and if the defendants sales records would have revealed,in full,a counterfeiting operation that netted more than the million in potential statutory damages,they had every incentive to keep those records from the plaintiffs.if those records would have revealed a lesser amount of damages,they had the incentive to pursue those records with every tool at their disposal.the apparent indifference on the part of the defendants to the aid offered them suggests that tendering complete documentation to the plaintiff was not in their interest.to be sure,the challenge of acquiring documentation may have been exacerbated by the criminal proceedings,but the defendants general failure,with the help of the district court,to work around that set of problems so as to produce substantial information in defense of the civil claims undercuts their claim that the criminal proceedings completely impeded their ability to mount a defense.
finally,the defendants argue that lam and chan reliance on their fifth amendment privilege favored a stay.indeed it did,insofar as it limited their ability to assist in defending against the civil claims.but we see nothing in the record to indicate that their invocation of the privilege alone resulted in one or more adverse inferences being drawn against them.the district court explained in its oral summary judgment ruling that if the defendants come forward with proofs of their sales and their customers for the accused merchandise the court would take that into consideration in fixing the appropriate sum of damages.summ.hr g tr.at.the court explained that the counterfeiting charges were proved,in part,by the absence of any opposition testimony by the defendants,and their indifference,i would say,to the notices of deposition served on them.id.at.but during oral argument the court referred only to the failure of the corporate defendants to offer witnesses under rule b,and suggested that it was that failure alone having little to do with the defendants fifth amendment privilege,assuming that other such witnesses were available that supported the adverse inferences 
even if the district court drew adverse inferences from lam and chan invoking their fifth amendment rights,such inferences were not necessarily material because there was sufficient evidence without them to adequately support the district court grant of summary judgment.if defendants choose to remain silent,the adverse inference that may be drawn will be only one of a number of factors the factfinder will consider and will be given no more evidentiary value than the facts of the case warrant.united states dist.council of new york city,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the record included visual evidence that enabled the district court to conduct its own comparison of the authentic and accused products,the records of customs seizures,and the defendants own scant document production.indeed,that is the evidence on which the district court explained it was largely basing its decision.
also weighing against the stay was the public interest in prompt further protection of the plaintiff and the public through the civil action from what the evidence before the district court suggested likely was a counterfeiting enterprise.see landscape forms,columbia cascade,cir reminding courts that the underlying purpose of the lanham act is protecting consumers and manufacturers from deceptive representations of affiliation and origin dresser,at denying a stay in order to avoid the continued dissemination of false or misleading information by companies to members of the investing public.
and,as the district court found,louis vuitton plainly had a compelling interest in prompt resolution of the civil case,in part because of the apparent scale of the counterfeiting operation and the potential for lost sales and consumer confusion.see order denying motion for stay at noting that p laintiff has an interest in the prompt prosecution of its case.its trademark is valuable,and counterfeit goods threaten the value of its trademark and cut into sales.moreover,vuitton acted expeditiously to advance its interests,filing the present lawsuit more than a year before lam and chan were indicted.in light of the length of time that the lawsuit had progressed by the time the indictments issued,and defendants dilatory tactics during discovery,granting a stay posed a particular risk to vuitton interest in the prompt resolution of its claims.
lastly,the court had reason to proceed forthwith based on its own interest in disposing of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself landis,at.
while we thus find substantial arguments arrayed both for and against the district court grant of a stay,we conclude that the defendants were not as a matter of law deprived of their constitutional rights,or otherwise gravely and unnecessarily prejudiced,by the court decision.the court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying the stay.
iii.award of attorney fees 
the defendants argue that the district court erred in awarding attorney fees and costs.they contend that because louis vuitton opted to receive statutory damages pursuant to c,it waived the ability to receive an award of attorney fees.the defendants point out that unlike subsections a and b of section,which explicitly provide for such an award,subsection c does not.
the district court,acknowledging the absence of binding precedent on this issue in this circuit,ruled that a lthough attorney fees are frequently awarded in conjunction with actual damages,and often not awarded in conjunction with statutory damages,in its discretion they are appropriate here,and plaintiff should be awarded its expenses of suit.order awarding statutory damages at.the district court imposed an attorney fee award of,which was percent of the attorney fees,expenses,and investigative costs that louis vuitton had sought.id.
on appeal,the defendants argue that in making the award the district court abused its discretion by exercising a power that it did not have.they rely heavily on a line of district court decisions concluding that attorney fees are unavailable under section a for plaintiffs receiving statutory damages under section c,as well as on a ninth circuit decision,k n eng g,bulat,cir.
in the alternative,the defendants argue that the attorney fees awards were excessive and that reimbursement for some expenses awarded was not supported by the required documentation.
standard of review 
it is of course a longstanding principle of american law that each party must pay his or her own attorney fees irrespective of who prevails in the litigation.reimbursement of the winning party by the losing party is not available unless there is an express statutory basis for permitting or requiring it.see,arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,cir describing statutory exceptions to the american rule.
whether attorney fees are available pursuant to section c is a question of statutory interpretation.we therefore review the district court conclusions de novo.dsi assocs.llc united states,cir ehrenfeld mahfouz,cir.but we review the district court decision regarding the amount of any such award for abuse of discretion.scott city of,cir per curiam accord banff,colberts,cir considering an award of attorney fees under section of the lanham act.a court abuses its discretion if it rests its decision on an erroneous determination of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding.scott,at.
governing law 
under section of the lanham act,a plaintiff seeking damages for counterfeiting and infringement has the option of seeking either actual or statutory damages,but not both.a plaintiff may recover actual damages equal to defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.a a plaintiff may elect instead to recover statutory damages for the use of a counterfeit mark that are computed per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold,offered for sale,or distributed.c the issue is plain does the election by a plaintiff to seek statutory damages under section c instead of actual damages and profits under section a,supplant only that part of section a that provides the method for ascertaining the amount of damages with the method set forth for ascertaining damages in section c,while leaving unaffected the last sentence of the subsection t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party or does it supplant the entirety of subsection a including the provision for attorney fees in exceptional cases if the former,then the plaintiff may make such an election,as louis vuitton did in this case,and retain the ability to seek attorney fees if the case is deemed by the court to be sufficiently exceptional.if the latter,by making the election to seek damages under subsection c,louis vuitton lost the ability to obtain any attorney fees award at all,under subsection a or otherwise.
some district courts have concluded that a plaintiff who opts to receive statutory damages under section c is indeed foreclosed from receiving attorney fees under section a,even in an exceptional case.see,global van lines,global moving express,civ.rjh knf,dist.lexis,at,john wiley sons,kauzin rukiz entm t promotions,civ.sas gwg,wl,at,dist.lexis,at june,gucci,duty free apparel,d.
other district courts including the court in this case have taken the contrary position and held that the lanham act does not prohibit simultaneous awards of relief under section a and section c so long as a plaintiff does not obtain a recovery of both actual and statutory damages.see,louis vuitton malletier ly usa,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,although attorneys fees are frequently awarded in conjunction with actual damages,and often not awarded in conjunction with statutory damages,in my discretion they are appropriate here citations omitted nike,top brand,civ.kmw rle,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,while there has been some question about the availability of an award of attorney fees where statutory damages are given,courts have found both appropriate in such exceptional cases of willful infringement.
other district courts have acknowledged this as an unsettled question without proffering an answer to it.most frequently,courts avoid confronting the issue by implicitly or explicitly accounting for the cost of attorney fees in setting the amount of the award.see,cartier symbolix,d,the court finds it unnecessary to resolve this interesting question of statutory interpretation since it concludes that a modest award of attorney fees is appropriate either as a separate award,or as a part of an award of statutory damages.louis vuitton malletier,civ.lak,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,award of statutory damages suffices to make plaintiff whole rodgers anderson,civ.rjh ajp,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,same.
still other district courts in this circuit have awarded attorney fees under section a and statutory damages under section c simultaneously,but without acknowledging the potential statutory hurdle they had to clear in doing so.see,union of orthodox jewish congregations of am.am.food beverage,d,louis vuitton malletier artex creative int l,d,louis vuitton malletier carducci leather fashions,d,tiffany nj luban,d.
the ninth circuit appears to be the only circuit court to have explicitly recognized this issue,although the court did not resolve it.in k n engineering,the district court awarded attorney fees under section b not,as in the present case,under the last sentence of section a to a plaintiff who,like louis vuitton here,opted to receive statutory damages under section c.at.on appeal,the ninth circuit explained that section c makes no provision for attorney fees.id.at.it ruled that because the plaintiff had elected to receive statutory damages under section c,there was no statutory basis to award the plaintiff attorney fees under b.id.
k n engineering is,however,critically different from the case at bar.there,as here,statutory damages were awarded under section c.but there,unlike here,attorney fees had been awarded by the district court under section b,rather than a.as the court of appeals explained,section b attorney fees provision applies only in cases with actual damages under a,and the district court had assessed no such damages as a result of the plaintiff election to receive statutory damages instead.id.the ninth circuit explicitly reserved the question at issue here because the fee award in this case was made pursuant to b,we do not reach the issue whether an election to receive statutory damages under c precludes an award of attorney fees for exceptional cases under the final sentence of a.id.at 
k n engineering thus left the present question undecided.commentators remain divided.compare callmann on unfair competition,trademarks and monopolies ed.a prevailing plaintiff who elects statutory damages under the lanham act in a counterfeiting case is not entitled to attorney fees.with mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.describing the ninth circuit k n engineering decision in the subsection b context as a reading of the statute and lamenting that it fails to read lanham act as an integrated whole.
statutory interpretation 
as with any question of statutory interpretation,we begin with the text of the statute to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.robinson shell oil,d see also united states am.soc.of composers,authors,and publishers,cir.a particular statute plain meaning can best be understood by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.saks franklin covey,cir.w e attempt to ascertain how a reasonable reader would understand the statutory text,considered as a whole.pettus morgenthau,cir.if we can ascertain the plain meaning of the statutory text by examining it in the context of the statute as a whole,we need proceed no further.if,however,the plain meaning is ambiguous,we may consult other sources.extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting legislature understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.exxon mobil allapattah,d.we turn to the legislative history only when the plain statutory language is ambiguous or would lead to an absurd result.in re ames dep t stores,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
textual analysis.section a distinguishes between a plaintiff recovery and a court discretionary award of attorney fees in exceptional circumstances.recovery of damages is both something to which a successful plaintiff shall be entitled and represents compensation and not a penalty in the form of defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.a.the award of attorney fees,by contrast,is reserved for exceptional cases.we have held,moreover,that the prerequisite to a finding that a case is sufficiently exceptional to warrant an award of fees is that the infringement was willful or in bad faith.see,patsy brand,realty,cir.
section c characterizes the plaintiff recovery of statutory damages as being instead of actual damages and profits under subsection a of this section.c.to the extent that subsection a distinguishes between actual profits and damages on the one hand,and an award of attorney fees on the other,then,the alternative recovery is instead of damages and profits under subsection a,not instead of damages,profits and in some exceptional cases attorney fees under subsection a.an award of attorney fees in an exceptional case is thus not foreclosed.under this reading,section a is the primary or default source of trademark infringement remedies available to a victorious plaintiff,and section c represents a special exception or carveout for part of the remedy otherwise available under section a actual damages and profits.
we find this argument compelling,because it best comports with the statutory text.the phrase elect ing instead of actual damages and profits under subsection a ought not be read to mean elect ing instead of all remedies provided under subsection a.in our view,so long as the exceptional case requirement of section a is met,the text of sections a and c leaves an award of attorney fees within the discretion of the district court.nonetheless,because we recognize that the text demonstrates at least some ambiguity,we turn to an examination of the purpose of section c 
based analysis.our consideration of the history of the statute and congress purpose in enacting section c,reinforces our view that the election of a remedy under section c by a plaintiff such as louis vuitton here does not foreclose the possibility of a recovery of attorney fees under section a.
before,trademark remedies were governed by sections a and b alone.section a provided as remedies then as now profits,actual damages,and costs,plus attorney fees in an exceptional case.section b provided in cases of willful counterfeiting for treble damages,a reasonable attorney fee,and prejudgment interest.
in,congress passed the anticounterfeiting consumer protection act the act,which amended section to add subsection c,providing for the alternative of statutory damages.anticounterfeiting consumer protection act of,stat.codified at c.congress appears to have been motivated by a gap in the law plaintiffs who were victorious on their civil counterfeiting claims were often unable to obtain an adequate recovery in actual damages because counterfeiters often maintain sparse business records,if any at all.see,at in passing the act,which allows trademark plaintiffs to elect to recover statutory damages in counterfeit cases in lieu of actual damages,congress apparently sought to ensure that plaintiffs would receive more than de minimis compensation for the injury caused by counterfeiting as a result of the unprovability of actual damages despite the plain inference of damages to the plaintiff from the defendant unlawful behavior.the act was thus apparently designed to provide an alternative to the type of recovery provided in section a not to all of the remedies provided for in that section.the act was meant to expand the range of remedies available to a trademark plaintiff,not restrict them.
in light of that history,it seems to us unlikely that congress intended to prevent a plaintiff who opts to recover statutory damages from also receiving attorney fees.if congress purpose in enacting section c was to address the problem facing a plaintiff unable to prove actual damages,denying an attorney fee award to those plaintiffs making use of the new election would be inconsistent with that remedial purpose.the key sources the house and senate reports do not indicate that congress intended a tradeoff between statutory damages and both actual damages and attorney fees.see.
this case is illustrative.the district court concluded that the defendants were responsible for a massive counterfeiting enterprise based at least in part on plaintiff allegations and the unavailability of records suggesting otherwise.as we have explained,a defendant facing a statutory damage award less than the actual amount of the damages he or she caused has the incentive to frustrate ascertainment of the actual amount of the damages.it makes little sense,we think,to further reward a defendant successful in defeating the plaintiff and the court attempts to fix the actual amount of damages by allowing him or her to avoid an award of attorney fees.such a scheme would only further incentivize the defendant to avoid making,keeping,or producing sales records.
we therefore conclude that an award of attorney fees is available under section a in exceptional cases even for those plaintiffs who opt to receive statutory damages under section c.
application 
under the last sentence of section a,in exceptional cases the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a.we have said that the lanham act allows recovery of a reasonable attorney fee only on evidence of fraud or bad faith.conopco,campbell soup,cir quoting twin peaks,publications int l,cir see also,patsy brand,at exceptional cases include instances of fraud or bad faith or willful infringement citations omitted gordon breach sci.publishers am.inst.of physics,cir per curiam same in other words,we have concluded that the key is willfulness on the part of the defendants the finding of willfulness determines the right to attorney fees.bambu sales,ozak trading,cir.we have no trouble agreeing with the district court on the facts as we have described them that the infringement here was willful,involving instances of fraud and bad faith.the award of attorney fees was therefore justified.
the defendants argue that even so,louis vuitton counsel time and billing records were scant and incomplete,thereby frustrating the inquiry into whether any of the hours charged were duplicative or unnecessary.they argue that some of the hours were for unnecessary work,because once the district court denied the defendants motion for a stay,the case became hopeless and the plaintiff was assured of a judgment in its favor.the defendants also assert that louis vuitton failed to provide appropriate documentation for the fees of its private investigator and that the district court therefore should not have awarded those fees as costs.
these arguments are unsupported by the record.in assessing the reasonableness of attorney fees,a court looks to the amount of time spent as reflected in contemporaneous time records,and then decides how much of that time was reasonably expended.clarke frank,cir.if the district court finds that some of the time was not reasonably necessary to the outcome of the litigation,it should reduce the time for which compensation is awarded accordingly.see,hensley eckerhart,d.
in the present case,louis vuitton produced more than one hundred pages of complete billing records.some of the allegedly unnecessary work in fact resulted from the defendants own dilatory treatment of louis vuitton discovery requests.moreover,lam and chan decision to invoke their fifth amendment privilege did not render legal work already completed unnecessary.we see no error on the part of the district court in making these findings.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the defendants motion to stay this case pending the conclusion of the related criminal proceeding.we also conclude that the award of attorney fees was within the discretion of the district court and that the court properly awarded attorney fees based on the court finding of willful infringement.
the judgments of the district court are therefore affirmed.
we refer to such fees throughout this opinion as attorney fees,the term used in b,rather than the less commonly used attorney fees,the term used in a,or the likely more accurate attorneys fees,see naacp town of haven,cir although the fees sought in this case are for multiple attorneys,we refer to them in the singular possessive,attorney fees,because that is the term used by the statute in that case for such awards.
the details of the related criminal proceeding are rehearsed here for background purposes only.this court may take judicial notice of any fact that can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.b.

section generally provides that deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of business are unlawful.bus.law mckinney.section l provides for injunctive relief where injury to business reputation or dilution of a registered mark is likely.id.
corporations do not have a fifth amendment right against.see,braswell united states,d noting that prior cases had settled that a corporation has no fifth amendment privilege in re grand jury subpoena issued june,cir per curiam c orporations can not avail themselves of the fifth amendment privilege.in this circuit,at least,this rule includes small or solely owned corporations.see in re grand jury subpoena,at.accordingly,a corporation may not refuse to submit to a rule b deposition,or to turn over corporate records,on the grounds that such acts may tend to incriminate it.id.at.the defendant corporations were,of course,free to designate individuals other than chan and lam as b witnesses.see.b.
rule b provides notice or subpoena directed to an its notice or subpoena,a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation,a partnership,an association,a governmental agency,or other entity and must describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination.the named organization must then designate one or more officers,directors,or managing agents,or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify.a subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to make this designation.the persons designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization.this paragraph does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.
those product lines are known as the collection,the ly collection,and the cherry blossom collection.the district court explained that the collection bears substantial similarity to the lv logo mark,floral motifs,and composite mark except that a cursive m replaces the lv logo,and that the flower design is somewhat modified.summ.hr g tr.at.the cherry blossom collection features bags with a brown canvas base similar to the canvas of the louis vuitton bags,and the ly logo is in contrasting colors in pink and red cherry blossom flowers superimposed with pink and red cherry blossoms and flowers superimposed over the logos.id.at.the ly collection replicates all of the louis vuitton marks except that they replaced an overlapping lv with a ly.id.at.
it is unclear to us whether the plaintiff was able to secure any additional records by consulting with the attorney office prosecuting the defendants criminal case,or whether the defendants were able to do so themselves.the record does not reflect any additional attempts by the defendants to secure the records the unavailability of which they initially argued supported their application for the stay,nor did they make any specific objections to the civil proceedings on the basis of their inability to introduce specific documents.
the jury was apparently unable to decide whether counterfeit bags were actually seized in norfolk,virginia.counts two through seven of the superseding indictment related only to seizures in norfolk.
allegations related to the importation of counterfeit louis vuitton merchandise were included in count one of the superseding indictment,conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods,of which lam and chan were found guilty.no allegations relating to louis vuitton merchandise were included in the remaining six counts of the superseding indictment.
there are other possible justifications for a stay.for example,a district court may issue one in a civil proceeding in deference to a parallel criminal proceeding in order to prevent either party from taking advantage of broader civil discovery rights or to prevent the exposure of the criminal defense strategy to the prosecution.kreisler,at.

for cases applying substantially this standard,see also,hicks,d at boock,wl,at,dist.lexis,at quoting trs.of plumbers pipefitters pension fund.at motorola,abeckaser,cv cps smg,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,parker dawson,cv jfb wdw,cv jfb wdw,cv jfb wdw,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,jhw greentree capital,whittier trust,civ.hb,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.some district courts have instead applied a similar test under which the court considers the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously with the civil litigation as balanced against the prejudice to the plaintiffs if delayed the private interests of and burden on the defendants the interests of the courts the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation and the public mountains chapter of trout unlimited,epa,d,listing test and collecting cases see also golden quality ice cream,deerfield specialty papers,pollak,originally setting out this test.
were we forced to choose between the two tests,we would likely prefer judge chin formulation because it explicitly considers the degree to which the issues in the civil and criminal proceedings overlap.see trs.of plumbers pipefitters pension fund.at if there is no overlap,there would be no danger of and accordingly no need for a stay.the test also has the advantage of taking into account the status of the criminal proceeding,including whether the civil defendant has been indicted,a factor that speaks to whether a prosecution is likely and imminent as opposed to a remote or purely hypothetical possibility.but in reviewing district court judgments on appeal,the question for us is whether at the end of the day the trial court abused its discretion,not whether the court employed a superior check list in arriving at its decision.
because the denial of a stay here plainly does not violate lam and chan constitutional rights,we need not speculate further about the circumstances under which a more compelling constitutional argument would be presented.cases where courts have found a stay constitutionally required are few and far between likely because district courts stay proceedings out of an abundance of caution when there is a serious question as to whether a denial would violate the fifth amendment.the eleventh circuit appears to be the only circuit that has outlined a specific test for determining whether a stay is constitutionally required.see united states premises located at route,cir stay required when the invocation of the fifth amendment privilege must result in an adverse judgment,not merely the loss of the defendant most effective defense.stated plainly,the rule applies when the invocation of the privilege would result in automatic entry of summary judgment.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
see wehling cbs,cir,in which the plaintiff in a libel action had requested a stay in lieu of dismissal pending the outcome of a related criminal proceeding against him.the court faulted the district court for failing to measure the relative weights of the parties competing interests with a view toward accommodating those interests,if possible.id.at.
district courts have not,however,treated the fact that an indictment of the defendants has been handed up at the time of their making a motion for a stay of the civil proceedings as requiring that the stay be entered.in addition to the decision of the district court in this case,see,abeckaser,wl,at,dist.lexis,at denying stay in action where defendants requested a stay on the eve of summary judgment,eighteen months after a related indictment and when discovery in the civil case had been completed fendi adele ashley reed trading,civ.jes mhd,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,denying stay in and counterfeiting action where defendant waited until six months after indictment to request stay travelers cas.sur.vanderbilt,llc,civ.dlc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at may,declining to stay civil proceedings where it is clear that many of the issues in this litigation have a life independent from the willingness of the indicted defendants to testify or the substance of any testimony they might give.
these considerations are related.the compulsory production of books and papers does implicate the fifth amendment privilege.see spevack klein,d.the defendants here do not argue,however,that they resisted document production because of the possibility of.rather,their argument is a purely practical one that the unavailability of these documents due to the parallel criminal proceeding was unduly prejudicial.
in their initial letter seeking a stay,the defendants did not raise the fifth amendment issue.they asserted instead that discovery would have been more difficult for them to comply with because some relevant documents had been seized by the government.it is only now,on appeal,that the parties have extensively briefed the fifth amendment issue.the defendants failure to squarely present their fifth amendment argument to the district court in the first instance also calls into question the degree to which they actually feared prejudice in the civil proceeding.
the defendants argue that louis vuitton commercial interests must not have been in grave jeopardy because louis vuitton did not seek a temporary restraining
