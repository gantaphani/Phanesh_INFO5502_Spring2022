joseph mazzei initiated a class action against the money store et,alleging,inter alia,overcharge of late fees on mortgages,and prevailed in a jury trial.the united states district court for the southern district of new york koeltl,i granted motion to decertify under federal rule of civil procedure c c a class that was previously certified pursuant to rule a and b and ii entered judgment in favor only of mazzei,the putative class representative.
we hold that a district court has power,consistent with the seventh amendment and rule,to decertify a class after a jury verdict and before the entry of final judgment.we also hold that,in considering such decertification or modification,the district court must defer to any factual findings the jury necessarily made unless those findings were seriously erroneous,a miscarriage of justice,or egregious.applying these principles,we conclude that the district court did not abuse discretion in determining that rule requirements were not met and in decertifying the class.
an accompanying summary order affirms the denial of mazzei motion for a new trial as to a second claim.
background 
in,joseph mazzei obtained a mortgage loan from his employer,the money store.at that time,the money store was a loan servicer and mortgage lender.mazzei missed payments on the loan for years beginning in late,and received three notices of default in.in,the money store changed ownership,and mazzei was laid off.soon after,the money store ceased originating loans and became homeq servicing.
early in,the money store servicing operator,tms mortgage,notified mazzei that he was in default mazzei loan was accelerated,the entire sum of principal and interest became due and foreclosure proceedings were begun.mazzei avoided a foreclosure sale by filing for bankruptcy,and ultimately paid the full balance of the loan,with interest and various default fees.these fees included,inter alia,attorney fees,and ten late fees of each five of which were incurred after acceleration.
mazzei then sued the money store,tms mortgage,and homeq servicing collectively,the money store for breach of contract,on behalf of a putative class,challenging the imposition of late fees and attorney fees.citing terms set forth in the fannie mae form loan documents that mazzei signed when the mortgage loan was originated,mazzei contended that the note contemplated the imposition only of late fees,and that the imposition of late fees violated the agreement.
mazzei achieved certification of the class,defined as 
all similarly situated borrowers who signed form loan agreements on loans which were owned or serviced by the defendants and who from march,to the present were charged a late fees after the borrower loan was accelerated,and where the accelerated loan was paid off post acceleration late fee class

the class definition was later amended on consent to exclude borrowers who signed loan mortgage agreements after november,and for administrative purposes to close on june.order,mazzei money store,jgk rle june,ecf.
the certified class action eventually went to trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of mazzei and the class on the late fee claims.it awarded mazzei,and it awarded the class approximately million plus prejudgment interest.the jury found in favor of the money store on the remaining claims.
after trial,and before the entry of judgment,the money store moved for decertification of the class pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c c,or,in the alternative,the entry of judgment as a matter of law on the class late fee claims pursuant to federal rule.the class was composed of borrowers whose loans were either owned by the money store via origination or assignment or serviced by it.both motions were based in relevant part on mazzei failure to prove privity of contract between the money store and those borrowers whose loans it only serviced,and did not own.the district court agreed that mazzei failure to prove privity with respect to such absent class members defeated class certification on grounds of typicality and predominance.the district court therefore granted the money store motion for decertification of the class.mazzei money store.the district court also opined that it would have granted the money store motion for judgment as a matter of law if decertification had not been appropriate.id.at.judgment was entered for mazzei on his individual late fee claim.
mazzei challenges the decertification on the grounds,inter alia,that decertification is unavailable after a jury verdict in favor of a certified class that the findings made to support decertification were incompatible with the seventh amendment and that the rule requirements for class certification were satisfied.we affirm.
discussion 
federal rule of civil procedure c c provides that a n order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.fed.civ.c c.mazzei argues nevertheless that a class may not be decertified after a jury verdict in its favor because such decertification is tantamount to overturning a jury verdict,for which the only procedural avenue available is judgment as a matter of law under rule b and decertification would violate the class members seventh amendment right to a jury trial 
federal rule and our case law confirm that a district court may decertify a class after a jury verdict and before the entry of final judgment in deciding an appeal of a denial of a motion to decertify after a jury verdict in a class favor,we observed that a district court may decertify a class if it appears that the requirements of rule are not in fact met.sirota solitron devices,cir.discussing motion to decertify after jury verdict in favor of subclass see also rossini ogilvy mather,cir.affirming decertification of one class after bench trial based on evidence reversing decertification of two other classes.
a district court exercise of discretion is set forth clearly in both the wording and commentary of rule.see fed.civ.c c an order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.fed.civ.c advisory committee notes to amendment a determination of liability after certification,however,may show a need to amend the class definition.decertification may be warranted after further proceedings.see also wright et,federal practice procedure ed.update reference to the final judgment in rule c c avoids a possible ambiguity under the prior rule,making clear that after a determination of liability it may be permissible to amend the class definition or subdivide the class if it becomes necessary in order to define the remedy or if decertification is warranted.
indeed,because the results of class proceedings are binding on absent class members,see fed.civ.c,the district court has the affirmative duty of monitoring its class decisions in light of the evidentiary development of the case.richardson byrd,cir.the district judge must define,redefine,subclass,and decertify as appropriate in response to the progression of the case from assertion to facts.see phillips petroleum shutts,t he due process clause of course requires that the named plaintiff at all times adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.emphasis added.the power to decertify a class after trial when appropriate is therefore not only authorized by federal rule but is a corollary 
the seventh amendment,which applies in federal court proceedings,is not to the contrary.the amendment has two parts the trial by jury clause preserves a litigant right to a jury trial in a subset of civil cases the reexamination clause provides that no fact tried by a jury,shall be otherwise in any court of the united states,than according to the rules of the common law.const.amend.vii.
as to mazzei,there is no seventh amendment issue at all.mazzei will receive damages on his individual claim in the amount awarded him by the jury.and he has no constitutional right to represent a class whether he may do so is purely a matter of rule.
as to the class,there is no violation.the right of absent class members to adjudication by jury is unimpaired.their claims survive by virtue of american pipe tolling.see american pipe constr.utah.under this rule,the filing of a putative class action tolls the statute of limitations with respect to all absent class members until the time class certification is denied.see american pipe,at crown,cork seal parker.therefore,any putative member of the decertified class who wishes to do so may file an individual action seeking damages on a similar claim so long as the individual action is instituted during whatever amount of time remains in the limitations period.see crown,cork seal,at.
the district court decertification thus has the same effect as would a grant of a motion for a new trial pursuant to federal rule a.the grant of such a motion does not mean that there must be a new trial,or that there will be one it just means that there can be one if an individual claimant chooses to continue pursuit of the claim.it is beyond dispute that the grant of such a motion does not violate the seventh amendment.see gasperini ctr.for humanities,byrd blue ridge rural,montgomery ward duncan,raedle credit agricole indosuez,cir.united states landau,cir.
there are many procedural devices that impose judicial control on juries,binder long island lighting,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds in banc by fisher vassar,cir,and such controls are not only compatible with the seventh amendment jury trial right,but necessary to the institution.see dagnello long island,cir.the jury does not function alone,but in cooperation with the judge presiding over the trial.without judicial supervision over what blackstone called the misbehavior of juries,a trial by jury would lack one of the essentials of the jury trial as it was known to the common law before the adoption of the constitution.footnotes omitted.permissible controls include certain procedures that were not in conformity with practice at common law when the amendment was adopted.gasperini,at.
the right of absent class members to a jury trial is protected,not impaired,by the rule c c decertification procedure,which protects their due process rights and defendants by ensuring that any class claim that proceeds to final judgment and thus binds them is fairly and appropriately the subject of class treatment.see stores,dukes,rule a ensures that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class whose claims they wish to litigate.amchem,windsor,subdivisions a and b of rule focus court attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity so that absent members can fairly be bound by decisions of class representatives.shutts,at consistent with the due process clause,absent class members may be bound to a class judgment only if they are adequately represented by the named plaintiffs hansberry lee,same see also supra part 
decertification in this case provokes a further question the power of the court to make the findings that supported its ruling.decertification was based on the district court determination that mazzei had failed to prove through evidence at trial that borrowers whose loans were only serviced not owned by the money store were nevertheless in a contractual relationship with the money store.this factual question whether mazzei proved that absent class members were in privity with the money store was both relevant to the de certification motion and an element of the class merits claim.and on the merits,the jury obviously found that privity has been established.
normally,the district court resolves factual issues related to class certification,making its findings based on the preponderance of the evidence even if they overlap with the merits of the case.see amgen.ret.plans trust funds,merits questions may be considered to the extent that they are relevant to determining whether the rule prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.dukes,at frequently that rigorous rule analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.but such findings do not bind the trier of fact.in re ipo,at.the question becomes how does a jury factual finding impact the district court decision about whether decertification is appropriate or not 
we hold that when a district court considers decertification or modification of a class after a jury verdict,the district court must defer to any factual findings the jury necessarily made unless those findings were seriously erroneous,a miscarriage of justice,or egregious.see raedle,at.this is the standard that a district court applies to a rule motion for a new trial on grounds and we conclude that it is appropriate in this context as well as to questions of fact that are not necessarily decided by the jury verdict,the court can make its own factual findings based on the preponderance of the evidence as is usually done when making a determination about class certification.
for the reasons discussed supra part,the seventh amendment is not violated by the district court evaluation of trial evidence in ruling on the procedural issue of decertification.that is what trial judges do when considering a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.see landau,at the seventh amendment does not prevent a district court from substitut ing its view of the evidence for that of the jury,provided the judge is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.at the same time,we have explained that the judge power to do so is in tension with the seventh amendment.raedle,at landau,at same.given that tension here,with the reexamination clause,it is imprudent and likely improper to further relax the standard by which a trial court may substitute its view of the evidence for that of the jury.landau,at.by respecting the jury work,the seventh amendment issue is avoided this approach makes full use of the work the jury has already done and it fits the procedural scheme set forth in federal rules b and a.
mazzei argues that decertification should be constrained by the rule standard of legally insufficient evidence.see fed.civ.a realty dev,cir.that stringent standard is not called for because unlike the grant of a rule motion decertification does not resolve the claims of the withstand decertification and survive unimpaired.the seriously erroneous formulation better comports with the district court authority to manage the class action and to protect the rights of absent class members,see,fed.civ.d,e it respects the trial court position as to evaluate class issues,see in re sumitomo copper,cir.referring to second circuit longstanding view that the district court is often in the best position to assess the propriety of the class and it recognizes rule explicit contemplation of decertification,see fed.civ.c c.
a district court order granting or denying class certification is reviewed for abuse of discretion.myers hertz,cir.this standard applies to the ultimate decision on class certification and to rulings on each of the rule requirements.id.a district court decision granting certification is given greater deference than a decision denying certification or,a fortiori,an order decertifying a class.see johnson nextel commc ns,cir.citing moore painewebber,cir.
a plaintiff seeking certification of a rule b damages class action has the burden to establish numerosity,commonality,typicality,adequacy of representation,predominance of common questions of law or fact,and the superiority of a class action to other procedures.fed.civ.a,b see amgen,ct at teamsters local,at.in opposing the decertification motion,mazzei retained the burden to demonstrate that these requirements were satisfied.see rossini,at rubinstein,newberg on class actions ed.update when a defendant moves for an order denying class certification,the burden to prove compliance with rule remains with the plaintiff.
the class included borrowers whose loans were either owned or serviced by the money store.to prove a claim on its behalf,mazzei was required to prove,inter alia,that class members were in a contractual relationshi
