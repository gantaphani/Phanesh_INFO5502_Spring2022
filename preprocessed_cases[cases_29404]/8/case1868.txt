in this case,we address the question of whether the order dealing with a debtor mortgage obligations in a chapter bankruptcy confirmation order is res judicata with respect to a subsequent challenge by the trustee to the validity of the mortgage.we conclude that it is.
andrea celli the trustee appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn,that reverses a ruling of the bankruptcy court littlefield,and finds in favor of appellee first national bank of northern new york fnb.the district court concluded that a chapter bankruptcy confirmation order was res judicata with respect to the validity of certain mortgage liens listed by the debtor in his chapter plan and therefore precludes the debtor and the trustee subsequent attempt to avoid these liens on his property.we affirm.
background 
the facts of this case are drawn from the parties stipulations and bankruptcy court filings.in kevin layo layo or debtor purchased a residence in lawrence county,new york the property.over the next four years,layo executed and delivered to fnb four mortgages on the property.the first and third mortgages were satisfied and discharged,and only the second mortgage and fourth mortgage mortgages are at issue in this dispute.mortgage,which layo executed to secure the sum of in february,was recorded in the lawrence county clerk office.mortgage remains undischarged,and the parties have ma d e no stipulation regarding the underlying debt and whether or not it has been satisfied.layo executed mortgage in april,securing a loan.it was recorded on may.the parties have stipulated that on january,fnb inadvertently discharged mortgage.
in may,layo filed a petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code,et.chapter.fnb subsequently filed a claim in the amount of to which layo consented,including it in his chapter plan 
the claim of fnb in the amount of is secured by a valid first mortgage against debtor real estate,which is debtor homestead the property.there are no arrears.debtor will make regular monthly payments directly to first national bank of northern new york 
schedule d of layo chapter plan,which lists creditors holding secured claims in his assets,indicates that the is secured by a mortgage recorded on february.although mortgage was executed before february,and mortgage was not executed until sometime thereafter,at the time it is clear from the record that both layo and fnb agreed that layo owed fnb and that the mortgage note was secured by a first mortgage interest in layo homestead property.with the recommendation of the trustee,the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york littlefield,confirmed layo chapter plan on october,the confirmation order.
in early,after layo stopped making principal and interest payments on his debt,fnb moved to lift the automatic stay and foreclose on the property.in response,in march,layo and the trustee filed a complaint that sought to avoid mortgage asserting that it had been discharged and was thus free and clear of the ostensibly satisfied lien and to receive a satisfaction and discharge of mortgage,which they claimed had been paid in full with what appear to have been the proceeds of the april loan secured by mortgage.in its answer,fnb admitted most of the factual allegations but raised as an affirmative defense that the bankruptcy court chapter confirmation order established fnb position as a secured creditor,and therefore,the doctrine of res judicata precluded further litigation on the issue.the bankruptcy court proceeded,through an adversary proceeding,to resolve the challenge with respect to mortgages and.
in its decision,the bankruptcy court concluded that res judicata did not apply.it granted both of the trustee requests.fnb appealed to the district court,which reversed the bankruptcy court,concluding that under the test set forth in corbett macdonald moving,cir,the chapter confirmation order met the requirements for res judicata.the district court concluded that the trustee causes of action seeking to void and set aside the mortgage liens were barred on that basis.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a district court review of a bankruptcy court decision,we make an independent and plenary review of the bankruptcy court decision,accepting its findings of fact unless clearly erroneous and reviewing its conclusions of law de novo.bell bell in re bell,cir.we review the dismissal of a claim on res judicata grounds de novo.see lawrence wink in re lawrence,cir.
res judicata under corbett 
in corbett,we set forth the test for res judicata in bankruptcy proceedings involving a plan of reorganization 
to determine whether the doctrine of res judicata bars a subsequent action,we consider whether the prior decision was a final judgment on the merits,the litigants were the same parties,the prior court was of competent jurisdiction,and the causes of action were the same.in the bankruptcy context,we ask as well whether an independent judgment in a separate proceeding would impair,destroy,challenge,or invalidate the enforceability or effectiveness of the reorganization plan.
corbett,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in this case,there is no dispute that the second and third prongs of the corbett analysis are satisfied.the litigants are the same and the case arrives before this court on appeal from an appropriate united states district court,which had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court decision.our analysis,therefore,focuses on the first and fourth prongs of the corbett test.
identical causes of action 
we turn to the fourth prong first.to satisfy the fourth prong of the corbett test for res judicata,there must be identity of causes of action,id.at,which means that the second action must involve the same claim or nucleus of operative fact as the first,interoceanica sound pilots,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the two court actions at issue here are a the confirmation proceedings for layo chapter plan concluded in october,and b the adversary proceeding challenging the validity of the mortgages commenced in march.the relevant claim to be analyzed in connection with those two actions is the asserted invalidity of the mortgage lien listed in the confirmed chapter plan.as the fifth circuit stated in in re howe,cir,the critical question for res judicata purposes is whether the party could or should have asserted the claim in the earlier proceeding.
the trustee argues that there is no identity of causes of action because the facts supporting the claim that the mortgage lien was invalid were not known to the trustee prior to confirmation of the chapter plan.as a result,argues the trustee,she was unaware at the time of the confirmation proceedings that she should have challenged fnb mortgage interests.the trustee argument does not carry the day.as a general rule,newly discovered evidence does not preclude the application of res judicata.exceptions to this rule exist when the evidence was either fraudulently concealed or when it could not have been discovered with due diligence.saud bank of new york,cir internal citation omitted.as the district court properly noted,checking the county records is the most basic type of due diligence.inspection would have uncovered the history of discharged and undischarged mortgage liens on the property.that is,the facts that form the basis for the trustee challenge to the mortgages were available in the county clerk office for anyone to see.the trustee had clear opportunities to object to the validity of the mortgage lien listed in the confirmed chapter fnb filed its claim in the amount of and when layo consented to and included that claim in his final chapter plan.
we therefore agree with the district court that the trustee had both a motive and opportunity to confirm the status of real estate liens affecting the debtor estate at or before the time that the plan was confirmed.the confirmation proceedings and the subsequent adversary proceedings to challenge the mortgages are thus considered identical under the fourth prong of our corbett analysis.
