background 
magi is a new york corporation with its principal place of business in long beach,new york.the vatican state is the territory over which the holy see of the roman catholic church exercises sovereignty.the vatican office of publications,acting on behalf of the vatican state,has the authority to enter into contracts with third parties for the commercial exploitation of the artwork and artifacts in the vatican library collection.defendant second renaissance,llc second renaissance is a limited liability company with its principal place of business in corona,california.defendant gerald colapinto is the president of second renaissance.
on may,the vatican office of publications and second renaissance entered into a master license agreement.the master license agreement stated that the vatican state owns or controls all artwork,artifacts,manuscripts,and items within or under the control of the vatican library,and that the vatican office of publications alone has the power to license the right to make reproductions and adaptations of items in the vatican library collection.under the master license agreement,the vatican office of publications granted to second renaissance the rights to produce and market specific lines of products based on reproductions of artifacts in the vatican library and,subject to certain conditions,to sublicense those rights.as to sublicensing,the master license agreement provided that second renaissance would 
have the right to sell,sublicense or assign the rights granted herein,provided that the proposed buyer,assignee sublicensee is identified by second renaissance in writing the buyer,sublicensee assignee is approved in writing by the vatican office of publications or is fifty percent or more owned or controlled by second renaissance,and the proposed buyer,sublicensee or assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement.
the master license agreement also contained a forum selection clause and a choice of law clause,which provided 
any disagreements between the vatican office of publications and second renaissance shall be resolved exclusively in the sovereign state of vatican city second renaissance hereby consents to jurisdiction in the sovereign state of vatican city.all disputes relating to this agreement between the vatican office of publications and second renaissance shall be governed by the laws of the sovereign state of vatican city,and second renaissance and the vatican office of publications hereby consent thereto.any proceedings shall be conducted in the english language.
on july,pursuant to the master license agreement,magi entered into seven sublicense agreements with second renaissance the sublicense agreements for the production by magi of candles,chocolates,confections,flowers,stamps,wrapping bags,and fundraising materials,which would all bear the name,logo,and seal of the vatican library the sublicense agreements were approved by the vatican office of publications,as required by the master license agreement.the sublicense agreements also all contained the following forum selection and choice of law clauses,which were identical to the ones contained in the master license agreement 
any disagreements between second renaissance and magi shall be resolved exclusively in the sovereign state of vatican city.second renaissance and magi each hereby consents to jurisdiction in the sovereign state of vatican city.all disputes relating to this agreement between second renaissance and magi shall be governed by the laws of the sovereign state of vatican city,and second renaissance and magi each hereby consents thereto.all proceedings shall be conducted in the english language.
the sublicense agreements also provided that if any conflict arose between the sublicense agreements and the master license agreement,the latter would control.
on july,magi filed suit against colapinto,second renaissance,and the vatican state in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.in its amended complaint,magi alleged that colapinto and second renaissance did not provide magi with the access to artwork and commercially usable images of the materials that second renaissance had,in turn,licensed from the vatican library.magi further alleged that colapinto and second renaissance had misrepresented the nature of colapinto relationship with the vatican state as well as the availability of certain images in the vatican library.magi also claimed that the vatican state was aware of second renaissance and colapinto purported misrepresentations,and that second renaissance and colapinto had acted as agents for the vatican state in the course of breaching the sublicense agreements.magi alleged fraud,negligence,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and conversion,and sought damages and rescission of the sublicense agreements on october,the vatican state filed separate motions to dismiss based on subject matter jurisdiction,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and the forum selection clauses forum non conveniens 
on august,after reviewing the amended complaint and declarations submitted by the parties,the district court mauskopf,granted the vatican state motion to dismiss for improper venue on the basis of the forum selection clauses in the sublicense agreements,and therefore found it unnecessary to decide the vatican state motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see magi xxi,stato della città del vaticano,d.in its memorandum and order,the district court identified five separate grounds for determining that the vatican state is a closely related party to second renaissance,and that it was foreseeable to magi that the vatican state would seek to enforce the forum selection clauses against magi.the district court summarized its reasoning as follows 
there are multiple grounds for this conclusion the vatican state interests in the sublicense agreements are derivative of and directly related to second renaissance conduct in entering into and allegedly violating those agreements second renaissance rights in the sublicense agreements are derivative of and depend on the rights it acquired from the vatican state the master license agreement entitled the vatican state to exercise significant control over the form and content of the sublicense agreements and plaintiff alleges the signatories second renaissance and colapinto are the vatican state agents for liability purposes and its claims against all three defendants are essentially identical.moreover,the vatican state may enforce the forum selection clause in the master license agreement as a signatory because plaintiff asserts claims for breach of contract on the theory that it is a beneficiary of that agreement.
id.at.because this memorandum and order disposed only of the claims against one defendant,the district court kuntz,issued an order for entry of final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b the order of final judgment was entered on february.magi then brought the instant appeal.

we apply a analysis to determine whether to dismiss a claim based on a forum selection clause 
the first inquiry is whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement.the second step requires us to classify the clause as mandatory or permissive,to decide whether the parties are required to bring any dispute to the designated forum or simply permitted to do so.part three asks whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the forum selection clause.
if the forum clause was communicated to the resisting party,has mandatory force and covers the claims and parties involved in the dispute,it is presumptively enforceable.the fourth,and final,step is to ascertain whether the resisting party has rebutted the presumption of enforceability by making a sufficiently strong showing that enforcement would be unreasonable or unjust,or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.
phillips,at quoting bremen,at internal citations and italics omitted.the district court determined that the forum selection clauses in the sublicense agreements were reasonably communicated and were mandatory,rather than permissive.magi xxi,d at.the parties do not contest these determinations.in addition,although magi argued that enforcement of the forum selection clauses here would be unreasonable or unjust before the district court,it does not raise that argument on appeal we therefore focus our analysis on the third factor whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the forum selection clause.phillips,at.
in general,the fact a party is a to an agreement is insufficient,standing alone,to preclude enforcement of a forum selection clause.aguas lenders recovery,llc suez,cir.in aguas lenders,we held that a successor in interest to a signatory of a contract is subject to the presumption of the enforceability of mandatory forum selection clauses in the contract.id.we reasoned that this conclusion would prevent parties to contracts from using evasive,formalistic means lacking economic substance to escape contractual obligations.id.we also noted that a forum selection clause involving sophisticated parties to an international transaction is an obligation that is calculated by parties into the cost of a contract.id.citing bremen,at.on this basis,we concluded that a forum selection clause is integral to the obligations of the overall contract,and a successor in interest should no more be able to evade it than any other obligation under the agreement.id.
the enforceability of forum selection clauses as to need not be limited to successors in interest.a literal approach to interpreting forum selection clauses an approach that always ignored affiliates of the signatories could undermine the contribution that such clauses have been praised for making to certainty in commercial transactions.adams raintree vacation,llc,cir.forum selection clauses have the salutary effect of dispelling any confusion about where suits arising from the contract must be brought and defended,sparing litigants the time and expense of pretrial motions to determine the correct forum and conserving judicial resources that otherwise would be devoted to deciding those motions.carnival cruise lines,shute,d.they also further vital interests of the justice system,including judicial economy and efficiency,stewart,ricoh,d kennedy,concurring,ensure that parties will not be required to defend lawsuits in fora,and promote uniformity of result.hodes achille lauro ed altri gestione,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted,overruled on other grounds by lauro lines chasser,d.as a result,where the alleged conduct of the nonparties is closely related to the contractual relationship,a range of transaction participants,parties and nonparties,should benefit from and be subject to forum selection clauses.holland am.line wärtsilä,cir internal quotation marks omitted 
we hold that a to a contract containing a forum selection clause may enforce the forum selection clause against a signatory when the is closely related to another signatory.id in such instances,the relationship between the and that latter signatory must be sufficiently close that the enforcement of the forum selection clause is foreseeable to the signatory against whom the wishes to enforce the forum selection clause see hugel of lloyd,cir in re optimal,d.as the signatories to the contract have already assented to a forum selection clause and thus have agreed to litigate disputes relating to the contract in the chosen forum,this holding comports with the legitimate expectations of the parties,manifested in their freely negotiated agreement.bremen,at.
here,the vatican state was closely related to second renaissance by virtue of the master license agreement.in addition,the vatican state relationship with second renaissance was sufficiently close with regard to the licensing of reproductions of items in the vatican library collection that it was foreseeable to magi that the vatican state would seek to enforce the forum selection clauses in the sublicense agreements several observations inform our reasoning.first,the sublicense agreements stated that their form and content,as well as second renaissance right to assign the rights granted by the sublicense agreements to magi,were subject to the approval of the vatican state.second,all of the artwork,artifacts,and manuscripts made available to magi for reproduction were owned by the vatican state and made available through the vatican library.third,the sublicense agreements stated that any products made by magi were subject to approval by the vatican state.fourth,magi interests in the sublicense agreements were wholly derivative of the rights second renaissance acquired from the vatican state through the master license agreement.fifth,the sublicense agreements stated that,if any conflicts between the sublicense agreements and the master license agreement arose,the latter would control.sixth,the master license agreement and sublicense agreements had identical forum selection clauses.lastly,magi alleged that second renaissance and the vatican state acted in concert while fraudulently inducing magi to enter into the sublicense agreements 
in sum,the vatican state was known by magi as the source of the contractual authority granted to magi by the sublicense agreements.the sublicense agreements also specifically provided for the extensive and continuing involvement of the vatican state in the execution of magi obligations and authority under the sublicense agreements.as a result of these considerations and the other factors described above,the vatican state and second renaissance were closely related parties,and it was foreseeable that the vatican state would enforce the forum selection clauses in the sublicense agreements against magi.magi claims were thus properly dismissed by the district court.
magi also argues that the choice of law clauses in the sublicense agreements have a broader ambit than the forum selection clauses and so this dispute is not covered by the latter.however,magi did not raise this argument before the district court.see magi xxi,d at plaintiff does not argue that the forum selection clauses do not apply to the claims in th
