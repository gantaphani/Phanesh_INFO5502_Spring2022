the plaintiff,jonesfilm,appeals the district court dismissal of its trademark action against the defendants,who produced and distributed the movie the first weeks,for failure to join an indispensable party.the plaintiff alleges that the first weeks infringes its trademark in the movie weeks.the defendants respond that they purchased the right to make a movie using the trademark weeks after the plaintiff sold that right to another party.several years after weeks was released,the plaintiff transferred the right to produce a sequel based on weeks to ntts,a movie producer located in the united kingdom and a to the plaintiff suit.ntts paid for the right to produce a first sequel,which was released under the title another weeks.in addition to giving ntts the right to produce the first sequel,the plaintiff gave ntts a conditional option to produce additional movies that was contingent on the good faith negotiation of a compensation and credit agreement with the plaintiff.ntts in turn transferred this conditional option to an entity that is now owned by the defendants.
the defendants produced and distributed the first weeks,which was advertised as a prequel to weeks.the plaintiff was not contacted by any party prior to the release of the first weeks and was initially unaware that the film had been made and released.after discovering the film,the plaintiff brought an action alleging trademark infringement and various state law claims against the defendants.the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff action for failure to join an indispensable party.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the plaintiff complaint.it concluded that ntts is a necessary party under.a because the adjudication of the plaintiff action would affect ntts contractual rights.the district court reasoned that determining whether the defendants had the right to make the first weeks would affect ntts interests because it would require defining the scope of the rights conferred by the plaintiff to ntts.the district court also found that ntts could not be joined as a party because the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over ntts.it then concluded based on.b that ntts is indispensable to deciding the plaintiff action.
we respectfully disagree with the district court because we conclude that deciding the plaintiff claim will not affect ntts interests.because it is undisputed that no party satisfied the condition precedent to making an additional movie by contacting the plaintiff before making the first weeks,ntts does not have a colorable interest in the subject matter of this litigation,the right to make an additional movie using the trademark weeks.moreover,as this action can be decided by the district court without resolving any disputed issues of fact with respect to ntts conduct,this action need not affect the determination of whether ntts fulfilled any of its contractual obligations with third parties.
because we find that ntts is not a necessary party,we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiff case for failure to join an indispensable party under rule.therefore,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
