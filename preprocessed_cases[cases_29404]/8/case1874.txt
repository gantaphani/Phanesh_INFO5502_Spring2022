background 
amex is a publicly traded financial services corporation.american express financial advisors aefa is a subsidiary of amex and provides a variety of financial products,including insurance and annuities.aefa subsidiary,ids life insurance company,sells insurance products and invests the premiums in fixed income securities with a broad range of maturities.because the returns from these investments are used to pay benefits,the returns must exceed the benefits payable for ids life to remain profitable.
a the original complaint 
we describe in the margin the relevant positions in amex held by the individual appellees the original class action complaint was filed against amex and chenault,golub,hubers,and cracchiolo on july,one day before the end of the pertinent limitations period the original complaint included as class members all persons who purchased,converted,exchanged or otherwise acquired amex common stock between july,and july.
the following was alleged by the complaint.beginning in,amex commenced investing in,instruments such as termed junk bonds and collateralized debt obligations cdos ultimately,aefa portfolio contained billion worth of cdos,exceeding the portfolio diversification standards followed by most insurance companies with regard to investments.
default rates in the bond market increased during the third quarter and throughout.at the end of the fourth quarter,amex announced a million in its investments.in connection with the,chenault publicly stated that the high yield issue was the most significant item in the quarter for aefa and that g oing forward,amex will continue to invest directly in bonds because of their generally high overall returns,even though these returns came with higher risk.on april,an amex press release announced that first quarter earnings per share were expected to be eighteen percent below the previous year earnings due to million in losses from the and sale of certain securities held in aefa investment portfolio.despite assurances by amex that losses in amex portfolio for the remainder of would likely be far lower than those in the first quarter,amex announced on july,a steep decline in its second quarter earnings due to a charge of million.this charge reflected in aefa portfolio and losses from rebalancing the portfolio towards securities.in response to this additional,chenault stated that it is now apparent that our analysis of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter did not fully comprehend the risk of amex investments during a period of persistently high default rates.
based on these allegations,the complaint alleged three material misstatements omissions of material fact i failing to disclose that amex had invested in a risky portfolio of or junk bonds that carried the potential for substantial losses if default rates in the junk bond market increased ii failing to disclose the true extent of amex total exposure as a result of the risky portfolio after amex wrote down its junk bond portfolio by million in april and iii failing to disclose that amex was taking a substantial and unnecessary risk by investing in securities involving complex risk factors that amex management and personnel did not fully comprehend.these allegations formed the basis of claims for damages asserted under section b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,section a of the exchange act,a,and common law fraud.
with regard to scienter,the original complaint alleged that appellees either knew the statements disseminated by amex were materially false and misleading or rendered misleading by omission of material facts or recklessly disseminated the statements in disregard of facts amex either knew or should have known.there was also a appellees had a motive to make false statements to increase the value of their call options,and that chenault,hubers,and cracchiolo had a motive to make false statements because they sold amex stock during the class period.
b the amended complaint 
the amended the consolidated amended class action filed on december.it shortened the class period by eight days.the amended complaint described the pertinent events as follows.although amex disclosed the amount invested in investments,it did not alter its investment strategy in response to high default rates in the market beginning in and continuing through.moreover,amex did not report significant losses or take significant charges despite the erosion of value of the securities held by aefa.while admitting some deterioration in its portfolio in,amex form continued to describe aefa asset quality as strong.ultimately,however,in the first quarter,amex wrote off million in charges but maintained that subsequent writedowns were expected to be substantially lower.nevertheless,one quarter later,amex followed with a million for securities.after this,amex announced that,consistent with industry standards,it would reduce its investments to seven percent of its portfolio from the ten to twelve percent previously maintained.in august,amex centralized risk controls in the corporate risk management committee to supplement the risk management capabilities resident within its business segments.
the amended complaint stated that the action arises out of the materially false and misleading representations and omissions contained in the public statements of american express and made by its senior officers and directors.this conduct disguised amex true operating results,lack of management controls,and huge losses suffered in risky junk bonds 
the amended complaint set out four primary misrepresentations or omissions of material fact,namely that amex misrepresented amex investments as conservative when,in fact,they were concealed the extent of amex exposure failed to disclose the lack of risk management controls and failed to disclose the lack of proper valuation methods,and the fact that amex accounting was not in accordance with gaap generally accepted accounting principles.
the amended complaint added details not present in the original complaint,again as follows.first,because so much of aefa portfolio consisted of to twelve was a need to monitor these investments closely in order to determine current value and assess their risks accurately.nevertheless,aefa failed to adequately monitor and evaluate the extent of its exposure during the class period.furthermore,amex lacked proper valuation methods as evidenced by aefa failure to update the valuation of its investments in the face of steep market declines and its repeated reliance on recommendations and prices improperly provided by securities brokers.moreover,amex represented in its form that m anagement establishes and oversees implementation of policies and monitors aggregate risk exposure on an ongoing basis,but no risk management controls were in fact in place.
second,the suspect valuation methods and lack of risk controls caused amex to misrepresent its,investments as conservative and thereby to conceal the extent of its exposure.for example,in its annual report,incorporated by reference in its form,amex stated that i nvestment in fixed income securities provides aefa with a dependable and targeted margin between the interest rate earned on investments and the interest rate credited to clients accounts.moreover,chenault told investors in that because amex risk management staff are among the best in the business and have continually improved amex processes over the years,amex would withstand the economic downturn.however,the inadequate incorrect procedures amex used to value and evaluate aefa holdings in fact made it impossible to accurately assess the portfolio risk.
third,the amended complaint enumerated specific departures from gaap in amex valuation techniques that led to a failure to account for impairments in the value and to its disregard for adverse events impacting the,failing to specify the probabilities of losses in investments and failing to take a provision of losses in its investments in interim financial statements.nevertheless,amex annual report stated that amex is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of its consolidated financial statements,which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
c district court decision 
the district court granted amex motion to dismiss the amended complaint.first,it held that the amended complaint included new claims that did not relate back to the original complaint and were therefore.it noted that the claims in both the original and amended complaints relied on the same statutory b and a of the exchange that the amended complaint alleged different facts.of the four primary misrepresentations or omissions alleged in the amended complaint i misrepresenting amex investments as conservative when,in fact,they were ii concealing the extent of amex exposure iii failing to disclose the lack of risk management controls and iv failing to disclose the lack of proper valuation methods and the fact that amex accounting was not in accordance with court held that only i and ii amplified and expanded the claims made in the original complaint and therefore related back to that complaint because the original complaint simply alleged that amex did not fully comprehend the risks associated with amex holdings,the court held that iii and iv have no such mooring in the initial pleading and involve different operative facts.therefore,the district court held that they did not relate back.
after dismissing those two claims as,the district court assessed the merits of the remaining two claims.with regard to the first alleged portrayal of its investments as conservative rather than court found that the parties agree that defendants fully disclosed the risks of amex investments.the district court then dismissed this claim because there was no material misrepresentation because appellants disagreed only with defendants characterization of those risks.as to the second alleged the extent of amex court held that although certain statements related to this allegation might be actionable appellants had failed to allege scienter adequately on the part of any defendant.
on march,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint by memorandum order.both the memorandum and its corresponding docket entry granted leave to replead scienter as to defendants statements that the court had found to be potentially actionable.on april,a clerk judgment was entered in the docket,stating that for the reasons given in the march order,defendants motion to dismiss is granted,the amended complaint is dismissed with leave to replead,any pending motions are moot accordingly,the case is closed.despite the apparent right to replead,on april,notices of the right to appeal were mailed to plaintiffs counsel.on april,plaintiffs counsel communicated with the district court chambers and was informed by a law clerk that judge pauley had intended to enter a final judgment from the march order.only after filing a motion to vacate,reopen,or otherwise modify the judgment would appellants be allowed to file a new complaint.
on april,appellants moved for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal to decide whether to appeal or amend their complaint as to its scienter allegations.appellees responded the following day,arguing that any notice would be premature because an order dismissing a complaint with leave to replead is not a final order.appellees also asked the court to set a deadline for the plaintiffs to replead.the district court entered an order on may,stating that the april order dismissing the amended complaint with leave to replead was not a final judgment.the order also set a deadline of may,for appellants to file a second amended complaint.on may,a few hours before the court order was filed,appellants filed a notice of appeal from the court march order and april judgment.
on may,appellants,acknowledging that no final judgment had yet been entered,informed the court that they did not intend to amend the complaint and asked it to enter a final judgment in this action so that lead plaintiffs can proceed with an appeal to the second circuit without delay.on may,the court entered an order stating that the plaintiffs had decided not to amend the complaint and directing the clerk of court to enter final judgment.on june,the clerk entered a judgment dismissing the complaint for the reasons given in the may order.plaintiffs never appealed the june judgment.
discussion 
a appellate jurisdiction 
amex argues that we do not have appellate jurisdiction because appellants filed a notice of appeal only from the judgment of the district court dismissing the amended complaint with leave to replead and not from the subsequent order dismissing the complaint.nevertheless,we conclude that we have jurisdiction.
under fed.a,a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or before the entry of the judgment or treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.the supreme court has interpreted rule a to permit a notice of appeal from a nonfinal decision to operate as a notice of appeal from the final judgment only when a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.firstier mortgage investors mortgage ins,d emphasis in original.this holding does not mean,however,that rule a protects only those appellants who appeal prematurely from decisions that will be final once the court enters judgment in a separate document under rule.in explaining the scope of rule a,firstier itself favorably discussed ruby secretary of navy,in which 
the appellant filed his notice of appeal from an order of the district court that dismissed the complaint without dismissing the action.the court of appeals determined that the ruling was not a final decision under,because the ruling left open an opportunity for the appellant to save his cause of action by amending his complaint.nonetheless,the court ruled that the notice of appeal from the nonfinal ruling could serve as a notice of appeal from the subsequently filed final order dismissing the action.
id.at.citing ruby secretary of navy,cir.thus,rule a protects the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment,while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment.id.at.
a dismissal with leave to amend is a order and not appealable.connecticut bank fluor,cir blanco united states,cir elfenbein gulf western,cir.however,an appellant can render such a order final and appealable by disclaiming any intent to amend.kittay kornstein,cir filing notice of intent not to replead in district court renders court dismissal with leave to replead final and allows review of the dismissal by court of appeals fluor,at court had jurisdiction over appeal from dismissal with leave to amend within twenty days because appellant disclaimer at oral argument on appeal of intent to amend effectively cures the nonfinal character of the judgment from which the appeal has been taken although the better practice would have been for counsel to have included in the record on appeal a written disclaimer of intent to amend divittorio equidyne extractive,cir of district court dismissal with leave to amend cured by appellant disclaimer of intent to amend before district and appellate court 
applying firstier in light of our practice of allowing disclaimers of intent to amend to render a judgment final,appellants notice of appeal is effective.the judgment from which the notice of appeal was filed was but would become final when the plaintiffs disclaimed their intent to amend the complaint.firstier insulates from jurisdictional challenge a premature appeal of a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.at.here there was no need for a subsequent judgment because appellants appealed from a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by a disclaimer of intent to amend.appellants made this disclaimer,thereby rendering the dismissal a final order and causing their premature notice of appeal to ripen within the meaning of rule a.
it is true that the district court had entered an order setting a deadline for repleading before the plaintiffs disclaimed their intent to do so.nevertheless,this order was an amendment to the dismissal with leave to replead,which was the decision that ripened into a final judgment.moreover,as noted supra,firstier favorably gave an example almost identical to the fact pattern in this of illustrate the proper application of rule a.firstier,at.the present case,like firstier,is one in which a litigant confusion is understandable,and permitting the notice of appeal to become effective when judgment is entered does not catch the appellee by surprise.little would be accomplished by prohibiting us from reaching the merits of this case.firstier,at.in particular,we see no benefit to finding a notice of appeal untimely where,as here,appellant intention to appeal from a final order was known to both the opposing party and the court,and where the only impediment to appealability was appellant own waivable right to amend its complaint.in these circumstances,there was no harm to appellee that resulted from the failure to file a second notice of appeal 
b relation back of the amended complaint 
appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing two claims in the amended complaint as because they did not relate back to the original complaint applying a de novo standard of review,we vacate the judgment of the district court.
standard of review 
many of our relevant decisions do not discuss the standard of review of district court decisions under rule c.see,stevelman alias research,cir siegel converters transportation,cir see also tiller atlantic coast line.however,those decisions that do address the standard of review hold it to be abuse of discretion.tho dinh tran alphonse hotel,cir we review a district court decision that an amendment relates back for an abuse of discretion.nettis levitt,cir we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision as to whether the rule c standard has been met.wilson fairchild republic,cir whether a new claim in amended pleading relates back to an original complaint lies in the district court discretion and it is for abuse of that discretion that we review the district court decision.
the use of the abuse of discretion standard may have resulted from applying the standard of review for denials of leave to amend under rule a to cases arising under rule c.both tho dinh tran and nettis relied upon wilson,while wilson in turn relied upon leonelli pennwalt,cir,and yerdon henry,cir,for the abuse of discretion standard.those latter cases,however,addressed the standard of review of a denial of leave to amend a complaint under rule a leonelli,at although the claim in the requested amendment arguably arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original misrepresentation,namely plaintiff termination,and thus could be said to relate back to the original complaint,denial of the amendment under these circumstances does not amount to an abuse of the district court discretion.yerdon,at we review the decision not to allow an amendment for abuse of discretion.
another source of confusion about the proper standard of review of rule c decisions is that some courts have a different standard of review for these than for decisions under rule c.rule c provides 
an amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision rule c is satisfied and,within days,the party to be brought in by amendment a has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits,and b knew or should have known that,but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party,the action would have been brought against the party.
in percy san francisco,cir,the ninth circuit noted that the standard of review of decisions under rule c is abuse of discretion,because such decisions require a court to exercise its discretion in deciding whether the circumstances of a given case are such that it would be unfair to permit the plaintiff to add a new defendant.
in contrast,a relation back decision under rule c does not involve an exercise of discretion.a court reviewing a rule c decision performs a function analogous to that performed by an appellate court reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b.in reviewing a b dismissal,we ask whether the facts provable under the allegations of the complaint would support a valid claim for relief in reviewing a rule c relation back decision,we ask whether the facts provable under the amended complaint arose out of conduct alleged in the original complaint.see stevelman,at.if so,the amended complaint will relate back.because appellate courts seem to be in as good a position as the district court to make this decision,percy,at,the standard of review under rule c should arguably be de novo,stevelman,at and several other circuits have so held 
by way of contrast,abuse of discretion is a standard of review suitable to district court decisions that balance several factors,often including equitable considerations of matters specific to the conduct of the particular action.in such matters,a district court has a comparative advantage over an appellate court.a district court has a familiarity with the whole case and a refined sense of the legitimate needs of the parties,and is therefore better able than an appellate tribunal to choose among multiple reasonable but incompatible results.
in our view,the relation back issue is more analogous to a dismissal on the pleadings than a balancing of factors involving the conduct of a lawsuit.if facts provable under the amended complaint arose out of the conduct alleged in the original complaint,relation back is mandatory.the proper standard of review of rule c decisions is therefore de novo and we so hold 
legal standard for.
rule c provides that a n amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.the purpose of rule is to provide maximum opportunity for each claim to be decided on its merits rather than on procedural technicalities.siegel,at quoting wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at.for a newly added action to relate back,the basic claim must have arisen out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading tho dinh tran,at quoting schiavone fortune,d.under rule,the central inquiry is whether adequate notice of the matters raised in the amended pleading has been given to the opposing party within the statute of limitations by the general fact situation alleged in the original pleading.stevelman,at internal quotations and citation omitted.where the amended complaint does not allege a new claim but renders prior allegations more definite and precise,relation back occurs.id.at.
for example,where an initial complaint alleges a basic scheme of defrauding investors by misrepresenting earnings and profitability,an allegation of accounts receivable manipulation in an amend
