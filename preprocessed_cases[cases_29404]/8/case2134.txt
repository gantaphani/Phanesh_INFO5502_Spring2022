on this expedited interlocutory appeal,we review an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge denying plaintiff nickolas zervos motion for an order preliminarily enjoining defendants verizon new york,verizon,empire healthchoice empire,and united healthcare,united from refusing to provide insurance coverage for a particular medical treatment.
we hold,inter alia,that a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,and there is no exception to this rule for a case in which the district court has heard no live testimony and that the district court,which heard no live testimony,did not abuse its discretion in denying zervos motion for preliminary injunctive relief because zervos had not least on the record as it currently there was either a likelihood that he would succeed on the merits of any of his claims,or that there were sufficiently serious questions as to the merits of his claims to be fair grounds for litigation.
accordingly,we affirm the order of the district court denying zervos motion for a preliminary injunction.
background 
zervos is an employee of verizon,and at all relevant times he has been entitled to health insurance under a plan the plan or plan sponsored by verizon,carried by empire,and administered by united.in march,zervos was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer,for which he underwent a radical mastectomy and was treated with conventional chemotherapy.this chemotherapy regimen concluded in october,at which point zervos treating physicians recommended that he undergo a different,a single cycle of chemotherapy,administered in conjunction with a transplant of bone marrow stem cells hdct.
zervos requested that empire that it would pay for hdct,but empire refused to do so by letter dated october,stating that hdct is experimental and investigational in breast cancer stage iv,the stage to which zervos breast cancer had apparently advanced the october letter invited zervos to appeal,and he did so.
empire then sent zervos relevant records to an external reviewer in this case,thomas spitzer,director of the bone marrow transplant program and deputy chief of the unit at massachusetts general hospital.spitzer filed a report that concluded that there are no convincing data to show that hdct is a superior approach to conventional chemotherapy alone for male patients with metastatic breast cancer.
empire abides by the decisions of its external reviewers regarding whether coverage should be provided in a particular case.accordingly,by letter dated october,empire denied zervos appeal,explaining we are unable to authorize hdct for the following reason there are no convincing data to show that hdct is superior to conventional chemotherapy alone for males with metastatic breast cancer.hdct remains denied as experimental and investigational.
on january,zervos initiated this action in the district court.his complaint alleged violations of new york law,new york city law,and three federal employee retirement income security act of erisa,et title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,as amended,et and the americans with disabilities act ada,et.after filing his complaint,zervos moved by order to show cause for an order preliminarily enjoining verizon,empire,united from denying refusing to and provide coverage for hdct to zervos on the grounds that it is investigational or experimental,or that there are no convincing data to show that hdct is superior to conventional chemotherapy alone for males with metastatic breast cancer,or for any other reason it is otherwise excluded under his health and medical insurance plan,and compelling empire to allow and promptly pay for zervos claims for hdct and associated procedures.
following a flurry of recusals,the cause was assigned to judge daniels.for the reasons set forth in a thorough memorandum opinion and order,see zervos verizon,civ,wl,judge daniels denied zervos motion for a preliminary injunction.this timely and expedited interlocutory appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we have often we review a district court decision on a motion for preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.see,sg cowen sec.messih,cir.zervos argues,however,that our review is de novo where the district court has considered strictly a documentary record,with no live testimony.appellant brief at citing donovan bierwirth,cir.
before considering zervos argument,we pause briefly to clarify the meaning of three important novo review,review,and review.
de novo review is review without deference see salve regina college russell,d when de novo review is compelled,no form of appellate deference is acceptable.when we review a district court decision de novo,we take note of it,and study the reasoning on which it is based.however,our review is independent and plenary as the latin term suggests,we look at the matter anew,as though it had come to the courts for the first time.see black law dictionary ed defining de novo as a new and afresh.
clear error is the standard under which appellate courts review a district court factual findings.see ornelas united states,d clear error is a term of art derived from rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,and applies when reviewing questions of fact.it is a deferential standard of review grounded,inter alia,on the belief that district courts have a good deal of expertise when it comes to.anderson city of bessemer city,d.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.accord city of bessemer city,at.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.
finally,there is review this is a second,more complicated,species of deferential appellate review.when a district court is vested with discretion as to a certain matter,it is not required by law to make a particular decision.rather,the district court is empowered to make a its falls within a range of permissible decisions.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions 
with these definitions in mind,we turn to zervos argument that there is an exception here to our customary review.in orvis higgins,cir frank,we held that the court of appeals may review without is de only a district court legal determinations,but its factual determinations as well,provided that such factual determinations are not based on live testimony the orvis rule.see id.at.a subsequent generation of cases extended the orvis rule,holding that when a district court decision on a preliminary injunction motion is not based on live testimony,the court of appeals may review the decision is whether to grant or deny the preliminary deferentially than our customary standard would otherwise permit the live testimony exception.see state of nuclear regulatory comm n,cir collecting cases that apply the live testimony exception and noting that this line of cases follow s orvis.
the rationale for the orvis rule is that when a district judge factual determinations are based entirely on documentary evidence,we can evaluate the written record as well as he can.citizens comm.for faraday wood lindsay,cir.the basis for the live testimony exception applicable to review of preliminary injunction rulings is all but identical where th e district court did not hear live witnesses,whose credibility generally plays an essential part in its determination,and the case was decided on the basis of pleadings,affidavits and depositions,which the court of appeals is in as good a position as the district judge to read and interpret,the appellate court is not limited to reversal for abuse of discretion.donovan,at.
it is thus apparent that the rationale for the orvis rule suggested the live testimony exception.but the logic by which the live testimony exception was derived from the orvis rule is a bit obscure,never so far as we know having been articulated.indeed,it is not obvious how the orvis rule under which a district court factual determinations are reviewed de novo might have compelled elaboration of the live testimony exception under which a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is reviewed de novo.the decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction involves more than factual determinations which under the orvis rule are reviewed de novo and legal conclusions which are always reviewed de novo.it involves an exercise of discretion.see post at.this exercise of discretion is vested in the district court and reviewed for abuse,and nothing in the orvis rule seems to suggest otherwise.
we need not attempt to illuminate this darkness.the question of how our court extrapolated the live testimony exception from the orvis rule is not currently relevant.rather,what matters here is only this as explained below,because the live testimony exception was based entirely on the orvis rule,the demise of that rule means that the live testimony exception is no longer viable.
the orvis rule was unambiguously repudiated by the amendments to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure the amendments.see.a findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.emphasis added see also,advisory committee notes,amendment explaining that the amendments aimed to displace our held that no deference had to be accorded to district court factual determinations in cases in which live testimony was not heard because the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial court to review a purely documentary record.as the supreme court has noted,orvis itself was one of the authorities that was swept aside in the wake of the amendments 
v arious courts of appeals have on occasion asserted the theory that an appellate court may exercise de novo review over findings not based on credibility determinations.see,orvis higgins,cir this theory has an impressive genealogy,having first been articulated in an opinion written by judge frank and subscribed to by judge augustus hand,see orvis higgins,supra,but it is impossible to trace the theory lineage back to the text of rule a,which states straightforwardly that findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.that the rule goes on to emphasize the special deference to be paid credibility determinations does not alter its clear command rule a does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings from the obligation of a court of appeals to accept a district court findings unless clearly erroneous.
city of bessemer city,at.selected citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,in the years since the amendments became law,panels of this court have emphasized that the current rule is circuit precedents that invoke the orvis rule.see,weissmann freeman,cir.moreover,we have not hesitated to disregard even circuit precedents that apply the orvis rule see paddington attiki importers,cir squibb,cir.
because the orvis rule was the only prop that supported the live testimony exception,that exception has been irredeemably undermined.we therefore hold that a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is not generally reviewed de novo rather,such decisions are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,and there is no exception to this rule for cases in which the district court heard no live testimony.
in reaching this conclusion,we are aware that decisions applying the live testimony exception have occupied something of a prominent place in our jurisprudence.see,bridgeport coalition for fair representation city of bridgeport,cir.declining to apply the live testimony exception because the district court held hearings vacated on other grounds by,d.and we are of course mindful of the rule that one panel is ordinarily bound by prior panel decisions.see,rocket jewelry box,noble gift packaging,cir.
however,the principle of fidelity to prior panel decisions does not apply when the sole basis of those,the orvis been overruled by a change in the federal rules of civil procedure.see,weissmann,at reich sabia,cir holding that a prior panel decision is not binding on a subsequent panel where a statute undermining the prior panel rationale was passed after the prior panel decision.see generally williams ashland eng g,cir an existing panel decision may be undermined by controlling authority,subsequently announced,abrogated on other grounds by carpenters local union united states fid.guar,cir.
moreover,we have often noted that one panel of this court is not bound by a prior panel decision whose rationale is overruled,implicitly or expressly,by the supreme court.united states ianniello,cir vacated on other grounds by united states indelicato,cir.such is the case here.the supreme court in anderson made it clear that the orvis rule has been toppled law that has been built entirely atop as the live testimony necessarily fall with it.
in sum,because the live testimony exception is no longer viable,we may displace the district court decision to deny zervos motion for a preliminary injunction only if we conclude that that decision amounted to an abuse of discretion we now turn to that question.
likelihood of success on the serious questions going to the merits 
a party seeking a preliminary injunction ordinarily must show a that it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction and b either i a likelihood of success on the merits or ii sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant favor see,polymer technology mimran,cir.
we begin by considering the second set of factors likelihood of success on the merits and sufficiently serious questions going to the merits.as to these,our conclusions are straightforward.
first,for substantially the reasons stated by the district court,we believe that zervos has not yet demonstrated that there is even a remote possibility that he will be entitled to relief on the basis of his ada claim.see zervos,wl,at.
second,we are convinced that zervos has not shown a likelihood of success on his title vii crux of which is that empire has discriminated on the basis of sex in its provision of coverage for hdct.the district court found that empire has covered or not covered hdct without regard to the sex of those that apply for it.see id.at.we perceive no clear error in this factual finding,and therefore we agree with the district court that zervos has not established that there is any chance that his title vii claim may be meritorious.see id.
finally,we agree with the district court that zervos has not least on the administrative record,see miller united welfare fund,cir review of a decision of a plan administrator under the arbitrary and capricious standard is limited to the administrative record that there is any realistic possibility that he may be entitled to relief on his erisa claim.the district court found that empire technological assessment committee tac decided after a march meeting that it would no longer cover hdct,and that tac made this decision only after review ing the scientific data available to them and considering all of the medical evidence of hdct unproven benefit.id.at.moreover,the tac concluded,on an adequate record,that hdct was not superior to conventional therapy,empire denied coverage on this basis,and the district court upheld the reasonableness of empire decision on this ground.
in so ruling,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that zervos erisa claim is insufficiently substantial to suppo
