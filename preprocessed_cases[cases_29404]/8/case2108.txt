in this litigation commenced under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia of,et,plaintiff first city,first city holds an unsatisfied default judgment against rafidain bank rafidain,and seeks to collect that judgment from central bank of iraq central bank on the theory that central bank is rafidain alter ego.rafidain appeals an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,refusing to vacate an order of civil contempt that had been entered to compel rafidain compliance with discovery demands directed to the alter ego question.rafidain appeals the order on the grounds that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction and that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking because,even if the fsia afforded jurisdiction in the underlying litigation involving a loan agreement and letters of credit,rafidain is no longer a party to that action and there is no alternative jurisdictional basis for compelling rafidain to submit to discovery in the united states.
we affirm,without deciding whether rafidain is or has been a party,on the ground that because jurisdiction under the fsia existed to decide the underlying litigation involving a loan agreement and letters of credit,the fsia continues to confer jurisdiction for proceedings in aid of that money judgment.
we also affirm the district court ruling that in serving certain discovery notices,first city effected personal service on rafidain.
background 
in,first city filed suit against rafidain and central bank,as rafidain alter ego,to recover more than million in unpaid principal and interest on defaulted letters of credit issued by rafidain,iraq commercial bank.the district court martin,entered default judgment for million against both defendants on april.a year later,both defendants moved to vacate the defaults central bank motion was granted on the basis that service had been insufficient,but rafidain motion was denied.see first city,rafidain,civ,wl.first city subsequently served central bank for the second time with the summons and an amended complaint,thereby commencing a new action against central bank.central bank moved to dismiss the amended complaint on grounds of sovereign immunity.
in connection with central bank motion to dismiss,first city requested discovery on its contention that central bank is the alter ego of rafidain,and served both banks with interrogatories and document requests bearing on that issue.central bank provided some responses in february,and some more in april,but has yet to fully comply.rafidain did not respond at all.in july,first city issued and served a subpoena and a set of document requests on iraq permanent representative to the united nations in new york,as rafidain registered agent.rafidain did not respond to the subpoena.
in june,central bank renewed its motion to dismiss on several grounds,including lack of jurisdiction.first city opposed the motion on the ground that it had been hamstrung in gathering evidence by the banks,and separately filed a motion to compel additional responses.at the hearing on the motion to dismiss,the district court rakoff,granted central bank motion to dismiss with prejudice on grounds of sovereign immunity,without expressly deciding first city motion to compel.first city appealed.
on july,this court remanded with the following instructions 
because rafidain is a party to this suit,has been found to fit within the fsia commercial activity exception and because first city has a judgment against rafidain,allowing first city to seek further discovery from rafidain would not intrude upon the sovereign immunity,if any,of rafidain.the district court should have permitted full discovery against rafidain,which would have allowed first city a fair opportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery without further impinging on central bank immunity.following discovery from rafidain,the district court would then have been in a better position to assess whether discovery from central bank on the alter ego question was sufficiently likely to be productive as to warrant compelling additional jurisdictional discovery.we believe that the court failure to take such a course,when coupled with the dismissal of the complaint,was an abuse of discretion.
accordingly,the district court order granting central bank motion to dismiss is vacated.on remand,the district court is instructed to permit first city to conduct full discovery against rafidain.after such discovery,the district court should then determine whether there is an adequate factual record on which to rule whether central bank was rafidain alter ego,or whether further discovery against central bank on the jurisdictional question is warranted.

after the remand,first city served rafidain with a rule subpoena duces tecum seeking jurisdictional discovery on the alter ego issue the subpoena.rafidain,which argues that it was no longer a party to this action and was not subject to the court jurisdiction,did not respond to the subpoena.on november,first city moved to hold rafidain in contempt.first city also moved to compel central bank to respond to discovery on the ground that first city had been unable to obtain discovery from rafidain.concurrently,central bank renewed its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the district court did not order central bank to comply with jurisdictional discovery,but denied central bank motion to dismiss because rafidain may yet seek to purge its civil contempt and provide the requested discovery that could support plaintiff alter ego theory.first city,rafidain bank,d.
first city motion for contempt was granted,and an order to show cause against rafidain was entered on november.id.at.rafidain did not appear or respond.almost a year later,on november,the district court held rafidain in civil contempt and imposed a fine of per day,to continue until such time as rafidain purged its default.id.on another front,first city served a subpoena in december seeking alter ego documents from richards,counsel for central bank and previous counsel of record for rafidain.first city,rafidain bank,et.
rafidain at last appeared with new counsel on june,than seven months after the contempt order had been entered against it,and for the first time since the action was recommenced against central moved to vacate the civil contempt order on the grounds that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction to enforce the subpoena.rafidain took no steps to purge its contempt.
two days later,first city responded by serving a subpoena duces tecum on rafidain counsel seeking,pursuant to,discovery from rafidain and restraint of assets in aid of enforcing the default judgment against rafidain the subpoena.id.rafidain moved to quash this subpoena on the ground of improper service,which motion was denied.id.at 
on november,the district court denied rafidain motion to vacate the contempt order,in part on the ground that it was constrained by this court ruling that rafidain remained a party to the action.see first city,at.the denial was framed as follows 
in moving to vacate the court order of november,holding rafidain in civil contempt for failure to comply with the rafidain subpoena,rafidain argues,first and foremost,that the court lacked authority to impose such an order because rafidain by that time was no longer a party to this lawsuit and was exempt under the fsia from being subject to discovery.the first premise of the argument is effectively foreclosed,however,by the court of appeal sic express finding that rafidain is a party to this suit and that the district court is instructed to permit first city to conduct full discovery against rafidain.while rafidain was not a party to the appeal in which the court of appeals made these determinations and therefore may have a basis in some future appeal for asking the court of appeals to reconsider its conclusions in this regard,it would exceed the power of this lower court to disregard these clear and unequivocal determinations of the court of appeals.the court therefore finds,in compliance with the second circuit ruling,t
