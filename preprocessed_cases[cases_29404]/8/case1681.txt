these cases,argued in tandem,require us to decide whether an alien subject to a final order of removal who files a successive asylum application based only on changed personal circumstances must also file a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions pursuant to c ii,when the deadline has passed for such a motion.petitioners yuen jin,shan hu zheng,jiao fang chen,and hua zeng,all chinese citizens,sought to advance successive asylum claims years after their initial asylum applications were denied and they were ordered removed.petitioners moved to reopen their proceedings and requested permission to file successive asylum applications,arguing that they were newly eligible for asylum based on the birth of additional children after the entry of their final removal orders.
the board of immigration appeals bia denied the motions and refused leave to file successive asylum petitions because petitioners had alleged only changed personal circumstances and not changed country conditions the latter,the agency concluded,was required for consideration of an untimely motion to reopen,and petitioners could not assert successive asylum claims in the absence of an accompanying motion to reopen pursuant to c ii.the bia subsequently adopted this conclusion as the holding of its published,precedential opinion,in re.because we have determined that the agency interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,we defer to the bia decision in in re and accordingly deny the petitions for review.
background 
in december,petitioner yuen jin arrived in the united states from fujian province,china,and was detained after presenting a fraudulent passport.in january,the ins served her with a notice to appear and placed her in removal proceedings.in may,jin sought asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat on the grounds that chinese authorities forced her to undergo an abortion and that she feared future persecution for illegally departing china.
in september,jin married jian geng zheng,and in october of that year,she appeared at a hearing before an immigration judge ij.finding the petitioner not credible,the ij issued a decision in december denying jin applications for relief and ordering her removed.in april,while her appeal was pending before the bia,jin had her first child.jin removal order became final in september when the bia affirmed the ij decision jin did not file a petition for review in this court.
in january,jin gave birth to her second child,and in july,nearly three years after the bia issued a final order of removal,jin filed a motion to reopen her proceedings,claiming that,in light of china family planning policies,the birth of her second child constituted changed personal circumstances that affected her eligibility for asylum.she also submitted a second asylum application accompanied by supporting documents.
in september,the bia denied jin untimely motion,finding that she had not demonstrated changed country conditions as required for the board to consider a motion to reopen filed more than ninety days after the entry of a final removal order.the bia did not address jin successive asylum petition but construed jin motion only as a motion to reopen.jin filed a timely petition for review of the board decision in this court.
ii.shan hu zheng 
in december,petitioner shan hu zheng left fujian province,china,for the united states,where she arrived without inspection.she filed an initial asylum application,alleging religious persecution.in november,the ij denied zheng application and ordered her deported,finding that the evidence of harassment that she had presented did not rise to the level of persecution.the bia affirmed in may.
in october,zheng married hong tao lin,a naturalized citizen,and later gave birth to two in february,and another in may.after filing unsuccessful motions to reopen in and,zheng filed a third motion to reopen in june,claiming that the birth of her second child constituted changed circumstances that warranted the granting of an untimely motion to reopen and made her newly eligible for asylum.based on her changed personal circumstances,zheng argued that she could file a successive asylum application.
in july,the bia denied the motion as both and.the bia found that zheng motion did not fall within an exception to those procedural limitations because the birth of children in the united states did not amount to changed country conditions.four months later,the bia reopened zheng proceedings sua sponte based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the bia then reissued its july decision to enable zheng to timely file the instant petition for review in this court.
iii.jiao fang chen 
petitioner jiao fang chen entered the united states in august as a visitor without a valid entry document.she was subsequently placed in removal proceedings.in june,she filed applications for asylum,withholding of deportation,and cat relief,claiming that family planning authorities in china forcibly inserted an iud after the birth of her first child in,that she had secretly removed it,and that she left china to avoid reinsertion of the device.in june,chen gave birth to her second child,and at her asylum hearing,chen claimed that she would be forcibly sterilized if returned to china,because she now had more than one child.
the ij denied chen claims and ordered her removed after making an adverse credibility determination and finding that chen had not adduced sufficient persuasive evidence of systematic forced sterilization under china policy.in april,the bia summarily affirmed.chen did not file a petition for review of that decision.
in august,chen filed a motion to reopen and a new asylum application with the bia,arguing that her untimely filing should be excused because she was now pregnant with her third child and would definitely be unable to avoid sterilization,and the enforcement of china family planning laws had become harsher and more widespread since.the bia denied the motion as untimely,noting that chen third pregnancy was not a change arising in china,that changed personal circumstances did not excuse her late filing,and that no change in china enforcement policy had occurred.the bia did not address chen new asylum application.chen now petitions for review of that decision.
iv.hua zeng 
petitioner hua zeng,born in fujian province,arrived in the united states without inspection in march.he applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat in july of that year.in his asylum application,zeng stated that he left china because local officials harassed,attacked,and arrested him after he spoke out against the government.in september,he was placed in removal proceedings,and in february,the ij ordered zeng removed in absentia when he failed to attend his removal hearing.the february,removal order became final after zeng failed to appeal the ij order.
in june,zeng filed a motion to reopen his proceedings,alleging that he had missed his master calendar hearing because of circumstances beyond his control.the ij granted him two weeks to file a detailed affidavit and supporting documentation,but zeng did not file anything more and did not appeal the ij denial of the motion.
after the removal order became final,zeng remained in the united states,married,and fathered two born in december and the other in october.in january,more than five years after he was ordered removed,zeng filed with the immigration court a motion to reopen based on his changed personal circumstances.he argued that the birth of his two sons made him newly eligible for asylum relief because he would be forcibly sterilized if removed to china.zeng also requested permission to file an untimely successive asylum application based on his changed personal circumstances,despite his concession that country conditions had not changed.
the ij denied the motion,noting that a previous motion to reopen filed by zeng had been denied on july,and that his current motion to reopen thus violated both the time and numerical restrictions set forth in the applicable regulations.the ij did not act upon zeng request for permission to file a second asylum application.
in april,zeng appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that no motion to reopen was required in order to file a successive asylum application.the bia rejected this argument and dismissed zeng appeal.the board agreed with the ij that zeng second motion to reopen was both and and,in addition,found the motion to be ineligible for an exception based on changed country conditions because it was based only on a change in personal circumstances.zeng then filed a timely petition for review in this court.
discussion 
petitioners cases present the common question of whether an alien subject to a final removal order may file a successive asylum petition based solely on changed personal circumstances,unaccompanied by a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions.consistent with its ruling in each of the cases at bar,the bia recently answered this question in the negative in in re,holding that when a petitioner is subject to a final order of removal,his successive asylum application is subject to the same procedural requirements as a motion to reopen and must therefore allege changed country conditions if it is filed more than ninety days after the entry of the final order.a b providing that a removal order becomes final upon the earlier of i a determination by the board of immigration appeals affirming such order or ii the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the board of immigration appeals.
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion,kaur bia,cir per curiam,and its legal conclusions de novo,with the caveat that the bia interpretations of ambiguous provisions of the ina are owed substantial deference unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,perez suriel de batista gonzales,cir per curiam internal quotation marks and citation omitted quoting chevron natural res.def.council,d.precedential bia decisions,those that have been published,such as in re,are eligible for chevron deference insofar as they represent the agency authoritative interpretations of statutes.maiwand gonzales,cir.and the bia interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bowles seminole rock sand.see also jigme wangchuck dep t of homeland,cir according substantial deference to the bia interpretations of immigration regulations.
i.the statutory and regulatory scheme 
as a general rule,an alien who has filed a previous asylum application that has been denied may not apply again for asylum.a c.there is,however,an exception if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum.id.a d emphasis added.pursuant to its expressly delegated authority to provide by regulation for any other conditions or limitations on the consideration of an application for asylum not inconsistent with this chapter,id.d b,the agency promulgated.subsection a i of that regulation provides that the term changed circumstances can refer to either changed country conditions or changed personal circumstances,which include activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.a i a b.petitioners argue,based on these statutory and regulatory provisions,that a d permits an alien under a final removal order to file a successive asylum petition on the basis of changed personal circumstances,such as the birth of a second or third child in the united states.see wei guang wang bia,cir.
petitioners argument is complicated,however,by additional provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina and their implementing regulations.under b ii,a fter completion of removal proceedings,and in conjunction with a motion to reopen pursuant to cfr part where applicable,an asylum application must be filed with the immigration court having jurisdiction over the prior proceeding.id.b ii emphasis added.an alien who is subject to a final removal order and who wishes to reopen his proceedings generally may file only one motion to reopen and must file that motion within ninety days of the date of entry of the final order.c a,c i see also c.these numerical and time limitations do not apply,however,if the motion is based on changed country conditions and the relevant evidence was unavailable during the prior proceeding.c c ii see also c ii unlike in the case of a successive asylum application filed under a d,changed personal circumstances are insufficient to excuse an alien from the procedural requirements of a motion to reopen.see,wang,at the law is clear that a petitioner must show changed country conditions in order to exceed the filing requirement for seeking to reopen removal proceedings.a change in personal circumstances can not suffice.citation omitted jian huan guan bia,cir per curiam holding that an alien was not entitled to relief from the motion to reopen deadline because she had established only changed personal circumstances,which does not fit under the exception set forth in c ii.
reading all of these provisions together,the bia has interpreted them to provide that an alien who has completed removal proceedings and is under a final order of removal,and who wishes to file a new asylum application,must do so in conjunction with a motion to reopen those proceedings and if such a motion is filed more than ninety days after entry of the final order,the motion must be denied unless the alien can establish changed country conditions.see in re,at t he regulations require that all asylum applications filed with the immigration court after the close of removal,deportation,or exclusion proceedings be accompanied by a properly filed motion to reopen.id.at a d,on which the respondent relies for his premise that changes in personal circumstances justify the new asylum application,simply does not apply to a situation where an asylum applicant has already been ordered removed.
for the reasons expressed below,we hold that the bia interpretation of the relevant ina provisions is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,and that its regulatory particular,its reading of b ii is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.we therefore accord those interpretations deference under chevron,d.
the board determination that a properly filed motion to reopen is a prerequisite to the filing of a new asylum petition when the petitioner is under a final removal order has recently been affirmed by four other circuits and is based on sound reasoning.see qing li chen mukasey,cir we conclude that the bia interpretation of and c,as they affect each other,is a reasonable one,and we defer to that interpretation.wen ying zheng mukasey,cir t he bia reasonably harmonized the relevant statutes and regulations in concluding that an alien under a final order of removal must successfully reopen under c c ii in order to pursue an untimely or successive asylum application under a d.hai fan huang attorney of the,cir unpublished opinion w e can not say the bia requirement that an alien under a final administrative order of exclusion or removal must file a motion to reopen is an arbitrary or capricious interpretation of the immigration laws.cheng chen gonzales,cir agreeing with the bia that c c ii requirements govern the successive asylum application of a petitioner subject to a final removal order.
the board treatment and application of c c ii under the facts presented is not inconsistent with a d.any potential tension between a broad provision that changed country conditions or changed personal circumstances can support a new asylum application under a d and the bia determination that only changed country conditions can support a new asylum application filed by an alien under a final removal order is easily resolved.as the seventh circuit noted in cheng chen,a d says nothing about the situation in which the applicant has already been ordered removed,the order has become final,and the time for reopening the removal proceeding has expired.at.thus,b ii,which discusses the filing of an asylum application in conjunction with a motion to reopen when removal proceedings have been completed and a c c,which delineates the requirements for such a motion when a final order has issued,can properly be read as filling this gap by setting forth the mechanism by which an alien may file a successive asylum petition when the alien has already been ordered removed.
the bia interpretation of the ina gives meaning to both c c and a d.under that interpretation,an alien may file a successive asylum application based on changed personal circumstances or changed country conditions,pursuant to a d,at any time during proceedings before the entry of a final order of removal or within the deadline for a motion to reopen.outside of those circumstances,changed country conditions under c c must be shown.in re,at.the statutory provisions each play a role and apply at different points in the immigration proceeding,with a d apply ing principally at an earlier stage of proceedings than the reopening provisions in c c.id.
it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but,as the bia reasoned,petitioners proposed interpretation that an alien may file a new asylum application at any when subject to a final removal a motion to reopen,and by showing either changed personal circumstances or changed country conditions,would render c c superfluous.see in re,at.an alien could completely bypass the more stringent procedural requirements for a motion to reopen by filing a successive asylum application neither c c deadline nor its exception in the case of changed country conditions would ever apply,even after the entry of a final order of removal.
the board determination is also consistent with its general administrative procedures.as the bia acknowledged in in re,as a procedural matter a motion to reopen must be filed with a successive asylum petition after the completion of removal proceedings because the agency could not otherwise consider the new issue raised by the petitioner.at noting that,in the case presented,the applicant filed no motion to reopen proceedings,a prerequisite to our taking up any issue arising in his case,given the entry of the removal order against him see also id.at stating that t he only way for us to acquire jurisdiction over a petition for further relief such as a successive asylum application when a final order of removal is in place is through a properly filed motion to reconsider or reopen id.at.nor could the petitioner benefit from a grant of asylum on his successive application unless he first provided the agency with a means of reopening his proceedings to vacate the removal order.see a v providing that an alien who has been granted asylum may not adjust his status unless he is admissible to the united states.
petitioners contend that the bia interpretation of the ina is contrary to the statutory scheme and to congress intent because it would leave without any avenue of relief aliens whose personal circumstances had genuinely changed more than ninety days after a final agency decision in a removal proceeding.we disagree.notwithstanding the fact that any such aliens would likely have remained in the country in violation of the immigration laws,see a a setting forth penalties for an alien who willfully fails or refuses to depart from the united states within a period of days from the date of the final order of removal under administrative processes,c iii provides that the time and numerical limitations for a motion to reopen shall not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings a greed upon by all parties and jointly filed.thus,with the government consent,an alien alleging only changed personal circumstances could reopen his proceedings and file a successive asylum petition.furthermore,it is within the bia discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte if it determines,based on a petitioner particular circumstances,that reopening is warranted.see a the board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.
petitioners also claim that the regulatory history of unambiguously establishes that they are not required to file a motion to reopen with their successive asylum applications.they point,in particular,to the department of justice explicit decision not to include such a requirement in the final version of the regulation 
because of inconsistency between the formulation of changed circumstances in a d and the formulation in c c ii,which permits an alien to file a motion to reopen beyond the time limit normally applicable to such a motion,the department has decided to drop the requirement that,for purposes of the prohibition in a c,the changed circumstances exception may only be raised through a motion to reopen.
proposed,changed circumstances arising after the denial of the application but before the alien departure or removal from the united states shall only be considered as part of a motion to reopen.
this argument was considered and rejected by the third,seventh,eighth,and ninth circuits and by the bia in in re,and we reject it as well.we find persuasive the bia reasoning that 
t he cited regulatory history nowhere states that an alien may file unlimited successive asylum applications after the entry of a final administrative order of removal without filing a motion to reopen.at best,the cited regulatory provisions implementing a d are silent on the issue of reopening,most likely because the requirement of an accompanying motion to reopen once a final order of removal has been entered is clearly set forth in other parts of the statutory and regulatory scheme.
in re,at.thus,the regulation history does not unambiguously support petitioners argument.as we have discussed,the current regulation can be read,consistent with a d,c c,and,to provide that a successive asylum application may be filed without a motion to reopen before a final removal order has entered.see zheng,at c hanging the regulations does not reflect a clear intent to weaken the requirements of a motion to reopen when an alien under a final order of removal seeks to file a successive asylum application.petitioners regulatory history argument therefore does not undermine the reasonableness of the bia statutory and regulatory interpretations.
the bia determination is further supported by policy considerations that several courts of appeals have recognized as important.the decisions of the third,seventh,and eighth circuits were influenced by principles that we articulated in wei guang wang bia.see zheng,at stating that practical realities support the bia interpretation,and discussing wang huang.at cheng chen,at.in wang,we discussed the policy behind extending the deadline for a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions,but not on changed personal circumstances.we noted that it would be ironic to allow aliens to reopen their cases following a final order of deportation simply because they were able to change their own personal circumstances,by giving birth to additional children while remaining in the united states illegally 
it is quite a different situation where a petitioner is seeking to reopen his asylum case due to circumstances entirely of his own making after being ordered to leave the united states.in such a situation,it would be ironic,indeed,if petitioners were permitted to have a second and third bite at the apple simply because they managed to marry and have children while evading authorities.this apparent gaming of the system in an effort to avoid deportation is not tolerated by the existing regulatory scheme.the law is clear that a petitioner must show changed country conditions in order to exceed the filing requirement for seeking to reopen removal proceedings.a change in personal circumstances can not suffice.
wang,at citations omitted.
we find this logic equally applicable to successive asylum petitions filed after the bia has issued a final removal order.were we to accept petitioners argument that an alien subject to such an order may file,more than ninety days after its entry,a second asylum application without a motion to reopen,and on the basis of only changed personal circumstances,we would be permitting extensive gaming of the system because those circumstances could be entirely of the alien own making.id.aliens would have every incentive to disregard their removal orders and remain in the united states long enough to change their personal circumstances,by having children or practicing a persecuted religion and initiate new proceedings via a new asylum application 
as the seventh circuit suggested in cheng chen,some restriction that can not be manipulated by petitioners must be in place,lest petitioners take advantage of the system by manufacturing a new case for asylum.see at it makes no sense to allow an alien who manages to elude capture for years after he has been ordered to leave the country,and has exhausted all his legal remedies against removal,to use this interval of unauthorized presence in the united states to manufacture a case for asylum.requiring a petitioner to file a motion to reopen in order to file a new asylum application,and therefore to show changed country conditions if the motion is untimely,provides one such restriction against manufacturing a case for asylum.
such a requirement also promotes the agency interest in finality.the supreme court has recognized this interest as important in the immigration context.see ins doherty,d noting that m otions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored because as a general matter,every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the united states ins abudu,d noting the strong public interest in finality,and endorsing the view that the ins should have the right to be restrictive in granting motions to reopen because g ranting such motions too freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts.accepting petitioners argument would permit aliens to file a new asylum application at any time,virtually without restriction,undermining significantly the finality of immigration proceedings.
we conclude that the bia interpretation of the ina and its implementing regulations are reasonable,fully consistent with the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions,and comport with sound and policy considerations.we therefore affirm its holding that an alien under a final removal order must file a successive asylum application in conjunction with a motion to reopen and in accordance with those procedural requirements.we also note that we are not bound by our comment in jian huan guan bia,cir per curiam,that such an alien may request permission to file a successive,untimely asylum application based only on changed personal circumstances,because that comment was contained in dicta.see id.at see also zheng,at stating that the language in guan was dictum cheng chen,at same in re,at same chang hua he gonzales,cir suggesting,in dicta,that the petitioner could file a successive asylum application without a motion to reopen haddad gonzales,cir same also qing li chen,at w e are not bound by he offhand observation.xiao xing ni gonzales,cir calabresi,concurring.
ii.constitutional challenges 
petitioners raise two constitutional challenges to the bia determination,both of which we reject as meritless.
due process 
petitioners contend that the bia interpretation of the ina violates aliens due process rights by depriving them of a hearing when they have experienced only changed personal circumstances.but petitioners have not established any liberty or property interest in asylum that warrants fifth amendment protection.we agree with the views of other circuits that have addressed similar due process claims in the context of discretionary relief.see,smith ashcroft,cir noting that aliens have no protected liberty or property interest in a waiver of deportation under former ina c because such relief is discretionary,a circumstance fatal to a due process claim oguejiofor attorney of the,cir a n alien has no right to discretionary relief or to be eligible for discretionary relief.emphasis added.we hold that an alien who has already filed one asylum application,been adjudicated removable and ordered deported,and who has nevertheless remained in the country illegally for several years,does not have a liberty or property interest in a discretionary grant of asylum.in other contexts,we have suggested in dicta that an alien interest in not being returned to a country where he fears persecution may well enjoy some due process protection not available to an alien claiming only admission.yiu sing chun sava,cir see also augustin sava,cir noting that the ina prohibits the attorney general from deporting or returning an alien to a country in which his life or freedom would be jeopardized,but leaving open the question of whether or not due process protections apply to an application for a discretionary grant of asylum.we do not consider those situations here,nor do we address whether an applicant for withholding of removal or relief under the cat would have a protectable interest in those mandatory forms of relief.
in any event,assuming arguendo that petitioners had a protectable interest in relief under a d,they have not been denied due process.we stated in augustin sava 
the requirements of the due process clause are flexible and dependent on the circumstances of the particular situation examined.without attempting precisely to map the contours of due process in the immigration area,we think that the protected right to avoid deportation or return to a country where the alien will be persecuted warrants a hearing where the likelihood of persecution can be fairly evaluated.
at citation omitted.any alien to whom the bia determination would apply would have already had a full and fair removal hearing which resulted in a final removal order as well as the adjudication of their initial asylum application.the alien is afforded additional process by the opportunity to submit and offer evidence on a motion to reopen his earlier proceedings if the motion is granted,a hearing will be held.c b.thus,petitioners can not succeed on their due process challenge 
equal protection 
petitioners also argue that the bia interpretation results in an equal protection violation in that it treats aliens under a final removal order who nevertheless remain illegally in the united states differently than aliens under a final removal order who comply with the order by leaving,but who later reenter the united states illegally.the latter class may apply for withholding of removal and is not required to present evidence of changed country conditions to support a determination of reasonable fear.see e id.under the bia rulings,however,the former class may not reopen proceedings or submit a new asylum application without showing changed country conditions.
to successfully assert an equal protection challenge,petitioners must first establish that the two classes at issue are similarly situated.t he government can treat persons differently if they are not similarly situated.ins,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.petitioners have failed to do so here.aliens who disregard a final removal order and remain in the country illegally are not similarly situated to aliens who have complied with a final order but subsequently reenter the united states and try to seek relief.id.at concluding that legal permanent residents and permanent residents are not similarly situated for purposes of equal protection analysis.
assuming arguendo that the two classes of aliens were similarly situated,petitioners equal protection claim would fail on other grounds.the challenged classification is not protected,and there is no fundamental right at stake,see supra part thus,the proper standard of review is rational basis.see heller doe,d a classification neither involving fundamen
