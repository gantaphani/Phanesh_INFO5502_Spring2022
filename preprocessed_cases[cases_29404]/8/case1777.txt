background 
prior litigation.this appeal is another chapter in a jurisdictional dispute among new york city construction unions that has been going on for more than years.at the core of this saga was a dispute between two labor unions representing drywall finishing local and local of the operative plasterers and cement masons international association,local,which is not involved in the current litigation.both unions are members of the building construction trades council of greater new york trades council.more than a century ago,the trades council and the building trades employers association an organization of construction contractors associations btea,have formed the new york plan for the settlement of jurisdictional disputes new york plan.through the decisions of the official organs of the new york plan published in the green book,specific types of construction work in new york city were assigned to specific unions,and the member employers and unions must abide by those work assignments.
local has tried for years to violate local jurisdiction in new york by assuming drywall finishing jobs that rightfully belonged to local.these attempts have led to a series of court decisions generally upholding local position.see drywall tapers and pointers of greater new york,local local of operative plasterers and cement masons international association,cir drywall tapers and pointers of greater new york,local local of the operative plasterers and cement masons international association,wl,drywall tapers and pointers of greater new york,local local of the operative plasters and cement masons international association,wl,ordering the march,injunction,which enjoined local from performing drywall finishing in new york city and,in effect,allocated drywall finishing work in new york city to local this order was subsequently incorporated in the new york plan green book.
pending litigation.a week after the march,decision,the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of organization not previously involved in the a new local union,local,one of the current appellants,to represent drywall finishing workers in the state of new york.local was not affiliated with the trades council,and is therefore not bound by the new york plan.shortly after local was chartered,some new york contractors who had previously employed local workers for drywall finishing jobs entered into collective bargaining agreements with local 
local filed a complaint with the district court against four construction managers and their respective drywall subcontractors,who have employed local members to do drywall finishing work in four manhattan construction sites.local complaint alleged violation of the district court march,injunction by failing to employ local members,and sought enforcement of the new york plan to which the defendants were allegedly parties,pursuant to section of the labor management relations act.local,not being a party to the new york plan and thus not bound by the injunction,was not named as a defendant in the complaint.
local suit against the contractors did not reach trial.after the district court denied the defendants motions to dismiss and indicated its intent to enter a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from further violating the march,injunction subject to confirmation that the defendants are bound by the new york plan,the parties reached an agreement that put an end to the litigation settlement agreement.in december,the district court issued an amended consent injunction,consent injunction adopting the parties settlement agreement.nastasi,one of the drywall,appeals the consent injunction in,notwithstanding its agreement to the entry of the consent injunction,and local appeals the consent injunction in,notwithstanding its not being a party to the proceeding.
local attempted intervention.while local action was still pending,local is repeatedly mentioned in local complaint but,as noted,was not a party to the proceeding nor to the new york plan instituted several proceedings with the national labor relations board nlrb,stressing its legitimate role in the new york drywall industry and attacking local for the remedies it sought in this action.thus,local initiated several representation proceedings with the nlrb,under which majorities of workers employed by some of the defendants have elected local as their collective bargaining representative.local also filed with the nlrb a series of formal charges against local and the who complied with the preliminary injunction,alleging unfair labor practices in violation of sections b a and e of the national labor relations act.
on november,while the parties to local action were still in negotiations and while local proceedings with the nlrb were still pending,local filed a motion with the district court to intervene as of right in local action,pursuant to.a.
local motion to intervene was scheduled for oral argument on january.in the meantime the parties reached their settlement agreement,and on december,the district court entered the consent injunction.local filed its notice of appeal from the consent injunction on january,before its motion to intervene was heard and disposed of.
the district court denied local motion to intervene for lack of jurisdiction because local had filed a notice of appeal,contesting the consent injunction.local appeals the denial of intervention in.
discussion 
nastasi appeal 
local challenges nastasi right to appeal the consent injunction on the ground that nastasi was a party to the settlement agreement that was adopted by the district court in the consent injunction.the consent injunction incorporates the exact language of the settlement agreement.the settlement agreement further states that it constitutes a final settlement of all claims between local and defendant nastasi arising from or relating to the federal action,and that the parties have executed this settlement agreement knowingly,voluntarily and without duress.
an appeal from a consent injunction is generally unavailable since the parties are held to have waived any objection to issues included in the injunction.see new york ex rel.vacco operation rescue national,cir united states international brotherhood of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers of america,cir kelly trust commissioner of internal revenue,cir a consent judgment by its nature precludes an appeal.
nastasi offers three arguments to avoid this well settled rule.first,it contends that its consent to the settlement agreement resulting in the consent injunction was not voluntary.as its brief asserts 
the injunction was consensual only in the sense that it was clear to all of the defendants that if they did not negotiate a consent injunction,the district court intended to enter a more onerous injunction against nastasi and all of the other defendants.
the argument is entirely without merit.most disputes are settled because at least one of the parties perceives at least a risk of a more disadvantageous outcome if the litigation proceeds.nastasi makes no claim that its consent to the settlement agreement was obtained under duress or any other circumstance that might avoid the consequences of its voluntary
