in this putative class action,jeffrey gallego alleges that northland group northland violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,by sending him and other class members a debt collection letter that gave a number but did not specify the name of the person at that number.before a responsive pleading was filed,gallego and northland sought to settle the matter on a classwide basis.the district court denied class certification,and then dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that it did not raise a colorable federal question.
while we agree with the district court that gallego allegations concerning the failure to include the name of a person to call back do not state a claim under the fdcpa,we disagree that the claim is so insubstantial that it does not even support jurisdiction.we further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated in part,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
gallego brought this action in the southern district of new york on behalf of himself and a class consisting of a ll new york consumers who were sent letters notices from northland,attempting to collect a debt owed to department stores national bank dsnb,which did not contain the name of the person to call back.the complaint alleged that the failure to provide a name violated the fdcpa,and thus the asserted basis for jurisdiction was that the action was one arising under the laws of the united states.
the letter received by gallego,which is attached to the complaint as an exhibit and is dated january,identifies northland as the sender,indicates that northland is a collection agency licensed by the minnesota department of commerce,and states the name of the original creditor dsnb,the name of the store at which gallego incurred the debt macy and the original account number.the letter opens with the proclamation it a new year with new opportunities,and invites gallego to settle his account for either over four payments or over two payments.it offers gallego the option to pay online,by phone or by mail,and contains a boldface disclaimer explaining that the statute of limitations on the debt has expired,but that court rules require you to tell the court that the statute of limitations has expired to prevent the creditor from obtaining a judgment.id.finally,it provides a telephone number for gallego to call if he has any questions,but does not give the name of any person who can be reached at that number.
gallego alleges that the letter failure to provide a name violates two provisions of the fdcpa,which prohibits t he use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer,and,which prohibits the use of unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt and gives examples of such prohibited means.neither provision explicitly requires debt collection letters to include a name,but the new york city administrative code does.see admin.code a iv.the complaint claims that,b ecause the january,letter failed to provide the name of the person to call back,as required by admin.code.a iv,northland violated and.
before northland had filed a responsive pleading,the parties agreed to settle the lawsuit on a classwide basis.the settlement agreement provided that northland would establish a fund totaling,an amount the agreement stated was approximately equal to of northland net worth of that amount,the settlement if approved would pay to gallego,as class representative,and distribute the remaining to class members who filed timely claims.the agreement capped attorneys fees at.under the agreement,class members of whom the agreement estimated that there were around would have the choice to opt out of the settlement,but all class members who did not exercise that option would release all their claims against northland relating to the letter,whether or not they filed a claim to receive part of the settlement.finally,the agreement was to become null and void if more than fifty class members affirmatively opted out,unless northland waived that provision.
northland and gallego then jointly moved for conditional approval of the classwide settlement and to certify the conditional settlement class.on april,the district court alvin hellerstein,denied class certification,concluding that a class action was neither the superior nor fairer method for litigating the issues in the complaint.gallego northland,d.the court then sua sponte questioned its jurisdiction,explaining that the complaint appeared to allege nothing other than a violation of new york city law and not to raise any colorable federal claims,and directed gallego to show cause why the complaint ought not be dismissed on that basis.id.at.in response,gallego filed a cross motion for reconsideration of the april order.four days later,on may,the district court issued an order denying the motion,and dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
federal district courts have jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the supreme court has recognized,however,that federal claims that are not colorable,immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or wholly insubstantial and frivolous,do not give rise to jurisdiction.arbaugh y h,quoting bell hood.the district court found that gallego fdcpa claims fell into that category.we disagree.
just weeks ago,the supreme court cautioned courts against collapsing the distinction between failing to raise a substantial federal question for jurisdictional purposes and failing to state a claim for relief on the merits.shapiro mcmanus.the court cited a series of formulations from prior cases illustrating the level of frivolity required for a federal claim to fail to invoke federal jurisdiction essentially fictitious,wholly insubstantial,obviously frivolous,and obviously without merit,id.at and further noted that the adverbs in those formulations were no mere throwaways the limiting words wholly and obviously have cogent legal significance.id.alteration and some internal quotation marks omitted.unless a claim fails to clear even that low bar,the court explained,the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.id.that is what the district court should have done here.
we agree with the district court that gallego fails to state a claim under the fdcpa.the complaint can be read as asserting two alternative theories of fdcpa liability either that the prohibitions of and against false representation s,deceptive means and unfair or unconscionable means in effect incorporate the new york city administrative code provisions on debt collection agencies,or that failing to include a name is itself deceptive or unfair or unconscionable,under the plain meaning of those terms.
neither theory has merit.as to the first,there is no indication that congress intended for and to incorporate standards of conduct.on the contrary,the fdcpa expressly contemplates the existence of state laws that offer protections to consumers that go beyond the fdcpa itself.the section entitled r elation to state laws provides that the fdcpa preempts state laws to the extent that they are inconsistent with the fdcpa,and further clarifies that a state law is not inconsistent with the fdcpa if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection provided by the fdcpa.if the fdcpa itself incorporated applicable state and local law,that clarification would be unnecessary.accordingly,we join every other circuit court to have considered the question in concluding that violations of state and local debt collection statutes are not per se actionable under the fdcpa.see currier first resolution inv,cir stating that congress did not turn every violation of state law into a violation of the fdcpa leblanc u
