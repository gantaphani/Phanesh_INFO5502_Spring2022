a final part of the letter specifically asks j j to acknowledge you j j provide your prospective consent to our blank rome representation of generic drug manufacturers in proceedings involving johnson johnson and its affiliates and subsidiaries.
pursuant to this engagement agreement,blank rome advised j j on a variety of privacy matters,much of which was related to j j affiliates.in particular,jennifer daniels,a partner at blank rome,provided affiliates with services,including the preparation of policies and procedures,guidance documents,and training materials.in,daniels represented babycenter in a matter.blank rome did not,however,advise j j with regard to the services agreement agreement between babycenter and gsi,which is the subject of the current litigation.it also appears that blank rome received no confidential information relevant to that agreement during its representation of j j or,separately,babycenter.
b j j relationship with babycenter 
babycenter is a subsidiary of j j that operates as an online media company.babycenter hosts a variety of websites in the united states and abroad that focus on pregnancy and early childhood development.until january,babycenter also hosted an online retail store offering and related products.
babycenter relies on j j for a variety of business services,including accounting,audit,cash management,employee benefits,finance,human resources,information technology,insurance,payroll,and travel services and systems.it also substantially relies on j j legal department either to provide legal services or to secure outside counsel.stuart wilks,a member of the j j legal department,serves as board attorney to babycenter.j j legal department participated in the negotiation of the agreement between babycenter and gsi.j j lawyers have also been involved from the beginning in the dispute between babycenter and gsi.indeed,j j legal department has dealt directly with blank rome in attempting to resolve the present dispute.
finally,it appears that j j exercises some management control over babycenter business decisions,although the extent of this control is not clear from the record.babycenter is a limited liability company.its sole member is bc acquisition group,which is itself a subsidiary of j j j structures affiliates into groups of companies.babycenter belongs to the consumer healthcare group and its operations are supervised by the consumer healthcare group operating committee,which is composed mainly of j j employees.
c babycenter gsi commerce solutions 
babycenter and gsi entered into the aforementioned agreement in august,pursuant to which gsi agreed to run the operations of babycenter online store in return for a percentage of sales revenue.section of the agreement provides that,if a dispute should arise,the parties will first attempt to resolve it through mediation.should mediation fail,the agreement provides that the parties will proceed to arbitration.
when babycenter closed its online store in,gsi accused it of wrongfully terminating the agreement.specifically,it argued that the term of service in the agreement had not expired at the time the store closed.james smith,a blank rome partner,notified babycenter on december,of gsi demand for mediation on its claim.daniels,the blank rome partner who had worked with j j and affiliates on privacy matters,contacted j j legal department the same day to inform j j of the dispute.in january,the parties attempted mediation.blank rome partners smith and rebecca ward appeared on behalf of gsi.members of the j j legal department,as well as john winter no relation to the author of this opinion from the firm patterson belknap webb tyler llp,appeared on behalf of babycenter at mediation.
mediation efforts proved unsuccessful.on february,winter informed gsi that babycenter would not continue to arbitration so long as blank rome represented gsi.on the same day,j j informed blank rome of its opposition to blank rome representation of gsi.
d the district court proceedings 
on april,in light of babycenter failure to arbitrate,gsi filed a motion in the southern district to compel arbitration.babycenter responded with a to disqualify blank rome as counsel,arguing that its representation of gsi presented a concurrent conflict to which j j had not given its consent.
the district court granted babycenter motion to disqualify blank rome.gsi commerce solutions,babycenter,d.although blank rome separate representation of babycenter allegedly ended in,see id.at,the court concluded that babycenter still must be considered a current client of blank rome for purposes of disqualification,id.at,because babycenter and j j must be considered essentially the same client for purposes of the instant litigation.id.at.see also id.although technically babycenter is a wholly owned subsidiary of j j,as a practical matter it is part and parcel of j citation omitted.in so ruling,the court focused on the evidence of substantial operational commonality between babycenter and j j,but particularly on babycenter reliance on j j to provide legal services.see id.at.the court further found it relevant that,since babycenter is a wholly owned subsidiary,its liabilities directly impact j j.id.at.
the court found that the engagement agreement had not given blank rome broad authority to accept representation adverse to affiliates such as babycenter.see id.at.instead,it noted that the agreement itself contains prospective waivers of certain conflicts,thus indicating at least implicitly that blank rome was aware of the potential conflict of interest that would be posed by its representation of interests adverse to j j and its subsidiaries.id.
the district court proceeded to disqualify blank rome on the ground that it had not obtained consent to the concurrent representation.see id.at.
discussion 
a standard of review 
we review a district court order disqualifying an attorney for an abuse of discretion.see glueck jonathan logan,cir.matters of law are reviewed de novo and factual findings are sustained unless clearly erroneous.zervos verizon new york,cir.we will affirm the court application of the law to the facts unless the court findings can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.in addition,to the extent we need to interpret the engagement agreement between j j and blank rome,its construction is a question of law unless the agreement meaning is ambiguous.see ja apparel abboud,cir.an agreement is ambiguous only if it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement.med,breuer capital,cir.
b the corporate affiliate conflict 
in deciding whether to disqualify an attorney,a district court must balance a client right freely to choose his counsel against the need to maintain the highest standards of the profession.hempstead video.vill.of valley stream,cir.although the american bar association aba and state disciplinary codes provide valuable guidance,a violation of those rules may not warrant disqualification.see id.instead,disqualification is warranted only if an attorney conduct tends to taint the underlying trial.bd.of educ.nyquist,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.one established ground for disqualification is concurrent representation,an attorney simultaneous representation of one existing client in a matter adverse to another existing client.cinema,cinerama,cir.because concurrent representation is prima facie improper,it is incumbent upon the attorney to show,at the very least,that there will be no actual or apparent conflict in loyalties or diminution in the vigor of his representation.id.at.we have noted that this is a burden so heavy that it will rarely be met.glueck,at.in this respect,it will not suffice to show that the two matters upon which an attorney represents existing clients are unrelated.the lawyer who would sue his own client,asserting in justification the lack of substantial relationship between the litigation and the work he has undertaken to perform for that client,is leaning on a slender reed indeed.cinema,at.
we have not previously considered whether,and under what circumstances,representation adverse to a client corporate affiliate implicates the duty of loyalty owed to the client.however,the issue has been addressed by the aba and also has been discussed extensively in other courts.
the aba model rules of professional conduct provide that a lawyer who represents a corporation or other organization does not,by virtue of that representation,necessarily represent any constituent or affiliated organization,such as a parent or subsidiary.aba model rule of prof l conduct cmt.this statement embodies what is often termed the entity theory of representation.see charles wolfram,legal ethics conflicts,inst.study legal ethics.however,an attorney may not accept representation adverse to a client affiliate if circumstances are such that the affiliate should also be considered a client of the lawyer aba model rule of prof l conduct cmt.the aba discussed this subject further in a opinion letter,concluding that whether a lawyer represents a corporate affiliate of his client depends not upon any clearcut per se rule but rather upon the particular circumstances.am.bar ass comm.on prof ethics,formal opinion,reprinted in lawyers manual on prof conduct ethics opinions.
many courts have reached the conclusion that the bar to concurrent representation applies if a firm representation adverse to a client corporate affiliate reasonably diminishes the level of confidence and trust in counsel held by the client.certain underwriters at lloyd,london argonaut ins,d,internal quotation marks omitted see also discotrade int l,d,hartford accident indem.rjr nabisco,john steele,conflicts a reasonable expectations test.put another way,these courts focus on the reasonableness of the client belief that counsel can not maintain the duty of undivided loyalty it owes a client in one matter while simultaneously opposing that client corporate affiliate in another.see,certain underwriters at lloyd,london,d at discotrade,d at.
we agree that representation adverse to a client affiliate can,in certain circumstances,conflict with the lawyer duty of loyalty owed to a client,a situation that we shall refer to as a corporate affiliate conflict.
the factors relevant to whether a corporate affiliate conflict exists are of a general nature.courts have generally focused on i the degree of operational commonality between affiliated entities,and ii the extent to which one depends financially on the other.as to operational commonality,courts have considered the extent to which entities rely on a common infrastructure.see,discotrade,d at corporate affiliates deemed single entity where each used the same computer network,system,travel department,and health benefit plan eastman kodak sony,wl,at,corporate affiliates deemed single entity based on,inter alia,integration of technology systems.courts have also focused on the extent to which the affiliated entities rely on or otherwise share common personnel such as managers,officers,and directors.see,e,certain underwriters at lloyd,london,d at substantial overlap in management eastman kodak,wl,at shared directors,officers and legal department discotrade,d at same board,directors and president.in this respect,courts have emphasized the extent to which affiliated entities share responsibility for both the provision and management of legal services.see eastman kodak,wl,at certain underwriters at lloyd,london,d at discotrade,d at hartford accident and inde
