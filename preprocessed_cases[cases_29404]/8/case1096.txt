this antitrust class action was brought on behalf of approximately million merchants against visa visa and mastercard international incorporated mastercard,which are the two largest credit card issuing networks in the united states,as well as against various issuing and acquiring banks collectively with visa and mastercard,the defendants,alleging a conspiracy in violation of section of the sherman act.after nearly ten years of litigation,the parties agreed to a settlement that released all claims in exchange for disparate relief for each of two classes up to billion would go to an class,and a class would get injunctive relief.the district court certified these two classes,and approved the settlement as fair and reasonable.on this appeal,numerous objectors and plaintiffs argue that this class action was improperly certified and that the settlement was unreasonable and inadequate.we conclude that the class plaintiffs were inadequately represented in violation of rule a and the due process clause.accordingly,we vacate the district court certification of this class action and reverse the approval of the settlement.
background 
detailed information about how the credit card industry operates is set out in the district court opinion approving the settlement in this case,in re payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litig.payment card i,supp,and in our previous opinions dealing with past antitrust lawsuits against visa and mastercard,stores,visa,cir.united states visa,cir.in re visa antitrust litig.visa check,cir.this section of the opinion lays out only the facts and procedural history needed to explain our analysis and result.
in general terms,a visa or mastercard credit card transaction is processed as follows the customer presents a credit card to pay for goods or services to the merchant the merchant relays the transaction information to the acquiring bank the acquiring bank processes the information and relays it to the network here,visa or mastercard the network relays the information to the issuing bank if the issuing bank approves the transaction,that approval is relayed to the acquiring bank,which then relays it to the merchant.if the transaction is approved,the merchant receives the purchase price minus two fees the interchange fee that the issuing bank charged the acquiring bank and the merchant discount fee that the acquiring bank charged the merchant.
in a given transaction,the interchange fee that the acquiring bank pays and is in turn paid by the merchant varies depending on the credit card network and the type of credit card.thus,the american express network generally charges a higher interchange fee than the visa or mastercard networks.and visa and mastercard have different product levels within their credit card portfolios,such as cards that give consumers generous rewards,and typically charge a higher interchange fee than cards that offer few rewards or none.the difference in interchange fee between american express and visa or mastercard is one at the brand level,while the difference between,a rewards card from visa and a card from visa is one at the product level.
plaintiffs are all merchants who accept visa and credit cards and are therefore bound by the issuers network rules.plaintiffs challenge as several of the following network rules which are effectively identical as between visa and mastercard.the default interchange fee applies to every transaction on the network unless the merchant and issuing bank have entered into a separate agreement.the rule requires merchants to accept all visa or mastercard credit cards if they accept any of them,regardless of the differences in interchange fees.multiple rules prohibit merchants from influencing customers to use one type of payment over another,such as cash rather than credit,or a credit card with a lower interchange fee.these rules include the and rules,which prohibit merchants from charging different prices at the point of sale depending on the means of payment.
plaintiffs allege that these visa and mastercard network rules,working in tandem,allow the issuing banks to impose an artificially inflated interchange fee that merchants have little choice but to accept.the argument is that the rule forces merchants to accept all visa and mastercard credit cards few merchants can afford to accept none of them the rules prohibit them from nudging consumers toward cheaper forms of payment the issuing banks are thus free to set interchange fees at a rate and that rate is effectively locked in via the default interchange fee because the issuing banks have little incentive to deviate from it unless a given merchant is huge enough to have substantial bargaining power.
the first consolidated complaint in this action was filed in.developments since then have altered the credit card industry in important ways.both visa and mastercard conducted initial public offerings that converted each from a consortium of competitor banks into an independent,publicly traded company.the durbin amendment to the wall street reform and consumer protection act of limited the interchange fee that issuing banks could charge for debit card purchases,and allowed merchants to discount debit card purchases relative to credit card purchases.finally,pursuant to a consent decree with the department of justice in,visa and mastercard agreed to permit merchants to discount transactions to steer consumers away from credit cards use.none of these developments affected the or rules,or the existence of a default interchange fee.
notwithstanding these industry developments,the plaintiffs pressed on.discovery included more than depositions,expert reports,days of expert deposition testimony,and the production of over million pages of documents.the parties fully briefed a motion for class certification,a motion to dismiss supplemental complaints,and for summary judgment.beginning in,the parties participated in concurrent settlement negotiations assisted by mediators.at the end of,the district judge and the magistrate judge participated in the parties discussions with the mediators.in october,after several more marathon negotiations with the mediators including one more with the district court and magistrate judges,the parties executed the settlement agreement.the district court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on november,and final approval on december.payment card i,supp.at.
the settlement agreement divides the plaintiffs into two classes one the rule b class covers merchants that accepted visa mastercard from january,to november,the other the rule b class covers merchants that accepted or will accept visa mastercard from november,onwards forever.the former class would be eligible to receive up to billion in monetary relief the latter would get injunctive relief in the form of changes to visa and mastercard network rules.because of the difference between rule b and rule b,members of the first class which receives money damages in the settlement could opt out,but members of the second,class which receives only injunctive relief could not.
the most consequential relief afforded the b class was the ability to surcharge visa and credit cards at both the brand and product levels.that is,a merchant could increase the price of a good at the point of sale if a consumer presents for example a visa card instead of cash,or a visa rewards card instead of a visa card that yields no rewards.the incremental value and utility of this relief is limited,however,because many states,including new york,california,and texas,prohibit surcharging as a matter of state law.see,expressions hair design schneiderman,cir.upholding the new york ban on surcharges rowell pettijohn,cir.upholding the texas ban on surcharges.but see dana supply attorney,florida,cir.striking down florida ban on surcharges.moreover,under the clause included in the settlement agreement,merchants that accept american express can not avail themselves of the surcharging relief because american express effectively prohibits surcharging,and the settlement agreement permits surcharging for visa or mastercard only if the merchant also surcharges for use of cards issued by competitors such as american express.
visa and mastercard also agreed to modify their network rules to reflect that they will negotiate interchange fees with groups of merchants in good faith,the benefits of the durbin amendment and department of justice consent decree,and permit a merchant that operates multiple businesses under different names or banners to accept visa or mastercard at fewer than all of its businesses.
the settlement agreement provides that all of the injunctive relief will terminate on july.
in return,the plaintiffs are bound by a release that waives any claims they would have against the defendants for all of the conduct challenged in the operative complaint,all other policies and practices concerning credit card transactions that were in place as of november,and any substantially similar practices they adopt in the future.while the injunctive relief for the b class will expire on july,this release has no end date.it operates in perpetuity,provided only that visa and mastercard keep in place the several rules that were modified by the injunctive relief provided to the b class including,inter alia,permitting merchants to surcharge,or impose rules that are substantially similar to the modified rules.that is,after july,for as long as visa and mastercard elect to leave in place their network rules as modified by the settlement agreement or adopt rules substantially similar thereto,the defendants continue to enjoy the benefit of the release as to all claims the plaintiffs potentially had against the defendants for any of the network rules existing as of november.
if,after july,the visa or mastercard networks rules are changed such that they are no longer substantially similar to their form as modified by the settlement agreement,then merchants are freed from the release as to claims arising out of that new network rule but only as to such claims.for example,if visa or mastercard revert to their agreement rules by forbidding merchants from surcharging,then the release will not bar future merchants included in the b class from bringing antitrust claims arising out of the prohibition on surcharging but the rest of release would remain in effect,so that a suit by the future plaintiff could not challenge any of the unchanged network rules,such as the rule or imposition of default interchange fees.in sum,regardless what visa or mastercard do with their network rules after july,no merchant will ever be permitted to bring claims arising out of the network rules that are unaffected by this settlement agreement,including most importantly,the rule or existence of default interchange fees.
appellants,including those that opted out from the b class and objected to the b class,argue that the b class was improperly certified and that the settlement was inadequate and unreasonable.
discussion 
certification of a class is reviewed for abuse of discretion,whether the decision i rests on a legal error or clearly erroneous factual finding,or ii falls outside the range of permissible decisions.in re literary works in databases copyright litig.literary works,cir.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.charron wiener,cir.
class actions are an exception to the rule that only the named parties conduct and are bound by litigation.see hansberry lee.in order to justify a departure from that rule,a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.dukes,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.that principle is secured by rule a and the due process clause.rule a,which requires that the representative parties fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent,as well as the competency and conflicts of class counsel.amchem,windsor.t he due process clause of course requires that the named plaintiff at all times adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.phillips petroleum shutts.class actions and settlements that do not comply with rule a and the due process clause can not be sustained.
we conclude that class members of the b class were inadequately represented in violation of both rule a and the due process clause.procedural deficiencies produced substantive shortcomings in this class action and the settlement.as a result,this class action was improperly certified and the settlement was unreasonable and inadequate.
under rule a,a dequacy is twofold the proposed class representative must have an interest in vigorously pursuing the claims of the class,and must have no interests antagonistic to the interests of other class members.denney deutsche bank ag,cir.see also robinson commuter,cir.two factors generally inform whether class representatives satisfy the rule a requirement absence of conflict and assurance of vigorous prosecution.to assure vigorous prosecution,courts consider whether the class representative has adequate incentive to pursue the class claim,and whether some difference between the class representative and some class members might undermine that incentive.id.at.to avoid antagonistic interests,any fundamental conflict that goes to the very heart of the litigation,charron,at internal citations omitted,must be addressed with a structural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals among the plaintiffs.amchem,at.one common structural protection is division of the class into homogenous subclasses under rule c b,with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel.ortiz fibreboard.
adequacy must be determined independently of the general fairness review of the settlement the fact that the settlement may have overall benefits for all class members is not the focus in the determination whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication.denney,at quoting ortiz,at.the focus of the rule a inquiry remains on inequity and potential inequity at the precertification stage.ortiz,at.so when as here the district court certifies the class at the same time it approves a settlement,the requirements of rule a demand undiluted,even heightened,attention.amchem,at.
the supreme court wrote the ground rules for adequate representation in the class context in amchem and ortiz,two asbestos cases.our recent decision in literary works contributed a gloss on the subject.
the proposed settlement in amchem potentially encompassed millions of plaintiffs who had been exposed to asbestos,without distinction between those who had already manifested injuries and sought generous immediate payments,and those who had not manifested injury and sought an ample,fund for the future.amchem,at.a single class representative could not adequately represent both interests.the two subgroups had competing interests in the distribution of a settlement whose terms reflected essential allocation decisions designed to confine compensation and to limit defendants liability.literary works,at quoting amchem,at.the antagonistic interests were so pronounced,on an issue so crucial,that the settlement required a structural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals.amchem,at.
two years later,the supreme court again considered a class action that joined present and future claimants in a single class,and emphasized it is obvious after amchem that a class divided between holders of present and future claims requires division into homogenous subclasses under rule c b,with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel.ortiz,at.a second fatal deficiency in the ortiz settlement was that all present claimants were treated equally,notwithstanding that some had claims that were more valuable.it is no answer to say that these conflicts may be ignored because the settlement makes no disparate allocation of resources as between the conflicting classes for the very decision to treat them all the same is itself an allocation decision with results almost certainly different from the results that the disparate claimants would have chosen.id.at.these fault lines between present and future plaintiffs,and among plaintiffs with differently valued claims,were so fundamental that they required structural protection in the form of subclasses with separate counsel.id.
literary works contained the same ingredients of conflict identified in amchem and ortiz.literary works,at.the settlement divided class claims into three categories,capped defendants overall liability at million,and used a formula for splitting this amount.the settlement was less generous to the third category,and required the holders of those claims to exclusively bear the risk of,their recovery alone would be reduced to bring the total payout down to million.the class representatives of the single class included individuals with claims in each category nevertheless,we held that at a minimum class members with claims only in the third category required separate representation because their interests were antagonistic to the others on a matter of critical importance how the money would be distributed.id.at.
since some named representatives held claims across all three categories,the class did not encompass mutually exclusive groups as in amchem still,each impermissibly served generally as representative for the whole,not for a separate constituency.id.at quoting amchem,at.class representatives with claims in all three categories naturally would want to maximize their overall recovery regardless of allotment across categories,whereas class members with claims only in the third category would want to maximize the compensation for that category in particular.a great risk thus arose that class representatives would sell out the third category of claims for terms that would tilt toward the others.as it transpired,the resulting settlement awarded the third category less,and taxed that lesser recovery with all the risk that claim would exceed the liability cap.
we did not conclude that the third category inferior recovery w as determinative evidence of inadequate representation.id.at.the claims in third category were objectively the weakest.the problem,of course,wa s that we ha d no basis for assessing whether the discount applied to category c recovery appropriately reflect ed that weakness.id.we could not know the right value of the category c claims without independent counsel pressing its most compelling case.id.while the settlement was the product of an intense,protected,adversarial mediation,involving multiple parties,including highly respected and capable mediators and associational plaintiffs,these features of the negotiation could not compensate for the absence of independent representation because there could be no assurance that anyone advanced the strongest arguments in favor of the disfavored claims.id.at.the eventual settlement proved that o nly the creation of subclasses,and the advocacy of an attorney representing each subclass,can ensure that the interests of that particular subgroup are in fact adequately represented.id.at.divided loyalties are rarely divided down the middle.
like the classes in amchem,ortiz,and literary works,the unitary representation of these plaintiffs was inadequate.class representatives had interests antagonistic to those of some of the class members they were representing.the fault lines were glaring as to matters of fundamental importance.such conflicts and absence of incentive required a sufficient structural assurance of fair and adequate representation,amchem,at,but none was provided.
the conflict is clear between merchants of the b class,which are pursuing solely monetary relief,and merchants in the b class,defined as those seeking only injunctive relief.the former would want to maximize cash compensation for past harm,and the latter would want to maximize restraints on network rules to prevent harm in the future.amchem tells us that such divergent interests require separate counsel when it impacts the essential allocation decisions of plaintiffs compensation and defendants liability.amchem,at.the settlement agreement does manifest tension on an essential allocation decision merchants in the b class would share in up to billion of damages,while merchants in the b class would enjoy the benefit of some temporary changes to the defendants network rules.the same counsel represented both the b and the b classes.the class counsel and class representatives who negotiated and entered into the settlement agreement were in the position to trade diminution of b relief for increase of b relief.however,it is obvious after amchem that a class divided between holders of present and future claims requires division into homogenous subclasses with separate representation.ortiz,at.
moreover,many members of the b class have little to no interest in the efficacy of the injunctive relief because they no longer operate,or no longer accept visa or mastercard,or have declining credit card sales.by the same token,many members of the b class have little to no interest in the size of the damages award because they did not operate or accept visa or mastercard before november,or have growing credit card sales.unitary representation of separate classes that claim distinct,competing,and conflicting relief create unacceptable incentives for counsel to trade benefits to one class for benefits to the other in order somehow to reach a settlement.
class counsel stood to gain enormously if they got the deal done.the up to billion in relief for the b class was the cash settlement in an antitrust class action.payment card i,supp.at.for their services,the district court granted class counsel million in fees.in re payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litig.payment card ii,supp.the district court calculated these fees based on a graduated percentage cut of the b class recovery thus counsel got more money for each additional dollar they secured for the b class.but the district court calculation of fees explicitly did not rely on any benefit that would accrue to the b class,id.at,and class counsel did not even ask to be compensated based on the size or significance of the injunctive relief.id.the resulting dynamic is the same as in ortiz.as the supreme court recognized in that case when the potential for gigantic fees is within counsel grasp for representation of one group of plaintiffs,but only if counsel resolves another group of plaintiffs claims,a court can not assume class counsel adequately represented the latter group interests.ortiz,at.we expressly do not impugn the motives or acts of class counsel.nonetheless,class counsel was charged with an inequitable task.
the trouble with unitary representation here is exacerbated because the members of the b class could not opt out.the b merchants are stuck with this deal and this representation.we do not decide whether providing these class members with opt out rights would be a sufficient structural assurance of fair and adequate representation,amchem,at,to overcome the lack of separate class counsel and representative.visa check,at.it is enough to say that this feature of the settlement agreement compounded the problem.
one aspect of the settlement agreement that emphatically can not remedy the inadequate representation is the assistance of judges and mediators in the bargaining process.true,a mediator involvement in settlement negotiations helps to ensure that the proceedings were free of collusion and undue pressure.deutsche bank,cir.but even an intense,protected,adversarial mediation,involving multiple parties,including highly respected and capable mediators and associational plaintiffs,does not compensate for the absence of independent representation.literary works,at.the mission of mediators is to bring together the parties and interests that come to them.it is not their role to advance the strongest arguments in favor of each subset of class members entitled to separate representation,or to voice the interests of a group for which no one else is speaking.
nor is the problem cured by the partial overlap of merchants who get cash as members of the b class and become members of the b class as they continue to accept visa or mastercard.the force of amchem and ortiz does not depend on the mutually exclusivity of the classes it was enough that the classes did not perfectly overlap.we held as much in literary works,reasoning that named plaintiffs with claims in multiple subgroups can not adequately represent the interests of any one subgroup because their incentive is to maximize their own total recovery,rather than the recovery for any single subgroup.amchem observed that where differences among members of a class are such that subclasses must be established,we know of no authority that permits a court to approve a settlement on the basis of consents by members of a unitary class,some of whom happen to be members of the distinct subgroups.amchem,at quoting in re joint and dist.asbestos,cir,modified on reh g,cir.
moreover,whatever overlap presently exists is partial and shrinking with time.as of the september,fairness hearing,class counsel reported that the class was composed of about million merchants.that figure of course does not include merchants that have come into being since then,or those that will come into being in the future,all of whom will be members of only the b class.the membership of the b class,on the other hand,is fixed and finite.over time,the initial overlap will be reduced,and the gap between the interests of the b and b classes will continue to widen.
none of this is to say that b and b classes can not be combined in a single case,or that b and b classes necessarily and always require separate representation.problems arise when the b and b classes do not have independent counsel,seek distinct relief,have membership,and importantly are certified as.the requirements of rule a are applied with added solicitude in the class context because the certification of a mandatory settlement class effectively concludes the proceeding save for the final fairness hearing,and there is thus a heightened risk of conflating the fairness requirements of rule e with the independent requirement of rigorous adherence to those provisions of the rule designed to protect absentees,such as rules a and b.charron,at quoting ortiz,at.as in amchem,ortiz,and literary works,settlements that are approved simultaneously with class certification are especially vulnerable to conflicts of interest because the imperatives of the settlement process,which come to bear on the defendants,the class counsel,and even the mediators and the court itself,can influence the definition of the classes and the allocation of relief.for this reason,we scrutinize such settlements more closely.
of course we have blessed settlements that were the product of unitary representation,but those were entered into after class certification.for example,we approved a settlement negotiated by unitary counsel in charron but before doing so,we note d that unlike the situation in amchem,ortiz,and literary works,the settlement here was not being approved at the same time that the class was being certified.charron,at.accordingly,we were more skeptical of allegations that subclass conflicts required separate representation.id.true,charron observed a ll class settlements value some claims more highly than others,based on their perceived merits,and strike compromises based on probabilistic assessments,but that observation has less force in the context.charron also spoke of counsel trading one claim for another which may be permissible in the class action,we are concerned that counsel will trade the interests of one class for another which is not.
we have reason to think that that occurred here.structural defects in this class action created a fundamental conflict between the b and b classes and sapped class counsel of the incentive to zealously represent the latter.apparently,the only unified interests served by herding these competing claims into one class are the interests served by settlement i the interest of class counsel in fees,and ii the interest of defendants in a bundled group of all possible claimants who can be precluded by a single payment.this latter interest highlights the next problem with the settlement agreement.
this opinion already concludes that class plaintiffs were inadequately represented.accordingly,the settlement and release that resulted from this representation are nullities.see stephenson dow chem,cir,aff in part by an equally divided court and vacated in part,res judicata generally applies to bind absent class members except where to do so would violate due process and d ue process requires adequate representation at all times throughout the litigation.this outcome is confirmed by the substance of the deal that was struck.like the supreme court in amchem,we examine a settlement substance for evidence of prejudice to the interests of a subset of plaintiffs when assessing the adequacy of representation.literary works,at.here,the bargain that was struck between relief and release on behalf of absent class members is so unreasonable that it evidences inadequate representation.
it is familiar doctrine of the federal courts that members of a class not present as parties to the litigation may be bound by the judgment where they are in fact adequately represented by parties who are present consistent with the requirements of due process and full faith and credit.hansberry,at emphasis added see also stephenson,at part of the due process inquiry and part of the rule a class certification requirements involves assessing adequacy of representation and conflicts.similarly,p laintiffs in a class action may release claims that were or could have been pled in exchange for settlement relief but this authority is limited by the identical factual predicate and adequacy of representation doctrines.stores,at.w here class plaintiffs have not adequately represented the interests of class members,any c laims arising from a shared set of facts will not be precluded.id.at.
as discussed above,literary works concluded that inadequate representation was demonstrated by the relief afforded to a subset of the class.similarly,the release in stephenson was itself proof of inadequate representation,wheras the release in stores did not impugn the class representation.considered together,these cases illustrate when the tradeoff between relief and release as applied to a class member can violate due process.
literary works held that class members with claims in one of the categories were inadequately represented not only because they did not receive separate representation,but also because they solely bore the risk that the total amount claimed would exceed a preset liability cap.we observed that this feature of the settlement could not be justified by the relative weakness of those claims because that fact was already accounted for.literary works,at.we could discern no reason for subjecting the single category of claims to the whole risk of nor could the settlement proponents.id.at.when one category of class members are targeted for worse treatment without credible justification it strongly suggests a lack of adequate representation for those class members who hold only claims in this category.id.
in stephenson,we considered a collateral attack on a class action that had established a settlement fund for individuals injured by exposure to agent orange.the underlying litigation provided compensation only for those who discovered their injury before,yet released all future claims.two individuals who fell within the class definition of individuals injured by agent orange,but who learned of their injury after,challenged the release as applied to them.analogizing the case to amchem and ortiz,we concluded that the two individuals were inadequately represented in the prior litigation because the settlement purported to resolve all future claims but the settlement fund was permitted to terminate in and n o provision was made for claimants.stephenson,at.the two challengers could not have been adequately represented if their class representative negotiated a settlement and release that extinguished their claims without affording them any recovery.the result violated due proces
