two named individuals and the pink triangle coalition ptc,a consortium of international gay and lesbian organizations,appeal from the orders of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york edward korman,chief judge entered on april,and may.in its orders,the district court declined to adopt the ptc proposal for the allocation of the historic settlement of holocaust victims class actions against swiss banks.the ptc objected to the district court allocation of certain settlement funds for the benefit of destitute holocaust survivors on the ground that,for a series of historical reasons,extremely few victims of nazi persecution of homosexuals can be identified as an alternative,the ptc proposed that of the settlement fund be set aside for,inter alia,scholarly,educational,and outreach efforts related to nazi persecution of homosexuals.the district court overruled the ptc objection and declined to adopt its accompanying proposal on the ground that priority in settlement fund distributions should be accorded to identifiable needy holocaust survivors.we now hold that,in doing so,the district court acted well within its discretion,and we affirm the court orders.
background 
this appeal arises from the district court allocation and distribution of the historic settlement fund in the holocaust victim assets litigation,which consolidated several class actions by nazi persecution victims against swiss banks.three other appeals from the district court allocation and distribution orders were argued in tandem with appellants one brought by,inter alia,organizations representing persons with disabilities,represented here by the disability rights associates dra another brought by,inter alia,the holocaust survivors,hsf and a third brought by samuel dubbin.we adjudicate these appeals in separate opinions filed today.see in re holocaust victim assets,cir dra appeal in re holocaust victim assets,cir hsf appeal in re holocaust victim assets,cir dubbin appeal.in the opinion addressing the hsf appeal,we summarize the claims underlying the holocaust victim assets litigation and its procedural history.see in re holocaust victim assets,at.we assume familiarity with that summary and highlight here only those background events directly relevant to this appeal.
in august,the parties to the holocaust victim assets litigation agreed in principle to release defendant banks and certain other swiss entities from liability in exchange for the creation of a billion settlement fund explicitly designed to benefit jews,homosexuals,jehovah witnesses,the disabled and recognized by the united nations as having been the targets of systematic nazi persecution on the basis of race,religion or personal status.in re holocaust victim assets,d.four of the five classes designated in the settlement agreement and certified by the district assets class,looted assets class,slave labor class i,and refugee of members of these persecuted groups and their heirs id.at.on august,the district court entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement agreement.in re holocaust victim assets,no.cv.
on november,the district court also approved a plan for the allocation and distribution of settlement funds developed by special master judah gribetz.see in re holocaust victim assets,wl,dist.lexis.of the billion fund,million was allocated to the deposited assets class,which is composed largely of heirs of victims of nazi persecution who deposited funds in swiss banks.in re holocaust victim assets,d.under the plan,the remainder of the fund is to be shared principally by the other four settlement classes.because the distribution of million allocated to the looted assets class was not susceptible to individualized claims or to a meaningful pro rata distribution,the court adopted a cy pres remedy targeting the neediest survivors in the looted assets class.id.at emphasis added.ninety percent of this cy pres remedy was earmarked for needy jewish survivors,and ten percent for needy roma,jehovah witness,disabled,and homosexual survivors.id.at.
in,the ptc submitted to the special master a proposal for a cy pres allocation of one percent of the total settlement as an appropriate means of publicly acknowledging the suffering of homosexuals as a class under the nazis and as an instrument to advance the prevention of human rights abuses based on sexual orientation from happening again.pink triangle coalition,proposal for a cy pres allocation for homosexual victims of the nazis,submitted to special master judah gribetz.the proposal included a detailed account of the persecution suffered by members of the gay and lesbian community at the hands of the nazi regime.id.at.the following is but a brief summary of the facts recounted in the ptc proposal 
from their early public statements about homosexuality in the late,through their assumption of power in,and until their defeat in,the nazis attempted to systematically eradicate homosexuality from the german nation by outlawing,stigmatizing,and persecuting expressions of homosexuality.the nazi regime campaign to eradicate homosexuality began with the destruction of research centers,cultural resources,business establishments,communications media,and community organizations throughout germany.it led to the arrest and imprisonment of approximately homosexual men,the deportation of to homosexual men to slave labor and concentration camps,the subjection of an undetermined number of homosexual male internees to heinous medical experiments,and finally the outright murder of an estimated to homosexual men identified and interned as such.
id.at footnote omitted.
the ptc proposal also underscored the challenges of locating gay and lesbian holocaust survivors,as well as the historical roots of these challenges 
after,the circumstances encountered by homosexual survivors of nazi persecution are unique because homosexual men continued to be singularly and intensively pursued,imprisoned,and persecuted in west germany and austria under the same legal codes used by the nazis until as late as and,respectively.survivors were publicly stigmatized,harassed,silenced,and they were excluded from compensation and ignored by elected officials for more than forty years.
as a consequence,very few homosexual victims have come forth to seek compensation or claim assets.moreover,due to the fear of being,many of the victims did not disclose their homosexuality to their families or the state.given the climate for homosexual victims,it is more than reasonable to presume that many did not inform their families about their sexual orientation and many more did not or were not able to have families of their own.similar to many of the victims with disabilities,the majority of homosexual victims in all likelihood did not have heirs,successors,administrators,executors,or other affiliates who could act on their behalf.
the first political acknowledgement of the injustice of nazi atrocities perpetrated against homosexuals did not come until nearly half a century after the crimes occurred.homosexual victims were not even mentioned in memorials and museum exhibits at the concentration camps until the.finally,homosexual victims had no extended familial,social and organizational networks outside of germany such as those relied on by victims from religious or ethnic groups which could advocate on their behalf and contribute to the formation of a collective memory of the crimes of which they had been victims.
id.at footnote omitted.
arguing that the overwhelming majority of the individual victims will never be able to come forward and claim their due compensation under the swiss banks settlement,id.at,the ptc proposed to use the cy pres allocation it had requested to support the following four initiatives 
providing material assistance to needy homosexual survivors of nazi persecution,including those who have not come forward for compensation under the current suit.
supporting scholarly research aimed at more fully documenting the crimes committed by the nazi regime and at locating additional survivors of persecution by the nazis.
promoting the education of students and the general public about the nazi persecution of homosexuals.such efforts might include,but are not limited to,curriculum development projects websites historical exhibits public monuments and the identification,preservation,and interpretation of historic sites.
advancing efforts to prevent persecution throughout the world today by supporting a diversity of educational,outreach,and awareness programs.
on january,the ptc moved in the district court for the cy pres distribution recommended in its proposal.the district court denied the ptc motion on march,without prejudice to renewal in the event of a second plan of distribution.
on september,the district court ordered,pursuant to the special master recommendation,certain supplemental allocations to settlement classes.in re holocaust victim assets,no.cv.these included an additional million allocation to the looted assets class for distribution in accordance with the cy pres principles that governed the initial million allocation,slip op.at.
on october,the special master reported to the district court that over million of the billion fund had been awarded through direct payments or humanitarian assistance to nearly a quarter of a million class members,the vast majority of whom are surviving victims of nazi persecution the other recipients are the heirs of owners of swiss bank accounts who received distributions as members of the deposited assets class.in re holocaust victim assets,special master interim report on distribution and recommendation for allocation of excess and possible unclaimed residual funds,no.cv,at,special master interim report.of that amount,million had been allocated to the looted assets class and distributed to or reserved for future disbursements by programs,that offer food,medicine,shelter and similar assistance to needy holocaust victims.id.at.the special master interim report also noted that the international organization for migration iom,which oversees the distribution of settlement funds to homosexual,roma,jehovah witness,and disabled victims of nazi persecution,see in re holocaust victim assets,d at,continues to consult with experts and organizations as to how best to locate and serve needy homosexual nazi victims,special master interim report at.despite having contacted fifty homosexual ngos,foundations,and organizations which work in this community throughout europe,the iom experienced extremely limited success in locating victims of nazi persecution against homosexuals.id.at.
the special master proposed that an additional million,attributable primarily to interest income accruing on the settlement fund,be allocated to the looted assets class for distribution in accordance with the cy pres principles that have successfully governed the administration of the previous million and million allocations to that class.id.at.the special master also recommended that the district court invite proposals for the allocation and distribution of any unclaimed amounts that might remain from the up to million allocated to the deposited assets class,of which approximately million remain ed as of the date of the special master interim report.id.at.in an order filed november,the district court adopted the special master recommendations.in re holocaust victim assets,no.cv.
on december,the ptc submitted a joint objection to the special master october,allocation recommendation and proposal in response to the special master inquiry regarding the future allocation of unclaimed funds.o n behalf of homosexual victims of the third reich,nearly all of whom are now impossible to identify,the ptc objected to the special master proposed distribution of all residual unclaimed funds only to identified needy living holocaust victims.the ptc again proposed a cy pres allocation of one percent of the settlement fund to support the four initiatives it had previously advanced.
in a memorandum and order of april,the district court overruled the ptc objection and declined to adopt the ptc proposal.in re holocaust victim assets,d.the district court reasoned that a separate distribution to remembrance and education programs dedicated to homosexual victims of the nazis was not warranted for three reasons.id.at.first,homosexual victims are only entitled to such distributions as as a group.id.at.second,and more importantly,the court stated that it was unable to justify the million allocation advocated by the ptc given the current level of need experienced by individual members of the looted assets class,such as the identified destitute jewish survivors in the former soviet union alone,many of whom are in danger of starving without continued assistance.id.finally,the court cautioned against assuming that homosexual survivors have not received a proportionate share of the total distributions in this case.id.the court noted that some of the survivors who received funds on the basis of their membership in other victim groups may have been homosexual,even if not explicitly identified or targeted by the nazis as such.id.in addition,the court cited a clear record of awards in the deposited assets class being made based on accounts once held by homosexual victims of nazi persecution and noted that homosexual partners have been recognized as heirs in the claims process.id.the court concluded that b ecause so many survivors continue to face needs on a daily basis,the worthy goals advanced by the ptc can not be currently funded by the settlement fund.id.at emphasis added.
on may,the district court filed a memorandum clarifying its april,memorandum and order 
the word currently appeared to leave open the possibility that at a future date,such programs could be the recipients of money from the settlement fund.but after holding a hearing on april,regarding the distribution of any possible residual funds in this case,and having heard from many members of the survivor community and the organizations that assist them,it is evident that the personal needs among survivors of nazi persecution for food,winter relief,emergency assistance,medicine and home health care will remain too pressing to justify any future distribution to the ptc proposed programs for research,education,or advocacy.to the extent that my april,memorandum and order left open the possibility that i could reconsider this question at a future date,i now clarify that my decision was final.
in re holocaust victim assets,no.cv,slip op.at may.
appellants filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.
discussion 
as we have held in an earlier appeal related to this litigation,t he district court has broad supervisory powers with respect to the administration and allocation of settlement funds,and we will disturb the scheme adopted by the district court only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.in re holocaust victim assets,cir citing beecher able,cir,and quoting in re agent orange prod.liab,cir.professor burt neuborne,the lead settlement counsel in this case has aptly summarized the reasons for our deferential approach to district court settlement allocation decisions generally,and to the district court allocation decisions in this particular litigation 
in a complex class action settlement like this one,fraught with difficult legal and moral judgments,someone must make the final choice between and among numerous praiseworthy alternatives.under federal rule of civil procedure and the structure of the swiss bank settlement agreement,that heavy responsibility falls on the shoulders of the supervising district judge,whose thoughtful discretionary judgments are entitled to respect and deference in this court.

that said,the district court discretion is not unbounded.we have previously recognized that a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon,cir footnotes omitted.
before considering whether the district court exceeded its discretion here,it is helpful to clar
