appellant,john canney,iii,chapter trustee for the estate of maxwell frazer trustee,appeals from an opinion and order of the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions,judge,dated august.the district court reversed the decision of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of vermont robert krechevsky,bankruptcy judge dated august,which denied appellee merchants bank request for relief from an automatic stay.
this appeal concerns the intersection of federal bankruptcy law with vermont strict foreclosure law.after obtaining several loans from merchants bank and securing the loans by mortgages on his property and assignment and pledge of the stock in his restaurant,maxwell frazer max country village store and g restaurant frazer defaulted on the loans.merchants bank obtained a foreclosure judgment from state court that specified the amounts due and a deadline for frazer to redeem,cure his default.days prior to the deadline,frazer filed for bankruptcy protection.
the issues raised by this appeal are whether the automatic stay provisions of a or the time limitations of b apply when a mortgagor files for bankruptcy during the equity of redemption period following entry of judgment in a vermont strict foreclosure action and if the automatic stay provisions do not toll the equity of redemption period,whether those provisions toll either the recording of the certificate of or the issuance of the writ of possession.we follow our sister circuits and hold that b,not a,governs the tolling of a period of equitable redemption.because the redemption period lapsed without redemption,we find that neither frazer nor the trustee has a legally cognizable right or interest in the property that justifies encumbrance by the federal bankruptcy laws.finally,we hold that neither the recording of the certificate of nor the issuance of the writ of possession is stayed by a.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the facts in this case are undisputed.between may and march,merchants bank provided several loans to frazer merchants bank secured the loans by either mortgages on frazer real property located in the town of weathersfield,vermont the property,or assignment and pledge of the stock in his restaurant.frazer defaulted on the loans,and in january,merchants bank sought foreclosure.
in june,frazer entered into a stipulation and judgment and shortened redemption period,which was so ordered by the state court on july.the parties agreed that the equity of redemption period would expire on september.
on september,a consolidated judgment order and decree of foreclosure foreclosure judgment was issued by the windsor superior court.see merchants bank frazer,windsor super.docket.the foreclosure judgment forever barred frazer from equity redemption unless merchants bank was paid the full amount due on the mortgage on or before september.
on september,frazer filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.that petition was dismissed,however,for lack of jurisdiction on december.the next day,frazer filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.
on june,merchants bank moved for relief from the automatic stay,arguing that the equity of redemption period is not stayed by,on the ground that the timing provisions of b take precedence over tolling.merchants bank relied on decisions from the united states courts of appeals for the sixth,seventh,and eighth circuits.
the bankruptcy court denied merchants bank motion on august.see in re frazer.the bankruptcy court considered it significant that all but one of the circuit court cases relied on by merchants bank involved the statutory right of redemption following a foreclosure by sale.see id.at.the bankruptcy court found dispositive the distinction between a mortgagor equity of redemption,which is a property interest that exists prior to the passing of title,and a right,available only in those states where statutes so provide,to repurchase the already foreclosed property from a buyer following a foreclosure sale.id.emphasis added.relying on the prior decisions of bankruptcy courts in vermont and connecticut the two states in which strict foreclosure rather than foreclosure by sale is the usual method of foreclosure,rather than the decisions of the sixth,seventh,and eighth circuits,the bankruptcy court held that the equity of redemption period is stayed by and denied merchants bank motion.id.at.merchants bank appealed.
on may,frazer chapter case was converted to a chapter case,and john canney,iii,was appointed trustee of the estate.
on august,the district court issued its opinion and order reversing the bankruptcy court.see merchants bank.the district court found persuasive the case law in other circuits analyzing the issue of how b and a interrelate and concluding that the timing provisions of b take precedence over a tolling where no affirmative act triggering the indefinite stay provision of may be found.see id.at.the district court noted that the vermont cases that take a contrary approach rely primarily on the legislative history of a without reference to.stat.ann.and determined that the issue could be resolved by the procedural requirements of vermont law.id.at.the district court recognized that although the passage of full title,both legal and equitable,to the mortgagee,not under a decree of judicial sale,passes after the recording of the decree in foreclosure in the appropriate city or town clerk office and the expiration of the redemption date s specified in the decree of foreclosure,id.at quoting,at,this affirmative act is only required on the part of the foreclosing mortgag ee prior to obtaining title when there are subsequent purchasers,mortgag ees or attaching creditors.id.at quoting.stat.ann.the court therefore concluded that,with respect to the mortgagor,title passes without reference to.stat.ann,and thus no additional act is required in the state of vermont which would trigger the indefinite stay of a.id.at.
additionally,the court reasoned that,while all debtors are generally protected under the indefinite stay of a,that protection is limited for those who had agreements to pay by a particular date under b.id.at.consequently,the district court followed the direction of the sixth,seventh,and eighth circuits and held that the indefinite stay provided for in a is superseded by the timing provisions of b.id.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
this appeal requires us to analyze the intersection of federal bankruptcy law with vermont strict foreclosure law in order to address the following questions whether the automatic stay provisions of a or the time limitations of b apply when a mortgagor files for bankruptcy during the equity of redemption period following entry of judgment in a vermont strict foreclosure action and if the automatic stay provisions do not toll the equity of redemption period,whether those provisions toll either the recording of the certificate of or the issuance of the writ of possession.
vermont strict foreclosure law 
before wading into federal bankruptcy law,a brief explanation of the vermont strict foreclosure law is warranted strict foreclosure is the normal method of foreclosure only in connecticut and vermont.in re frazer,quoting baxter dunaway,the law of distressed real estate foreclosure,workouts,procedures,rev.in vermont,a mortgage conveys legal title to the mortgagee at the time the mortgage is granted.see mitchell aldrich,pierce brown.o nce the condition of a mortgage is broken,the mortgagee becomes at law the absolute owner of the property and is entitled to immediate possession rassman am.fid,quoting kelly clement bank,see also town of bristol united states,same,citing cases.a mortgagee may assert its right to possession by peaceable entry by eviction or by seeking a foreclosure judgment in county court 
through a foreclosure judgment,a mortgagee formally takes possession of the property.a foreclosure judgment vests full legal and equitable title to the property with the mortgagee,subject only to the mortgagor equity of redemption,which is a contingent equitable interest in the property,and limited rights to possession,rents,and profits of the property during the period of redemption.see stowe,burlington sav.bank,under vermont law if no one redeems foreclosed property within the prescribed period,the foreclosing mortgagee,pursuant to the vermont strict foreclosure procedure,chapter,subchapter,obtains full and complete title and has the right to sell the property and retain the surplus,if any.hooper wilson,i t is universally allowed that the mortgagor is tenant,and therefore no trespasser,until the mortgagee has asserted his right of possession,and then the mortgagor has only the equity of redemption.emphasis added dieffenbach attorney of,cir u ntil a foreclosure decree,the mortgagor was the equitable owner of the fee,with legal title vested in the mortgagee only for the protection of his security interest.see also.stat.ann.aldrich lincoln land,discussing right of redemption and emphasizing that responsibility for complying with the conditions of redemption are on the one seeking the exercise of the right.redemption or satisfaction of the foreclosure judgment is the operative contingency curing the default within the time period specified in the foreclosure judgment vests equitable title with the mortgagor failure to do so,however,extinguishes the contingent interest.see,stowe center,at dieffenbach,at,aldrich,at.
in this case,merchants bank effectively asserted its rights,including its right of possession,and obtained a foreclosure judgment in its favor in the windsor superior court on september.accordingly,as of that date,frazer only interest in the property was the equity of redemption.see,hooper,at dieffenbach,at.as the decree makes clear,the equity of redemption is irreversibly foreclosed and forever barred if the mortgagor fails to redeem within the period set forth in the decree.
in analyzing whether a or b apply in this case,we must keep in mind that p roperty interests are created and defined by state law.butner united states,d.because frazer sought bankruptcy protection after the foreclosure judgment had been filed but during the redemption period specified in that judgment,his equity of redemption,a contingent equitable interest in the property subject to extinguishment absent redemption within the allotted time,became property of the estate within the meaning of federal bankruptcy laws.see a 
tolling of the period of redemption 
we begin our analysis of federal bankruptcy law with the statutory text.section a provides,in pertinent part 
a except as provided in subsection b of this section,a petition filed under section,or of this title,or an application filed under section a of the securities investor protection act of operates as a stay,applicable to all entities,of 
the commencement or continuation,including the issuance or employment of process,of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title 
the enforcement,against the debtor or against property of the estate,of a judgment obtained before the commencement of the case under this title 
any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate 
any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate 
any act to create,perfect,or enforce against property of the debtor any lien to the extent that such lien secures a claim that arose before the commencement of the case under this title 
a.section b provides,in pertinent part 
b except as provided in subsection a of this section,if applicable nonbankruptcy law,an order entered in a nonbankruptcy proceeding,or an agreement fixes a period within which the debtor may file any pleading,demand,notice,or proof of claim or loss,cure a default,or perform any other similar act,and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition,the trustee may only file,cure,or perform,as the case may be,before the later of 
the end of such period,including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case or 
days after the order for relief.
b.the situation presented by this case seems to fall within the scope of both provisions.on one hand,the foreclosure judgment in favor of the mortgagee resulted from a proceeding against the debtor and left the mortgagor with a right to redeem within a specified timeframe.this right is property of the estate within the meaning of,suggesting that a may apply.on the other hand,the foreclosure judgment is an order entered in a nonbankruptcy proceeding that fixes a period within which the debtor may cure a default,suggesting that b may apply.
neither the statutory text nor the legislative history of a and b directly addresses how these provisions relate to one another.nonetheless,vermont bankruptcy courts have consistently held that the automatic stay provisions of a toll the duration of a debtor equity of redemption period.see in re shea realty,in re realty.
in contrast,three circuit courts have considered the interrelation between the provisions at issue here and determined that the timing provisions of b take precedence over a tolling.see in re tynan,cir in re glenn,cir johnson first bank,cir see also in re maanum,cir r egardless of the type of property interest affected,a can not be read to stay the mere running of a statutory time period.section b and section a are mutually exclusive anything temporarily stayed under the specific language of section b is not indefinitely stayed by the more general language of section a.quoting johnson,at justice valley bank,cir applying johnson rationale and holding that b trumps b.following the reasoning of johnson and maanum,the eighth circuit determined that b,rather than a,governed in a strict foreclosure proceeding,where a south dakota state court had entered a foreclosure judgment declaring that the carvers had defaulted on a contract for deed they had entered into pertaining to certain real estate in south dakota and specifying the conditions for redemption.see in re carver,cir.
the seminal case on the applicability of a and b to a statutory redemption period following a mortgage foreclosure was bank of commonwealth bevan,in that case,the mortgagee and purchaser appealed an order of the bankruptcy court staying the statutory redemption period following a foreclosure sale of the debtor residential property.id.at.the district court noted that,w hile the nature and extent of the debtor interest in real property is determined by application of state law,the bankruptcy code defines those interests in property which become property of the estate and hence within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.id.at citing collier on bankruptcy ed accordingly,the bevan court concluded that the right of redemption created under state law generally passes into the estate of the debtor if the period of redemption has not expired at the time the petition is filed.id.at citing collier on bankruptcy,ed.we agree.
the bevan court concluded that u nder the language of a,an automatic stay applies to acts,proceedings and their continuation,and enforcement of judgments against the debtor or property of the estate,and does not effect sic the running of specific time periods unlike which speaks explicitly to that issue.id.at.the bevan court further reasoned that 
an interpretation of a as an indefinite stay of the statutory period of redemption would render b superfluous.if a automatically stays the running of the statutory right to redeem until the stay is lifted pursuant to c or d,the pertinent time allotments of b are completely extraneous as statutory time periods designed to control the trustee activity.moreover,if a is interpreted to provide for the automatic stay of time periods for an indefinite amount of time,then subsections a and b of,which define minimum and maximum time periods for the trustee to act,directly conflict with a.
id.at.the bevan court noted that although would give the debtor greater protection,where one section of the bankruptcy code explici
