background 
christopher millea suffers from severe stress disorder as a result of combat as a marine during the first gulf war.notwithstanding psychotherapy and medication,he suffers unpredictable panic attacks and exhaustion that can require time off work on short notice.in,millea began working for metro north,a area commuter railroad.in,he applied for special leave under the fmla metro north approved his application and granted him days of intermittent fmla leave for.
the incident.in the summer of,millea was working in a stamford storeroom under supervisor earl vaughn,with whom millea had developed a contentious relationship.a phone conversation with vaughn on september,developed into a heated disagreement that triggered one of millea panic attacks.millea immediately left work to see his doctor.because the encounter with vaughn led to the attack,millea did not inform vaughn about his unforeseen fmla leave instead,he advised garrett sullivan,the lead clerk,and asked sullivan to advise vaughn,which sullivan did.the next day,millea called sullivan at am to report that he was taking another fmla day sullivan again relayed the information to vaughn.in both instances,vaughn received timely,although indirect,notice of millea use of fmla leave.
metro north internal leave policy provides,in relevant part,i f the need for fmla leave is not foreseeable,employees must give notice to their supervisor as soon as possible.because millea did not notify vaughn of his two absences directly,vaughn told metro north payroll department to log millea absences as leave.metro north then opened an official investigation of millea,which resulted in a formal notice of discipline being placed in his employment file for one year.the notice was expunged after a year,millea having had no further disciplinary incidents.after the investigation,millea voluntarily transferred to a custodian janitorial job,which paid slightly less but was not supervised by vaughn.
the complaint.millea complaint against metro north alleges that he never violated metro north internal leave policy because he notified vaughn indirectly of his absences,or,in the alternative,that the aspect of metro north policy he violated was void because it conflicted with the regulations implementing the fmla.millea alleges three claims 
interference with millea ability to take fmla leave.see a it shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under this subchapter.
retaliation against millea for taking fmla leave by i placing a notice of discipline in his employment file for a year ii requiring him to update his fmla certification iii creating a work environment that motivated him to transfer to a lower paying job iv delaying approval of his bid for the lead custodian position in and v subjecting him to heightened managerial surveillance.see a it shall be unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter.
intentional infliction of emotional distress iied.
the answer.on the interference claim,metro north answered that it was entitled to log millea absences as leave because he violated metro north legally valid internal leave policy.on the retaliation claim,metro north answered that none of the claimed acts of retaliation was the result of millea use of fmla leave,and none was materially adverse.on the iied claim,metro north answered that any violation of the fmla was not done intentionally or outrageously and so could not amount to iied.
the trial.millea suit against metro north was tried in may.millea requested that the court charge the jury on the definition of materially adverse employment action using the standard articulated by the supreme court in burlington northern santa fe railway white,d burlington northern,a title vii retaliation claim case.the court rejected the proposed charge on the ground that this case involved the fmla,not title vii,and instead issued an instruction with a narrower definition of materially adverse.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of millea on his interference claim,awarding him in lost wages and other damages.the jury found in favor of metro north on both the retaliation and iied claims.millea moved for costs and attorneys fees,and the court awarded in attorneys fees and in costs.metro north moved for judgment as a matter of law on the interference claim and for its costs associated with the retaliation and eeid claims.the court denied these motions.
both parties now appeal.
discussion 
this appeal and together present three questions.first,did the district court err in denying metro north request for judgment as a matter of law on millea interference claim second,did the district court commit nonharmless error when it rejected millea proposed retaliation instruction based on the burlington northern standard third,did the district court abuse its discretion in awarding millea only in attorneys fees for his successful interference claim 
we review a district court ruling on a rule motion de novo,and apply the same standard used by the district court below.cobb pozzi,cir.judgment as a matter of law is available only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the prevailing party on that claim.a.judgment as a matter of law is only granted when there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture,or there is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded persons could not arrive at a verdict against it.cruz local union of the int l of workers,cir brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
metro north argues there is no legal basis on which the jury could have concluded that metro north interfered with millea exercise of his fmla rights.metro north concedes that millea was entitled to take fmla leave and that it disciplined millea for his use of such leave,but argues that such discipline was justified as a matter of law by millea failure to comply with metro north internal leave policy requiring an employee to notify his supervisor directly when fmla leave is taken.there is no dispute that a company may discipline an employee for violating its internal leave policy as long as that policy is consistent with the law however,we conclude that,on these facts,metro north internal leave policy is inconsistent with the fmla.
the fmla generally requires employees to comply with the employer usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave.c.however,this requirement is relaxed in unusual circumstances or where the company policy conflicts with the law.id.
the regulations implementing the fmla provide that when an employee need for fmla leave is unforeseeable as millea was,n otice may be given by the employee spokesperson,spouse,adult family member,or other responsible party if the employee is unable to do so personally.id.a.because this regulation expressly condones indirect notification when the employee is unable to notify directly,metro north policy conflicts with the fmla and is therefore invalid to the extent it requires direct notification even when the fmla leave is unforeseen and direct notification is not an option.
whether millea situation on september constituted an unusual circumstance in which he was unable to personally notify vaughn is a question of fact,not of law.the jury found that millea gave proper notice,meaning his notice complied with the fmla and all legally valid aspects of metro north internal leave policy.neither the district court nor this court may this finding.
metro north also argues that the jury verdict on the interference claim must be vacated because the district court committed legal error by charging the jury that an employer internal leave policy may not be more strict than the requirements of the fmla.metro north argues this instruction was impermissibly broad and vague.we disagree.
the district court charged the jury 
in determining whether millea notice occurred as soon as practicable,you must consider all of the facts and circumstances of the situation.you should note that under the fmla,notice may be given by the employee,by a family member,or other responsible adult,such as a treating physician or other medical professional.you should also note that an employer may impose customary rules and procedures for notification,provided that they are not more stringent than the requirements under the family medical leave act.
this instruction is not misleading it correctly explains that the fmla authorizes indirect notification and that an employer is free to implement internal notification rules only to the extent those rules are not more strict than the law allows.
metro north argues that the not more stringent language is overly broad because companies may implement internal leave policies more strict than the fmla as long as the timing requirement is not more strict than the fmla permits.this is incorrect the fmla limits stringency,requiring certain latitude in terms of timing,method of notification.if the law expressly states that an employee may do a thing,a company internal leave policy may not prohibit it.in this case,the fmla implementing regulations state that an employee in millea position may notify his employer indirectly of his need for unforeseen medical leave a company internal leave policy may not require otherwise.the jury instruction correctly captured this idea.
even if millea prevails on his interference claim,he would be entitled to no damages unless he suffered a compensable loss as a result of the alleged interference.the fmla provides that an employer interfering with its employee legitimate use of leave shall be liable to the employee affected for damages equal to the amount of any wages,salary,employment benefits,or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation.a a i i.metro north argues that when it logged millea medical leave as sick leave instead of fmla leave,millea suffered no compensable loss because both types of leave were unpaid,and that it is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law that it owes millea nothing.
it appears from the record that metro north never made this argument before the district court.its opposition to millea motion for attorneys fees implicitly conceded the validity of the damages award it used this award as the basis for its calculation of attorneys fees.arguments raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived.eastman kodak stwb,cir t his court ordinarily will not hear arguments not made to the district court.having tacitly accepted the validity of the damage award before the district court,metro north waived this argument even if it had merit,which is doubtful 
millea challenges the judgment dismissing his retaliation claim on the ground that the jury instruction defining materially adverse action constituted reversible error.we review de novo a claim of an erroneous jury instruction.gordon bd.of,cir.to justify a new trial,a jury instruction must be both erroneous and prejudicial.id.at.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.id.an erroneous jury instruction is prejudicial unless the court is convinced that the error did not influence the jury verdict.id.
millea sought a charge using the definition of materially adverse employment action articulated by the supreme court in the title vii lawsuit,burlington northern santa fe railroad white,d.in particular,millea proposed that an adverse employment action occurs when a reasonable employee in the plaintiff position would have found the alleged retaliatory action materially adverse,and that a retaliatory action is materially adverse when the action would have been likely to dissuade or deter a reasonable worker in the plaintiff position from exercising his legal rights.
the district court rejected millea proposed instruction,instead charging the jury 
an adverse employment action is a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.examples of material adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment are termination,demotion,loss of benefits,or significantly diminished responsibilities.an alteration of job responsibilities and a mere inconvenience are not examples of materially adverse changes in the terms and conditions of employment.
millea argues that in light of the reasoning in burlington northern,the district court definition of materially adverse was impermissibly narrow and therefore erroneous.we agree.
burlington northern expanded the definition of materially adverse employment action for purposes of title vii retaliation claims.now,a title vii plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court rejected the proposition that an actionable act of retaliation must relate to the specific terms and conditions of the employee employment,id.at,and construed materially adverse action broadly to include changes in employment life outside of the terms and conditions of employment.id.the court concluded that only this broader definition fulfilled the purpose of title vii provision preventing employers from deterring their employees from exercising their legitimate legal rights.id.at.
this rationale applies with comparable force to the provision of the fmla.the fmla provision has the same underlying purpose as title vii and almost identical wording.compare a it shall be unlawful for any employer to discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter,with a it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.
we therefore join our sister circuits that have considered this issue and apply the burlington northern standard for materially adverse action to the fmla context.see breneisen motorola,cir applying burlington northern standard to fmla retaliation claims metzler fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir same mcardle dell,app x,cir unpublished opinion per curiam same dicampli korman,app x,cir unpublished opinion same csicsmann sallada,app x,cir unpublished opinion per curiam same.for purposes of the fmla provision,a materially adverse action is any action by the employer that is likely to dissuade a reasonable worker in the plaintiff position from exercising his legal rights.
by instructing the jury that a material adverse action is restricted solely to changes in the employee terms and conditions of employment,the district court committed legal error.
millea further argues that the erroneous jury instruction prejudiced him,and that retrial is required on his retaliation claim.we agree.
of the five retaliatory acts alleged by millea,the jury found only one causally related t
