this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,birnbaum contends that the district court abused its discretion by granting a default judgment in favor of the guggenheim llcs.for the reasons described below,we reject this argument.before we reach the merits of his argument,however,we first address our jurisdiction to hear this claim.
jurisdiction 
applicable law 
issues relating to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,even on appeal,and even by the court sua sponte.cave meadow union free sch,cir.we have subject matter jurisdiction over appeals from the final decisions of district courts.thus,we must determine whether the district court intended the judgment to represent the final decision in the case.bankers trust mallis.

application 
the complaint alleged,in addition to federal and state trademark claims,a rico violation and fraud.the district court default judgment specifically identified that the action had been brought under the lanham act and rico,but only ruled on the federal and state trademark claims hence,although neither party briefed the issue,at first glance,it appears that two claims may have survived the district court default judgment,raising a question as to the finality of that judgment.
at oral argument on appeal,both parties indicated that they understood the default judgment to be the final decision on the merits as to all of the claims raised by the guggenheim llcs.the district court,moreover,intended the same after making certain ancillary rulings,it terminated all outstanding motions and ordered the case closed.ellender,at concluding that judgment was final appealable decision when clerk was informed that judgment closed the case.the docket reflects no further involvement by the district court in this case.houbigant,at.
we further note that,in the nearly two years since the district court entered its default judgment,aside from defending the appeal,the guggenheim llcs have declined to further prosecute any claims to the extent any remained outstanding.hence,they would suffer no prejudice by our treating the default judgment as final.mindful that we are directed to give a practical rather than a technical construction to section,cohen,at,we conclude that the default judgment entered against birnbaum dismissed the rico and fraud claims against birnbaum without prejudice hence,the judgment was a final decision,and we have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal.
default judgment under rule 
turning to the merits,we conclude that,notwithstanding birnbaum arguments to the contrary,in light of birnbaum numerous discovery violations,the district court did not abuse its discretion by entering a default judgment pursuant to rule 
applicable law 
if a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,the district court may impose sanctions,including rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party.b a vi.certain rule remedies dismissing a complaint or entering judgment against a defendant are severe sanctions,but they may be appropriate in extreme situations,as when a court finds willfulness,bad faith,or any fault on the part of the noncompliant party.bobal rensselaer polytechnic,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.

application 
entry of default judgment 
the district court found that birnbaum intransigence spanned months,and that less serious sanctions would have been futile.birnbaum raises no legitimate challenge to these findings,and we find no error in these conclusions or findings of fact,particularly in light of his failure to answer the complaint or oppose the motion for default judgment.see.teddy bear beargram co,cir a default is an admission of all wellpleaded allegations against the defaulting party.hence,we focus on the willfulness of birnbaum default and the sufficiency of the warnings he received.
willfulness 
the district court found that birnbaum had willfully disobeyed its discovery orders.it made this finding after recounting numerous extensions provided to permit birnbaum participation throughout the discovery process.it further noted that birnbaum had not complied with written and oral court orders,before it found that birnbaum had a demonstrated history of willful with court orders.default,ecf see also shcherbakovskiy da capo al fine,f d,cir noting district courts possess wide discretion in imposing sanctions under rule but declining to enter default judgment without explanation supporting the sanction.but see cine forty second theatre allied artists pictures,cir failure to comply may be excused if defendant made good faith efforts to comply or if compliance was thwarted by circumstances beyond his control.given birnbaum sustained recalcitrance,this finding was not clearly erroneous.
ii.warnings for non compliance 
birnbaum contends that he was not sufficiently warned of the consequences of a default judgment.he argues that a more thorough warning was necessary as he appeared without counsel during the april,hearing when the default judgment was discussed.in light of the record as a whole,this argument is without merit.
our rule precedents hold that a court abuses its discretion if it dismisses a case without first warning a pro se party of the consequences of failing to comply with the court discovery orders.see valentine museum of modern art,cir per curiam.we have no analogous precedent in the default judgment context,but even entries of default judgments against counseled clients require sufficient notice.see reilly.natwest mkts.grp,cir due process requires that courts provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before imposing any kind of sanctions.alteration,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.see generally sieck russo,cir affirming entry of a default judgment against defendants who were warned that a default judgment will be entered against them if they failed to appear internal quotation marks omitted.both dismissal and entry of default judgment,however,are serious,rule sanctions hence,a court is similarly obliged to provide adequate notice of a default judgment as a sanction against a party proceeding pro se 
in light of this obligation,we must assess whether the district court warnings which mentioned sanctions,but never the phrase default judgment were sufficient.by comparison,in valentine museum of modern art,we concluded that a district court had sufficiently warned the pro se defendant where the court read and explained relevant portions of rule on the record before ultimately dismissing the case.at.here,the district court warnings were not so specific,but it warned birnbaum regularly and often throughout the case,birnbaum received six separate warnings.first,at a january,conference,the district court verbally warned birnbaum that he had to participate in discovery as ordered,then issued a written order outlining birnbaum discovery obligations.second,in a february,order to show cause,the district court directed birnbaum to explain why contempt sanctions should not be imposed for his failure to respond to plaintiffs discovery requests as ordered by this court.order to show cause,ecf.third,in a february,telephone call,the district court orally chastised birnbaum for practices relating to his deposition.fourth,by its february,order,the district court emphasized that sanctions would be imposed for a ny further improper disruption of the deposition.order,ecf.fifth,the guggenheim llcs requested their default judgment in open court,with birnbaum present.sixth,after describing birnbaum numerous efforts to delay the proceedings,the district court stated that we have reached the point in the proceedings where i need to take action.hr g tr.and finally,birnbaum was served with a copy of the guggenheim llcs order to show cause for default judgment,and a proposed default judgment was filed on the docket birnbaum did not opp
