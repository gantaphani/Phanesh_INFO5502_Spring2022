in settling a civil lawsuit against public officials,the parties in this case convinced the district court to issue a report that the parties and the district court have treated as a gag order barring the parties from disclosing the terms and conditions of the settlement.in short order,erasmo rodríguez,a lawyer assisting one of the parties,made statements about the settlement to the local press.unhappy with the press coverage of their secretive settlement,the public officials who were parties to the settlement obtained an order from the district court holding rodríguez in contempt and referring him to the commonwealth of puerto rico supreme judicial court for disciplinary review.finding no basis in the record to support the contention that rodríguez violated any court order,we reverse.
in,several people were wrongfully convicted of murder based in large part on the allegedly false testimony of one key witness.see,cir.after one of those people committed suicide in prison,the witness came forward to recant her testimony,claiming that law enforcement personnel had coerced and bribed her into giving fabricated testimony.id.the criminal defendants appealed to puerto rico supreme judicial court,their convictions were vacated,and the charges against them were dropped.rodríguez was appointed to represent one group of the criminal defendants in that appeal he successfully worked to obtain the reversal of their criminal convictions.
the wrongfully convicted individuals their heirs or assigns brought two suits,consolidated into this single case,against the police officers and prosecutors who had been involved in their prosecutions.various defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of absolute or qualified immunity,which the district court denied.on interlocutory appeal,we affirmed the district court ruling as to all but one defendant,and we sent the case back to the district court in anticipation of trial.see id.
at that juncture,the parties to the civil lawsuit reached a settlement following discussions mediated by a magistrate judge.at the parties request,the magistrate judge memorialized the settlement which had not yet been reduced to writing in a fourth settlement conference report.the aptly named report did just that it reported the terms and conditions of the parties agreement,including three terms relevant to this appeal the settlement agreement shall not signify acceptance of liability regarding the facts alleged in the complaint the parties shall maintain in strict confidentiality all the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement and the court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce all the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement.
the parties to this appeal,including rodríguez,treat the report as if it actually ordered compliance with the terms and conditions it reported.while that reading could be questioned,in the absence of any argument by anyone that the report was not an order to comply with the terms of the reported settlement,we will assume the parties shared understanding to be correct.the parties also all assume that the magistrate judge had the power to issue an order enjoining certain prospective conduct,but see b,so we shall as well,given the parties apparent unanimous consent,id.c.finally,rodríguez waives any argument that he was not subject to the assumed order.
four days after the magistrate judge entered the report,a regional weekly newspaper called el regional published an article titled,the circle is closed.the article stated that the plaintiffs achieved victory against the puerto rican government by way of settlement,but they were going to receive much less than the ten million dollars they initially sought.the precise amount the plaintiffs would be paid under the settlement was not stated because of the court confidentiality agreements,but the paper noted that it would be a small fraction of their claimed damages and it might take several years for the amount to be paid out.the article then quoted rodríguez as saying 
it was inconvenient for them the government to fight it because of the circuit of boston decision and because of the implications made by both the federal and circuit courts.this case is a vindication of the plaintiffs rights.it is never payment for the damages suffered,because that will not cover the loss of the lives of manuel ortiz and leopoldo sanabria that has no price.or the death of hector merced that has no price,and the damage will never be compensated,but at least there is that implicit recognition of the violation of the plaintiffs civil rights.
no plaintiffs were quoted in the piece,nor were any of the plaintiffs attorneys.
the defendants claimed breach,or more precisely violation,triggering civil contempt proceedings that eventually targeted rodríguez.after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the district court found that rodríguez made only the quoted statement directly attributed to him.the district court further found that the quoted statement violated the order because it revealed a term or condition of the settlement agreement.
rodríguez first argument on appeal is that there is insufficient evidence to support the finding that he made even the statement directly attributed to him.we easily reject this argument.the article itself was entered into evidence at the contempt hearing without objection or restriction.it expressly identified rodríguez as the source of the quoted statement.rodríguez,in turn,never testified otherwise.such a record provides ample support for the district court fact finding in a civil contempt proceeding.see langton johnston,cir.
this brings us to rodríguez second,and better,argument that the statement he was found to have made did not violate the court order.as a preliminary matter,we eschew any broad reading of the court order when determining whether rodríguez statement violated it.as construed by the district court and the parties,the order constituted a prior restraint on speech.such restraints bear a heavy presumption against their constitutional validity,times united states,quoting bantam books,sullivan,and even when valid are narrowly construed,se.promotions,conrad,exceptions to the doctrine of prior restraint are few and narrow.principles of contempt similarly counsel against any broad reading of the presumed order a finding of contempt for violating a court order should issue only when there is clear and convincing proof of a violation of a court decree.burke guiney,cir.quoting erhardt prudential,cir.see also in re grand jury investigation,cir.a complainant must prove civil contempt by clear and convincing evidence and the putative contemnor must have violated a clear and unambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was expected and who was expected to behave in the indicated fashion.quoting project kemp,cir.finally,while we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its ultimate decision to impose a contempt sanction for abuse of discretion,united states saccoccia,cir,our review will proceed more searchingly when,as here,we are confronted with a finding of contempt than when we are called upon to consider a finding exonerating a putative contemnor from a charged contempt,project,at.
employing these principles of law,we can not agree with the district court that rodríguez violated the order.in finding a violation,the district court pointed to the report summary of the portion of the parties settlement agreement disavowing any concession of liability.the report summary states the settlement agreement shall not signify acceptance of liability regarding the facts alleged in the complaint.the district court found that rodríguez revealed the substance of this clause.it reasoned that by saying the settlement was a vindication of the plaintiffs rights and b y stating that the settlement agreement was an implicit recognition of the violation of plaintiffs civil rights,rodríguez was indicating that defendants were liable to plaintiffs.for two reasons,we disagree.
first,rodríguez statement to the press was silent on the matter of liability.rodríguez instead addressed the righ
