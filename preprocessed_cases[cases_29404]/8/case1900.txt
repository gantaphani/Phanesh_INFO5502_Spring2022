hartford life and accident insurance company hartford appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin.after a bench trial on the administrative record,the district court found that dennis paese was entitled to benefits under a disability plan provided by his employer,sequa corporation sequa,through an insurance policy issued by hartford.see generally paese hartford life accident ins,wl,wl.
hartford contends that the district court erred in awarding paese disability benefits,damages for outside insurance coverage,and attorney fees.we affirm the district court award of disability benefits and attorney fees,but we vacate its award of damages for the purchase of supplemental insurance.in so doing,we clarify that a plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies when bringing a claim for benefits pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa section a b,a b,does not mean we lack subject matter jurisdiction,but rather is an affirmative defense,subject to waiver,estoppel,futility,and similar equitable considerations.
background 
sequa hired paese in march,and he served as its director of labor and employee relations from january until september.on august,paese injured his neck,shoulders,back and wrists in an automobile accident.paese initially returned to work after the accident,but on september,he left work in severe pain,and never returned.a short time later,sequa reorganized paese department and eliminated his position.
paese participated in sequa group long term disability insurance policy the sequa plan,which was issued by hartford and governed by erisa.the sequa plan offered three possible periods of disability benefits,depending on eligibility benefits for six months benefits for months after the expiration of the benefits,for employees who,due to accident or sickness,could not perform the essential duties of their own occupation and disability benefits thereafter until the social security normal retirement age age for paese,for employees who,due to accident or sickness,could not perform the essential duties of any occupation for which they are qualified by education,training or experience.
paese received six months of benefits consisting of salary continuation at a rate of per week from september,until march.on march,paese filed for disability benefits,claiming total disability from september.on april,hartford requested that sequa clarify paese job duties,and sequa subsequently explained that extensive travel in europe and north america by car and airplane was an essential function.on april,paese had surgery on his elbow and arms,in order to treat symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.on may,hartford approved paese application for disability benefits beginning march,concluding that he was totally disabled under the own occupation standard.on september,paese underwent back surgery.
beginning in early,hartford began to have second thoughts.hartford assistant medical director,george kazda,and a registered nurse on hartford clinical staff,cynthia french,reviewed paese file.kazda and nurse french concluded that,contrary to the opinions of his treating physicians,paese was not really totally disabled from performing his own occupation.based on this internal review,hartford changed its mind,and concluded that paese was not totally disabled under the own occupation standard.accordingly,on october,hartford reversed its earlier decision and refused to pay further disability benefits.
in a series of letters from paese to hartford between november and february,paese administratively appealed the decision to terminate his benefits.in these letters,paese responded to hartford findings and provided additional medical information and test results,as well as the names of additional treating physicians.in february,paese also provided hartford a copy of a determination by the social security administration ssa that he was totally disabled.
on march,paese months of long term benefits expired,causing the automatic transition from the own occupation standard to the any occupation standard.as a part of paese administrative appeal,hartford requested that barry turner,a medical consultant,review paese medical records.on march,turner issued a report recommending final termination of paese disability benefits because he was not and according to turner never was,even immediately after his accident totally disabled.on march the march transition to the any occupation finally denied paese request for benefits.
on december,paese commenced this action against hartford.the parties stipulated to a bench trial on the administrative record,without witnesses.during the course of the bench trial,paese sought to introduce the results of a medical examination by robert stoller,which provided yet another independent evaluation of paese injuries and disability.this report had been prepared during the course of a personal injury action in new jersey arising out of the automobile accident that had caused paese injuries.though the report had not previously been a part of the administrative record,the district court admitted and relied on it in making its decision.see paese,wl,at.
after considering the record,the district court found that paese was totally disabled under both the own occupation and any occupation standards,and was therefore entitled to benefits of per month starting october,with prejudgment interest,future benefits under the sequa plan,and reasonable attorney fees.see id.at.
following the ruling,the parties submitted competing proposals on what was owed to paese.ultimately,the district court directed entry of a final judgment of,which consisted of back disability benefits of,attorney fees of,and the cost of conversion and alternative insurance paid by paese of.this appeal followed.
discussion 
award of disability benefits 
hartford raises several issues on appeal regarding the district court award of disability benefits.it contends that the district court improperly shifted the burden to hartford to prove paese total disability abused its discretion by considering evidence outside the administrative record clearly erred in awarding paese benefits under the own occupation standard and exceeded its jurisdiction by awarding paese permanent disability benefits under the any occupation standard.the first three issues do not require much discussion while the fourth affords us an opportunity to clarify the exhaustion requirements under erisa.
burden of proof 
the placement of the burden of proof is a question of law that we review de novo.see locher unum life ins.of,cir.all parties agree that as a matter of general insurance law,the insured has the burden of proving that a benefit is covered.mario p c food markets,cir.
hartford contends that the district court improperly placed the burden on hartford throughout its analysis of paese claimed total disability,based in large part on the following solitary line of the district court opinion hartford itself decided,on may,that paese was totally disabled,and it has simply not demonstrated that paese condition had improved by october,to the point that he was no longer disabled.paese,wl,at emphasis in original.
we disagree that this lone reference shows that the district court did anything wrong.at the outset of its analysis,it clearly and correctly stated that paese has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is totally disabled within the meaning of the plan.id.the district court carefully analyzed and weighed the evidence.see id.at.it credited both paese evidence and the independent medical evidence,and it discounted hartford evidence.our review of the record leads us to conclude that the court understood the burden of proof and placed it where it belonged.
consideration of evidence outside administrative record 
hartford next claims that the district court abused its discretion by admitting stoller report.again,we disagree.where,as here,the plan administrator is not disinterested,hartford was both the plan administrator and insurer,the decision whether to admit additional evidence is one which is discretionary with the district court,but which discretion ought not to be exercised in the absence of good cause.defelice am.int l life assurance,cir,cited in muller first unum life ins,cir.the district court,applying defelice,found that good cause existed for the admission of the report because it was highly probative and written by a disinterested party who had actually examined paese,and because paese was not at fault for the report initial absence from the record in light of these entirely appropriate findings,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the report.
eligibility under the own occupation standard 
hartford next argues that the district court erred in finding that paese was eligible for benefits from march,to march,under the own occupation standard.once again,we disagree.where an erisa plan does not accord an administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,a district court reviews all aspects of an administrator eligibility determination,including fact issues,de novo.locher,at quoting firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also krizek cigna group,cir muller,at.neither party disputes that the sequa plan does not give hartford full discretion to interpret and apply its terms.thus,the district court correctly found that it could review hartford decision to terminate benefits de novo,instead of under a more restrictive arbitrary and capricious standard.see paese,wl,at.
where the district court reviews an erisa plan eligibility determination de novo,we,in turn,review factual findings for clear error,and legal conclusions de novo.see locher,at.under those standards,we conclude that there were sufficient facts in the record generated from a variety of which the district court appropriately discussed and relied support the finding that paese was totally disabled.see paese,wl,at.the district court drew no impermissible inferences from the evidence,nor is it evident to us that the court was mistaken in its conclusion.
as for the specific issue of whether the district court gave undue weight to the conclusions of paese treating physicians,see id.at,the supreme court has explicitly stated that,unlike the ssa,erisa plan administrators need not give special deference to a claimant treating physician.see black decker disability plan nord,d c ourts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation.however,the court in black decker also observed that erisa plan administrators may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician.id.accordingly,while black decker holds that no special deference is required,this does not mean that a district court,engaging in a de novo review,can not evaluate and give appropriate weight to a treating physician conclusions,if it finds these opinions reliable and probative.this is precisely what happened here.
as for the specific issue of whether the district court gave undue weight to the ssa finding that paese was totally disabled,we are not troubled.see paese,wl,at.the court acted well within its discretion when it considered the ssa findings as some evidence of total disability,even though they were not binding on the erisa plan,and even though the ssa definition of disability may differ from that in the sequa plan.see billinger bell atlantic,d,plaintiff alleges that the social security administration decision to grant her social security disability benefits is evidence of a complete disability under the plan.while i agree that it is evidence,it is but one piece of evidence internal citations omitted pagan nynex pension plan,social security determinations are not binding on erisa plans kunstenaar.life ins,cir statutory definitions of disability such as those governing the ssa are not binding on a district court engaged in de novo review of an erisa plan denial of disability benefits muller,at as to the ssa decision,it was made after first unum review had been completed and has little independent probative value.true,the ssa determination did not bind either the erisa plan or the district court.however,it does not follow that the district court was obligated to ignore the ssa determination,especially if the district court found the determination probative,if not necessarily dispositive,as was the case here.
eligibility for permanent benefits under the any occupation standard 
having disposed of the majority of hartford arguments,we now turn to the key issue in this case.hartford maintains that the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant paese permanent benefits under the any occupation standard because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies and had not given hartford the opportunity,in the first instance,to decide the issue.initially,we note although erisa requires that all benefit plans provide for carrier review,see,it contains no statutory exhaustion requirement.indeed,section a b of erisa,under which paese brought his claim,simply states that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan,does not itself include an exhaustion requirement.that said,the federal this recognized a firmly established federal policy favoring exhaustion of administrative remedies in erisa cases.kennedy empire blue cross blue shield,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the first question we must address is whether a plaintiff failure to exhaust the remedies provided in an erisa plan implicates our subject matter jurisdiction,or merely serves as an affirmative defense.
as the supreme court has recently reminded us in eberhart united states,d per curiam clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.id.at quoting kontrick ryan,d.in other words,we are called on to address whether the administrative exhaustion requirement under erisa section a b is truly jurisdictional in the article iii sense,or is more akin to a rule,which would be an affirmative defense subject to equitable considerations such as waiver,estoppel or futility.
admittedly,our case law has been somewhat casual when discussing the exhaustion requirements under section a b.on the one hand,we occasionally use jurisdictional language when discussing the exhaustion requirements.see,peterson cont l cas,cir a bsent a determination by the plan administrator,federal courts are without jurisdiction to adjudicate whether an employee is eligible for benefits under an erisa plan.emphasis added.on the other hand,we have also stated that absent a clear and positive showing that seeking review by the carrier would be futile,that remedy must be exhausted prior to the institution of litigation.jones unum life ins.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added but see locher,at characterizing jones as holding that the issue of eligibility for permanent benefits had not ripened into a dispute capable of conferring jurisdiction on a district court until the plan administrator had made a determination in that regard.
in our latest albeit tangential statement on this subject in nichols prudential insurance of america,cir,we stated that it was unclear whether a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under erisa section a b is properly brought for failure to state a claim,lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or on some other procedural basis.nichols,at.we declined to resolve the issue,recognizing that the standard of review was the same de novo regardless.see id.moreover,we suggested that a plan administrator failure to adhere literally to the regulatory deadlines renders the claimant administrative remedies exhausted by operation of law and consequently permits the claimant to seek review in the federal courts without further delay.id.at.
our court has recognized a number of situations where a administrative exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense and not a jurisdictional bar.for instance,we have held that in the employment discrimination context,the exhaustion requirement,while weighty,is not jurisdictional,boos runyon,cir,and is subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.see zipes trans world airlines,d briones runyon,cir.similarly,under the labor management relations act of,see,the failure to exhaust labor union grievance procedures is an affirmative defense,rather than a jurisdictional bar.see sellers floor crafters,cir johnson motors,cir.also,under the financial institution reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,we have held that the complete failure to take the appropriate administrative action constituted a jurisdictional bar to suit in federal court,but that the mere late filing of such an action,after the agency limitation period had expired,did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.see carlyle towers condo.ass fdic,cir although the firrea makes exhaustion a jurisdictional requirement,it does not necessarily follow that compliance with time limits imposed by the fdic has the same force.
perhaps our most thorough investigation of the question of whether exhaustion is jurisdictional comes from our recent analysis of the prison litigation reform act plra,a.see generally hemphill new york,cir.we concluded that unless the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is essential to the existence of the claim,or to ripeness,and therefore to the presence of an article iii case or controversy,the statutory requirement to exhaust administrative remedies under the plra did not affect a court jurisdiction to hear the case.richardson goord,cir per curiam quoting perez.dep t of,cir.since richardson,we have held that a litigant failure to exhaust in the plra context is an affirmative defense that can be waived,and that a defendant actions may subject him to claims of estoppel.see giano goord,cir ziemba wezner,cir per curiam jenkins haubert,cir accord handberry thompson,cir.
in the plra context,courts now perform a inquiry to determine whether a can successfully rebut an affirmative defense of failure to exhaust were the administrative remedies in fact available to the prisoner hemphill,at citing abney,at did the defendant forfeit the affirmative defense of by failing to raise or preserve it or is he otherwise estopped from raising the defense hemphill,at citing johnson testman,cir and ziemba,at and have special circumstances been plausibly alleged that justify the prisoner failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements hemphill,at quoting giano,at.
we believe that these principles,developed in the plra context,serve as particularly apt analogs to the administrative exhaustion requirements under erisa section a b.it is certainly true,as described above,that there is a firmly established federal policy favoring exhaustion of administrative remedies in erisa cases.kennedy empire blue cross blue shield,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,we have described the primary purposes of the exhaustion requirement under erisa as follows 
to uphold congress desire that erisa trustees be responsible for their actions,not the federal courts to provide a sufficiently clear record of administrative action if litigation should ensue to assure that any judicial review of fiduciary action or inaction is made under the arbitrary and capricious standard,not de novo to help reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits under erisa to promote the consistent treatment of claims for benefits to provide a nonadversarial method of claims settlement and to minimize the costs of claims settlement for all concerned.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.
these important policy goals have little or no bearing on the existence of a claim,or on ripeness,and therefore have little to do with the presence of an article iii case or controversy.the fact that erisa,unlike the plra,does not even contain a statutory exhaustion requirement,further strengthens our conclusion.indeed,the requirement is purely a concept that developed in the absence of statutory language demonstrating that congress intended to make erisa administrative exhaustion a jurisdictional requirement.richardson,at numerous circuits have pointed out that the plra lacks the sweeping and direct language that would indicate a jurisdictional bar rather than a mere codification of administrative exhaustion requirements.internal quotation marks omitted.for these reasons,we hold that a failure to exhaust erisa administrative remedies is not jurisdictional,but is an affirmative defense.
having determined that a failure to exhaust erisa administrative remedies under section a b is an affirmative defense,we now consider whether hartford can successfully assert it.to begin,paese argues that hartford failed to object to the any occupation determination before the district court.in general we refrain from passing on issues not raised below.virgilio city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted see singleton wulff,d.the law in this circuit is clear that where a party has shifted his position on appeal and advances arguments available but not pressed below,waiver will bar raising the issue on appeal.united states braunig,cir,quoted in stores,visa,cir.
as paese correctly observes,hartford knew from the moment they received his complaint in december that he sought future benefits up until the time of his death based on his permanent disability.complaint at.yet,prior to the district court decision,hartford neglected to raise this issue even after the district court decision,hartford failed to raise this issue,even though it had numerous opportunities to do so.for instance,hartford submitted an opposition to paese proposed judgment.in this lengthy filing,hartford objected to paese calculations of interest,cost of living adjustments,and purchase of outside insurance,and requested that paese recovery be reduced by his receipt of social security benefits.however,hartford did not object to the award of past benefits from october,until april,which includes the march,transition date,nor to the award of benefit payments into the future.
we recognize that we retain broad discretion to consider issues not raised below because the waiver rules are prudential and not jurisdictional.see westinghouse credit,cir.however,when the waived issue involves factual determinations,as is the case here,we are seldom inclined to exercise this discretion.see baker dorfman,cir.thus,because this issue on the transition from the own occupation to the any occupation standard was not raised before the district court,and involves some factual determinations and not merely questions of law,we deem it waived.see burnette carothers,cir finding appellants waived a claim where they failed to raise this issue in the district court,even though they were then represented by counsel and no miscarriage of justice will result.
even if this issue had been raised below,we would nonetheless conclude that hartford could not successfully assert it.here,the transition from the own occupation standard to the any occupation standard on march,occurred during the pendency of paese administrative appeal,and prior to the erisa plan final determination on march.thus,here we are faced with an appeal process that began during the time period of the own occupation standard,but finally ended during the time period of the any occupation standard.paese essentially argues both that hartford actions estop it from now claiming that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the permanent disability benefits under the any occupation standard,and that any attempt to exhaust his administrative remedies would have been futile we agree.
a party claiming equitable estoppel must have relied on its adversary conduct in such a manner as to change his position for the worse,and that reliance must have been reason
