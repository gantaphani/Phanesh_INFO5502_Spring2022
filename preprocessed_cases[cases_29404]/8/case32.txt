under the patent act of,if a patent and trade office pto examiner denies a patent application,the applicant may file an administrative appeal with the pto board of patent appeals and interferences.if the board also denies the application,the applicant may appeal directly to the court of appeals for the federal circuit under.alternatively,the applicant may file a civil action against the pto director under,which permits the applicant to present evidence that was not presented to the pto.
respondent hyatt filed a patent application covering multiple claims.the patent examiner denied all of the claims for lack of an adequate written description.hyatt appealed to the board,which approved some claims but denied others.pursuant to,hyatt filed a civil action against the director,but the district court declined to consider hyatt newly proffered written declaration in support of the adequacy of his description,thus limiting its review to the administrative record.applying the deferential substantial evidence standard of the administrative procedure act apa to the pto factual findings,the court granted summary judgment to the director.on appeal,the federal circuit vacated the judgment,holding that patent applicants can introduce new evidence in proceedings,subject only to the limitations in the federal rules of evidence and the federal rules of civil procedure.it also reaffirmed its precedent that when new,conflicting evidence is introduced,the district court must make de novo findings to take such evidence into account.
held there are no limitations on a patent applicant ability to introduce new evidence in a proceeding beyond those already present in the federal rules of evidence and the federal rules of civil procedure.if new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact,the district court must make de novo factual findings that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the pto.
a section,by its express terms,neither imposes unique evidentiary limits in district court proceedings nor establishes a heightened standard of review for pto factual findings.nonetheless,the director contends that background principles of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and impose a deferential standard of review in proceedings.as the director concedes,however,judicial review in proceedings is not limited to the administrative record because the district court may consider new evidence.if it does so,the district court must act as a factfinder and can not apply the apa deferential standard to pto factual findings when those findings are contradicted by new evidence.moreover,the doctrine of administrative exhaustion the primary purpose of which is the avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative process,mckart united states,does not apply because the pto process is complete by the time a proceeding occurs.
b the core language of the patent act,codified as revised statute,remains largely unchanged in.decisions interpreting thus inform this court understanding of.both butterworth united states ex rel.hoe,and morgan daniels,describe the nature of proceedings,but the two opinions can be perceived as being in some tension.butterworth described the proceeding as an original civil action seeking de novo adjudication of the merits of a patent application,while morgan described it as a suit for judicial review of agency action under a deferential standard.the cases are distinguishable,however,because they addressed different circumstances.butterworth discussed a patent applicant challenge to the denial of his application,whereas morgan involved an interference proceeding that would now be governed by,not,and in which no new evidence was presented.here,this court is concerned only with a proceeding in which new evidence was presented to the district court,so butterworth guides this court decision.thus,a district court conducting a proceeding may consider all competent evidence adduced and is not limited to considering only new evidence that could not have been presented to the pto.the introduction of new evidence in proceedings is subject only to the federal rules of evidence and the federal rules of civil procedure,and if new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed factual question,de novo findings by the district court will be necessary for that new evidence to be taken into account along with the evidence before the board.
c the district court may,however,consider whether the applicant had an opportunity to present the newly proffered evidence before the pto in deciding what weight to afford that evidence.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the patent act of,et,grants a patent applicant whose claims are denied by the patent and trademark office pto the opportunity to challenge the pto decision by filing a civil action against the director of the pto in federal district court.in such a proceeding,the applicant may present evidence to the district court that he did not present to the pto.this case requires us to consider two questions.first,we must decide whether there are any limitations on the applicant ability to introduce new evidence before the district court.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that there are no evidentiary restrictions beyond those already imposed by the federal rules of evidence and the federal rules of civil procedure.second,we must determine what standard of review the district court should apply when considering new evidence.on this question,we hold that the district court must make a de novo finding when new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact.in deciding what weight to afford that evidence,the district court may,however,consider whether the applicant had an opportunity to present the evidence to the pto.
the patent act of establishes the process by which the pto examines patent applications.a patent examiner first determines whether the application satisfies the statutory prerequisites for granting a patent.if the examiner denies the application,the applicant may file an administrative appeal with the pto board of patent appeals and interferences board.if the board also denies the application,the patent act gives the disappointed applicant two options for judicial review of the board decision.the applicant may either appeal the decision directly to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit,pursuant to or file a civil action against the director of the pto in the united states district court for the district of columbia pursuant to 
in a proceeding,the federal circuit must review the pto decision on the same administrative record that was before the pto.thus,there is no opportunity for the applicant to offer new evidence in such a proceeding.in dickinson zurko,we addressed the standard that governs the federal circuit review of the pto factual findings.we held that the administrative procedure act apa,et,applies to proceedings and that the federal circuit therefore should set aside the pto factual findings only if they are unsupported by substantial evidence.at quoting.
in zurko,we also noted that,unlike,permits the applicant to present new evidence to the district court that was not presented to the pto,at.this opportunity to present new evidence is significant,not the least because the pto generally does not accept oral testimony.see brief for petitioner.we have not yet addressed,however,whether there are any limitations on the applicant ability to introduce new evidence in such a proceeding or the appropriate standard of review that a district court should apply when considering such evidence.
in,respondent gilbert hyatt filed a patent application that,as amended,included claims.the pto patent examiner denied each claim for lack of an adequate written description.see requiring patent applications to include a specification that provides,among other information,a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it.hyatt appealed the examiner decision to the board,which eventually approved claims,but denied the rest.hyatt then filed a action in federal district court against the director of the pto director,petitioner here.
to refute the board conclusion that his patent application lacked an adequate written description,hyatt submitted a written declaration to the district court.in the declaration,hyatt identified portions of the patent specification that,in his view,supported the claims that the board held were not patentable.the district court determined that it could not consider hyatt declaration because applicants are precluded from presenting new issues,at least in the absence of some reason of justice put forward for failure to present the issue to the patent office.hyatt dudas,civ.action d dc,app.to pet.for cert.quoting deseversky brenner,cadc.because the excluded declaration was the only additional evidence submitted by hyatt in the proceeding,the evidence remaining before the district court consisted entirely of the pto administrative record.therefore,the district court reviewed all of the pto factual findings under the apa deferential substantial evidence standard.see supra,at see also mazzari rogan,ca fed.applying that standard,the district court granted summary judgment to the director.
hyatt appealed to the federal circuit.a divided panel affirmed,holding that the apa imposed restrictions on the admission of new evidence in a proceeding and that the district court review is not wholly de novo.hyatt doll.the federal circuit granted rehearing en banc and vacated the district court grant of summary judgment.the en banc court first held that congress intended that applicants would be free to introduce new evidence in proceedings subject only to the rules applicable to all civil actions,the federal rules of evidence and the federal rules of civil procedure,even if the applicant had no justification for failing to present the evidence to the pto.reaffirming its precedent,the court also held that when new,conflicting evidence is introduced in a proceeding,the district court must make de novo findings to take such evidence into account,at.we granted certiorari,and now affirm.
the director challenges both aspects of the federal circuit decision.first,the director argues that a district court should admit new evidence in a action only if the proponent of the evidence had no reasonable opportunity to present it to the pto in the first instance.second,the director contends that,when new evidence is introduced,the district court should overturn the pto factual findings only if the new evidence clearly establishes that the agency erred.both of these arguments share the premise that creates a special proceeding that is distinct from a typical civil suit filed in federal district court and that is thus governed by a different set of procedural rules.to support this interpretation of,the director relies on background principles of administrative law and practice under a patent statute that predated.for the reasons discussed below,we find that neither of these factors justifies a new evidentiary rule or a heightened standard of review for factual findings in proceedings.
to address the director challenges,we begin with the text of.see,magwood patterson,slip,at.section grants a disappointed patent applicant a remedy by civil action against the director.the section further explains that the district court may adjudge that such applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his invention,as specified in any of his claims involved in the decision of the pto,as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the director to issue such patent on compliance with the requirements of law.by its terms,neither imposes unique evidentiary limits in district court proceedings nor establishes a heightened standard of review for factual findings by the pto.
in the absence of express support for his position in the text of,the director argues that the statute should be read in light of traditional principles of administrative law,which congress codified in the apa.the director notes that requires a district court to review the reasoned decisionmaking of the pto,an executive agency with specific authority and expertise.accordingly,the director contends that a district court should defer to the pto factual findings.the director further contends that,given the traditional rule that a party must exhaust his administrative remedies,a district court should consider new evidence only if the party did not have an opportunity to present it to the agency.
we reject the director contention that background principles of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and require a deferential standard of review in a proceeding.under the apa,judicial review of an agency decision is typically limited to the administrative record.see.but,as the director concedes,proceedings are not so limited,for the district court may consider new evidence.when the district court does so,it must act as a factfinder.zurko,at.in that role,it makes little sense for the district court to apply a deferential standard of review to pto factual findings that are contradicted by the new evidence.the pto,no matter how great its authority or expertise,can not account for evidence that it has never seen.consequently,the district court must make its own findings de novo and does not act as the reviewing court envisioned by the apa.see.
we also conclude that the principles of administrative exhaustion do not apply in a proceeding.the director argues that applicants must present all available evidence to the pto to permit the pto to develop the necessary facts and to give the pto the opportunity to properly apply the patent act in the first instance.brief for petitioner citing mckart united states.but as this court held in mckart,a primary purpose of administrative exhaustion is,of course,the avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative process.at.that rationale does not apply here because,by the time a proceeding occurs,the pto process is complete.section,moreover,does not provide for remand to the pto to consider new evidence,and there is no pressing need for such a procedure because a district court,unlike a court of appeals,has the ability and the competence to receive new evidence and to act as a factfinder.in light of these aspects of proceedings at least in those cases in which new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed question of fact we are not persuaded by the director suggestion that proceedings are governed by the deferential principles of agency review.
having concluded that neither the statutory text nor background principles of administrative law support an evidentiary limit or a heightened standard of review for factual findings in proceedings,we turn to the evidentiary and procedural rules that were in effect when congress enacted in.although is a relatively modern statute,the language in that provision originated in the act of july,act,ch,stat,and the history of proceedings can be traced back to the act of july,act,ch,stat.thus,we begin our inquiry with the act,which established the patent office,the pto predecessor,and first authorized judicial review of its decisions.
the act provided that a patent applicant could bring a bill in equity in federal district court if his application was denied on the ground that it would interfere with another patent,at see also shipman,handbook of the law of equity pleading.three years later,congress expanded that provis
