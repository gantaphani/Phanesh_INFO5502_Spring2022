on april,a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico by eleven individuals alleging that as citizens of the united states residing in puerto rico they are being deprived of the right to vote for the candidates to the offices of president and of the united states,a condition which they view to be a violation of their constitutional rights to the same privileges and immunities,treaty rights,due process and equal protection of the laws enjoyed by united states citizens residing in the states.
plaintiffs,in effect,comprise two separate groups.the first includes individuals who have always resided in puerto rico and whose claim is based on their alleged right to vote for the national offices in question because they consider it a right inherent in united states citizenship.the second group is comprised of former residents of states who were eligible to vote during such residence in the states but became ineligible to do so upon taking residency in puerto rico.both groups claim entitlement to vote pursuant to the constitution of the united states and pursuant to treaty obligations assumed by the united states under the international covenant on civil and political rights,vol,ratified,cong.rec.april,iccpr.in addition,the second group also calls into question the constitutionality of the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act nocava,which allows united states citizens residing outside the united states to vote in federal elections as absentee voters in their last state of residence.because puerto rico is included within the definition of united states,residents of puerto rico who would otherwise qualify to vote pursuant to this statute are disqualified.this is claimed to be a violation of various constitutional provisions.
plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment against the united states affirming the invalidity of the denial of their alleged right to vote for the national offices in question.in addition,they sought an order requiring the united states to take all the necessary steps to implement their alleged right to vote for president and.
on june,the united states moved to dismiss the complaint claiming,in substance,that the allegations contained in the complaint are virtually identical to those previously brought by eleven individuals,including plaintiff igartua in the case of igartua de la rosa,et united states,in which the district court acosta,dismissed plaintiffs request for declaratory and injunctive relief for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see igartua united states,aff,cir,igartua i,cert.denied,d.the united states alleged that igartua i required dismissal of the present action under the principles of res judicata and stare decisis.
this motion was denied by the district court on july,in an extensive opinion,see igartua united states,d igartua ii,in which it ruled that the provisions of the iccpr were not and thus did not give rise to privately enforceable rights under united states law,and further that nocava did not violate plaintiffs constitutional rights.it ruled,however,that preventing plaintiffs from voting in presidential and elections was unconstitutional.
thereafter,on july,the commonwealth of puerto rico and its governor,pedro rossell√≥,moved to intervene in this action,in effect supporting the claims of plaintiffs.this intervention was allowed by the district court on july.
on august,the united states filed its answer,alleging in defense substantially the same grounds as claimed in its motion to dismiss,and in addition contending that the issues presented by plaintiffs raised political questions outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
after several intervening procedural events,on august,the district court entered a final opinion and order,essentially confirming its july opinion,and entering a final judgment 
declaring that the united states citizens residing in puerto rico have the right to vote in presidential elections and that its electoral votes must be counted in congress 
concluding that the government of puerto rico has the obligation to organize the means by which the united states citizens residing in puerto rico will vote in the upcoming and subsequent presidential elections and to provide for the appointment of presidential electors,and ordering the government of puerto rico to act with all possible expediency to create such mechanism and 
ordering the government of puerto rico to inform the court of all developments related to its implementation of the presidential vote until the votes are counted pursuant to the twelfth amendment to the constitution.
on september,the legislature of puerto rico enacted law for the purpose of allowing the citizens of the united states of america domiciled in puerto rico to vote in the election for the offices of president and of the united states,and to establish the procedures and mechanisms to effectuate said vote.this bill was signed into law on september,and became effective immediately.see law of september.
on september,the united states filed its notice of appeal from this final judgment and from the final opinion and order also entered by the district court on august,which contained provisions substantially the same as those in the final judgment.neither the plaintiffs nor the intervenor government of puerto rico and governor appealed.
for the reasons stated herein,we reverse and vacate the final judgment and final opinion and order and remand with instructions to dismiss the action.see toren toren,cir.this court,of course,expresses no opinion with regard to the validity under puerto rican law of law.
in igartua i,a case brought by the same lead plaintiff and lawyer who appears currently before us,this court held with undeniable clarity that the constitution of the united states does not confer upon united states citizens residing in puerto rico a right to participate in the national election for president and.addressing precisely the argument presented to the district court in this case,this court recognized that article ii of the constitution explicitly provides that the president of the united states shall be elected by electors who are chosen by the states,in such manner as each state legislature may direct.see id.at citing const.art.ii,cl.we concluded that puerto rico,which is not a state,may not designate electors to the electoral college,and therefore that the residents of puerto rico have no constitutional right to participate in the national election of the president and.see id.at.
since our decision in igartua i in,puerto rico has not become a state,nor has the united states amended the constitution to allow united states citizens residing in puerto rico to vote for president,as it did for united states citizens residing in the district of columbia with the amendment to the constitution.see id.at.absent such a change in the status of puerto rico or an amendment to the constitution of the united states,our decision in igartua i controls this case,unless there has been intervening controlling or compelling authority.see gately massachusetts,cir the doctrine of stare decisis renders the ruling of law in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision.see also williams ashland eng g,cir in a circuit,newly constituted panels are,for the most part,bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.
the district court attempted to distinguish igartua i in its july opinion but not in its final opinion and order on reasoning that while igartua i centered on plaintiff inability to vote for the president and vice president,the instant case revolves around their inability to elect delegates to the electoral college.igartua ii,d at.this effort at distinguishing igartua i obviously fails.under the constitution,the appointment of electors through the popular vote is the means by which the president and vice president are chosen,art.ii,cl.amend.xii.this court held in igartua i that the citizens resident in puerto rico do not have a right to vote in presidential elections because puerto rico is not entitled under article ii to choose electors for the president.igartua i,at.
there are two exceptions to the rule that earlier decisions are binding.first,an earlier panel decision may be undermined by controlling authority,subsequently announced,such as an opinion of the supreme court.williams,at.the second exception is for those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision,although not directly controlling,nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel,in light of fresh development,would change its collective mind.id.the commonwealth argues that those exceptions are met here in light of two supreme court decisions rice cayetano,d,and term limits thornton,d.neither case support the commonwealth argument.
the court in rice struck down a hawaii statute that imposed voting qualifications based on the fifteenth amendment mandate that neither the national government nor the states may deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race.see rice.at.this fifteenth amendment ruling on racial voting classifications does not impact the reasoning in igartua i that article ii governs the right to vote in presidential elections.the reliance on the court holding in term limits similarly is inapt.the court ruled that states lack the power to impose qualifications for offices of the united states congress in addition to those set forth in the constitution.see at.the court language describing the fundamental principle of our representative democracy,which appellees cite in their brief,serves to amplify the court holding that the states can not impose restrictions on federal elections,but also does not alter the article ii analysis in igartua thus,neither case stands for the proposition that the right to vote in the presidential election is derived from any source other than article ii of the constitution.
because igartua i is binding authority,the district court erred in not dismissing the action.
the judgment and order of the district court is reversed and vacated and the case is remanded with instructions that the action be dismissed with prejudice.
as i did in igartua i,i join the court opinion in this appeal because i believe it to be technically and,as the law now stands,legally correct in its conclusion that the constitution does not guarantee united states citizens residing in puerto rico the right to vote in the national presidential election.i also agree with the court indication that today decision expresses no opinion with regard to the validity under puerto rico law of law of september,which is the subject of separate litigation and which i conclude is not properly before us.i am,however,compelled to write separately because i can no longer remain silent to the subjacent question,because from my perspective,there are larger issues at stake.
more than years ago,at the conclusion of the war of,puerto rico was ceded to the united states by spain despite lofty rhetoric at the time extolling the virtues of american democracy,it should be noted that,at the time of general miles arrival,and since the enactment of the spanish constitution of,puerto ricans enjoyed spanish citizenship and voting representation in the spanish parliament,rights which were confirmed in the constitution of and in the autonomic charter of.jos√© tr√≠as monge,historia constitucional de puerto rico the united states has since exercised almost unfettered power over puerto rico and the nearly united states citizens who currently reside there although persons born in puerto rico are citizens of the united states at birth and thereby owe allegiance to the united states,kawakita united states,while residing in puerto rico they enjoy fewer rights than citizens of the united states that reside in the fifty states,see united states,d and cases cited therein,or even in foreign countries,see reid covert,d.undoubtedly the most glaring evidence of this egregious disparity is the fact that they do not elect a single voting representative to a federal government that exercises almost absolute power over them.
this anomalous situation arises primarily as a result of the decisions of the supreme court in the insular cases which established as early as the plenary power of congress over puerto rico under the territorial clause of the constitution in a series of narrowly divided decisions,the court held that puerto rico was an unincorporated territory,see insular cases,supra note,and as a result part of the united states for some purposes and not for others as such,congress was held to have plenary power over the internal and external affairs of the island,subject not even to the bill of rights except insofar as those guarantees might be explicitly extended to the island by congress.see downes,at.
between and,persons residing in puerto rico were considered to be citizens of puerto rico and nationals of the united states this condition was changed in,however,when congress granted united states citizenship en masse to the residents of puerto rico notwithstanding this apparent upgrading of the personal status of puerto rico residents,the supreme court in in balzac porto rico,established the inferior nature of the united states citizenship held by residents of puerto rico by concluding that the constitution protection of these new citizens was limited to those rights deemed by the court to be fundamental.yick wo hopkins.voting is a fundamental political right,because it is preservative of all rights see also reynolds sims,d.
since balzac the civil rights of united states citizens residing in puerto rico,particularly their national political rights,have remained dormant at best,subject to the vagaries of congress,and the conspicuous inattention of the judiciary.the granting of commonwealth status in itself an enigmatic condition which merely allowed the residents of puerto rico limited,did nothing to correct puerto rico fundamental condition of national unempowerment,embodied most notably in the lack of voting representation in the congress and the ineligibility to vote for president and.the united states citizens residing in puerto rico to this day continue to have no real say in the choice of those who,from afar,really govern them,nor as to the enactment,application,and administration of the myriad of federal laws and regulations that control almost every aspect of their daily affairs.
on numerous occasions since congress has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the continuing inequality to which united states citizens in puerto rico are subjected,and a perusal of the congressional record demonstrates the jealousy with which congress has guarded its plenary power over the island the courts have supported this view.see harris rosario,d califano torres,d.
this is not a totally unpredicted scenario.as far back as,in the first of the insular cases,de lima bidwell,at,the court expressed its concern with the possibility that congress might hold puerto rico in limbo indefinitely 
the theory that a country remains foreign with respect to the tariff laws until congress has acted by embracing it within the customs union,presupposes that territory may be held indefinitely by the united states that it may be treated in every particular,except for tariff purposes,as domestic territory that laws may be enacted and enforced by officers of the united states sent there for that purpose that insurrections may be suppressed,wars carried on,revenues collected,taxes imposed in short,that everything may be done which a government can do within its own boundaries,and yet that the territory may still remain a foreign country.that this state of things may continue for years,for a century even,but that until congress enacts otherwise,it still remains a foreign country.to hold that this can be done as matter of law we deem to be pure judicial legislation.we find no warrant for it in the constitution or in the powers conferred upon this court emphasis provided.

the present conundrum can not be justified or perpetuated further under the subterfuge of labeling it a political question.undoubtedly,this situation is political in the sense that it involves the political rights of a substantial number of united states citizens.it is also political because it is one that should,in the normal course of things,be resolved by the political process and the political branches of government.but in the final analysis,this problem is no more political than that presented to and resolved by the supreme court in brown board of education,one that required corrective judicial action even in the face of longstanding legal precedent in brown,the court recognized that,as the ultimate interpreter and protector of the constitution,it must at times fill the vacuum created by the failure or refusal of the political branches to protect the civil rights of a distinct and politically powerless group of united states citizens.see also united states carolene prods.famously suggesting that prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition,which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities,and may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.
the united states citizens residing in puerto rico are caught in an untenable.the national disenfranchisement of these citizens ensures that they will never be able,through the political processes,to rectify the denial of their civil rights in those very political processes.this uninterrupted condition clearly provides solid basis for judicial intervention at some point,one for which there is resounding precedent.see brown board of education,supra.
in this year of the united states constitution,and year of united states presence in puerto rico,united states citizenship must mean more than merely the freedom to travel to and from the united states.see balzac,at.this citizenship should not,can not,be devalued to such a low scale.
after more than a century of united states possession of puerto rico,there continues to be tremendous debate over the status of the island and the nature of its relationship with the united states.certainly the citizens of puerto rico are divided on the issue,a condition which has permitted the federal government to externalize this question.what is established,for the time being at least,is that the federal courts continue to recognize the almost absolute power of congress to unilaterally dictate the affairs of puerto rico and her people.so long as that is the case,the practicality of the matter is that puerto rico remains a colony with little prospect of exerting effective political pressure on the elected branches of government to take corrective action.
the contemporary society of united states citizens residing in puerto rico hardly deserves colonial treatment by the united states,assuming that such treatment is ever justified.puerto rico is home to a vibrant intellectual and cultural community which includes many institutions of higher education and other indicia of modern society,as well as a solid economic foundation which is wholly integrated into the national framework.most importantly,its citizens have contributed in full measure,and at times beyond,to the defense of our country 
the perpetuation of this colonial condition runs against the very principles upon which this nation was founded.indefinite colonial rule by the united states is not something that was contemplated by the founding fathers nor authorized per secula seculorum by the constitution.see downes,at.harlan,dissenting the idea that this country may acquire territories anywhere upon the earth,by conquest or treaty,and hold them as mere colonies or people inhabiting them to enjoy only those rights as congress chooses to accord to wholly inconsistent with the spirit and genius,as well as with the words,of the constitution.and far from being a matter of local concern to the united states citizens in puerto rico only,the inequality to which these citizens are subjected is an injury to every american,because as surely as the current situation causes irreparable harm to united states citizens residing in puerto rico,it just as powerfully denigrates the entire nation and the constitution.
although this is not the case,nor perhaps the time,for a federal court to take remedial action to correct what is a patently intolerable situation,it is time to serve notice upon the political branches of government that it is incumbent upon them,in the first instance,to take appropriate steps to correct what amounts to an outrageous disregard for the rights of a substantial segment of its citizenry.a failure to do so countenances corrective judicial action.see brown board of education,supra.it may be that the federal courts will be required to take extraordinary measures as necessary to protect discrete groups completely under the sovereignty and dominion of the united states.cherokee nation georgia,pet.marshall.
my concurrence in today decision,of course,indicates that i do not consider this the appropriate case for such intervention,largely because the particular issue of the presidential vote is governed by explicit language in the constitution providing for the election of the president and by the states,rather than by individual citizens.but i,for one,am of the view that my vote today is not equivalent to a carte blanche.
the commonwealth argues that stare decisis is not an inexorable command,particularly in constitutional cases.but igartua i is based on supreme court opinions which that court has not reconsidered and we are not free to do so.and e ven in constitutional cases,stare decisis carries such persuasive force that even the supreme court has always required a departure from precedent to be supported by some special justification.dickerson united states,d.
