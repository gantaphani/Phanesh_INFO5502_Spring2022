in previously deciding the merits of this case brought under the employees retirement income security act of erisa,we agreed with plaintiff diahann gross that our circuit should no longer apply the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review to certain benefits decisions.see gross sun life assurance of,cir.we also found the administrative record inadequate to permit our de novo judgment on gross entitlement to benefits.accordingly,we remanded the matter for further proceedings.gross now seeks an award of attorney fees under g on the ground that she achieved some degree of success on the merits.see hardt reliance standard life ins,d quoting ruckelshaus sierra club,d.appellee sun life assurance company of canada contends that gross is not entitled to attorney fees and that,in any event,her request is premature.
we conclude that our prior decision afforded gross a degree of success on the merits that qualifies her for an award of fees.further,we find that such an award is both appropriate and properly ordered at this time.hence,we remit gross fee request to the district court for a determination in the first instance of the proper amount of the award.
factual background 
we summarize the facts underlying gross disability claim only briefly here,as they are presented in detail in our earlier opinion.gross was placed on disability leave at the age of based on her complaints of severe pain,weakness,and numbness in her arms and legs,as well as recurring headaches.her treating physician attributed the symptoms to various medical conditions,including fibromyalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy,and concluded that gross was unable to work.in denying disability benefits to gross,sun life relied heavily on video surveillance that showed gross engaged in activities that appeared inconsistent with her physical limitations.
in her appeal to this court,gross raised two substantial threshold questions concerning her claim for disability benefits.we rejected one applicability of the safe harbor exception to erisa coverage but agreed with gross assertion that policy language requiring proof of disability satisfactory to us is inadequate to confer the discretionary authority that would trigger deferential review of the insurer benefits decision.at.the latter holding departed from our holding a decade earlier in brigham sun life of canada,cir and thus changed the law in this circuit governing policies with the satisfactory to us language.as directly applied to gross case,the decision withdrew from sun life the right to make a judgment about her eligibility for benefits that is subject to review only for abuse of discretion.
we also concluded that the administrative record was inadequate to allow a full and fair assessment of gross entitlement to disability benefits,and therefore remanded the case to allow further development of the evidence.at.in so ruling,we faulted sun life for failing to provide its independent medical consultant with important background about gross circumstances on a critical surveillance day and for disregarding the consultant observation that it might be beneficial to reexamine gross in light of the seeming inconsistences between his prior evaluation and the surveillance.id.at see also id.at sun life handling of the inconsistencies between the medical reports and the video surveillance raises a legitimate question about whether sun life has made a bona fide effort to determine gross capabilities.
at the same time,however,we recognized that gross,despite her burden to prove disability,had not submitted a statement from her own doctor explaining why she was shown in the surveillance video performing activities that appeared beyond her capabilities.we therefore ordered a remand so that the parties can further address both the significance of the video evidence in assessing gross limitations and the veracity of her and observed symptoms.id.at.
gross subsequently filed the motion that is now before us seeking an award of attorney fees and costs for the litigation in the district court and on appeal as noted,sun life contends that gross is not yet eligible for a fee award.
eligibility for fee award 
legal background 
under erisa,a court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party in a benefits proceeding.g.in hardt,the supreme court clarified that eligibility for an award under section g does not require that the be a prevailing party,but only that the claimant show some degree of success on the merits.gastronomical workers union local metro.hotel ass pension fund dorado beach hotel,cir quoting hardt,at the favorable result must be more than a trivial success or a purely procedural victory,but it is enough if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation some success on the merits without conducting a lengthy inquiry into the question whether a particular party success was substantial or occurred on a central issue.hardt,at internal quotation marks omitted brackets omitted we have described such success as a merits outcome that produces some meaningful benefit for the.gastronomical workers union,at.
importantly,the supreme court declined in hardt to decide whether a remand order,without more,constitutes some success on the merits sufficient to make a party eligible for attorney fees under g.at.in hardt,the claimant success had three components a remand requiring a reevaluation of her claim,the district court expressed favorable view of that claim,with a warning that the court would grant judgment for the claimant if the plan administrator did not adequately consider all the evidence within days,id.internal quotation mark omitted,and an eventual award of benefits by the plan administrator.the court characterized that combination as far more than trivial success.id.we thus understand the court to be saying that circumstances less favorable than hardt also would meet the requisite level of success.
the question to which we now turn is whether the particular circumstances of the remand in this case satisfy the hardt standard.
discussion 
gross maintains that she is entitled to a fee award under hardt because she proved that sun life violated her fundamental erisa rights and she secured a change in the standard of review for policies containing the satisfactory to us language.sun life argues that a remand on its own does not constitute success on the merits,and it asserts that our ruling on the standard of review can only be considered a purely procedural victory that also does not justify a fee award.
most courts considering the question left unanswered in hardt have held that a remand to the plan administrator for review of a claimant entitlement to benefits,even without guidance favoring an award of benefits or an actual grant of benefits,is sufficient success on the merits to establish eligibility for fees under section g.see,mckay reliance standard life ins,app x,cir barnes v.at t pension benefit plan nonbargained program,d,mccarthy commerce group,d,scott pnc bank affiliates long term disability plan,no.wdq,wl,at.june,olds ret.plan of int l paper,ws n,wl,at.june,citing cases petrone long term disability income plan for choices eligible emps.of johnson johnson affiliated,dpw,wl,at,finding no need to decide whether remand simpliciter is enough,but noting that the prevailing lower court wisdom appears to be that a remand of an erisa challenge may trigger a fee award in favor of the plaintiff under g but see,adair el pueblo boys girls ranch.long term disability plan,cv wyd klm,wl,at,stating that plaintiff may renew her request for attorney fees if she achieves success on remand mccollum life ins.of,wl,at,holding that plaintiff has not yet achieved any degree of success on the merits where case was remanded for full and fair review of plaintiff claim for disability benefits vivas hartford life and accident ins,civ,wl,at.june,concluding that remand to the plan administrator is a purely procedural victory that does not rise to hardt standard requiring a finding of some success on the merits 
among other factors,the courts concluding that remand simpliciter is enough have emphasized that a remand for further administrative proceedings commonly results from a substantive review of the evidence,the court considers the merits of the case and reaches it s conclusion on that basis.scott,wl,at emphasis added.hence,these courts treat such a remand as sufficient success under hardt based on the two positive outcomes inherent in such an order a finding that the administrative assessment of the claim was in some way deficient,and the plaintiff renewed opportunity to obtain benefits or compensation.see,mckay,app x at barnes,d at spradley owens.hourly emps.welfare benefit plan,no.civ raw,wl,at,olds,wl,at bowers hartford life accident ins,cv,wl,at.
as explained below,it is unnecessary for us to adopt a position on whether remand alone is enough to trigger fees eligibility.nonetheless,we find the majority position persuasive.a remand to the claims administrator for reconsideration of benefits entitlement ordinarily will reflect the court judgment that the plaintiff claim is sufficiently meritorious that it must be reevaluated fairly and fully.see stating that participants in erisa benefit plans are entitled to a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.here,for example,we observed that gross had submitted sufficient medical evidence that,if credited,is adequate to prove her entitlement to disability benefits.at.in complying with our remand instructions,the district court has now ordered sun life to render a new decision that includes reconsideration of videotape evidence that was not fairly examined during the original administrative process.see case cv rwz,dkt,the substance of the claim was thus a central concern in the appeal,and it will be the focus of the proceedings on remand.
to the extent sun life argues that an award of some amount of benefits is a necessary component of the success required by hardt,we are unpersuaded.the supreme court easily could have identified hardt eventual benefits award as a condition of her entitlement to attorney fees,but it did not do so.hence,in our view,the court reservation of judgment about a remand order,without more can not mean that the more,in every case,must include the eventual receipt of benefits in some amount.indeed,a remand for a second look at the merits of her benefits application is often the best outcome that a claimant can reasonably hope to achieve from the courts.to classify such success as a minimal or purely procedural victory mistakes its importance.
our dissenting colleague acknowledges that there may be a limited set of cases in which an erisa claimant will be entitled to fees absent a benefits award those where a court has explicitly found a violation of erisa substantive or procedural components but he asserts that supreme court precedent does not allow a more inclusive reach for section g.there is no such prohibition in hardt or any other supreme court case.to the contrary,the court purposefully left open the scope of some success on the merits,allowing the lower courts to give content to that requirement.our colleague conclusion that a remand without an award of benefits can suffice only if it remedies a violation of an explicit erisa right elevates the outcome of certain cases to a rule that circumscribes unwisely the development of some success on the merits contemplated by the supreme court.
under hardt,the question in each case is whether the claimant has achieved something more than trivial or procedural success.when an erisa beneficiary has earned a second look at her claim based on a deficient first review,her success can be equally consequential whether or not the identified flaw is explicitly linked by the remanding court to a statute or regulation.the court labeling of the claims administrator conduct may be one appropriate factor to consider it should not be the only one.
in this case,however,we need not finally resolve the adequacy of a remand,without more,or the characteristics of a qualifying remand.as the second circuit has observed,hardt appears to have left room for many factual scenarios to satisfy the standard of some success on the merits.scarangella grp.health,cir.like the plaintiff in hardt,gross obtained more than merely a second chance for a full and fair review of her claim by the plan administrator.
although we did not nudge sun life toward a decision in gross favor indeed,we expressly refrained from expressing any view on the ultimate merits of her claim we made a substantive ruling on the standard of review that altered the dynamic between sun life and gross in the subsequent proceedings.contrary to sun life and our dissenting colleague insistence,that legal decision had more than procedural impact.it increased the likelihood of a favorable benefits determination perhaps from sun life,and certainly from a reviewing court in the event gross claim is again denied by the claims administrator because sun life judgment will no longer be insulated from full judicial review.in effect,the change in the standard of review has strengthened gross claim the very existence of rights under such plans depends on the degree of discretion lodged in the administrator.the broader that discretion,the less solid an entitlement the employee has herzberger standard ins,cir.at a minimum,this outcome constitutes some meaningful benefit for the,gastronomical workers union,at,and,hence,satisfies the hardt standard of some degree of success on the merits,hardt,at internal quotation marks omitted.
our colleague attempts to diminish the substantive import of gross success with a hypothetical that he says makes it transparently clear that the plaintiff had not achieved anything resembling success on the merits.he contends that gross plainly would have earned no more than a purely procedural victory if we had applied the de novo standard of review ourselves,instead of remanding,and concluded that she is not entitled to benefits.
that contention is simply wrong.the fact that a claimant success and the denial of benefits might be combined in a single decision does not change the quantum of success achieved and,hence,provides no reason to alter our approach.the question remains the same what outcome,short of a receipt of benefits,constitutes the requisite success under hardt contrary to our colleague implication,there is nothing incongruous about rewarding only the successful portion of a mixed decision.we do it all the time in the context of attorney fees.see,joyce town of dennis,cir noting the well established principle that a fees award should reflect the plaintiff level of success.thus,even if we had reviewed the record ourselves and concluded that gross is not entitled to disability benefits,we still would have found her eligible for a fee award based on the success she did achieve.
at the heart of our colleague hypothetical is a suggestion that any decision that does not award benefits is merely procedural.to the same effect is his imagery,which concludes with the observation that s urviving to fight another day is not the same as winning the war.yet,he also appears to recognize that such a narrow conception of some success on the merits is incompatible with hardt,where as we have noted the court could have,but did not,condition fees on an award of benefits.he thus grudgingly acknowledges that certain battle victories may justify an award of fees.
here,as we have explained,gross secured a ruling on the standard of review that improved her likelihood of success on the merits of her claim and will impact all similar future claims.it thus provided to borrow our colleague formulation for the requisite success some concrete gain for the claimant.as such,it is readily distinguishable from interim,procedural victories such as a favorable ruling on a discovery dispute or a motion to intervene,barnes,d at noting that winning a motion for class certification or a motion to intervene would constitute a purely procedural victory olds,wl,at giving as examples of procedural victories favorable rulings on discovery disputes or motions in limine and orders disqualifying opposing counsel.
our colleague discrediting of the significance of the panel ruling causes him to focus on our observations about the significance of a remand simpliciter.in so doing,he critiques a decision we did not make.although we have favorably reviewed the rationales for awarding fees based solely on a claimant success in obtaining a remand,our decision in this case does not rest on such rationales.here,we have held that there is more.hence,our colleague necessarily rejects our outcome not because he disagrees with our thinking on whether a remand alone may justify a fee award,but because he rejects our conclusion that the panel holding was a significant,substantive success for gross.yet,he offers little explanation for dismissing that holding as purely procedural.in effect,he concludes that her victory was procedural simply because it was not accompanied by an award of benefits.
in crediting gross with success on the merits,we do not mean to portray as entirely irrelevant the eventual outcome of her claim for benefits.that outcome will be a factor in any request for fees,and it may be considered by the district court in considering a reasonable fee for the legal work.while gross failure to achieve an award of benefits,either in this court or on remand,may speak to the quantum of her success on the merits of her claim,it would not convert her substantial success on that claim into failure or trivial success.olds,wl,at.
we thus hold that gross is eligible for an award of fees under hardt.
in its supplemental brief opposing gross motion for fees,sun life appears to argue that the fee request is premature because gross benefits claim is not yet fully decided time will tell whether gross is entitled to receive benefits.if,in the future,a court concludes that she is totally disabled,there is no question that the issue of eligibility for attorney fees will be ripe.our discussion above demonstrates that sun life ripeness argument,relying in large part on the fact that no disability benefits have yet been awarded,is off the mark.as we have explained,the remand for reconsideration of her entitlement to benefits,in combination with a less deferential standard of review,means that gross already has achieved the success that makes her eligible for fees.our judgment in this appeal is now final and the outcome of the supplemental proceedings ordered by our remand will not change gross eligibility for fees for the phase of the case that concluded with that judgment.we therefore consider the fees issue fit for adjudication.gastronomical workers union,at see also id.fitness involves questions about whether the necessary factual predicate is sufficiently matured to allow a court to resolve the issue presented.
in evaluating ripeness,we ordinarily also look to whether a refusal to adjudicate th e issue will work a hardship on the party who seeks a remedy.gastronomical workers union,at.sun life argues that gross has not met this prong of the ripeness test because she has not argued that she will suffer hardship from a delay in consideration of her fees request.the fee issue itself,however,bespeaks a need for prompt resolution.statutes are designed to encourage the bringing of meritorious claims which might otherwise be abandoned because of the financial imperatives surrounding the hiring of competent counsel.kerr quinn,cir,quoted in riverside rivera,d referring to attorney fees in civil rights cases under.erisa fee provisions,in particular,are intended to encourage beneficiaries to enforce their statutory rights,donachie liberty life ass.of boston,cir internal quotation mark omitted,and to encourage attorneys to take on such cases,which are often time consuming and complex,hanley kodak ret.income plan,d.this case,for example,was removed to federal court in october after initial proceedings in state court,and gross benefits claim is still unresolved.
without some prospect of compensating their attorneys along the way,erisa litigants may face difficulty both securing counsel initially and retaining counsel as proceedings move forward.see,griffin jim jamison,cir noting in an erisa case that three lawyers had declined to represent the plaintiff before he approached his present counsel.we see no justification for a delay that might add to that risk.
in reaching this conclusion,we recognize that addressing gross attorney fee motion at this juncture could result in piecemeal fees litigation if gross is successful before the claims administrator on remand,see,rote titan tire,cir per curiam concluding that erisa authorizes the award of fees incurred during an administrative remand when district court retains jurisdiction peterson continental cas,cir same,or if she is again denied benefits but succeeds in litigation challenging that adverse ruling.although the balkanization of the fees issue may not be ideal in terms of court efficiency,the facts pertinent to fees motions covering separate phases of the case will not substantially overlap.hence,without minimizing the burden on the district court,we decline to prioritize marginal efficiency over the possibility of better access to skilled counsel for erisa claimants.
we therefore conclude that gross motion for attorney fees is ripe for adjudication.
having concluded that gross is eligible for an award of attorney fees under section g,we consider whether an award is appropriate here.although the supreme court in hardt emphasized that the tests traditionally used by courts to decide whether to award fees do not bear on the eligibility for fees under section g,it allowed such inquiries as a second step to determine whether a claimant found eligible should be awarded fees.see at.we continue to find useful the five factors delineated in our precedent,see cottrill sparrow,johnson ursillo,cir gray new eng,cir,and,hence,we review their applicability here.accord temme bemis,wl,at cir,per curiam noting that test may be used to analyze whether fees should be awarded in an erisa case scarangella,at,noting that district court could consider factors in exercising its discretion on whether to award fees williams metro.life ins,cir approving use of analysis simonia glendale disability plan,cir requiring use of analysis mckay,app x at same.
the five factors that should be considered by courts reviewing fee requests under erisa are 
the degree of culpability or bad faith attributable to the losing party the depth of the losing party pocket,his or her capacity to pay an award the extent if at all to which such an award would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances the benefit if any that the successful suit confers on plan participants or beneficiaries generally and the relative merit of the parties positions.
cottrill,at.the list is exemplary rather than exclusive,and indeed,not every factor in the list must be considered in every case,janeiro urological surgery prof l ass n,cir.no single factor is decisive.id.
culpability or bad faith 
although we did not conclude in our earlier decision that sun life exhibited bad faith in its handling of this case,we did describe its behavior as sufficiently culpable to count this factor in gross favor.see janeiro,at stating that it is unnecessary to find that defendants acted with an especially high degree of culpability.as noted above,we observed in our merits decision that sun life may not have made a bona fide effort to determine gross capabilities.gross,at.
more specifically,we observed that the reason gross made an unusually long drive on one of the days she was videotaped her mother medical emergency was essential knowledge for a reliable appraisal of her medical condition.id.yet,sun life apparently failed to provide this important context to its independent medical consultant and at least one internal reviewer.see id.at noting that the doctor who performed the final medical assessment of gross claim commented in his report that i t is unclear who the claimant was seeing at the medical building in ashland or why she would need to travel so far to be seen.alterations in original further,sun life disregarded the independent consultant suggestion that a reevaluation could shed light on the seeming inconsistencies between th
