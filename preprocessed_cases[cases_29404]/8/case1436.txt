this case involves two parties,both asserting legitimate claims to the same indivisible piece of property.in,sharyl davis purchased the camille pissarro monotype le marché for its fair market value,unaware that it had recently been stolen from a french museum.more than twenty years later,le marché true provenance came to light,and the united states government brought this forfeiture action with the intent of returning the monotype to france.unlike in the judgment of solomon,see kings,neither party has blinked,and we are therefore in the unenviable position of determining who gets the artwork,and who will be left with nothing despite a plausible claim of being unfairly required to bear the loss.in making that determination,we take comfort in our obligation to follow the rules that congress has given,and recognize that justice is done by providing the predictable result that congress intended.doing so here requires that we affirm both the district court sullivan,final judgment of forfeiture entered on january,and its order of may,denying davis motion for attorney fees.
background 
factual background 
two works of art were stolen from the musée faure in aix les bains,france on november.one of them,the pissarro monotype le marché,made its way to san antonio,texas,where emil guelton consigned it to adelman antiques and art gallery.on may,the gallery proprietor,jay adelman,sold the monotype for to the sharan corporation,a entity once partially controlled by davis.
following the sharan corporation dissolution,davis took ownership of le marché,which she displayed in her home for more than ten years before consigning it to sotheby for sale at an upcoming auction.the french national police became aware of le marché impending sale and informed united states law enforcement officials that the pissarro monotype soon to be auctioned off by sotheby had been stolen from the musée faure years earlier.the united states department of homeland security requested that sotheby withdraw le marché from the auction,and sotheby complied.
around the same time,the french authorities reopened their investigation into the theft in hopes of uncovering sufficient evidence to secure le marché return.as part of those efforts,investigators interviewed guelton,who admitted selling artwork to adelman while visiting texas in the.investigators also included guelton picture in a photo array that they showed to jacqueline rivollet,the museum guard on duty the day of the theft.rivollet positively identified guelton as the thief.armed with this evidence,the united states government filed a verified complaint in the southern district of new york on november,seeking civil forfeiture of the monotype.
ii.district court proceedings 
the government complaint alleged three separate claims for forfeiture.first,the government customs claim sought forfeiture under,a customs statute enacted as part of the tariff act of.section authorizes the forfeiture of m erchandise which is introduced into the united states contrary to law if the merchandise is stolen,smuggled,or clandestinely imported or introduced.c a.to satisfy the statute contrary to law requirement,the government alleged a violation of the national stolen property act nspa,which criminalizes,among other things,the possession or sale of stolen goods valued at or more that have moved in interstate or international commerce,with knowledge that the goods were stolen.see.to satisfy the is stolen,smuggled,or clandestinely imported or introduced requirement,the government alleged that guelton took le marché from the musée faure.
the government based its second and third forfeiture claims on,under which property constituting or derived from proceeds traceable to a violation of any offense constituting specified unlawful activity is forfeitable to the united states.a c.because nspa violations are specified unlawful activity,see c a,the government asserted the same factual predicate to support its forfeiture claims under section as it did to support its customs claim,namely that le marché constituted the proceeds of guelton theft.
following discovery,the government moved for summary judgment on its customs claim.davis responded by filing a for summary judgment on all three of the government forfeiture claims in which she asserted that her status as an innocent owner of le marché entitled her to continued possession of the monotype.in support of that proposition,davis directed the district court to d,which provides that a n innocent owner interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute.
at a hearing on june,the district court ruled on several issues relevant to the government customs claim.first,it found that forfeiture actions brought pursuant to are not subject to an defense.second,it concluded that the approach found in applied,and therefore the initial burden rested on the government to demonstrate probable cause to believe that le marché was subject to forfeiture.third,the district court found based on rivollet eyewitness identification of guelton and the undisputed fact that guelton had sold the monotype to adelman while in texas that the government had made a showing of probable cause for forfeiture.the burden therefore shifted to davis to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the monotype was not stolen merchandise introduced into the united states contrary to law.see c.
as for the government forfeiture claims under,the district court found that davis had established that she was an innocent owner of the monotype within the meaning of d a,and was therefore entitled to summary judgment on those claims.the government has not appealed that ruling.
in january,the district court held a jury trial to resolve the two remaining disputed issues of material fact whether davis could demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that le marché was not transported in interstate or foreign commerce with knowledge that the property was stolen.at trial,davis called rivollet to the stand.she testified to being a mere meter and a half from guelton on the day of the theft and to looking him in the eyes as he entered the museum.on cross examination,rivollet explained that she later heard guelton running down the stairs,and then saw him emerge from the stairwell with something under his parka.after calling the police,rivollet inventoried the museum collection and discovered that le marché had been removed from its spot on the wall.additional evidence demonstrated that guelton later transported le marché into the united states and consigned it to adelman.
jury deliberations began the morning of january.later that day,the jury returned a unanimous verdict for the government.specifically,the jury found that davis had failed to prove that le marché was not the work of art stolen from the faure museum on november,that le marché was not transported,transmitted or transferred in interstate or foreign commerce by guelton,or that guelton did not receive,possess,conceal,store,barter,sell,or dispose of le marché,knowing it was stolen,after le marché crossed a united states or state border.on january,the district court entered a final judgment of forfeiture,and on may,it denied davis motion for attorney fees.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,davis brings a host of challenges to the proceedings below.we begin by addressing davis argument that the government failed to demonstrate probable cause to believe that le marché was subject to forfeiture under.next,we turn to davis argument that she was entitled to additional substantive and procedural protections that the district court found inapplicable to forfeiture actions brought pursuant to.we then resolve davis constitutional challenges,before finally addressing the issue of attorney fees.
and the national stolen property act 
section authorizes the forfeiture of merchandise introduced into the united states contrary to law,if that property is stolen,smuggled,or clandestinely imported or introduced.c a.to satisfy the statute contrary to law requirement,the government alleged that guelton violated the nspa by stealing le marché from the musée faure,transporting it into the united states,and then consigning it to adelman.see.davis submits that the district court committed three errors in its application of the nspa to this case.first,davis argues that contrary to law refers only to violations of the customs laws,not to violations of the nspa.davis also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government on whether le marché value met the nspa statutory minimum of.finally,davis argues that le marché is no longer stolen property within the meaning of section c,and is therefore not subject to forfeiture.we address those arguments in turn.
a.the meaning of contrary to law 
property is subject to forfeiture under c only if it is introduced into the united states contrary to law.davis argues that nspa violations can not serve as a predicate offense to effect seizure under c contrary to law requirement without a customs violation.in effect,she urges us to read the phrase contrary to law as contrary to customs law.
it is axiomatic that the plain meaning of a statute controls its interpretation.lee bankers trust,cir.the phrase contrary to law means illegal unlawful conflicting with established law.see black law dictionary ed.nothing in the text of section limits that broad definition,and nowhere does the statute narrowly define the word law.
the government argues,with some force,for a literal interpretation of the statute.if congress had intended to limit the scope of section to violations of the customs laws,it could have said so.since it did not,section c would appear to require only that the property in question be introduced into the united states illegally,unlawfully,or in a manner conflicting with established law.
the rest of the statute provides additional support for this interpretation.for example,section c c permits the forfeiture of merchandise or packaging in which copyright violations are involved,see,while section c d permits the forfeiture of trade dress merchandise involved in the violation of a court order pursuant to.that section incorporates by reference federal laws that do not directly pertain to customs enforcement counsels against a reading of contrary to law that might preclude its application to those very statutes.accordingly,there is a strong argument that the phrase contrary to law in section c means exactly what it says the government may seize and forfeit merchandise that is introduced into the united states illegally,unlawfully,or in a manner conflicting with established law,regardless of whether the law violated relates to customs enforcement.
on the other hand,a statute context is critical to its interpretation and section reference to the importation of goods is relevant to discerning what congress intended by the phrase contrary to law.c.in light of this context,it can be argued that some nexus between international commerce the subject of the customs regulations found in title and the law violated is necessary to trigger section remedies.
we need not resolve that issue in this case because,even if such a nexus is required,the nspa provides one.it requires the transport ation,transmi ssion,or transfer in interstate or foreign commerce of stolen property or the dealing in stolen property that has crossed a state or united states boundary.whatever the merit of the government argument that the violation of any law suffices to meet section requirement that an object introduction be contrary to law,violation of the nspa certainly does suffice,and as that is the only law the government has alleged as a basis for its invocation of section,that is the only question we need answer here.
b.the value of le marché 
davis submits that,even if nspa violations satisfy the contrary to law requirement of section,the district court improperly granted summary judgment for the government on whether le marché value at the time it entered the united states met the threshold necessary for an nspa violation.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court to determine whether a genuine issue of a material fact exists that would preclude judgment as a matter of law.gallo prudential residential,cir.here,davis evidence failed to raise a material issue of fact regarding le marché value,and so the district court properly granted summary judgment to the government.
at summary judgment,the undisputed evidence before the district court indicated that le marché was stolen on november,and that adelman sold it to the sharan corporation for on may.that soon after its importation le marché sold for a price seventy percent above the statutory minimum is strong evidence that it was valued at or above at the time guelton brought it into the united states.therefore,in order to avoid summary judgment on this issue,davis needed to come forward with some evidence tending to show that le marché was worth less than at the time of importation.see anderson liberty lobby,genuine issues of material fact exist if a reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.this she failed to do.
davis local rule statement cites five pieces of evidence that she argues raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding le marché value.the first is a declaration by expert appraiser alex rosenberg evidently directed to whether davis is an innocent owner stating that was not an unreasonably low price for the monotype,and that a sale price within that range should not trigger a suspicion that the work of art was stolen.this statement is hardly evidence that le marché was worth less than the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from it is that the price sharan corporation paid for the monotype in approximated its fair market value,or,if anything,was too low albeit not unreasonably low.the second is a declaration from art expert gilbert edelson explaining that several hundreds of thousands of prints are sold annually in the united states.although a very small number of important,rarer prints by artists such as rembrandt will sell for substantial prices,the overwhelming number of prints sell for less than.however,edelson declaration is wholly silent on the value of le marché,and does not indicate whether or not it falls into the category of rarer prints that command a premium price.it therefore does nothing to undermine the government evidence that le marché was worth more than during the relevant period.similarly,not one of the depositions that davis cites from the curator of the musée faure,from a federal agent who investigated this case,and from adelman sheds any light on le marché value.
a jury presented with both the uncontradicted evidence that le marché was worth in and the equivocal and irrelevant statements cited by davis could not reasonably conclude that the monotype was worth less than when it entered the united states.we therefore affirm the district court finding that the government was entitled to summary judgment on that element of its forfeiture claim.
c.the meaning of is stolen 
property shall be seized and forfeited pursuant to c a if it is stolen,smuggled,or clandestinely imported or introduced into the united states.davis submits that the word is requires us to assess whether le marché constituted stolen property at the time of forfeiture,rather than at the time it entered the united states that argument,which calls for an interpretation of the statute that conflicts with the most natural reading of the text,is without merit.
the text of the statute makes clear that is stolen refers to the status of the property at the time of its introduction into the united states.the relevant portion of section c states 
merchandise which is introduced or attempted to be introduced into the united states contrary to law shall be treated as follows 
the merchandise shall be seized and forfeited if it 
a is stolen,smuggled,or clandestinely imported or introduced 
d is a plastic explosive,as defined in section q of title,which does not contain a detection agent,as defined in section p of such title 
subsection c applies only to m erchandise which is introduced or attempted to be introduced into the united states,and it therefore unquestionably focuses on the manner in which the merchandise enters the united states.under the most natural reading of the text,the phrase is stolen,which modifies the same merchandise,also refers to the merchandise status at the time of introduction.that focus makes sense section is a customs statute regulating the flow of goods into and out of the country.it is therefore concerned with what types of goods enter the united states,not with what happens to them after they get here.
davis interpretation shifts the statute focus away from the border in a manner that would produce absurd results.there is no reason to believe that the word is in section c a refers to a different time period than the word is in section c d,which requires the forfeiture of merchandise that is a plastic explosive,which does not contain a detection agent.see mashantucket pequot tribe connecticut,cir noting that the same word or phrase should be construed to have the same meaning throughout a statute.however,interpreting is to refer to the time of forfeiture,rather than the time of importation,would mean that the forfeiture of plastic explosives under section c d could be thwarted if after importation a detection agent were added to the mixture.there is nothing to suggest that congress intended to create such a loophole when enacting this legislation.
accordingly,we reject davis reading of is stolen,and adopt instead the more natural reading of the text that gives full force to each word that congress employed the phrase is stolen in c refers to the status of the property at the time of its introduction into the united states.
ii.the effect of the civil asset forfeiture reform act of on 
civil in rem forfeiture proceedings are based in part on the legal fiction that i t is the property which is proceeded against,and held guilty and condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient.various items of personal property united states.as a result,civil forfeiture claimants are rarely afforded the same procedural and substantive protections applicable in criminal forfeiture proceedings.for example,in many cases the burden rests on the claimant to demonstrate that her property is not subject to forfeiture.see united states parcel of property,cir.similarly,the claimant culpability is often irrelevant a long and unbroken line of cases holds that an owner interest in property may be forfeited by reason of the use to which the property is put even though the owner did not know that it was put to such use.bennis michigan,see also united states ursery.
congress responded to concerns regarding the broad scope of the government civil forfeiture authority by passing the civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra,stat.cafra provides some claimants with,among other things,a more favorable burden of proof and an defense.see c d.davis challenges the district court finding that those protections are inapplicable to forfeiture actions brought pursuant to.we review this question of statutory interpretation de novo.l commc ns osi,cir.
innocent owner defense 
davis submits that forfeiture actions brought pursuant to section are subject to an defense.although that argument has some equitable appeal,it lacks legal merit does not provide for an defense,and cafra expressly excludes forfeiture actions brought under title from its provision.
we turn first to the text of.although numerous statutes contain an explicit innocent owner defense,united states v.an antique platter of gold,cir,section plainly does not,nor did congress provide for one incorporation by reference to other provisions of the code.instead,section commands that property which is introduced or attempted to be introduced into the united states contrary to law shall be seized and forfeited.c emphasis added.the word shall indicates that congress intended forfeiture under section c to happen as a matter of course.such definite language is not susceptible to an interpretation that a legitimate possessory interest in the property might defeat an otherwise valid forfeiture claim.
it is unsurprising that section a statute first enacted more than eighty years ago as part of the tariff act of,stat.would require forfeiture of property regardless of the owner culpability.e arly statutes used to enforce the customs laws generally contained no innocent owner defense.united states buena vista,see also united states bajakajian,historically,the owner of forfeited property could be entirely innocent of any crime.indeed,the supreme court held,in a case addressing another provision of the tariff act of,that forfeiture may be enforced even against innocent owners the penalty is at times a hard one,but it is imposed by the statute in terms too clear to be misread.general motors acceptance united states.coming so shortly after the statute adoption,the supreme court decision in that case casts particularly vivid light on the understanding of the tariff act forfeiture provisions,and thus on congress likely intent.
nothing that congress has done in the subsequent eighty years commands a different result today.see united states v.an antique platter of gold,section c does not provide for an innocent owner defense,aff,cir.in fact,subsequent amendments to section have introduced no reference to an defense.see,usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of,stat,anti drug abuse act of,stat,given congress recent attention to civil forfeiture,there is no reason to believe that the omission was anything but deliberate.platter of gold,at.
nevertheless,davis suggests that we graft onto the defense that congress enacted as part of cafra that provision applies to any civil forfeiture statute,d,which cafra initially defines to include any provision of federal law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense,id.i.however,in what has become known as the customs,i a excludes from that definition the tariff act of or any other provision of law codified in title.that language could not be more clear for purposes of cafra,the tariff act of and the statutory provisions contained in title including are not civil forfeiture statutes.because cafra provision applies only to forfeiture actions brought under any civil forfeiture statute,and because section is not a civil forfeiture statute as defined in cafra,forfeiture actions brought pursuant to are not subject to cafra provision 
undeterred,davis points to a number of statements in the congressional record that may indicate that some members of congress had hoped for a more comprehensive piece of legislation.based on those comments,davis argues that congress intended cafra innocent owner defense to apply to all federal forfeiture statutes,and urges us to carry out that intent by effectively eliminating the customs.however,as davis herself admits,cafra backers ultimately decided to exclude title from the scope of cafra reforms in order to prevent the bill from being bottled up in the unsympathetic house ways and means committee,which has jurisdiction over bills affecting customs.david smith,an insider view of the civil asset forfeiture reform act of,champion,june,at.although davis characterizes that decision as a reflection of the arbitrary division of authority between committees in the house,not a judgment that there is something special about the forfeiture statutes in title,we must apply the law that congress actually passed and that the president signed,not the one that some members of congress may have preferred.that proponents of a broader law sacrificed their objective in order to secure faster or more certain passage does not undermine,but rather confirms,the status of the final text as the law that represents the enacted wishes of the legislators.ignoring the customs would violate our obligation to follow the law rather than make it.
davis also submits that,because cafra innocent owner provision applies to claims brought under any civil forfeiture statute,d emphasis added,rather than a civil forfeiture statute,id.a a i emphasis added,it must apply to all statutes authorizing civil forfeiture regardless of how civil forfeiture statute is defined in section i.however,under that interpretation,the phrase civil forfeiture statute would mean one thing in section d,and another elsewhere in the same section.such an interpretation is disfavored.see clark martinez.moreover,when congress did intend its reform measures to stretch beyond the reach of i,it used language manifesting that intent,carefully avoiding the civil forfeiture statute phrase that it had specifically defined as a term of art with a meaning narrower than its more natural purport.for example,cafra provision applies to any civil proceeding to forfeit property under any provision of federal law.b.congress decision not to use the same broad language in providing for an defense as it did in defining the scope of cafra provision further supports our conclusion that congress limited the application of that defense to civil forfeiture statutes as that term is defined in section i.
the statutory language is unambiguous c does not contain an defense,and the customs excludes the government customs claim from the scope of d.we therefore hold that no defense applies to forfeiture claims brought pursuant to.
burden of proof 
davis argues that the district court erred in applying the approach found in,rather than the more approach laid out in c we disagree.
there can be no doubt that,prior to cafra,the provision in governed forfeiture actions brought pursuant to that result was required by,which states that t he procedures set forth in sections through of this title shall apply to seizures of any property effected by customs officers under any law enforced or administered by the customs service unless such law specifies different procedures.in this case,le marché was seized by united states immigration and customs enforcement officers acting pursuant to their authority under and,statutes which do not specify their own standard.therefore,the burden of proof set forth in applies.
that result is unaffected by cafra because its provision applies only to forfeiture actions brought under any civil forfeiture statute.d c.as explained above,section is not a civil forfeiture statute for purposes of cafra,see i,and therefore cafra provision is inapplicable to the government customs claim.we therefore find that the district court correctly applied the approach of to this case.
iii.the constitutionality of the forfeiture 
davis argues that le marché forfeiture violated both the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment and the takings clause of the fifth amendment.we address those issues in turn,accepting the district court findings of fact unless clearly erroneous and reviewing de novo the application of those facts to the constitutional standard.see bajakajian,at.
a.the excessive fines clause 
the eighth amendment provides that e xcessive bail shall not be required,nor excessive fines imposed.const.amend.viii.a fine refers to a payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense.browning ferris indus.kelco disposal.as a result,only those forfeitures that may be characterized,at least in part,as punitive will be considered a fine for purposes of the eighth amendment.von hofe united states,cir,citing austin united states.
in platter of gold,we determined that a civil forfeiture action brought pursuant to was remedial rather than punitive.see at.two factors were central to our determination.first,the forfeiture was not part of a criminal prosecution,but was rather a civil in rem proceeding.id.at.second,and e ven more important,the forfeiture proceeding was brought under a customs law,which are traditionally viewed as.id.at.as a result,the forfeiture was remedial and therefore outside the scope of the excessive fines clause.id.
those same factors apply with equal force in this case.as in platter of gold,the statutory authority to seize and forfeit le marché came from a customs statute,see,which weighs strongly in favor of characterizing the forfeiture as remedial.see platter of gold,at.furthermore,the government customs claim is unconnected to any criminal prosecution,and davis culpability is irrelevant to its resolution.austin,at,contrasting traditional forfeiture statutes,with forfeiture statutes that expressly provide an innocent owner defense and are punitive because they focus on the culpability of the owner.we therefore easily conclude that le marché forfeiture was remedial,not punitive.one lot emerald cut stones united states,noting that the forfeiture remedy provided under another provision of the tariff act of is a remedial rather than punitive remedy.as a result,davis claim under the excessive fines clause must fail.
b.the takings clause 
davis is also not entitled to compensation under the takings clause.although the fifth amendment states that no private property shall be taken for public use,without just compensation,const.amend.v,the supreme court has made clear that t he government may not be required to compensate an owner for property which it has already lawfully acquired under the exercise of governmental authority other than the power of eminent domain,bennis,at,citing united states fuller.as a result,it has long been settled that if the government acts pursuant to a forfeiture statute,it may seize personal property without compensating the owner.redford dep t of,cir.in this case,the united states acted pursuant to the forfeiture provisions of,and was therefore entitled to seize le marché without compensating davis.
iv.attorney fees under b a 
in the united states,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y.however,cafra authorizes the courts to provide fees and other costs to claimants who substantially prevail in a civil proceeding to forfeit property.b a.davis argues that the district court erred in denying her attorney fees under that provision.according to davis,her success in defeating the government two forfeiture claims brought pursuant to a makes her a prevailing party,even though the government ultimately succeeded in its forfeiture action.
this court has not yet addressed the meaning of substantially prevails in the context of b a.we have,however,suggested that our interpretation of section should be informed by the case law applicable to similar provisions.see united states khan,cir union of needletrades,indus.textile employees ins,cir.that case law makes clear that davis did not substantially prevail under any reasonable interpretation of that phrase.
the touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which congress sought to promote in the fee statute.state teachers ass garland indep.sch.in the case of section,congress sought to address the public outcry over the government pursuit of civil and criminal forfeiture,without expand ing government liability respecting legitimate seizures of property plausibly subject to forfeiture.khan,at.congress balanced those competing priorities by limiting attorney fees to litigants who substantially prevail in their attempts to retain possession of wrongfully seized property.see b a.given congress intent not to assume liability for legitimate seizures,khan,at,we conclude that claimants who fail to retain ownership over any of the disputed property can not collect attorney fees under b a,for in those cases the seizure was undoubtedly legitimate.
this conclusion is further supported by the supreme court decision in sole wyner,which held that a plaintiff who gains a preliminary injunction after an abbreviated hearing,but is denied a permanent injunction after a dispositive adjudication on the merits,is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under the similar provision in b.see.the court reasoned that a party who achieves a transient victory at the threshold of an action is not entitled to attorney fees if,at the end of the litigation,her initial success is undone and she leaves the courthouse emptyhanded.id.at.
we understand sole focus on the litigation ultimate outcome to require us first to identify the claimant purpos
