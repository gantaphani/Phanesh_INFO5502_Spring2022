central vermont public service cvps appeals from the district court order denying its.b motion.in that motion,cvps sought relief from a bankruptcy court order permanently enjoining it from pursuing civil claims against the appellees harold and edith herbert the herberts.after waiting more than four years to challenge the bankruptcy court injunction,cvps contended that the bankruptcy court order was void for lack of jurisdiction.the district court ruled that the rule b motion was untimely and rejected cvps jurisdictional argument.although the district court untimeliness ruling was in error,we agree that the bankruptcy court at least had an arguable basis for exercising its jurisdiction,and accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of cvps rule b motion.
background 
in,the herberts purchased the mortgage and security agreements encumbering pico ski resort in southern vermont.in,they foreclosed against the resort and incorporated it as pico mountain,pico mountain resort,which they owned and controlled as shareholders,officers,and directors.in july,the herberts formed two new entities sherburne pass mountain properties,llc,to which the herberts conveyed all of the resort real estate and pico mountain operating company,to which they conveyed all of the resort personal property assets.less than one month later,their original company,pico mountain,filed a chapter petition in bankruptcy,listing no significant assets and million in unsecured debts.in december,the herberts conveyed the resort real property from sherburne pass mountain properties,llc,to pico management and conveyed the personal assets of pico mountain operating company to american skiing company.it appears from the appellate record that the herberts controlled pico management,but not american skiing company.the december sales directly and indirectly yielded million in benefits to the herberts,which they did not disburse to the creditors of pico mountain,including cvps.
in january,cvps filed a proof of claim in the pico mountain.chapter proceeding for the cost of the electrical power it had supplied to the resort.pico management placed in escrow to pay the cvps electrical power bill for utilities.meanwhile,the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of pico mountain,investigated causes of action against the herberts for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty toward the debtor.this issue was resolved when the trustee entered into a settlement agreement whereby the herberts agreed to pay the lesser of or thirty percent of the allowed unsecured claims against the debtor.in an adversary proceeding,the trustee sought bankruptcy court approval of the settlement and filed a complaint in that court to enjoin all creditors,including cvps,from bringing actions against the herberts through any derivative or alter ego claim s regarding a pico mountain,debt.
on june,the trustee summons and complaint were served on cvps.cvps does not dispute that it failed to enter an appearance or defend against the trustee action on october,bankruptcy judge francis conrad approved the settlement and entered an injunction barring creditors of the bankruptcy estate from pursuing any claim,direct or derivative,against the herberts.canney music network in re pico mountain,proceeding.on december,judge conrad entered a default judgment against those defendants that had not answered the trustee complaint,including cvps,and ordered that the trustee was not required to serve those defendants with copies of the injunction.
cvps concedes that it learned of the injunction from the herberts counsel on december,less than two months after the injunction and less than two weeks after the default judgment was entered against it.nevertheless,cvps waited more than four february,challenge the injunction by filing a rule b motion.this attack on the injunction was prompted by a suit filed by the herberts in chittenden superior court.that suit seeks to reclaim the moneys that pico management had placed in escrow,on the basis that the settlement and the related injunction barred cvps claims for those moneys.in its motion papers,cvps invoked rule b provision that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding if the judgment is void,and argued that the injunction was void for lack of jurisdiction.
in an oral ruling on june,the bankruptcy court denied the motion as both untimely,citing beller keller tyler,cir,and without merit because the bankruptcy court had an arguable jurisdictional basis for its order,citing nemaizer baker,cir.on october,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of the motion on both grounds.cvps now appeals from the judgment of the district court.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
generally,we review rule b motions for abuse of discretion.lawrence wink,cir.however,a district court ruling on a rule b motion is reviewed de novo where there are no disputes over the subsidiary facts pertaining to the issue of jurisdiction.united states forma,cir.under rule b a deferential standard of review is not appropriate because if the underlying judgment is void,it is a per se abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a movant motion to vacate the judgment under rule b.jalapeno prop,llc dukas,cir batchelder,concurring citations and quotation marks omitted see also recreational properties,southwest mortgage serv,cir t he district court has no discretion in ruling on a b motion,the judgment is either void or it is not.almost every circuit has adopted de novo review of rule b motions,and we know of no circuit that defers to the district court on a rule b ruling.see vinten jeantot marine alliances,d,collecting cases see also page schweiker,cir.
timeliness 
at the outset,cvps argues that the district court erred in ruling that the motion was not timely.even though rule b states that t he motion must be made in a reasonable time,courts have been exceedingly lenient in defining the term reasonable time,with respect to voidness challenges.in fact,it has been that,for all intents and purposes,a motion to vacate a default judgment as void may be brought at any time.beller keller,at quoting james moore,et,moore federal practice c ed.we conclude that the district court erred in finding that cvps motion was untimely.
bankruptcy court jurisdiction to enter the underlying order 
cvps argues that the bankruptcy court order was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.cvps contends that the bankruptcy court issued a final order in a proceeding without the parties consent and without a district court de novo review,and that therefore it exceeded its jurisdiction under northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,d plurality opinion,and.where bankruptcy courts have exceeded their jurisdiction in proceedings,we have not hesitated to vacate the bankruptcy court judgment on direct appeal.see,orion pictures showtime networks,in re orion pictures,cir see also cathedral of the incarnation garden city in re cathedral of the incarnation,cir gallucci grant in re gallucci,cir.
however,this case comes to us,not on direct appeal,but on appeal from a denial of a rule b motion through which cvps seeks to overturn a final default judgment.because final judgments should not be lightly reopened,rule b may not be used as a substitute for timely appeal since b allows extraordinary relief,it is invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.nemaizer,at citations omitted.in the context of a rule b motion,a judgment may be declared void for want of jurisdiction only when the court plainly usurped jurisdiction,or,put somewhat differently,when there is a total want of jurisdiction and no arguable basis on which it could have rested a finding that it had jurisdiction.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
cvps claims that the bankruptcy court injunction is void under marathon because the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate state law rights.in marathon,the supreme court held that congress could not constitutionally empower a bankruptcy court,which is not an article iii court,to adjudicate a state action based on a contract brought by a debtor against a defendant that had not filed a claim with the ba
