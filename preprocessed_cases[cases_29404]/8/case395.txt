in this case we must consider the first amendment rights of a speech and language therapist working as a state contractor navigating the shoals of the standard articulated by the supreme court in garcetti ceballos,has proven to be tricky business,and particularly so in the context of a motion to dismiss,because the inquiry is so highly fact intensive and context specific.
plaintiff ellen decotiis brought suit against child development county,lori whittemore individually and in her official capacity as director of,and debra hannigan in her official capacity as state director of child development services cds collectively the defendants pursuant to.decotiis alleges that she was retaliated against in violation of her first amendment free speech rights for expressing her opinion to parents that was not in compliance with state regulations and urging parents to contact advocacy organizations to address this problem.she seeks a declaration that the of her contract was a violation of her first amendment rights,injunctive relief to reinstate her contract and to prevent future retaliation based on protected speech,and attorney fees.she also seeks compensatory and punitive damages from whittemore,and compensatory damages from.
the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.on appeal decotiis argues that the district court erred in holding that her speech was not protected by the first amendment under the principle enunciated in garcetti and in holding that whittemore is entitled to qualified immunity.we affirm the district court judgment dismissing the complaint against whittemore,because she is entitled to qualified immunity in her individual capacity and the suit against whittemore in her official capacity is redundant of the suit against.however,we conclude that the complaint sufficiently alleges a constitutional violation,particularly in light of two holdings of this court that came after the district court ruling and limned the contours of the garcetti doctrine.we therefore vacate the judgment dismissing the complaint against hannigan and,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

cds is a system of intermediate educational created under state and federal law to provide early intervention and special education services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea for children with disabilities from birth to five years old.it is supervised by the maine department of education.at the time the complaint was filed,fifteen regional sites,including,comprised the system.defendant whittemore is the director of and is alleged to be personally responsible for the retaliation against decotiis.defendant hannigan is the state director of cds.
decotiis is a speech and language therapist licensed by the state of maine who over the previous eighteen years,and at the time of the events giving rise to this action,had contracts with various regional cds sites to provide speech and language therapy and evaluations for children.
in may,chapter of the maine unified special education regulation unified rule was adopted.prior to its adoption,eligible children generally received services for the full calendar year,in accordance with their individualized family service plans ifsp or individualized education plans iep.unified rule,however,limited these services for children aged three to five years old to the school year september through june.as a result,services were not provided to children over the summer unless they were deemed eligible for extended school year services esy services.in response to this new regulation,the state cds adopted a policy offering esy services as the exception and not the rule.compl.that is,esy services were to be provided only when a child iep team decided that the services were necessary to give the child a free and appropriate public education under idea.according to the complaint,unified rule and cds new policy generated a stir the cds regional sites,service providers,and parents of children with disabilities throughout maine were confused and concerned.this concern stemmed particularly from the absence of a clear procedure outlining the objective standards that would support eligibility determinations for esy services.
in the spring of,decotiis was working under contracts with three regional cds sites,including,to provide speech and language services to children.it was around this time that whittemore,case managers at,and parents of children served by informed decotiis about approach to determinations.specifically,decotiis was told that it was unlikely that children would receive esy services unless they were considered severely disabled,and that children who received a single service for example,only speech therapy would not qualify for esy services.moreover,decotiis was told that eligibility determinations were being made without the benefit of iep meetings and that iep meetings discussing children eligibility for esy services were only held at the insistence of parents.decotiis also learned that whittemore no longer trusted her clinical judgment as a result of what whittemore perceived to be decotiis high rate of recommendations,and that whittemore would no longer accept her recommendations.in contrast to the practices of,at the other two regional cds sites for which decotiis worked,decotiis submitted quarterly reports for her caseload,including her recommendations for esy services she would then be notified of iep meetings and at these meetings,the team would review her recommendations and make decisions about esy services.
after learning about approach to esy services,decotiis approached hannigan about the discrepancy between the practices of the different regional sites.hannigan responded that she had no insight into these differences.subsequently,decotiis contacted two advocacy groups in maine,which advised her that did not appear to be in compliance with state and federal law.
shortly thereafter,decotiis informed parents of children she was treating that she was confused and concerned about the criteria was using for eligibility for esy services and that parents should contact advocacy organizations for guidance concerning their rights under idea.id.she also posted a notice in her office with the names and telephone numbers of the advocacy organizations for the benefit of parents,because she believed that had given parents the incorrect number for one of the organizations.
in a letter dated july,informed decotiis that her contract,due to expire on september,would not be renewed as of august,the date of the complaint,decotiis was still working under contract at two other regional cds sites defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.the district court granted that motion,without a hearing,on january.decotiis now appeals.

first amendment claim 
decotiis first argues on appeal that the district court erred in holding that she did not speak as a citizen.though the question is a close one,we agree that the district court erred in so holding,particularly when we consider our recent decisions interpreting garcetti.viewing the facts set forth in the complaint in the light most favorable to decotiis,we conclude that she has alleged facts that form the basis of a plausible constitutional violation for which relief may be granted.
we begin with some fundamentals.government employees undoubtedly walk a tight rope when it comes to speaking out on issues that touch upon their fields of work and expertise.it is well settled that as a general matter the first amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for speaking out,cir quoting hartman moore,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this right is not absolute,however while public employees do not forfeit all of their first amendment rights by undertaking public employment,in recognition of the government interest in running an effective workplace,the protection that public employees enjoy against reprisals is qualified.id.at.
to determine whether an adverse employment against a public employee violates her first amendment free speech rights,this court has articulated a inquiry.see,cir.first,a court must determine whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.curran cousins,cir quoting garcetti,at.second,the court must balance the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.at quoting pickering bd.of,omission in original.third,the employee must show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.id.at.if all three parts of the inquiry are resolved in favor of the plaintiff,the employer may still escape liability if it can show that it would have reached the same decision even absent the protected conduct,at citing healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle.
the court must first determine whether the speech touched upon a matter of public concern where speech relates to a matter of inherent public concern,such as official malfeasance or the neglect of duties,this inquiry is confined to the subject matter of the speech.see curran,at jordan carter,f d,cir.here,decotiis informed the parents of children receiving speech and language services from,the public agency charged with providing these services,that may have been withholding certain services to which the children were legally entitled.she also urged the parents to contact advocacy groups for guidance on the matter.the subject matter of her speech plainly relates to a matter of inherent concern,and we therefore easily conclude that decotiis speech touched upon a matter of public concern.however,whether decotiis was speaking as a citizen,and the merits of the pickering balancing test,are up for debate 
garcetti analysis 
in garcetti,the supreme court held that public employees do not speak as citizens when they make statements pursuant to their official duties,and that accordingly,such speech is not protected by the first amendment.at.in garcetti itself,there was no dispute about whether the speech in question had been made pursuant to the plaintiff employment duties,and so the court noted that it had no occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee duties in cases where there is room for serious debate.id.at.the court did,however,provide some guidance as to how such a determination should be made.in describing speech made pursuant to employment duties,the court included speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities,speech that the employer has commissioned or created,speech that the employee was paid to make,speech that the employee duties required him to make,speech that amounts to the employee work product,and speech that is an official communication,at quoting garcetti,at alteration and omission in original citations omitted.
at the time of the district court order,this court had not yet had occasion to consider the application of garcetti,and particularly the question of what it means to speak pursuant to one employment duties.we recently considered the application of garcetti in two cases,foley town of randolph,cir,and,both of which inform the analysis 
in foley,the chief of the town fire department brought a first amendment retaliation claim alleging that the town and town officials suspended him for publicly criticizing the fire department lack of funding and staffing during a press conference he gave at the scene of a fatal fire.at.in concluding that the fire chief speech took on the character of an official communication rather than that of citizen speech,we stressed the importance of context in applying the garcetti test,noting that it was not determinative that the plaintiff was not required to speak to the media.id.at emphasis in original.specifically,we found three contextual factors significant the fire chief spoke while in uniform and on duty he spoke from the scene of a fire where he had been in command as the chief of the fire department and his comments were bookended by those of another state fire marshal.id.at.the fire chief speech was moreover entirely related to matters concerning the fire department.id.the combination of these contextual factors gave the appearance that the comments had the fire department imprimatur and were not citizen speech.id.
in,we again considered the character of public employee speech.was a transitory employee of the puerto rico tourism company,a public corporation charged with regulating,investigating,overseeing,intervening and imposing sanctions on persons providing ground transportation in puerto rico.at.after she and her colleagues were told to hold your horses and cease issuing citations to certain luxury vehicles,complained to three other employees,two shift supervisors and an attorney.id.at.shortly thereafter,she applied for a permanent position but was passed over.id.at.on the heels of this rejection,she brought suit alleging retaliation.id.at.
in we emphasized the importance of the,inquiry needed to determine whether speech is made pursuant to the employee official duties.id.at.first,a court must ask,what are the employee official responsibilities,and second,was the speech at issue made pursuant to those responsibilities id.after undertaking this inquiry,we concluded that both sides had strong arguments and affirmed the district court decision in favor because the defendant had failed to adequately brief the issue.id.at.
the instant case presents what may be a not uncommon scenario a public employee who is hired to perform certain specific functions believes her employer is not complying with the law and suggests to constituents a method to exert pressure on the public agency to encourage compliance.the question presented by such a case is when does the public employee take off her employee hat and put on her citizen hat 
in identifying plaintiff official responsibilities,the proper inquiry is practical rather than formal,focusing on the duties an employee actually is expected to perform,and not merely those formally listed in the employee job description.id.at quoting garcetti,at.it appears that the bulk of decotiis official duties related to evaluating and providing services to clients and participating in meetings neither party argues that she was expected to perform duties substantially different from these formal job duties however,defendants argue that the job description presumed communication with parents.
once the employment duties have been identified,the next question is was the speech at issue made pursuant to those responsibilities id.at.decotiis alleges retaliation for speech that occurred when she informed parents of the children she was treating that she was confused and concerned about the criteria was using for eligibility for esy services and that parents should contact advocacy groups for guidance concerning their rights under the idea.compl.to determine whether such speech was made pursuant to official responsibilities,the court must take a hard look at the context of the speech.foley,at.although no one contextual factor is dispositive,we believe several factors,gleaned from the case law,are instructive whether the employee was commissioned or paid to make the speech in question,garcetti,at the subject matter of the speech,id.at citing givhan line consol.sch,whether the speech was made up the chain of command,see id.at whether the employee spoke at her place of employment,see twin peaks charter,cir whether the speech gave objective observers the impression that the employee represented the employer when she spoke lending it official significance,foley,at whether the employee speech derived from special knowledge obtained during the course of her employment,see williams dallas.sch,cir and whether there is a citizen analogue to the speech,garcetti,at.
applying these factors,we identify some common ground between the parties decotiis was not literally authorized or instructed to make the speech at issue.indeed,the facts are quite the contrary decotiis speech was not made pursuant to her job duties in the most literal sense,at.nothing in the complaint suggests that authorized or commissioned decotiis to urge parents to contact advocacy groups.her speech may have been related to the subject matter of her job,but it was not,strictly speaking,among her enumerated duties to make such speech that being said,it is not determinative that an employee was not required to make the speech at issue.foley,at.an employee job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to dictate the bounds of speech made pursuant to her employment duties.garcetti,at.by the same token,it is not dispositive that decotiis speech concerned the subject matter of her employment.see id.at.nothing in garcetti or the decisions interpreting it can fairly be read to suggest that all speech tangentially or broadly relating to the work of a public employee is per se unprotected.
beyond this,the analysis becomes more difficult,in part due to the posture of the case.our review on a motion to dismiss is confined to the face of the complaint,and while decotiis has stated facts sufficient to establish citizen speech,many other facts that would lend context to her speech are not available.for example,there is no indication where decotiis advised her clients parents.she may very well have been in her office as the district court presumed but viewing the facts in the light most favorable to decotiis,she also could have spoken to parents in the grocery store on a sunday afternoon,or from home on the telephone after hours,or at any sort of social event where people encounter one another in a small community 
it is also not apparent from the complaint whether the speech was made during plaintiff work hours,or perhaps more relevantly,during a therapy session.although the district court presumed that the speech at issue here occurred during therapy sessions evaluations conducted by the plaintiff on behalf of,decotiis,d at,we find no basis for this conclusion within the four corners of the complaint.such facts may prove true as this litigation unfolds,but based only on the facts alleged in the complaint,such a presumption is inappropriate.
furthermore,indulging all inferences in favor of decotiis,we can not conclude that her speech bore the appearance of official status or significance.the complaint states that she spoke to the parents of her clients,and it is true that speech made to an audience to which an employee only has access through her job is generally less akin to citizen speech see,foley,at noting that the fact that the fire chief was in uniform and on duty at the time of the speech was not determinative but relevant and important to the inquiry tabb district of columbia,d,if plaintiff was generally responsible for presenting the public face of the agency and if she expressly spoke in that capacity then,under garcetti these statements likely are not protected.however,the complaint does not suggest,for example,that parents were led to believe that decotiis was speaking on behalf of,or that decotiis used her position of authority and trust,as the children therapist,to lend her advice greater credence or persuasiveness.therefore,drawing all reasonable inferences in decotiis favor,as we must,we conclude that decotiis speech did not create the appearance of approval or official significance.
here,the complaint does not reveal whether decotiis speech was confined to information she had obtained through her employment,that is,whether her speech reflected special knowledge attributable to her work.see williams,at concluding that speech was not protected when the employee knowledge was derived from his position,he spoke to other employees,and the speech concerned the subject matter of his employment.the complaint states that unified rule and cds related policies had generated consternation among service providers and parents throughout the state.in light of this,it is reasonable to infer that such concern was the subject of public discussion and that decotiis knowledge was therefore publically available and not unique to her and those in her employment position 
finally,we look to whether there is a citizen analogue to decotiis speech.see garcetti,at holding that speech may be protected when it is the kind of activity engaged in by citizens who do not work for the government.plaintiff argues that her speech was analogous to the speech of other citizens she says that parents of children,advocacy groups,therapists,professional associations,and lawyers were all discussing the issues about which she spoke.viewing the facts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to decotiis,her speech appears to have been sufficiently analogous to the speech of other citizens in the community troubled by the new regulation and policy.
in short,while we can not conclusively say that plaintiff speech was made as a citizen,the scope of our review on a motion to dismiss does not demand as much it is sufficient that the complaint alleges facts that plausibly set forth citizen speech.see dep of educ.of,cir souter,a plausible but inconclusive inference from pleaded facts will survive a motion to dismiss.we conclude that decotiis has surmounted this bar,and therefore the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim was in error 
the pickering test 
defendants argue alternatively that even if decotiis was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern,her speech was nevertheless unprotected under the pickering test.the pickering test attempts to balance the value of an employee the employee own interests and the public interest in the information the employee seeks to the employer legitimate government interest in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying out its public service mission.guilloty perez pierluisi,cir quoting steeves,cir see also pickering,at the problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.
in assessing the government interest in allaying disruption and inefficiencies in the workplace,a court should include in its considerations the time,place,and manner of the employee speech,and the employer motivation in making the adverse employment decision.davignon hodgson,cir.as with the garcetti analysis,the pickering balancing test requires a hard look at the facts of the case,including the nature of the employment and the context in which the employee spoke.see id.
the district court noted that plaintiff speech was likely not protected under pickering because she addressed only those with whom she came in contact through her job,and not a wider audience.decotiis,d at.taking the district court conclusion one step further,defendants argue that has a strong interest in restricting decotiis speech to prevent her from interfering with its ability to effectively communica
