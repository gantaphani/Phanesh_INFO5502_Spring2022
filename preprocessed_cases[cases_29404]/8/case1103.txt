today we join our sister circuits in holding that,for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction,a national bank is a citizen only of the state in which its main office is located.
the facts underlying this case are straightforward.on february,robert melina melina obtained and memorialized in a note the note a loan from wall street mortgage bankers for in principal.as security for this loan,melina executed a mortgage on his property at street in brooklyn,new york.wall street mortgage bankers indorsed the note to the order of indymac bank,indymac,and indymac later indorsed the note in blank.
in july,the office of thrift supervision closed indymac and appointed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as its receiver.that same day,the office of thrift supervision created a new entity,indymac federal bank,indymac federal,transferred indymac assets to indymac federal,and appointed fdic as indymac federal conservator.fdic later also became indymac federal receiver.
on march,fdic as indymac federal receiver entered into a loan sale agreement lsa to sell substantially all of indymac federal assets to onewest bank,onewest.section of the lsa,titled closing,contemplates that transfer of the subject notes shall take place at some future time.see app.section b of the lsa requires that all notes subject to transfer pursuant to the lsa bear a specific form of endorsement.
around the same time that onewest acquired melina loan,onewest contracted with deutsche bank national trust company for deutsche bank to serve as document custodian for melina original note and mortgage.in that capacity,deutsche bank had physical possession of melina original note and mortgage from until april,at which point deutsche bank sent them to onewest.onewest returned melina note and mortgage to deutsche bank in may,and deutsche bank sent them back to onewest in june.onewest then transmitted melina original note and mortgage to its foreclosure counsel at gross polowy,llc,on june.
on august,melina defaulted on his loan by failing to make the payment due that day.he did not cure the default after receiving notice from onewest.
on july,cit group entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger between cit group and imb holdco llc,the parent company of onewest.cit group is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business located at west street,new york,new york.article v,section of the agreement and plan of merger requires that,during the period between the date of the agreement and the actual closing,onewest seek cit group written permission prior to undertaking almost two dozen significant corporate decisions.these decisions include opening,closing,or relocating a branch.
on september,onewest commenced a foreclosure action against melina in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction.on that day,melina original note and mortgage were in the physical possession of onewest counsel at gross polowy.on october,onewest filed an amended complaint containing substantively the same allegations as the original complaint.on february,melina filed an answer,and on april,he filed an amended answer.onewest thereafter moved for summary judgment,and melina to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on june,the district court heard oral arguments on the motions.in a memorandum and order dated august,the district court denied melina to dismiss and granted onewest motion for summary judgment.the district court held that a national bank such as onewest is a citizen only of the state in which its main office is located not also of the state of its principal place of business and that onewest main office is indisputably in california.the district court concluded further that,even if the principal place of business of a national bank mattered for jurisdictional purposes,onewest was california.
the district court also disagreed with melina standing arguments on the basis of its finding that onewest was the legal holder of melina note and entitled to enforce it under the new york uniform commercial code.this finding was based on the affidavits of onewest corporate representative and counsel,which established that onewest was in physical possession of melina original note at the time it commenced its lawsuit.additionally,the district court found that onewest had proven it was entitled to enforce melina loan as the loan assignee.
melina timely appealed the district court memorandum and order and sought review of the district court holdings on subject matter jurisdiction and standing.

diversity jurisdiction under is proper only if diversity of citizenship among the parties is complete,only if there is no plaintiff and no defendant who are citizens of the same state.dep t of corr.schacht.diversity is measured as of the time the action is brought,and thus a change of citizenship does not destroy diversity jurisdiction.see vocational instruction project cmty,cir.

provides that national banks shall be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.the supreme court has held unequivocally that a national bank is located,for diversity jurisdiction purposes,in the state designated in its articles of association as the locus of its main office not in every state in which it has branch offices.see wachovia bank schmidt,
in wachovia bank,the supreme court left open the question of whether a national bank is also a citizen of the state of its principal place of business.see id.at.the court did observe,however,that although provides that a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every state and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of the state or foreign state where it has its principal place of business,c,t he counterpart provision for national banking associations,does not refer to principal place of business,wachovia bank,at.the court then dismissed this difference as one of scant practical significance because in almost every case the location of a national bank main office and of its principal place of business coincide.id.
several federal courts of appeals to have considered this issue in the wake of wachovia bank have held that a national bank is a citizen only of the state listed in its articles of association as its main office.see,rouse wachovia,fsb,cir.looking to the supreme court treatment of the issue and to the history and sequence of the enactment and amendment of the statute,we conclude that,under,a national bank is located only in the state designated as its main office.wells fargo bank,wmr,llc,cir.analyzing wachovia bank and statutory history to reject the claim that wells fargo is a citizen of both south dakota and california even the fifth and seventh circuits,which had held prior to wachovia bank that a national bank principal place of business is an independent basis for its citizenship,have now agreed that a national bank citizenship is to be determined with reference to its main office.see,tu nguyen bank of,app x,cir.a national bank may be considered a citizen of the state designated in its articles of association as its main office.quoting wachovia bank,at hicklin eng g,bartell,cir.wachovia bank held that national banks are citizens only of the states in which their main offices are located,and that decision saves this case from a jurisdictional dismissal.
we agree with our sister circuits that a national bank is a citizen only of the state listed in its articles of association as its main office.though wachovia bank did not conclusively resolve whether a national bank is a citizen of the state in which it has its principal place of business,the supreme court in that case did provide some indication that,for diversity purposes,a national bank citizenship should be limited to the l
