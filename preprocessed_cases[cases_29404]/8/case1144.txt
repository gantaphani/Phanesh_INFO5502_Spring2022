background 
i.the allegations in the proposed complaint 
we accept as true the facts alleged in the proposed complaint because sanderson appeals from the denial of leave to amend on the ground of futility.see panther partners ikanos commc ns,cir.
abat is a delaware corporation whose primary operations and subsidiaries are located in china.it principally design s,manufacture s,and market s rechargeable polymer pli batteries for use in consumer products,such as portable computers,as well as electric vehicles.in abat became obligated to file financial statements with the securities and exchange commission sec when it decided to list its stock on a united states exchange through a reverse merger.at all relevant times,abat contemporaneously filed financial statements with china state administration of industry and commerce aic,a regulatory agency to which chinese companies must submit such statements as part of an annual examination.
between may,and march,abat sec filings painted a favorable financial picture that included increasing revenues,gross profits and net income.these financial figures,however,contrasted with the figures reported in abat contemporaneous filings with the aic in china.in particular,from to abat reported losses to the aic while it reported significant profits to the sec.the differences were indisputably material.taking as an example,abat reported to the aic that its revenues were approximately and that it suffered an operating loss of million,while it reported to the sec revenues of million and a profit of million.
the proposed complaint alleges that these and other discrepancies in the financial figures reported to the aic and sec can not be explained by differences between those agencies reporting requirements and practices alone.if anything,it claims,chinese accounting rules more generously recognize revenue than generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states.
in addition to presenting two very different financial pictures to regulators in china and the united states,abat is alleged to have misrepresented or failed to fully disclose material facts about two transactions.
first,in december abat announced that it would purchase shenzhen zhongqiang new energy science technology,shenzhen zhongqiang for million,even though shenzhen zhongqiang had generated revenues of less than in and had suffered losses each year since its inception in.the proposed complaint alleges that in announcing the shenzhen zhongqiang acquisition abat failed to disclose that its chairman and chief executive officer,zhiguo fu,owned shenzhen zhongqiang and had paid a mere million for the company in.the transaction allegedly enabled fu to siphon funds from abat for his own personal use.
second,abat allegedly misrepresented the nature of its ownership interest in one of its purported subsidiaries,heilongjiang zhongqiang power tech,zq power tech.in its sec filings for and,abat identified zq power tech as a subsidiary of cashtech,which was itself a abat subsidiary.abat sec filings revealed that zq power tech was actually owned by fu and other investors.on april,moreover,abat responded to allegations of fraud by effectively admit ting that it did not actually own zq power tech from through.although it sought to justify initially accounting for zq power tech as a subsidiary because fu and his had transferred to abat all of the benefits and obligations of zq power tech,abat explained that it ultimately decided that it would be more appropriate to explain the relationship in detail.
the remaining defendants in this matter are two auditing firms,to which we refer as the auditor defendants.abat outside auditors from through december,were defendants bagell,josephs,levine,and its successor,friedman llp together,bagell josephs defendant efp rotenberg,llp efp served as abat auditor from december,through the filing of the proposed complaint in september.
the relevant audit opinions issued during these periods certified that abat financial statements conformed with gaap and present ed fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of abat.they also represented that the audits themselves were conducted in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board.the proposed complaint alleges that these statements were materially false and misleading and that the auditor defendants ignored or recklessly disregarded numerous red flags that should have alerted them to abat fraudulent financial statements.as relevant here,the proposed complaint identifies the following red flags the contrasting set of financial filings to the aic and the sec,the shenzhen zhongqiang transaction,the mischaracterization of the ownership of zq power tech,the unreasonably high profits that abat reported,and the mere fact that abat became listed on a united states exchange through a reverse merger.it focuses in particular on the first two of these red flags.as to both,the proposed complaint alleges that bagell josephs auditors visited abat offices in china,had ready access to abat financial records there,and presumably relied on the same underlying financial records and data that had formed the basis for abat aic filings.finally,an accounting expert opinion concludes that the auditor defendants failure to uncover or appreciate the significance of these red flags constituted an extreme departure from the reasonable standards of care they were obligated to meet as abat auditor s.
in abat fraudulent conduct and its reporting of significantly lower revenue and profit in its aic filings as compared to its sec filings was exposed in reports by publications.a march report discussed abat financial statements.almost immediately after that report was published,the price of abat shares plunged nearly percent.
ii.procedural history 
starting in april,five related securities fraud actions were filed against abat and certain abat executives collectively,the abat defendants.after these actions were consolidated,lead plaintiff sanderson filed a corrected first amended consolidated class action complaint the consolidated complaint to add bagell josephs and efp as defendants.both the abat defendants and the auditor defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.
the district court denied the motion as to the abat defendants but granted it as to the auditor defendants the court held that the consolidated complaint allegations that the auditors failed to conform their audits to professional standards established at best an inference of negligence,not recklessness or intentional misconduct.it also determined that all but one of the purported red flags were either not red flags or not alleged to have been known to the auditor defendants.it concluded that the remaining alleged red flag the recharacterization of the ownership of zq power tech was not sufficiently egregious to support the requisite scienter.lastly,the court held that the named plaintiffs lacked standing to sue efp because they purchased their aba
