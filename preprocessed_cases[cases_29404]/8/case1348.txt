this appeal requires us to address several unsettled issues concerning the effect of a settlement on an individual class member preexisting right to arbitrate certain claims.the appellants,john and elaine beland the belands,brought various claims before financial industry regulatory authority finra arbitrators against ameriprise financial services,ameriprise,a company,for,inter alia,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation related to the decline in value of various financial assets owned by the belands and managed by ameriprise.the claims are based on ameriprise alleged failure to adhere to the belands conservative investment strategy and its steering of the belands assets into mutual funds that allowed ameriprise to collect excessive fees.
ameriprise answered the belands finra complaint by asserting,principally,that the belands released their claims by operation of a settlement agreement in a suit that had proceeded between and in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the belands were class members in the class action,but in part,they allege,on the advice an ameriprise financial advisor they took no action at the time of the settlement,failing to either opt out of the class or submit a claim to share in the settlement funds.by the terms of the settlement agreement,the district court deborah batts,judge had retained exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the class litigation.
after finra arbitrators denied ameriprise motion to stay the belands arbitration,ameriprise moved in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,in which the class action had been litigated and settled,for an order to enforce the settlement agreement that would enjoin the belands from pressing any of their claims before finra arbitrators.the district court concluded that the class settlement barred all of the belands arbitration claims,and therefore granted ameriprise motion and ordered the belands to dismiss their finra complaint with prejudice.
we conclude that the district court had the power to enter such an order and that several of the belands arbitration claims were barred by the settlement.we therefore affirm in part.but because we conclude that the belands arbitration complaint pleads claims including suitability claims that were not,and could not have been,released by the class settlement,we vacate in part the district court judgment,and we remand the case for the entry of an order permitting the claims to proceed in finra arbitration.in light of our disposition of this appeal,we dismiss as moot the belands appeal from the district court denial of their motion for reconsideration.
background 
the in re aefa class action complaint 
between march,and may,various persons who had had dealings with the class plaintiffs brought a total of five separate lawsuits before the united states district court for the southern district of new york against several ameriprise affiliates.the class plaintiffs asserted various federal and claims based on ameriprise alleged conflicts of interest,misrepresentations and omissions,biased and canned financial advice and advisory services,failure to disclose financial incentives and fees,and steering of clients money into investments that benefited the defendants without regard to their clients best interests.on june,the district court consolidated the five class actions into in re american express financial advisors securities litigation in re aefa,civ,consolidated june.
the second consolidated amended class action complaint the class complaint,dated september,described the class action as arising out of the failure of american express to disclose an unlawful and deceitful course of conduct they engaged in that was designed to improperly financially advantage defendants to the detriment of class plaintiffs and other members of the class.class complaint,in re aefa,civ.s,ecf.the class plaintiffs alleged that instead of offering fair,honest and unbiased recommendations to plaintiffs and other investors,american express financial advisors gave recommendations,pushing clients into a,limited number of mutual funds in order to reap millions of dollars in secret kickbacks from the shelf space funds and millions more from sales of american express proprietary funds.id.they alleged further that the defendants had an undisclosed,material conflict of interest that made it impossible for them to render impartial advice.id.based on those allegations,the class plaintiffs brought claims for violations of the securities act of,the securities exchange act of and various rules promulgated thereunder,the investment advisers act of,and assorted claims including for breach of fiduciary duty,deceptive trade practices,and unjust enrichment.the class period was defined as march,to april,and was later extended to april.
in january,the lead plaintiffs in in re aefa moved for provisional certification of a settlement class and preliminary approval of a settlement agreement pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.see stipulation of settlement class settlement or settlement agreement,lead pls.notice of mot.for prelim.approval of settlement exh,in re aefa,civ,ecf.they simultaneously submitted a draft notice of proposed settlement of class action the class notice to the court.on february,the district court provisionally certified the class and approved the class notice.in february and march,the parties mailed the class notice to roughly million potential class members.
the class notice served several functions.first,it described the lawsuit in general terms 
in their lawsuits,the investors complain that they were sold financial plans advice that,instead of being tailored to their individual circumstances,contained standardized recommendations designed to steer them into investing in defendants proprietary mutual funds and other proprietary investment products the proprietary funds and certain preferred or select mutual funds the shelf space funds.plaintiffs claim that the conflicts of interest inherent in defendants financial plans financial advisory services,and the compensation arrangements between defendants and the preferred funds,were inadequately disclosed to investors

second,the class notice explained the options available to potential class members in acting on the class settlement.in particular,as relevant here,the class notice stated unless you exclude yourself,you will continue to be a member of the class,and that means that if the settlement is approved,you will release all released claims against the released persons,and you will be prohibited from bringing or participating in any other cases concerning the released claims against the released persons.id.at.the class notice also included a description of released claims and released persons taken from the settlement agreement.the definition of released claims included,inter alia,
any and all claims,debts,demands,rights or causes of action or liabilities whatsoever,whether based on federal,state,local,statutory or common law or any other law,rule or regulation,including both known claims and unknown claims that i have been asserted in this action by the plaintiffs or ii could have been asserted in any forum by the plaintiffs or class members against any of the released persons including claims that arise out of or are based upon a the allegations,transactions,facts,matters or occurrences,representations or omissions alleged,involved,set forth,or referred to in the class complaint 
id.at.importantly for present purposes,the class notice stated that released claims shall not include suitability claims unless such claims are alleged to arise out of the common course of conduct that was alleged,or could have been alleged,in the action,as more fully described herein.id.
the class notice further explains that releasing claims will prevent you from suing defendants over claims that arise from or are based on the offer and sale of financial planning services or financial advice provided to you by defendants,including claims to recover the fees you paid for financial advisory services or advice and claims that you were steered toward particular investments that were more profitable for ameriprise.id.it also warned potential class members,under the heading excluding yourself from the settlement,that if you want to retain any right to sue or continue to assert any of the released claims on your own against any defendant or other released person,then you must take steps to get out of the class.see id.at,explaining how to opt out of the class settlement and the consequences of do ing nothing.
on july,the district court issued an order and final judgment in in re aefa approving the class settlement,dismissing all class members claims with prejudice,and barring and enjoining class members from asserting related claims against released persons.the court retained e xclusive jurisdiction over the parties and the class members for all matters relating to this action and the settlement,including the interpretation,effectuation,or enforcement of the settlement agreement and this order and final judgment.order and final judgment at,in re aefa,civ.july,ecf.
the belands 
john and elaine beland are a retired married couple living on a acre parcel of farmland in new lenox,illinois,that,together with a much larger tract,had been in john family for more than a century.for many years,john,whose formal education ended in eighth grade,farmed the family homestead for the pesters,his aunt and uncle.claim in arbitration before finra finra complaint filed,decl.of david bowker in supp.of ameriprise fin,mem.of law in supp.of mot.to enforce in re aefa settlement and inj.bowker decl.exh,in re aefa,civ,ecf.after the death of his uncle,john continued to farm the land for his aunt,hazel pester.
according to the belands,in,acting on the financial advice of ronald miller an ameriprise financial consultant based in joliet,illinois hazel sold a large portion of the family farm for approximately million.the proceeds of the sale were immediately deposited into two different trusts a charitable trust worth million and a revocable trust worth.hazel was the charitable trust lifetime beneficiary,and she held a life estate in the revocable trust.in,hazel died.john beland took the corpus of the revocable trust,while various local churches and charities,as residuary beneficiaries,received the assets in the charitable trust.john,allegedly on miller advice,then converted the revocable trust into an ameriprise investment account,jointly held by the belands and managed by miller.
the belands finra complaint asserts that ameriprise and miller agreed to invest the belands funds in a conservative fashion,preserving capital and obtaining income from which the life beneficiaries could receive a return.id.however,the belands allege,a conservative asset allocation approach was not taken.id.in the finra complaint,the belands express two main grievances miller and ameriprise invested in many house american express mutual funds including various high yield junk bond funds,as well as risky small cap or funds and ameriprise invested in many risky technology stocks which led to huge,significant losses over time.id.they similarly contend that ameriprise allocat ed the trust assets inappropriately which left the trusts exposed to greater than expected losses.appellants br.at see finra complaint.
the belands state that their combined account balances dwindled from more than million at inception in to approximately in early.finra complaint.john admits that he did not review the account statements until after hazel death,when he noticed the precipitous drop.id.the belands allege that when they confronted miller about the accounts declining assets,miller set a course of,lies and deceit in order to obscure the mishandling of the accounts,providing false justifications for investment decisions and shielding the truth about ameriprise motives and conflicts of interest.id.among the allegedly false reasons for the losses were the september terrorist attacks and that the charitable trust was intended to diminish in value by design.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
over time,the belands received notices of myriad lawsuits against or involving various companies in which ameriprise and miller had invested on the belands behalf.in addition,john beland conceded that in early he received multiple notices relating to the in re aefa action.decl.of john beland,reply in supp.of mot.for.disc.exh.a,in re aefa june,ecf.because he found the notices,including the in re aefa notices,complex and confusing,he asked miller for advice.id.according to john,miller told the belands to do nothing about these notices and they followed his advice.id.as a result of their failure to take any action with respect to the in re aefa class settlement,the belands did not share in its proceeds 
the belands finra action 
in late,the belands sought legal advice regarding their accounts declining values,and on february,they filed an arbitration complaint with finra.they made claims collectively,the finra claims against miller and ameriprise for breach of fiduciary duty for failing to manage the trusts according to their investment objectives,and by,finra complaint breach of contract for mishandling the belands assets and covering up the mishandling,id.fraud for mak ing material misstatements of fact regarding the reasons for the assets decline in value,among other things,id.and negligent misrepresentation,id.see generally id.the belands sought an arbitration award of not less than for well managed account damages,for punitive damages,and for their costs and fees of the finra action.id.at.
in response before the finra arbitrators,miller and ameriprise collectively,the finra defendants filed a statement of answer,defenses and affirmative defenses on september.at the same time,the finra defendants moved before the arbitrators to stay the arbitration proceedings on the basis that,as members of the in re aefa class,the belands had released ameriprise financial and its agents and affiliates for the released claims defined in the class settlement and class notice.mot.to stay arbitration of released claims motion to stay at,bowker decl.exh,in re aefa,civ,ecf.in the motion to stay,the finra defendants listed eighteen separate ameriprise account numbers as to which,they contended,the belands allegations were barred by the class settlement the finra defendants stated in their motion that u nless claimants withdraw their released claims in this action,respondents will be forced to protect their rights by filing a motion to enforce class action settlement as to the released claims,and that,therefore,a stay of th e finra action as it pertains to the released claims is appropriate.id.at.on october,the belands filed an opposition to the finra defendants motion to stay,arguing that the class action specifically excluded the causes of action the belands assert in the finra arbitration.claimants opp to resp ts mot.to stay arbitration at,bowker decl.exh,in re aefa,civ,ecf.

ameriprise motion to enforce the class settlement in the.and belands cross motion to clear technical defaults and for limited discovery 
before the scheduled arbitration hearing could be held,however,the finra defendants filed a motion to enforce the in re aefa settlement agreement before the district court,which had retained jurisdiction over the in re aefa class litigation.in their march,motion to enforce,the finra defendants requested that the court order the belands to dismiss with prejudice their pending finra action against ameriprise.mem.in supp.of ameriprise mot.to enforce in re aefa settlement and inj.motion to enforce at,in re aefa,civ,ecf.the belands did not,in response,file a direct opposition to the motion.instead,they filed a,styled as a motion to clear technical defaults and for limited discovery,seeking to litigate the issue of whether the class settlement definition of released claims covered all of the claims that the belands asserted in their finra complaint.specifically,the belands argued that depositions should be taken to determine whether evidence supported their assertion that miller conduct deprived them of any meaningful opportunity to opt out of the class action,as well as to determine which of their investments did not fall within the ambit of the class settlement.mot.to clear technical defaults,for.disc.and to set briefing schedule at,in re aefa,civ,ecf.the belands proposed a deposition and briefing schedule that would culminate in an evidentiary hearing before the district court.the finra defendants opposed the by arguing,principally,that even the facts as alleged by the belands would not,under the excusable neglect standard,justify their failure to opt out of the class settlement.
the belands filed a reply,arguing that the district court 
should allow the arbitration to proceed for two reasons first,because the issues of miller breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation go well beyond any issue that was or could have been raised in the class action and second,because the arbitration panel is uniquely positioned to make factual determinations as to which accounts may or may not be encompassed within this court confirmation order.

the district court order enforcing the settlement 
in a order dated august,the enforcement order,the district court granted the finra defendants motion to enforce and ordered the belands to dismiss with prejudice their pending finra complaint against ameriprise and miller.the court concluded that the belands claims f ell within the definition of released claims barred by the court july,order.enforcement order at,in re aefa,civ,ecf.the court characterized the belands finra claims thus 
here,the belands claim that rather than managing their accounts in a conservative,minimal risk manner as promised,miller and ameriprise invested in many house american express mutual funds including various high yield junk bond funds,as well as risky small cap or funds in order to generate fees for ameriprise and promote mutual funds of american express.
id.at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that those allegations arise from the same transactions,facts,matters,occurrences,and representations as the claims of the class complaint.id.
the district court further determined that the belands could not satisfy the standard for excusable neglect to excuse their failure to opt out of the class settlement.id.at.in arriving at that conclusion,the court stated that while miller advice may have played a role in the belands decision not to opt out of the class,the belands should have known from the plain english of the class notice that miller recommendation that they do nothing would lead to no payment from the settlement and the release of future claims.id.at.the court also found that not until after ameriprise moved to enjoin the belands finra claims on march,did the belands argue before this court that they should be excused from failing to opt out of the settlement a delay that was,in the court view,inexcusably long.id.at.
after the district court issued the enforcement order,the belands filed a motion for reconsideration,making several arguments.first,they contended that the enforcement order simply overlooked material language in the release which exempts claims like the belands which do not relate to the allegations of the class action but instead raise independent suitability claims.second,the belands argued that the federal arbitration act faa required that the finra defendants arbitrate the coverage of the class settlement before the arbitrators.third,the belands further elaborated a theory of excusable neglect that would free their claims from the class settlement even if those claims were released claims.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration in a order dated august.
the belands appeal 
the belands filed a notice of appeal on august.the same day,the district court granted a stay of its enforcement order pending the appeal to this court.the stay remains in effect.
discussion 
on appeal,the belands argue that the district court erred in several respects.principally,they assert that the court failed to compare the substance of the claims alleged in their finra complaint which feature unsuitability,lack of asset allocation and speculative tech stock investing with the released claims in the class settlement.appellants br.at.in the belands view,the class settlement only released claims regarding the sale of,standardized investment adviser plans which steered customers to proprietary or preferred mutual funds for which ameriprise received kickbacks.id.they also point to a carve out in the class settlement that they contend exempts at least some of their finra claims.id.for these reasons,the belands contend that at least some of their arbitration claims are not released claims,and that the district court erred in requiring the belands to dismiss those unreleased claims.
alternatively,the belands argue that ameriprise chose to defend the belands claims before finra arbitrators and,therefore,the district court erred in derail ing the pending finra arbitration that questions concerning the scope of the settlement agreement were for the finra arbitrators to decide,and that the arbitrators indicated their intent to decide them that the release contained in the class settlement should not be applied against the belands because their failure to opt out of the class action was the product of excusable neglect and that the district court erroneously denied their motion for reconsideration.id.at.
the finra defendants also collectively ameriprise argue that the class settlement release of suitability claims arising out of the common course of conduct alleged in in re aefa precludes the entirety of the belands arbitration claims.appellee br.at.ameriprise also responds that the district court properly rejected the belands excusable neglect argument,and that the district court ha d exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the class settlement.id.at.the finra defendants therefore contend that the district court acted properly in directing the belands to dismiss all of their arbitral claims.
this appeal presents at least one unresolved legal issue about which the parties are in agreement.neither the belands nor ameriprise appear to dispute the general principle that federal courts are vested with power under the faa to enjoin a pending arbitration where appropriate.but this question has never been explicitly resolved by this court and we,therefore,address it in the course of our analysis.we also reiterate this court recent holding that constitutes an agreement to arbitrate disputes under finra rules,see ubs fin,wl,at.lexis,at cir,a proposition neither of the parties contests.
ii.arbitrability of the belands claims 
background arbitration law 
the faa creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr.the faa provides that an arbitration provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.further,the faa establishes a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution and supplies not simply a procedural framework applicable in federal courts but also calls for the application,in state as well as federal courts,of federal substantive law regarding arbitration.preston ferrer.
t he faa primary purpose is to ensur e that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford.univ.despite the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,moses cone,at,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit,howsam dean witter reynolds,quoting steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,internal quotation marks omitted see also volt,at arbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.a s with any other contract,the parties intentions control.stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,internal quotation marks omitted.
however,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.moses cone,at.accordingly,federal policy requires us to construe arbitration clauses as broadly as possible.collins aikman prods,cir brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we will compel arbitration unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.at t,commc ns workers of.
in this circuit,courts follow a test to determine the arbitrability of claims.in deciding whether claims are subject to arbitration,a court must consider whether the parties have entered into a valid agreement to arbitrate,and,if so,whether the dispute at issue comes within the scope of the arbitration agreement.ace capital re overseas cent.united life ins,cir accord john hancock mut.life ins.olick,cir.before addressing the second inquiry,we must also determine who the court or the arbitrator properly decides the issue.see republic of ecuador chevron,cir.
existence and scope of ameriprise consent to arbitrate 
because our review of the district court enforcement order requires that we evaluate not only the existence but also the scope of any such agreement,we must identify first that agreement form,and then its contours.
ameriprise does not dispute that,by virtue of its membership in finra,it has consented to arbitrate with its customers see finra code of arbitration procedure for customer disputes finra code parties must arbitrate a dispute under the finra code if arbitration is r equested by the customer t he dispute is between a customer and a finra member or associated person of a member and t he dispute arises in connection with the business activities of the member or the associated person john hancock life ins.wilson,cir explaining that the defendant concede d that it agreed by virtue of its membership in the nasd,the predecessor to finra,to arbitrate all disputes contemplated under a rule analogous to finra rule.nor does ameriprise dispute that all of the belands claims constitute claims aris ing in connection with its business activities within the meaning of finra rule.this court has recently stated that finra membership constitutes an agreement to adhere to finra rules and regulations,including its code and relevant arbitration provisions contained therein.ubs fin,wl,at see also wachovia bank,wl,at.lexis,at stating that interpretation of arbitration rules of an industry organization such as finra is similar to contract interpretation and concluding,in that case,that the matter was not arbitrable under finra rules.we therefore conclude that all of the belands finra claims against ameriprise are arbitrable in the absence of any subsequent agreement revoking or otherwise limiting the scope of ameriprise consent to arbitrate.
iii.binding nature of the class settlement on the belands 
we next turn to the parties relationship to the class settlement.absent a violation of due process or excusable neglect for failure to timely opt out,a settlement agreement binds all class members who did not do so.see,wal mart stores,visa,cir stating that a class member was required to opt out at the class notice stage if it did not wish to be bound by a class settlement agreement,cert.denied,county of suffolk long island lighting,cir stating that if a party could not have properly opted out of the mandatory class,it is bound by the class settlement if it is upheld,as are all other members of the class see also phillips petroleum shutts,in re painewebber,cir.and a settlement agreement is a contract that is interpreted according to general principles of contract law.omega eng g,omega,cir.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure permits a court to extend the time during which an act must be done on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.b b.in pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,the supreme court set forth four factors to be considered in connection with an assertion of excusable neglect as justification for a missed judicial deadline the danger of prejudice to the party opposing the extension the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the party seeking the extension and whether the party seeking the extension acted in good faith.id.at.while those factors are the central focus of the inquiry,the ultimate determination depends upon a careful review of all relevant circumstances.accord in re painewebber,at to establish excusable neglect,a movant must show good faith and a reasonable basis for noncompliance.
because the belands have not argued that due process was denied them with respect to the class settlement,we turn to whether the district court erred when it rejected their excusable neglect argument.on review of the district court ruling for abuse of discretion,see id.at,we will reverse only if we have a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion that it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors,silivanch celebrity cruises,cir,cert.denied.because we have no such clear conviction here,we do not disturb the district court conclusion that the belands failed to demonstrate excusable neglect.
in analyzing the issue,the district court relied on admonitions and warnings under boldface,capitalized headings in the class notice which the belands received about the consequences of taking no action.the court concluded that the belands should have known from the plain english of the notice that miller recommendation that they do nothing would lead to no payment from the settlement and the release of future claims.enforcement order at.it also determined that if the belands failed to read the notice,even after miller alleged advice,they did so unreasonably.the court further noted a significant delay on the belands part in seeking relief under the excusable neglect standard,even after they became aware of their possible error in failing to opt out of the class settlement.
we conclude that the court decision in this regard did not constitute an abuse of its discretion.the class notice is a reasonably straightforward document that contains a list of readable questions and answers discussing the content of the class action and the consequences of taking,or not taking,action in response.see wal mart,at stating that a class n otice is adequate if it may be understood by the average class member internal quotation marks omitted.and the class notice itself offered advice from class counsel,providing lawyers contact information and instructing class members to contact them should the content of the class notice be unclear.there is,moreover,little doubt that ameriprise would suffer prejudice if the belands were permitted to opt out of the class settlement three years late,as it would be exposed to liability that it had every reason to think had been foreclosed by the entry of the settlement agreement in federal court.
neither the length of,nor the reasons for,the belands delay counsel otherwise.even if john beland lack of an extended formal education rendered the class notice incomprehensible to him,the fact that he brought the document to miller the representative of ameriprise for advice suggests that he had some level of awareness of the notice importance.and while the belands explain their delay by asserting that they had relied on advice from miller that the belands should take no action with respect to the lawsuit against ameriprise,we agree with the district court implicit conclusion that any such reliance was unreasonable.applying the reasoning of a district court in another circuit,o nce the belands knew that there was a legal proceeding pending,it was no longer reasonable for them to continue taking legal or investment advice from ameriprise or any of its agents.in re vms sec,internal quotation marks omitted see also id.r elying on one adversaries rather than one attorney for advice is an error that is to be laid at the feet of the one who made it such reliance is not reasonable,particularly when the notice instructed class members to consult with their own counsel or class counsel if they had questions.internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the belands do not contend that miller took any action to limit their ability to consult with a lawyer or ask for outside advice.
we therefore reject the belands contention that the district court abused its discretion as to its application of the excusable neglect standard to their factual circumstances.it follows from that conclusion that the belands were bound as class members by the in re aefa class settlement.
iv.effect of the class settlement on the agreement to arbitrate 
question of arbitrability 
the supreme court has distinguished between question s of arbitrability,which are issue s for judicial determination,u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,at t,at see also first options of,kaplan,painewebber bybyk,cir,and other gateway matters,which are presumptively reserved for the arbitrator resolution,republic of ecuador,at internal quotation marks omitted.among questions of arbitrability presumptively reserved for a court,the supreme court has identified dispute s about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause and disagreement s about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.howsam,at.
the principal issue in this case is whether any of the belands finra claims survived the class settlement and are thus still subject to arbitration.as a preliminary matter,however,we must first determine whether the court or the arbitrator should answer that question.we conclude that such an inquiry is a question of arbitrability that is reserved to the court.
first,the class settlement did not merely resolve certain claims that class members might have had,thus estopping these class members from arbitrating these claims at a later date.as discussed further below,the class settlement revoked ameriprise consent to arbitrate certain claims.the question therefore is not whether those claims had been settled,thus precluding arbitration,but whether there was a surviving agreement,following the settlement,to arbitrate those claims at all.that question,u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.at t,at.but republic of ecuador,at observing that waiver and estoppel generally fall into the group of issues presumptively for the arbitrator.
second,ameriprise finra membership can not serve as such clear and unmistakabl e evidence of the parties intent that all future questions of arbitrability be submitted to arbitrators.see wilson,at o ne party membership in an exchange is insufficient,in and of itself,to evidence the parties clear and unmistakable intent to submit the arbitrability question to the arbitrators.
third,the district court explicitly retained jurisdiction over the in re aefa class action.see order and final judgment at providing that e xclusive jurisdiction is hereby retained over the parties and the class members for all matters relating to this action and the settlement emphasis added.
for those reasons,we conclude that determining the scope of the belands entitlement to arbitrate by virtue of ameriprise consent through its finra membership is a question for judicial resolution.as such,the district court properly undertook it on ameriprise motion the question remains whether its ultimate conclusion was correct.
scope of ameriprise agreement to arbitrate 
we have said that there is nothing irrevocable about an agreement to arbitrate.baker taylor,cir per curiam brackets,ellipsis,and internal quotation marks omitted.parties may limit the issues they choose to arbitrate,stolt nielsen.at,and n othing prevents parties to an agreement from excluding claims from the scope of an agreement to arbitrate,mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth.such limitations and exclusions need not be specified by the initial agreement to arbitrate.both of the parties may abandon this method of settling their differences,and under a variety of circumstances one party may waive or destroy by his conduct his right to insist upon arbitration.baker taylor,at internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,as relevant here,different or additional contractual arrangements for arbitration can supersede the rights conferred on a customer by virtue of a broker membership in a organization such as finra.kidder,peabody zinsmeyer trusts,cir citing merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,georgiadis,cir.
the class settlement in this case by which,as discussed above,the belands are bound is one such different or additional contractual arrangement.id.a n arbitrator derives his or her powers from the parties agreement to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution.stolt nielsen.at.it follows that where a party initially consents in this case,by dint of ameriprise finra membership to arbitrate certain types of claims,but later enters into a settlement agreement that releases claims that had been subject to the initial consent to arbitrate,the claims that have been released by such a settlement are no longer subject to arbitration.
in the case before us,the belands failed to opt out of the class,and as explained above have not demonstrated excusable neglect for that failure.therefore,bound by the class settlement and release,the belands may not pursue any released claims against ameriprise and its employees.and the class settlement supersedes all prior understandings,communications,and agreements with respect to the subject of this settlement,settlement agreement at,including the parties implicit agreement that the belands had a right to arbitrate certain claims against ameriprise by virtue of the latter finra membership.in other words,the class settlement extinguished not only the ability of class members to bring released claims against ameriprise as a matter of substance,but also the class members right to arbitrate those claims.
we find support for this conclusion in the tenth circuit opinion in riley manufacturing anchor glass container,cir.there,a merger clause in a settlement agreement purported to cancel,terminate and supersede any and all prior representations and agreements relating to the subject matter of the agreement.id.at.the court concluded that the merger clause revoked the prior right of the parties to demand arbitration on the specific topics that the court concluded were within the bounds of the settlement agreement.id.at see id.at concluding that the specific releases in the settlement agreement waive d the plaintiff right to demand arbitration on the five topics explicitly listed in the agreement see also miller runyon,cir given the contractual nature of arbitration,it can be argued that the preclusive effect of either a judicial judgment or an arbitration award on a subsequent arbitration should depend on what the parties agreed to.and then the court will decide as a matter of interpretation of the parties agreement to arbitrate whether the arbitrators can ignore a prior judicial judgment.citations omitted,cert.denied.
we agree with the tenth circuit approach.we conclude that the belands entitlement to arbitrate disputes with ameriprise,arising out of ameriprise finra membership and defined by rule,does not extend to the released claims defined by the settlement agreement because the settlement agreement amended the contours of the parties agreement to arbitrate all disputes between them before finra arbitrators.
district court retention of jurisdiction over in re aefa 
we do not suggest,however,that in all cases,a settlement agreement revokes a prior agreement or consent to arbitrate by releasing claims that would have been subject to arbitration under the earlier agreement or consent.indeed,u nder our cases,if there is a reading of the various agreements that permits the a rbitration c lause to remain in effect,we must choose it.bank julius baer waxfield,cir however,no such reading is possible here because the settlement agreement explicitly vests the district court with exclusive jurisdiction to enforce its terms.
a federal court does not automatically retain jurisdiction to hear a motion to enforce or otherwise apply a settlement in a case that it has previously dismissed.see kokkonen guardian life ins.of.such motions are essentially contract claims to be litigated in the state courts.see id.at.however,where,in a federal court,the court makes the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement part of the order of by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order the proper forum for litigating a breach is that same federal court.id.at accord perez westchester county dep t of,cir.in cases over which the district court retain s jurisdiction,it necessarily ma kes compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement a part of its order so that a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order.roberson giuliani,cir quoting kokkonen,at.further,this court has said that where there is ample evidence that the district court intended to place its judicial imprimatur on a settlement,the court retains jurisdiction to oversee the enforcement of the agreement.perez,at quoting torres walker,cir dicta.
that policy interest takes on particular importance in the context of class actions,which are complicated,expensive proceedings involving a multitude of different parties and potential parties but intended ultimately to make enforcement of the rights of all the parties more efficient and less expensive.as a general matter,the more loose ends that remain after the litigation has been resolved,the less successful the process has been.a district court therefore has the power to enforce an ongoing order against relitigation so as to protect the integrity of a complex class settlement over which it retained jurisdiction.in re prudential ins.of am.sales practice,cir see also in re am.life ins.sales practices,cir recognizing the authority of district courts to enforce by injunction a final judgment embodying the terms settling a class action.
in the enforcement order requiring the belands to dismiss their arbitration complaint in its entirety,the district court did not advert to any specific source of its jurisdiction to issue the enforcement order.in approving the settlement agreement and dismissing the in re aefa litigation,though,the district court had explicitly stated that e xclusive jurisdiction is hereby retained over the parties and the class members for all matters relating to this action and the settlement.order and final judgment at.therefore,despite the fact that the district court did officially close and dismiss with prejudice the in re aefa litigation,endorsed letter at,in re aefa,civ,ecf,the court properly retained jurisdiction to hear the kind of issues relating to the settlement agreement released claims raised by the belands in this case.see perez,at.
we have found no reading of the various agreements at issue in this case that would permit ameriprise preexisting and broad consent to arbitrate to remain in effect,bank julius,f d at,in its entirety.unlike the integrated reading we afforded the clause and anterior arbitration agreement in bank julius,an interpretation of the settlement agreement that would permit the belands to arbitrate released claims would run afoul of the district court order and final judgment.we arrive at this conclusion even though we approach it with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone,at.though we must resolve any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration,including when the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself,id.at accord worldcrisa armstrong,cir,we are satisfied that no such doubt exists here.in other words,it may be said with positive assurance that ameriprise consent to arbitrate as reflected in finra rule subsequent to amendment by the settlement agreement is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute surrounding the released claims.at t,at.
settlement agreement released claims 
standard of review 
in reviewing a district court interpretation of the terms of a settlement agreement,we review conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.see ciaramella reader digest ass n,cir.
interpreting class action settlement agreements 
it is elementary that a settlement agreement can not release claims that the parties were not authorized to release.see super spuds,mercantile,cir.at the same time,t he law is well established in this circuit and others that class action releases may include claims not presented and even those which could not have been presented as long as the released conduct arises out of the identical factual predicate as the settled conduct.wal mart,at quoting tbk partners,union,cir tbk partners,at w here there is a realistic identity of issues between the settled class action and the subsequent suit,and where the relationship between the suits is at the time of the class action foreseeably obvious to notified class members,the situation is analogous to the barring of claims that could have been asserted in the class action.under such circumstances the paramount policy of encouraging settlements takes precedence.
indeed,c lass actions may release claims,even if not pled,when such claims arise out of the same factual predicate as settled class claims.wal mart,at.and in order to achieve a comprehensive settlement that would prevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action,a court may permit the release of a claim based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the settled class action even though the claim was not presented and might not have been presentable in the class action.tbk partners,at.
overlap of claims 
we begin by noting that the starting point for interpreting settlement agreements is general principles.see,omega eng g,at.
here,the class settlement stated that the definition of released claims included,inter alia,
any and all claims,debts,demands,rights or causes of action or liabilities whatsoever,whether based on federal,state,local,statutory or common law or any other law,rule or regulation,including both known claims and unknown claims that i have been asserted in this action by the plaintiffs or ii could have been asserted in any forum by the plaintiffs or class members against any of the released persons including claims that arise out of or are based upon a the allegations,transactions,facts,matters or occurrences,representations or omissions alleged,involved,set forth,or referred to in the class complaint,and b the offer and sale of financial advice,financial planning,financial advisory services pursuant to a financial advisory service agreement,or the sps,wms or sma programs 
settlement agreement at.that definition is expansive,but the settlement agreement goes on to exclude certain claims from the definition purview.the settlement agreement states that released claims shall not include suitability claims unless such claims are alleged to arise out of the common course of conduct that was alleged,or could have been alleged,in the action,as more fully described herein.id.at emphases added.
as we explain above,supra note,suitability claims are often brought as a distinct subset of section b claims under the securities exchange act of,b.see dodds,at.ameriprise argues that the belands do not advert to any specific federal statute,or even the term suitability,in their finra complaint.and indeed,before the district court,the belands explicitly disavowed any reliance on federal securities law.therefore,says ameriprise,the belands did not actually assert suitability claims before finra.appellee br.at emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.however,particularly because of the lack of a definition of the term in the class settlement,for the purposes of this appeal we consider suitability to serve more as a general description of the character of potential claims such as breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation all of which the belands did allege in the finra proceedings,rather than a technical term denoting a specific type of section b claim.see also infra note.furthermore,we note that although the belands also disclaim reliance on state securities laws,regulations issued by the state of illinois the state where the belands filed their finra complaint define unsuitab ility with reference to fraud,decepti on,and manipulati on.admin.code tit.
the belands point to several aspects of their finra claims that demonstrate that not all of them are released claims barred by the class settlement.first,they argue that their claims span a time period matching that of the existence of their trusts from to while the release covers only claims between and.second,the belands argue that while the class settlement plainly relate s to claims involving the sale and promotion of proprietary and affiliated mutual funds for which ameriprise was receiving kickbacks or promoting,appellants reply br.at,the settlement agreement express exclusion of suitability claims covers the substance of many of their finra claims,which allege that the conservative goal of both the charitable remainder and revocable trusts was not followed and individual speculative tech securities were bought and sold,appellants br.at see also appellants reply br.at arguing that the belands finra claims include suitability claims unique to the recommendations of ameriprise broker ron miller claims related both to misrepresentation and recommendations having nothing to do with american express mutual funds and shelf space proprietary products.
ameriprise counters that the belands finra claims fall squarely within the definition of released claims.appellee br.at.regardless of any minor differences,ameriprise contends,the finra claims plainly arise from the same transactions,facts,matters,occurrences,and representations as the claims of the class complaint.id.at quoting order and final judgment at.ameriprise also rejects the belands attempt to rely upon the suitability claims in the class settlement,inasmuch as the belands finra complaint did not explicitly label or otherwise characterize any of their claims as being suitability claims 
we agree with the belands,however,that their finra claims and the released claims do not indeed,can not entirely overlap.first,the belands finra complaint unequivocally alleges that ameriprise and miller agreed to invest the belands funds in a conservative fashion,preserving capital and obtaining income from which the life beneficiaries could receive a return,finra complaint,but that a conservative asset allocation approach was not taken,id.that seems to us to be a quintessential suitability claim.see kearney prudential bache,describing a typical suitability claim as a broker invest ment in risky transactions contrary either to an investor explicit directions or to her interests.
second,although the definition of released claims does include suitability claims aris ing out of the common course of conduct that was alleged,or could have been alleged,in the in re aefa litigation,settlement agreement at,we read the common course of conduct alleged in the in re aefa litigation to be,as described by the belands,ameriprise routine practice of steering american express clients into proprietary or shelf space funds through one or more of the managed programs at american express,appellants reply br.at.indeed,the class consisted only of persons who purchased financial plans that invested in the proprietary or shelf space funds as well as others who otherwise invested in those funds.see class complaint.as the class notice explains,the class action involved investors who were sold financial plans advice that,instead of being tailored to their individual circumstances,contained standardized recommendations designed to steer them into investing in defendants proprietary mutual funds and other proprietary investment products and certain preferred or select mutual funds.class notice at.the class notice further explained that the basis of the class action was the notion that conflicts of interest inherent in defendants financial plans financial advisory services,and the compensation arrangements between defendants and the preferred funds,were inadequately disclosed to investors.id.the belands claims that miller mismanaged their trusts contrary to their instructions and investment goals do not fall within that common course of conduct.
third,the belands finra complaint is also devoted in part to the allegation that once they confronted miller about the accounts declining assets,miller set a course of,lies and deceit in order to obscure the mishandling in the accounts,providing false justifications for investment decisions and shielding the truth about ameriprise motives and conflicts of interest.finra complaint see also id.among those allegedly false reasons were the september terrorist attacks and that the charitable trust was set to diminish by design.id.internal quotation marks omitted.claims dependent upon allegations of this sort were plainly not released claims under the in re aefa class settlement.
fourth,there can be no question that the belands claims,to the extent that they involve conduct occurring after the class period,can not be released claims 
to be sure,some if not many of the allegations in the belands finra complaint constitute released claims.for example,they allege that a lmost from the start,rather than invest in conservative large cap stocks,paying good dividends as well as substantial bond portfolios,miller and ameriprise invested in many house american express mutual funds including various high yield junk bond funds.finra complaint emphasis added.similarly,they allege that ameriprise has managed the belands accounts in a fashion designed primarily to generate fees and income for ameriprise and to promote mutual funds of american express.id.to the extent the finra complaint contains similar claims,the claims are conclusively released claims and are,as such,barred.
however,the belands also clearly allege in their finra complaint that ameriprise invested in risky small cap or funds that exposed the belands accounts to tremendous market risk which was unsuitable for the ir account objectives.id.emphasis added.and while the in re aefa class period lasted from march,to april,the belands complaint stretches all the way into.those claims,we conclude,are not released claims and therefore are not barred by the in re aefa class settlement.
conclusion 
to summarize ameriprise consented to arbitrate disputes with the belands its customers by virtue of its membership in finra.finra rule is a broad provision that clearly encompasses the belands finra claims,as they indisputably arise in connection with the business activities of ameriprise and miller.finra code.even if it were a closer question,because the issue would be one of the construction of the contract language itself,we would resolve any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration republic of ecuador,at quoting moses cone,at.
the scope of an agreement to arbitrate is a question of arbitrability within the purview of the court,and therefore we can properly undertake the task of determining the breadth of ameriprise consent to arbitrate.in our view,the settlement agreement modif ied ameriprise fundamental and broad commitment,through its finra membership,to arbitrate any dispute,bechtel do brasil construções ltda.ueg araucária,cir emphasis in original,with the belands.specifically,the settlement agreement altered ameriprise prior expansive commitment to arbitrate by removing the released claims from the scope of that commitment.
we therefore conclude that ameriprise has not agreed to arbitrate the released claims as defined in the settlement agreement,but that it has agreed to arbitrate any claims asserted in the belands finra complaint.
vi.district court remedial power 
power to enjoin arbitration 
the question of whether federal courts have the power to stay arbitration under the faa or any other authority in an appropriate case is an open one in this circuit.republic of ecuador,at citing westmoreland capital findlay,f d,cir,abrogated on other grounds by vaden discover bank.but see in re lines,cir in the bankruptcy setting,congressional intent to permit a bankruptcy court to enjoin arbitration is sufficiently clear to override even international arbitration agreements.video tutorial,mci telecomms,cir per curiam failing to reach the issue but noting that w e would be to say that a district court can not stay arbitration for a short time while familiarizing itself with the issues underlying a proposed motion to stay a suit pending arbitration,or a proposed motion to stay an arbitration.but we find no indication that this issue was contested in the district court proceedings,and it was left unaddressed in both briefing to and oral argument before us.however,it is not one we think we can ignore simply because the parties have not squarely presented it to the court.although it is not a question upon the answer to which our jurisdiction depends,we view it as one we ought to address inasmuch as it implicates the remedial powers of the court,steel citizens for a better env t,emphasis in original,to issue the enforcement order.see aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,cir.in the words of another court,the issue represents a high order challenge 
on the one hand,a realistic concern for the finality and integrity of judgments would arise if parties were free to ignore federal court decisions that have conclusively settled claims or issues now sought to be arbitrated.yet,arbitration is a matter of contract and the faa only authorizes a limited review of the parties intent before compelling or enjoining arbitration.
olick,at internal quotation marks omitted.
while the faa terms explicitly authorize a district court to stay litigation pending arbitration,see,and to compel arbitration,see id,nowhere does it explicitly confer on the judiciary the authority to do what the district court enforcement order purported to do here enjoin a private arbitration.
our decisions do suggest,however,that,at least where the court determines pursuant to the first step outlined in ace capital,at,discussed above that the parties have not entered into a valid and binding arbitration agreement,the court has the authority to enjoin the arbitration proceedings.see united states eberhard,cr,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,w here courts in this circuit have concluded that of the faa permits the issuance of a stay of a private arbitration,they appear to have done so only in those circumstances where a stay would be incidental to the court power under the faa to enforce contractual agreements calling for arbitration.in citigroup global,vcg special opportunities master fund,cir,we affirmed a district court order preliminarily enjoining a finra arbitration from proceeding.id.at.in that case,the district court had serious questions as to whether one party was in fact a customer of a finra member which status,as we observed above,would bind the other party to arbitrate.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we concurred with that assessment,concluding that the customer status of the party was an issue in sharp dispute.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,we doubted the existence of a binding agreement to arbitrate in that case.
we have also affirmed a district court stay of arbitration after determining that the initiation of judicial proceedings in a foreign country constituted a waiver of a plaintiff right to arbitration,see zwitserse maatschappij van levensverzekering en lijfrente abn int l capital mkts,cir per curiam,as we have a stay of arbitration over various claims that we held were not within the scope of an arbitration agreement,even while affirming an order compelling arbitration of related validly arbitrable claims,see collins aikman,at.both of those cases,in addition to citigroup global markets,suggest that a federal court may enjoin an arbitration that the court determines is not otherwise valid.see also satcom int l grp.plc orbcomm int l partners,d,enjoining an arbitration in a case arising under the new york convention,after finding that such arbitration was inappropriate because the plaintiff had waived any right it previously had to arbitrate the issues in th e case.
the first circuit opinion in societe generale de surveillance,raytheon european mgmt,cir,is instructive.there,the court considered a party argument that the faa removes the district court power to enjoin an arbitration.id.at.the court first noted that the faa expressly provides federal courts with the power to order parties to a dispute to proceed to arbitration where arbitration is called for by the contract.id.at citing.it inferred that to enjoin a party from arbitrating where an agreement to arbitrate is absent is the concomitant of the power to compel arbitration where it is present.id.the court concluded that t o allow a federal court to enjoin an arbitration proceeding which is not called for by the contract interferes with neither the letter nor the spirit of the faa.see also painewebber hartmann,cir if a court determines that a valid arbitration agreement does not exist or that the matter at issue clearly falls outside of the substantive scope of the agreement,it is obliged to enjoin arbitration,overruled by implication on other grounds by howsam.
we confirm and apply those principles here.if the parties to this appeal have not consented to arbitrate a claim,the district court was not powerless to prevent one party from foisting upon the other an arbitration process to which the first party had no contractual right.as is clear from the supreme court and this circuit cases,a rbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion.volt,at see also howsam,at a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.internal quotation marks omitted.it makes little sense to us to conclude that district courts lack the authority to order the cessation of an arbitration by parties within its jurisdiction where such authority appears necessary in order for a court to enforce the terms of the parties own agreement,as reflected in a settlement agreement.we decline to do so here 
application to enforcement order 
the supreme court has made clear that t he preeminent concern of congress in passing the faa was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered,and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate,even if the result is piecemeal litigation.dean witter reynolds,byrd,emphasis added see moses cone,at f ederal law requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement.emphasis in original collins aikman,at see also trippe niles audio,cir when a dispute consists of several claims,the court must determine on an basis whether a party bears a duty to arbitrate.it is therefore appropriate for us and the district court to treat the belands released and finra claims differently.
because we have concluded that a district court may properly enjoin arbitration proceedings that are not covered by a valid and binding arbitration agreement,and because we have further determined that no such agreement exists in this case as to the released claims,we find no error in,and therefore affirm,that portion of the district court enforcement order that enjoined the belands finra arbitration as to the released claims.
however,as we have also discussed,the belands finra complaint contains various claims not encompassed by indeed,in certain cases specifically excluded by the release.those claims include claims based on,inter alia,unsuitable investment in technology stocks,misrepresentations and omissions regarding those investments,and claims involving alleged conduct falling outside the class period.because ameriprise consent to arbitrate,even as amended,limited by the settlement agreement,continues to embrace the claims,the district court to that extent only lacked the authority to enjoin the arbitration of the belands finra claims.therefore,we vacate the portion of the enforcement order that purported to enjoin the belands from presenting those claims to the finra arbitrators.we remand this matter to the district court for entry of an appropriately limited order enjoining only the arbitration of the released claims.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm that portion of the district court judgment enjoining the belands from arbitrating their released claims before finra arbitrators,and we vacate that portion of the court judgment enjoining arbitration of any claims.in light of our disposition of this appeal,we dismiss as moot the belands appeal from the district court denial of their motion for reconsideration.we remand for further proceedings.

the belands argue that the finra defendants qualitatively altered their position in the motion to enforce the in re aefa class settlement effect on the belands finra complaint because that document represented the first time that ameriprise had argued that all claims and facts alleged in the illinois arbitration were of the same course of conduct alleged in the new york class action.appellants br.at emphasis in original.the belands also characterize the motion to enforce as misleading because it argued that the belands sought a double recovery despite the fact that they had not received any payments from the class settlement,and because it did not indicate that the finra panel had denied the finra defendants motion to stay.id.internal quotation marks omitted.

on the other hand,procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.howsam,at emphasis in original quoting john wiley sons,livingston.likewise,the presumption is that the arbitrator should decide allegation s of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.id.alteration in original quoting moses cone,at.
