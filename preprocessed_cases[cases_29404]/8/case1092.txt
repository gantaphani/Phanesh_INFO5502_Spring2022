background 
the relevant facts in this appeal are not in dispute.on june,phillips responded to a complaint of fireworks being discharged in spak neighborhood.when he arrived to investigate,he observed spak burning the remnants of fireworks in a backyard fire pit,in what phillips perceived as an attempt to destroy evidence.the following day,phillips submitted a sworn affidavit to the connecticut superior court seeking a warrant to arrest spak on,inter alia,charges of tampering with or fabricating evidence.based on phillips sworn statement,the connecticut superior court issued a warrant for spak arrest on june,and based on that warrant spak was arrested on june.on september,the prosecuting attorney unilaterally dismissed the charges against spak by entering a nolle prosequi.a nolle prosequi is a declaration of the prosecuting officer that he will not prosecute further at that time upon the entering of a nolle prosequi by the state attorney,there is no case.state winer,quoting state ackerman.supp.the state never instituted further charges against spak subsequent to the nolle stemming from the june,incident.
on october,spak sued phillips in connecticut state court for malicious prosecution under section and the fourth amendment.phillips removed the action to the district of connecticut on november.on january,phillips moved for summary judgment on several grounds,including that spak action was untimely because he filed his complaint more than three years after the accrual of his claim.on october,the district court granted phillips motion for summary judgment on that ground.specifically,the district court held that spak malicious prosecution claim accrued on september,when the charges against him were nolled,and therefore dismissed the suit as.spak now appeals.

a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.gallo prudential residential,cir.all legal conclusions by a district court are reviewed de novo.united states livecchi,cir.per curiam.
on appeal,it is uncontested that spak filed his complaint alleging malicious prosecution more than three years after the state attorney entry of a nolle prosequi.spak concedes that if his claim for malicious prosecution accrued on the date that the state attorney nolled the charges against him,his suit is untimely.however,he argues that his claim did not accrue on the date that the charges against him were nolled,but thirteen months later when connecticut law mandated that the records of his nolled prosecution be erased.
accrual of section claims 
in the absence of federal common law,the merits of a claim for malicious prosecution under section are governed by state law.janetka dabe,cir.likewise,the applicable statute of limitations for a malicious prosecution claim is borrowed from the statute of limitations for the analogous claim under the law of the state where the cause of action accrued,see lounsbury jeffries,cir.see also wallace kato,which in connecticut is three years,see walker jastremski,cir.
however,the time at which a claim for malicious prosecution under section accrues is a question of federal law that is not resolved by reference to state law.wallace,at.federal courts apply general tort principles to determine the accrual date of a section claim.see also manuel,at in defining the contours and prerequisites of a claim,including its rule of accrual,courts are to look first to the common law of torts.in malicious prosecution suits under section,the statute of limitations begins to run when the prosecution terminate s in the plaintiff favor.poventud city of,cir.en banc quoting heck humphrey.a favorable termination does not occur until the prosecution against the plaintiff has conclusively ended.murphy lynn,cir.
one point of clarification regarding this accrual rule is in order.the fact that the accrual of section claims is analyzed under federal common law,while the merits of those claims are analyzed under the law of the state where the tort occurred,has led to some confusion concerning the standards used to define a favorable termination in the malicious prosecution context.this is because a malicious prosecution claim accrues when the underlying prosecution terminates in favor of the accused,but favorable termination is also a substantive element of a state law tort claim,see,singleton city of new york,cir.while the same phrase favorable termination is used in both the accrual analysis and the merits analysis of a section suit,it is analyzed under a different legal standard in each context.
when the question before a federal court is at what point a malicious prosecution claim accrued,favorable termination is analyzed under federal common law,because the timing of accrual is a question of federal law.see,wallace,at.when,by contrast,a federal court is analyzing the substantive merits of a plaintiff claim,the definition of favorable termination is analyzed under state law.see,singleton,at.what constitutes a favorable termination may turn out to be the same in each context,but not necessarily so.however,even if favorable termination in a particular case is unclear as a matter of state law,it can still be conclusively resolved as a matter of claim accrual under federal law.thus,the fact that a nolle prosequi constitutes a favorable termination under connecticut state law may be relevant to our accrual inquiry,but it is not dispositive.unless a nolle also constitutes a favorable termination under federal common law,then spak claim did not accrue for section purposes upon entry of the nolle.
ii.effect of a nolle prosequi 
under connecticut law,a prosecutor may decline to prosecute a case by entering a nolle prosequi.practice book.the effect of a nolle is to terminate a particular prosecution against the defendant.however,a nolle prosequi is not the equivalent of a dismissal of a criminal prosecution with prejudice,because jeopardy does not attach.roberts babkiewic
