plaintiffs sidney and johanna olmsted appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nicholas garaufis,judge granting the defendants.b motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated f and i of the investment company act of,et.supp the ica,by imposing upon the plaintiffs,who are holders of certain variable annuity contracts,fees,charges,and expenses that are excessive and unreasonable in relation to the services provided,the expenses to be incurred,and the risks assumed.we affirm the judgment of the district court because we agree with its conclusion that congress did not intend to create a private right of action for violations of f and i.
background 
the plaintiffs are holders of variable annuity insurance contracts issued by the defendants.compl.such contracts combine features of a mutual fund and a life insurance policy.a contract holder makes periodic payments into an account maintained by the issuer and consisting of various investments,such as mutual funds,selected by the holder.compl.the holder continues to make payments until a maturity date,at which time he or she receives a payout in the form of either a payment or a lifetime annuity.the contracts are variable because payouts depend on the market performance of the investments in the holder account,as contrasted with the fixed payout of a traditional insurance policy.
the plaintiffs contracts also include a feature called a death benefit.compl.under it,a holder who dies before the maturity date receives from the issuer a payment equal to the greater of a the value of the assets in the holder investment account,and b the sum of the amounts of the holder periodic payments before his or her death.id.
the defendants identify three risks they assume in issuing the contracts.first,they assert that they assume a risk under the death benefit that they might be required to cover for a decline in the value of the contract holder investments.second,they aver that they assume a mortality risk,in that a contract holder might select the lifetime annuity payout option and then live longer than expected.third,they allege that they assume an expense risk,in that the expenses associated with administering the contracts might exceed the fixed annual expense charge.for these asserted risks assumed and other services provided,the defendants total annual compensation under the contracts is of the assets in each contract holder account 
on march,the plaintiffs brought a class action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on behalf of all persons who purchased variable annuity contracts from the defendants on or after march.compl.the complaint alleges that the defendants have violated f and i of the ica because the fees they charge on their variable annuity contracts are excessive and unreasonable in relation to the services provided,the expenses to be incurred and risks assumed id.on october,the district court granted the defendants motion under.b to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint.olmsted pruco life ins.of new jersey,d.in a thorough and opinion,judge garaufis concluded that the ica does not provide a private right of action for violations of f and i and that the plaintiffs complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.id.
the plaintiffs appealed,asserting that the district court erred in concluding that the ica does not provide a private right of action for violations of f and i.the defendants argue that the district court was correct and that the plaintiffs complaint also should be dismissed i as,ii for failure to allege sufficient facts,and iii as barred by the doctrine.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under fed civ.b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.kalnit eichler,cir.
ii.congressional intent 
the supreme court has established that courts must look to the intent of congress in determining whether a federal private right of action exists for violations of a federal statute.like substantive federal law itself,private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress.alexander sandoval,d.without congressional intent,a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one,no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter,or how compatible with the statute.id.at.
determining congressional intent to create a right of action is therefore a matter of statutory interpretation.id.at.statutory intent is determinative.a court must begin its search for congress intent with the text and structure of the statute,id.at,and can not ordinarily conclude that congress intended to create a right of action when none was explicitly provided.see,touche ross redington,d i mplying a private right of action on the basis of congressional silence is a hazardous enterprise,at best.west allis mem l hosp.bowen,cir a strong presumption exists against the creation of implied rights of action.
no provision of the ica explicitly provides for a private right of action for violations of either f or i,and so we must presume that congress did not intend one.this presumption is strengthened by three additional features of the statute.
first,f and i do not contain language.section f provides 
it shall be unlawful for any account funding variable insurance contracts,or for the sponsoring insurance company of such account,to sell any such contract 
a unless the fees and charges deducted under the contract,in the aggregate,are reasonable 
f.and i provides 
it shall be unlawful for any account funding variable insurance contracts,or for the sponsoring insurance company of such account,to sell any such contract unless 
b the insurance company complies with section f of this title and any rules or regulations issued by the commission under section f of this title.
i.the language of these sections only describes actions by insurance companies that are prohibited it does not mention investors such as the plaintiffs.statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.sandoval,at.quoting california sierra club,d.
second,of the ica explicitly provides for enforcement of all ica provisions,including f and i,by the securities and exchange commission sec through investigations and civil suits for injunctions and penalties.see.in sandoval,the supreme court observed that 
the express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others sometimes the suggestion is so strong that it precludes a finding of congressional intent to create a private right of action,even though other aspects of the statute suggest the contrary.
at.internal citations omitted.
third,congress explicitly provided in b of the ica for a private right of derivative action for investors in regulated investment companies alleging that investment advisors breached certain fiduciary duties.b.congress explicit provision of a private right of action to enforce one section of a statute suggests that omission of an explicit private right to enforce other sections was intentional.obviously when congress wished to provide a private damage remedy,it knew how to do so and did so expressly.touche ross,at.
we therefore conclude that the ica text creates a strong presumption that congress did not intend to create private rights of action for violations of f and i.
iii.other factors in the analysis 
a strong presumption that congress did not intend a private right of action places a heavy burden on the plaintiffs to demonstrate otherwise.see victorian miller,cir to establish an implied private right of action under a federal statute,a plaintiff bears the relatively heavy burden of demonstrating that congress affirmatively contemplated private enforcement when it passed the relevant statute.the plaintiffs raise a series of arguments in
