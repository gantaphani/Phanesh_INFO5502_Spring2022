societe des hotels meridien and several related parties meridien appeal the dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b of their lanham act claims alleging false advertising and unfair competition through reverse palming off,see a a,b,as well as their supplemental state law claims.the claims had been asserted against starwood hotels resorts worldwide,starwood and lasalle hotel operating partnership,and related parties lasalle.because we find that meridien stated claims under the lanham act,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
the dispute that led to this litigation centers on several hotel directories circulated in early by starwood,which manages hotels under the westin name,among others.the directories contained pictures of two hotels in dallas and new orleans that were respectively identified in the directories as the westin city center,dallas and the westin new orleans.the pictures contained no identification,but did include descriptions of amenities,services,and features.the directories also listed the telephone numbers for the hotels.
the inclusion of the hotels in starwood directories had its roots in a dispute between meridien and lasalle.meridien and lasalle were parties to leases under which meridien operated properties in new orleans and dallas.both leases ran from february to april.the agreements contained change of ownership provisions giving lasalle the option to buy out meridien leasehold interest in the properties at fair market value if there was a change of ownership of meridien.meridien sale of its hotel management business in triggered the option,which was then exercised by lasalle.when meridien allegedly defaulted under the leases by failing to accommodate the purchase,lasalle terminated them in early and pursued arrangements it had made with starwood to manage the dallas and new orleans hotels as westin hotels.meridien then filed a demand for arbitration and lasalle sued in state court in new orleans,louisiana the new orleans action.meridien subsequently commenced an action in state court in dallas,texas,which was consolidated with another action later filed in texas state court by lasalle the dallas action.
in february,the trial court in the new orleans action granted meridien motion for a preliminary injunction pending arbitration of the lease dispute and stayed lasalle efforts to appoint westin as the new manager of the new orleans hotel.in may,the trial court in the dallas action upheld lasalle termination effective february of the dallas lease and concluded that meridien no longer had the right to occupy the hotel.lasalle subsequent attempt to evict meridien from the dallas property on the basis of this ruling temporarily failed on procedural grounds,and,as a consequence,meridien continued to manage the property during the period when meridien was losing in the state court litigation but had not actually been evicted,starwood began to circulate its hotel directory prominently featuring the hotels but identifying them as westin rather than meridien properties.
ii.procedural history and the district court decision 
in august,meridien commenced this action in the southern district of new york.meridien alleged lanham act and state law violations by starwood and lasalle,and sought a preliminary injunction preventing them from distributing publications that infringed its trademarks by describing the hotel properties as being a part of the starwood group.the district court denied this relief,concluding that meridien had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its lanham act claims because it had failed to establish customer confusion under the eight factors delineated in polaroid polarad elecs,cir.see societe des hotels meridien lasalle hotel operating,civ.jsm,wl at,dist.lexis,at,meridien i.the court also determined that meridien false advertising claim under the lanham act was unlikely to succeed on the merits because neither starwood nor lasalle had made statements that were literally false given that the legal status of meridien as the operator of the hotels was in dispute when the directories were distributed.see id.wl at,at citing johnson johnson merck consumer pharms.smithkline beecham,cir.
subsequently,meridien amended its complaint to assert direct lanham act claims for reverse palming off and false advertising against starwood,contributory claims against lasalle,as well as claims for common law unfair competition against both.starwood and lasalle then moved pursuant to rule b to dismiss the amended complaint and the court granted the motion.see societe des hotels meridien lasalle hotel operating,civ.jsm,wl at,dist.lexis,at,meridien ii.the court dismissed the reverse palming off claims because it concluded that starwood publication of the directories with photos of hotels created only a small likelihood of confusion.it found that any such confusion would,in any event,benefit meridien and not starwood since meridien would reap the benefits of any sales generated by these directories.id.wl at,at.the court further dismissed the false advertising claims because it found nothing in the directories that disparag es the quality of a competitor product.id.wl,at.finally,it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.id.meridien appealed and we reverse.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review dismissals under rule b de novo.in so doing,we accept all of plaintiff factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.courtenay communications hall,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
meridien standing 
as an initial matter,appellants challenge meridien standing.to establish standing for a false advertising claim under section a of the lanham act,the aggrieved party must demonstrate a reasonable interest to be protected against the advertiser false or misleading claims,and a reasonable basis for believing that this interest is likely to be damaged by the false or misleading advertising.ortho pharm.cosprophar,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the likelihood of injury and causation will not be presumed,but must be demonstrated in some manner.tropicana,cir,abrogated on other grounds by.a.however,the type and quantity of proof we have required to show injury and causation has varied from case to case.generally,we have tended to require a more substantial showing where the plaintiff products are not obviously in competition with the defendant products,or the defendant advertisements do not draw direct comparisons between the products.ortho pharm,at.
in its amended complaint,meridien alleges that starwood actions were positioned to cause the maximum amount of harm to plaintiffs,compl,and that defendants wrongful acts have caused and will continue to cause customer confusion and injury to plaintiffs,including without limitation,irreparable harm to plaintiffs brand,goodwill and reputation,destabilization of the workforce at both the meridien new orleans hotel and the meridien dallas hotel,and the loss of business.id.see also id,same.
appellants contend that these allegations lack the specificity required to establish standing.we disagree.we have consistently held that where the defendant has drawn a direct comparison between its own product and that of the plaintiff,we are inclined,without much more,to find standing to bring lanham act claims.see mcneilab,am.home prods,cir holding that injury can be presumed,for purposes of obtaining a preliminary injunction,in a lanham act claim for false comparative advertising.
here,the parties are direct competitors.we are satisfied that starwood,in publishing its directories,has drawn a direct comparison between its product and that of meridien.meridien alleges,in essence,that starwood is using meridien product to sell its own competing product by creating a false affiliation between the two chains and benefitting from the goodwill associated with the meridien chain.on these allegations,we conclude that meridien has demonstrated a reasonable basis for asserting that this conduct might cause it commercial injury under the lanham a
