robert riedinger appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york hurley,denying his claim for participation in a class action settlement on the ground that he held the wrong type of common stock.because we conclude that the district court erred in interpreting provisions of the settlement agreement governing eligibility for participation,we reverse and remand.
background 
elliott waldman the trustee,as trustee for his pension plan and on behalf of other stockholders of the olsten corporation olsten,a delaware corporation,commenced a class action against olsten and several of its officers and directors,claiming that they violated federal securities laws through a series of misstatements and omissions that artificially inflated the market price of olsten stock in august,the district court approved a million settlement and,at the same time,certified a class consisting of all persons and entities that purchased shares of common stock of olsten corporation olsten from february,through july,inclusive the class period.certain categories of stockholders were excluded,namely,the defendants,their affiliates,subsidiaries,members of their immediate families,and their successors and assigns.the district court drew its definition of the class from the stipulation of settlement settlement agreement or agreement signed by the parties to the underlying litigation.the settlement agreement drew no distinction between olsten two classes of common stock common stock and class b common stock.pursuant to the agreement,a claims administrator mailed notices of the settlement and proofs of claim to members of the class.
in october,riedinger received,unsolicited,the notice and a blank proof of claim,which he completed and returned.his claim indicated that he had acquired shares of olsten class b common stock within the class period.riedinger,who is the nephew of olsten founder,william olsten,had acquired these shares in when olsten purchased riedinger franchise,olsten of georgia,in exchange for the shares.the stock was purchased at about per share,making the shares worth more than million at the time of closing within weeks of the closing,the price of olsten stock began to fall precipitously.by december,riedinger stock was allegedly worth less than half its original value.he alleges that this decline financially devastated him and was due to the gross acts of fraud by defendants that were the subject of the underlying litigation.br.of at.
the claims administrator denied olsten claim on the ground that the term common stock,as used in the settlement,referred only to olsten common stock,not to class b common stock.olsten certificate of incorporation provides for two classes of common equity securities common stock and class b common stock.the common stock was publicly traded and voted on a basis.by contrast,the class b common stock had no established public trading market,was restricted stock,and was entitled to ten votes per share.because riedinger was a holder of class b common stock,the claims administrator concluded that he was not a member of the class and disallowed his claim.riedinger sought relief from the district court.
after considering the common stock question,as well as whether riedinger was an affiliate of the defendants,the district court found that because the settlement agreement,which referred only to common stock,fail ed to differentiate the two types of common stock,the district court could not conclude that the settlement agreement excludes recovery by owners of class b common stock.the district court also noted that the settlement agreement did not define the term affiliate and requested further briefing on the issue.
after receiving additional briefing,on april,the district court denied riedinger claim on both grounds.first,the district court reversed its previous conclusion that riedinger owned common stock,noting that the trustee had submitted,unprompted,new evidence regarding the distinction between common stock and class b common stock,which demonstrated that the term common stock,as it was utilized in the settlement agreement,did not include class b common stock.the district court concluded that the consistent usage of the terms common stock,in contrast with class b common stock,in olsten certificate of incorporation,proxy statements,and sec filings the corporate documents trump ed the dictionary definition urged by riedinger.
second,the district court found that riedinger was an affiliate within the meaning of the settlement agreement.the district court relied on the definition of affiliate under the securities act of the act and the securities exchange act of the act,both of which look to whether the person in question exercises control over a party who is alleged to have committed securities fraud.see et et a.the district court concluded that riedinger controls or is controlled by one of the defendants because he was a trustee of four trusts,which together contained more than five million shares of class b common stock.the trusts had been established by the will of riedinger late uncle,william olsten,for the benefit of his wife defendant miriam olsten,a director of olsten,his son defendant stuart olsten,a director,and the president of olsten,his daughter,and descendants.william olsten died in,and each trust,with the exception of the descendants,was assigned three trustees,one of whom was riedinger the district court held that because,as one of the trustees,riedinger shared in voting and investment power of olsten stock with defendants miriam and stuart olsten,he possessed control within the meaning of the sec regulations.the district court also noted that on august,riedinger had signed a voting agreement with the individual defendants and others to effectuate a merger between olsten and adecco.through this agreement,the district court said,riedinger actually exercised control.accordingly,the district court denied his claim.
this appeal ensued.

common stock 
riedinger argues that the district court erred in concluding,based on olsten corporate documents,that the settlement agreement reference to common stock excluded holders of class b common stock.he contends that it was error to look beyond the plain meaning of the term common stock when that term is unambiguous.we agree.
