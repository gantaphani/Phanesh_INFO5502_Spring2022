julio cesar valenzuela grullon valenzuela petitions for review of an order of immigration judge ij john opaciuch denying his application for cancellation of removal.valenzuela,who failed to appeal the order of removal to the board of immigration appeals bia,concedes that his administrative remedies are therefore unexhausted,but asks that the failure to exhaust be excused and that we reach the merits of his petition.we hold that the exhaustion requirement applicable to valenzuela petition,d,is statutory and jurisdictional.further,we conclude that the jurisdictional defect can not be excused on a ground of manifest injustice.contra marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir.
on december,valenzuela was admitted as a lawful permanent resident from his native dominican republic.in december,he was indicted in new york on a series of drug offenses,and pled to a single count in february.he was sentenced to a term of three years to life in prison.
one month before his october release on parole,the ins charged valenzuela with violating a law related to a controlled substance.see a b i upon his parole,valenzuela was detained by the ins.in december,he filed a petition for habeas corpus in the southern district of new york,arguing that detention without bond prior to his removal proceedings was unconstitutional.the district court griesa,granted the petition on december,and valenzuela was released.the government appeal of that ruling became moot when valenzuela removal proceedings were completed we therefore vacated the district court order 
throughout his removal proceedings,conducted in the spring of,valenzuela conceded removability but sought cancellation of removal.in order to establish that he has continuously resided in the for seven prerequisite to cancellation of removal,see a valenzuela would have had to overcome the rule,which provides that any period of continuous residence shall be deemed to end when the alien has committed an offense that renders the alien inadmissible to the united states.d b.valenzuela argued that the rule does not terminate a period of continuous residence until the alien is convicted of the removable consequential distinction for valenzuela because he pled guilty a few months after the december expiration of the period,whereas the indictment alleged that the offense was committed on or about august,
the bia had already rejected valenzuela proposed reading at the time of his hearing before the ij,see in re perez,bia decision in banc,but valenzuela urged the ij to follow the reasoning of the perez dissent.
the ij denied relief in august rather than appeal to the bia,valenzuela filed a second habeas petition in october to challenge the order of removal.this habeas petition was pending in the southern district of new york when the real id act of,stat,took effect on may.pursuant to section c of that act,the district court ordered the habeas corpus petition transferred to this court,where it was docketed as a petition for review.
valenzuela concedes his failure to exhaust administrative remedies before petitioning this court for review,but he contends that any failure to exhaust should be excused because appeal to the bia would have been futile,his appeal raises constitutional claims,and dismissing his petition would cause a manifest injustice.on the merits,valenzuela argues that the rule is ambiguous as to whether continuous residence is terminated by commission of an offense or by conviction,and that the perez dissent correctly concluded that the trigger is conviction.
the government urges us to dismiss the petition for review on exhaustion grounds because valenzuela never appealed to the bia.on the merits,the government defends the bia interpretation of the rule in perez as consistent with the plain language of the statute and argues that valenzuela is therefore barred from applying for cancellation of removal.
when the real id act of,stat,became effective,valenzuela second habeas petition challenging his order of removal,then pending in the southern district of new york,was transferred to this court and converted into a petition for review 
if an alien case,brought under section of title,united states code,and challenging a final administrative order of removal is pending in a district court on the date of the enactment of this division,then the district court shall transfer the case to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed 
c,stat.at see also ins,cir.the real id act speaks generally to the manner in which converted petitions are to be treated upon transfer here 
the court of appeals shall treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section,except that subsection b of such section shall not apply.
c,stat.at.in other words,converted petitions are to be treated as ordinary petitions for review in all respects except as to the filing deadline b.
the question,then,is whether valenzuela converted petition is governed by d a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right,or whether the sole exhaustion rule valenzuela violated is a judicial rule,which is discretionary and includes a number of exceptions,beharry ashcroft,cir.
we have not had occasion to decide whether d requires that aliens appeal to the bia before petitioning this court for review.but our jurisprudence makes that supposition.for example,we dismissed a habeas appeal in a case that had never been before the bia,holding that the limitations imposed by d on a court ability to review final orders of deportation extend ed to habeas corpus review.theodoropoulos ins,cir see also lin zhong dep t of justice,cir w e have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal entered against lin,so long as a decision has been rendered on his application by an ij and appealed to the two administrative remedies available to him as of right.marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir we therefore hold that,notwithstanding a habeas petitioner failure to exhaust his claims before the bia,as required by section d,we nonetheless have jurisdiction to consider the petitioner claim if it is necessary to avoid manifest injustice.emphasis added.
squarely presented with the issue for the first time in this appeal,we hold that the exhaustion provision of d requires aliens,inter alia,to appeal to the bia before petitioning for review in this court.
the next question is whether the statutory exhaustion requirement of d that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him as of jurisdictional or merely mandatory.see lin zhong,at.mandatory requirements we have said are subject to waiver,and are therefore less absolute than jurisdictional requirements.
in lin zhong,at,we distinguished between jurisdictional and mandatory rules,partly by resort to the supreme court caveat that 
c larity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.
eberhart united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.subsequent to lin zhong,the supreme court sharpened the analysis.in bowles russell,d,the court held that a limit on extensions of time to appeal,see c,was jurisdictional largely because of the fact that the time limitation is set forth in a statute.bowles.at.the court explained 
because congress decides whether federal courts can hear cases at all,it can also determine when,and under what conditions,federal courts can hear them.put another way,the notion of jurisdiction obviously extends to classes of cases falling within a court adjudicatory authority,but it is no less jurisdictional when congress forbids federal courts from adjudicating an otherwise legitimate class of cases after a certain period has elapsed from final judgment.
