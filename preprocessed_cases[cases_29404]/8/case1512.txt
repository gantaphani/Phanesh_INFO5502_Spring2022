george chavis brought suit in the united states district court for the western district of new york,claiming,inter alia,that he had been beaten and denied medical treatment by staff members and officials of southport correctional facility southport,where he was incarcerated.chavis sought leave to proceed in forma pauperis ifp under.the district court elfvin,denied chavis motion,holding that chavis had three strikes under g and had failed to allege an imminent danger of serious physical injury.the court gave chavis an opportunity to pay the filing fee,on pain of dismissal.rather than pay the filing fee,chavis filed a motion for leave to amend his complaint,making new allegations of threats and intimidation by southport personnel subsequently,he filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order,claiming that the threats had been repeated on numerous occasions.the district court siragusa,construed chavis filings as a motion for reconsideration,denied the motion,and dismissed the complaint.
on appeal,chavis argues that the district court miscounted his prior strikes,attributing two strikes to one case in which both chavis complaint and his subsequent appeal therefrom were dismissed as frivolous erred in finding that his original complaint did not allege imminent danger of serious physical injury and abused its discretion in denying leave to amend.we disagree with chavis first a previously open question in this hold that an incarcerated plaintiff incurs two strikes when a complaint and a subsequent appeal are independently dismissed for grounds listed in g.but we agree that the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend,and therefore remand.because chavis complaint as supplemented by the facts added in his motions might well satisfy the imminent danger standard,we need not decide whether his original complaint would similarly have sufficed.accordingly,we vacate and remand to the district court to allow amendment.
background 
proceedings in the district court 
on august,george chavis filed a pro se complaint against more than three dozen staff members and officials of southport correctional facility collectively,defendants,where he was then incarcerated alleging that the defendants had committed a wide variety of wrongs,he sought relief under and the first,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.for present purposes,the only relevant allegations are those in which chavis describes physical injury,threats of violence,and deprivation of medical treatment.he claimed that eight officers severely beat him on july,in retaliation for his filing grievances alleging prior misconduct by prison officials.this attack came shortly after chavis received a threat of physical abuse he also asserted that a similar assault took place a year earlier,on august.
chavis also alleged that,from november or december to may,he was denied treatment for hepatitis b along with other needed medications,supplements,and medically issued clothing.later in his complaint,he stated that o n numerous separate dates from this present date of civil suit activation dating back nearly eight to ten months a medical staff member named walsh had denied emergency medical needs and prescription refills needs sic,which allegedly resulted in extreme cruel and unusual punishment and further an atypical and significant hardship.
along with his complaint,chavis sought leave to proceed ifp pursuant to a.in an order docketed on october,the district court elfvin,denied chavis motion.under g,a prisoner is barred from proceeding ifp if he or she has on three or more prior occasions brought an action or appeal that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous,malicious,or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.the district court found that plaintiff had three such strikes chavis charnes,july,a complaint dismissed by the district court because it lacked an arguable basis in law or fact the subsequent appeal in charnes,which was dismissed by the second circuit as frivolous,see cir,and chavis cunningham,cir,in which the second circuit dismissed as frivolous an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in defendants favor the district court also found that none of the complaint wholly conclusory allegations rise to the level of imminent danger of serious physical injury.accordingly,the district court held that the complaint must be dismissed unless plaintiff paid the filing fee by november.
on november,chavis responded by filing a motion for leave to amend,emphasizing that he was in fact in imminent danger of physical injury.although he did not assert other violent incidents,he claimed,inter alia,that one of the officers involved in the july beating had visit ed plaintiff new cell verbally threatening to assault plaintiff again and that another had visit ed plaintiff cell for intimidation reasons.subsequently,on february,chavis filed a motion seeking an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.in his motion,chavis claimed repeated verbal threats of by defendants without cease,citing to four newly filed grievances and nearly a dozen more dated in this new year of.
on may,the district court siragusa,denied both motions and ordered the complaint dismissed.despite chavis explicit statement that he was not filing a motion for reconsideration,the district court viewed the motion to amend as in substance a motion to reconsider the october,order,because most of the motion attempted to distinguish the case from a second circuit case upon which the district court relied in concluding that the imminent danger exception did not apply.considering the motion as such,the district court found no reason to reexamine the october order and therefore nied the motion to amend and dismissed the complaint for failure to pay the filing fee the motion for a preliminary injunction was therefore deemed moot and hence appropriately dismissed.
arguments on appeal 
chavis timely appealed.the second circuit granted chavis leave to proceed ifp and appointed counsel,directing counsel to address whether each case the district court cited as a strike was actually dismissed as frivolous,malicious,or for failure to state a claim and if a district court case that is a strike and an appeal therefrom that is also a strike should be counted as one or two strikes.chavis concedes that the three cases on which the district court principally relied were dismissed on grounds listed in g,but argues that they only count as two strikes,because a district court dismissal of a complaint and a circuit court dismissal of an appeal in the same action are sequential proceedings in a single case and therefore are part of one action for purposes of g.as a result,chavis argues,he had only two strikes at the time of filing and was not barred from proceeding ifp.additionally,chavis contends a that the district court erred in concluding that his complaint did not allege an imminent danger of serious physical injury,and b that it abused its discretion in denying leave to file an amended complaint.
because defendants were never served,they are not parties to this appeal.in their stead,the state of new york the state filed an amicus brief to address the issue of whether the dismissals of a district court case and an appeal therefrom count as one or two strikes.the state argues that g treats the dismissal of suits and of their appeals as separate strikes.the amicus brief does not address the other issues raised in chavis appeal whether chavis alleged an imminent danger and whether his motion to amend was properly denied.
