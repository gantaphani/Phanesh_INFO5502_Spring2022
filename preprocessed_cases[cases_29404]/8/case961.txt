this case involves the power of a district court,after a settled case has been voluntarily dismissed under.a ii,to police the settlement through summary enforcement proceedings.we hold that a district court does not retain supplemental enforcement jurisdiction over a settlement after granting a rule a ii motion unless the parties either have agreed to incorporate the terms of the settlement into the dismissal order or have executed a stipulation authorizing the court to retain jurisdiction over the implementation of the settlement.because the record reflects no such agreement here,we affirm the order denying a writ of execution designed to enforce summarily a settlement reached many years ago by and between the parties.
the origins of this dispute go back more than three and decades.on august,the municipality of san juan the municipality and the department of health of the commonwealth of puerto rico the department entered into a contract relative to the allocation of federal medicaid dollars as medicaid funding increased,the parties periodically redefined the terms of their relationship.over time,the payments to the municipality rose dramatically.
in or around,the parties reached an impasse over how to allocate federal medicaid funds.on may,the municipality initiated an action against the department in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,claiming that the department was in violation of the medicaid act and in breach of contract.the case was assigned to judge fusté.
in short order,the parties reached an accord.the settlement agreement provided the municipality with certain medicaid funds for the fiscal years and.it also established a formula by which the parties could adjust the payments if congress increased puerto rico medicaid allotment for that fiscal year.
on august,the parties informed judge fusté of the settlement.at a chambers conference,the parties and the court discussed how the pending action would be terminated.the municipality told judge fusté that it was contemplating a motion for voluntary dismissal.the judge voiced no disapproval but suggested that the parties proffer a copy of the settlement agreement under seal and stipulate to the entry of judgment.although the municipality embraced this suggestion,the department balked.at that point,judge fusté washed his hands of the matter he stated that how to terminate the case was up to the parties,and the conference ended on that note.
later that day,the parties submitted two documents to the district court.the be placed under the terms of the settlement.the second was a motion for voluntary dismissal.the judge,on his own initiative,entered an order memorializing the basis for the court jurisdiction over the dispute,the fact of the settlement,and the court intention to enter judgment in favor of the municipality.in that order,the court expressed its opinion that both parties need the protection of a judgment on a matter of public interest and concern.the court then proceeded to enter a judgment for the municipality against the department,incorporating in the judgment the terms of the settlement agreement.both the order and the judgment were promulgated on august.
the department promptly moved to vacate these filings,arguing that it had never agreed to the entry of an adverse judgment.on november,the district court vacated both the order and the judgment,entering in lieu thereof an amended order and judgment.the amended order recited that the case had been settled,approved the settlement without elaborating upon its terms,and granted the motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to rule a.the text went on to remind the parties that the district court had inherent power to enforce settlement agreements and expressed the view that,notwithstanding the voluntary dismissal,the district court retained jurisdiction over the case the amended judgment dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to rule a.although it incorporated by reference the terms of the amended order,it made no direct reference to the settlement agreement.
despite these revisions,the department feared that the district court editorial comments about the retention of jurisdiction exposed it to summary enforcement proceedings should the municipality claim,in the future,that the department had not lived up to the terms of the settlement.to set this poltergeist to rest,the department appealed.we clarified,and then affirmed,the amended order and judgment in an unpublished opinion.municipality of san juan izquierdo mora,slip op.cir.may,per curiam.we characterized the amended judgment as a straightforward dismissal pursuant to rule a ii and held that it did not operate to incorporate by reference the settlement agreement.id.at.in the same vein,we treated the district court references to its inherent enforcement powers as mere dicta and ruled that,since the action had been dismissed,there was no warrant to review the dicta.id.to cinch matters,we emphasized that any suggestion that the dicta could be enforced via the district court contempt power was farfetched and without basis.id.
for nearly fourteen years,the dismissed action remained dormant.but this proved to be the calm before the storm.on march,the municipality,alleging that the settlement agreement had served as the foundation for the allocation of medicaid disbursements during the intervening years and that the department had unilaterally cut off the flow of funds with the result that the department owed it some,filed a motion asking the district court to enforce the settlement agreement the district court initially granted this motion and issued an ex parte order of execution.the department quickly obtained a stay.after considerable details of which are unimportant for present fusté reversed direction,vacated the order of execution,referred to our earlier unpublished opinion,and denied the municipality motion for summary enforcement.he subsequently rejected the municipality request for reconsideration.
displeased by this turn of events,the municipality sought a writ of mandamus directing the district court to reinstate its original ex parte order.we treated that petition as a notice of appeal.following full briefing,we heard oral argument on january.
the municipality appeal rests on two pillars.first,the municipality contends that the settlement agreement applies beyond the fiscal year up to the present time.second,it posits that the district court retained jurisdiction over that agreement,thus making summary enforcement proceedings appropriate.but stating the arguments in this order puts the cart before the horse the district court jurisdiction to conduct a summary enforcement proceeding must be examined before we can undertake an inquiry into the merits of the case.see steel citizens for a better env t,d collecting cases berner delahanty,cir.we turn,therefore,to the jurisdictional issue.
we begin our analysis by rehearsing the familiar law of the case doctrine.that doctrine has two components 
one branch involves the mandate rule which,with only a few exceptions,forbids,among other things,a lower court from relitigating issues that were decided by a higher court,whether explicitly or by reasonable implication,at an earlier stage of the same case.the other branch provides that unless corrected by an appellate tribunal,a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case constitutes the law of the case throughout the pendency of the litigation.
