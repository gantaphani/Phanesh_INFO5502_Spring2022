attorneys represent clients.a familiar incident of this relationship is that an attorney actions within the scope of her representation normally bind her clients.a corollary of this proposition is the sad fact but the fact nonetheless that the sins of the attorney are sometimes visited upon the client.this is such a case.
the facts are easily assembled.in march of,ramiro rivera velázquez,then years old,applied for a job as a boiler inspector with hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company the company.on may,the company extended a written offer of employment,which the appellant accepted.before he started on the job,however,the company rescinded the offer.
distressed by this turn of events,the appellant sought legal recourse he sued the company in a puerto rico court his complaint alleged,inter alia,that rescission of the employment offer was a of age discrimination and,thus,violated puerto rico law.see laws ann.tit,law.the company,seizing upon the existence of both diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in controversy,removed the case to the federal district court.see a,a.
over the next year,the appellant attorneys blundered time and again.for one thing,no fewer than three of the company motions were deemed unopposed due to the appellant failure to respond.for another thing,the appellant attorneys were thrice chastised by the district court and threatened with sanctions for failure to comply with court orders discovery requests.on yet another occasion,the court imposed a monetary sanction for the inclusion,in an amended complaint,of claims that the appellant had previously promised to drop.
this sorry series of sophomoric stumbles sets the stage for what happened next.on september,the company filed its portion of a previously ordered joint pretrial submission.the appellant failed to furnish his portion of the joint submission within the time allotted.the district court responded to this default by issuing a stern minute order.using red font for emphasis,the court denounced the appellant litigation strategy and warned that t he next sanction imposed for failure to obey a court order shall be the dismissal of the appellant complaint.the court then gave the appellant one week to show cause why his case should not be dismissed.
the appellant made no discernible effort to set matters straight but,instead,ignored the order.he neither proffered his overdue portion of the joint submission nor attempted to explain his repeated failures to comply with court orders and deadlines.true to its word,the district court proceeded to dismiss the case with prejudice.the appellant did not appeal this order.he did,however,eventually file a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
this motion beseeched the court to set aside the judgment.it explained that one of the appellant attorneys had been ill for several months that this illness had caused her to neglect the case and that this neglect had led to the repeated failure to comply with court orders and deadlines.
in a carefully considered opinion,the district court denied the appellant rule b motion.see rivera velázquez hartford steam boiler inspection ins,wl,at.this timely appeal followed.
our inquiry is guided by the abecedarian principle that relief under rule b is extraordinary in nature and that motions invoking that rule should be granted sparingly.karak bursaw oil,cir.thus,a party who seeks relief under the rule must establish,at the very least,that his motion is timely that exceptional circumstances exist,favoring extraordinary relief that if the judgment is set aside,he has the right stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or defense and that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing parties should the motion be granted.id.
it is a proposition that the district court is best positioned to examine these criteria.nansamba shore med,cir.consequently,we review the grant or denial of a rule b motion only for abuse of discretion.see id.
rule b offers six independent routes to relief.see.b.the motion filed in the court below did not clearly identify which of these routes might lead to relief in this case.the district court concluded appropriately,we think that only clauses and might fit.see rivera velázquez,wl,at.the appellant does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.we proceed accordingly.
clause of rule b authorizes the district court to grant relief from a final judgment due to mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.clause is a,which authorizes relief for any other reason that is,any reason not encompassed within the previous five clauses that may justify relief.
the court below correctly wrote off any possibility of relief under rule b.it is a bedrock principle that clause may not be used as a vehicle for circumventing clauses through.cotto united states,cir.in other words,rule b and rule b are mutually exclusive.de la torre cont l ins,cir.where,as here,a party asserted basis for relief falls squarely within the compass of rule b,rule b is not available.see cotto,at.
this brings us to the appellant claim under rule b.the claim,as framed,implicates the rule excusable neglect component.deciding what constitutes excusable neglect is a exercise,which requires an equitable determination,taking into account the entire facts and circumstances surrounding the party omission.dávila escuela de medicina universidad central del caribe,cir.the pertinent facts and circumstances typically include such things as the danger of prejudice to the,the length of the delay,the reason for the delay,and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.citing pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs.nevertheless,these factors are not entitled to equal weight.within the constellation of relevant factors,the most important is the reason for the particular oversight.nansamba,at.
the court below acknowledged that a few circumstances tilted in favor of granting the motion.see rivera velázquez,wl,at.in that regard,it cited the lack of any serious prejudice to the company should the case be reinstated,the general policy in favor of disposing of cases on the merits,and the absence of any evidence of bad faith on the appellant part.see id.despite these ameliorative factors,however,the court concluded that the totality of the circumstances weigh ed strongly against granting relief.id.
in reaching this conclusion,the court supportably found that the appellant had remained silent for months in the face of several court orders of which he had been duly notified,including an order that specifically warned that further inaction would entail dismissal.id.emphasis omitted.this silence was inexcusable,the court reasoned,because the attorney illness which the court accepted as real,notwithstanding the lack of any documentation neither justified nor explained the utter lack of communication.see id.at.to cinch matters,the appellant had two attorneys of record,one of whom had not professed illness at all.the court concluded that a t the very minimum,the appellant counsel should have informed the court and opposing counsel of their situation,which they did not do.id.at.in the court view,the sheer weight of these accumulated failures tipped the decisional scales against the appellant.
the appellant launches a attack on the district court reasoning.we consider each prong separately.
the appellant first line of attack,which is cast in terms of the district court use of precedents,leads nowhere.this line of attack calumnizes the district court for concluding,based on inappropriate case law that illness standing alone is not sufficient to justify relief under rule b.id.
the appellant argument rests upon an artificially cramped reading of the district court rationale.fairly read,the court reasoned that an attorney illness does not constitute a per se justification for rule b relief.see id.such an approach is both reasonable and consistent with precedent.while an attorney illness may constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting relief under rule b,see,gravatt paul revere life ins,app x,cir,that is not always the case.everything depends on context a party seeking relief must persuade the court n
