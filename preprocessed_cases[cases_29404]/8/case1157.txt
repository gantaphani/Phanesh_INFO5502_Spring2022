this case calls on us to review the district court resolution of several questions of new york law under its supplemental jurisdiction primarily,its application of certain state statutes governing franchising and wages to plaintiffs claims for compensation arising from their work,from the late through,as delivery drivers for one or more defendant corporations owned by defendant peter glazman.plaintiffs contend that defendants systematically undercompensated them for their work,purporting to treat them as franchisees while reaping disproportionate profits at plaintiffs expense.on that basis,plaintiffs filed this action in,alleging violations of the fair labor standards act,et flsa the federal insurance contribution act,et fica the new york labor law,labor law,et nyll the new york franchise sales act,bus.law,et fsa and various claims.
six years into in this litigation,the district court dismissed plaintiffs federal claims under the flsa and fica,but elected to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining state law claims,as to which dispositive motions had been submitted the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs nyll and contract claims for unpaid commissions,holding that the statute of frauds precluded any action premised on defendants alleged oral agreements to pay those commissions plaintiffs then proceeded to trial on their fsa claims,which stemmed from defendants alleged failure to comply with the act registration requirements and alleged use of fraudulent and unlawful practices in connection with the franchise relationship.after trial,a jury awarded damages to eight plaintiffs on these claims,and as envisioned by the fsa,the court awarded those plaintiffs their related attorneys fees.
defendants now appeal the district court fsa rulings in plaintiffs favor,contending principally that it was error for the district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these claims,and that plaintiffs claims were in any event barred by the statute of limitations.plaintiffs,challenging inter alia the district court ruling that the statute of frauds barred their nyll and contract claims for unpaid commissions.
for the reasons set forth below,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.we further conclude that the statute of limitations barred the fsa claims of six of the eight plaintiffs.although we affirm the fsa award as to the remaining two plaintiffs,we determine that the related attorneys fee award must be recalculated to reflect that modification in the substantive award.finally,we decide contrary to the district court that the statute of frauds does not preclude plaintiffs from pursuing their nyll and contract claims against defendants.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further proceedings on these claims and for recalculation of the attorneys fees.
background 
a.the parties and the relevant agreements 
defendant peter glazman also known as peter glassman owns or controls defendants pack courier services,usp courier and pack network usp network collectively,pack or defendants,corporations that provide package delivery services in the new york city metropolitan area glazman served as president of usp network throughout the plaintiffs relationship with the pack companies starting in the late.he became usp courier president after that corporation was formed in.usp network and usp courier share offices and employees.
over the years,glazman has sought to expand his business through franchising,the granting of rights to others to engage in the company business under a prescribed brand and marketing plan,in exchange for a fee the new york franchise sales act,bus.law,requires anyone who intends to sell franchises in the state to file an offering prospectus before sales of,or even offers to sell,franchises thus,in july,usp network filed a franchise offering prospectus with the new york state department of law.that franchise registration expired,however,on february.and although usp courier usp network successor continued to sell franchises under similar terms,it never filed a franchise offering prospectus with the state.
a form subscription agreement sa,which outlined the basic terms of the franchise arrangement,was attached as an exhibit to usp network prospectus.the sa required each subscriber to pay a subscription fee in exchange for the right to receive delivery assignments through usp network central dispatch,and entitled each subscriber to a weekly paycheck based on accumulated commissions earned for deliveries made.although subscribers could pay the entire subscription fee up front,many chose to pay in installments that were deducted weekly from their paychecks.interest was due on the unpaid balance,however,and as of the publication of the prospectus,usp network set the interest rate at per annum 
usp network also charged subscribers a training fee of,a generic weekly fee,and a beeper fee of to per week.moreover,according to the prospectus,subscribers were personally responsible for a host of operational expenditures,including the purchase or rental of a white cargo van for purchase,estimated at to insurance premiums estimated at to vehicle registration fees and motor vehicle taxes estimated at to gasoline estimated at per tank and other items,such as uniforms,hand truck equipment,and maps usp network treated subscribers as independent contractors and,accordingly,did not withhold any taxes from subscribers paychecks.
the sa provided that commission payments made by pack to subscribers for deliveries would be based principally on the type of delivery service requested by the customer,and the distance of the delivery.a schedule of amounts to be paid to subscribers,appended to the sa,contained tables listing related payment amounts.id.at.
on various dates between and,each plaintiff began to work as a delivery driver for pack almost all plaintiffs were recent eastern european immigrants,and many had limited proficiency in the english language.in deposition testimony or at trial,most plaintiffs acknowledged having signed some form of written agreement with pack some denied,however,that the document signed was the sa attached to the usp network offering prospectus some plaintiffs also testified that defendants did not give them sufficient time to review the documents they were asked to sign and did not provide them copies of the documents,even when plaintiffs specifically requested them.in total,defendants produced signature pages signed by only six plaintiffs.
the parties agree that defendants promised,in one form or another,to pay plaintiffs a fee for each delivery completed,rather than an hourly wage.they disagree,however,on how that fee was to be calculated.plaintiffs contend that defendants orally promised to pay them a commission on each delivery that is,of whatever the customer paid pack for the delivery several plaintiffs testified that although they sometimes suspected they were not receiving the promised rates each time they asked defendant glazman about their pay,glazman reaffirmed that pack paid its drivers commissions.defendants contend,however,that there was no agreement,oral or otherwise,to pay commissions.presumably referring to the schedule of amounts to be paid to subscribers appended to the sa,glazman testified at trial that there was a price list which we agreed to pay at a minimum to the driver,but he qualified the assertion by saying further that the terms changed all the time,depends on the client you acquire or the work you do.
procedural history 
in,plaintiffs filed their initial complaint alleging principally violations of the flsa and its state counterpart,the nyll,as well as violations of the fsa and breach of contract.plaintiffs averred that,despite defendants desire to treat them as independent contractors for tax and labor law purposes,they were actually defendants employees,because defendants controlled the manner in which they performed their work.accordingly,plaintiffs invoked the protections of the flsa and the nyll.as relevant here,plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated section of the nyll,because defendants failed to pay them all the wages they were owed that is,the difference between the commissions they were promised and the amounts they were actually paid for each delivery.the same allegations formed the basis for plaintiffs breach of contract claims.
additionally,plaintiffs claimed that defendants violated two provisions of the fsa section,which prohibits a franchisor from selling a franchise without first registering an offering prospectus with the new york state department of law the prospectus claim and section,which prohibits fraud in connection with the offer or sale of a franchise the fraud claim.as to the fraud claim,plaintiffs alleged that,to induce plaintiffs purchase of the franchises,defendants fraudulently represented that plaintiffs would earn commissions on deliveries.
over the course of the proceedings,the issues narrowed.in,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all federal claims by this point,the district court had presided over the case for six years,developing an intimate knowledge of the parties and the governing case law.discovery was complete,and the case was ready for trial.the district court therefore elected without objection to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.the court then granted summary judgment for defendants on the breach of contract and the nyll claims,concluding that the claims were barred by the statute of frauds because they were based on an alleged oral agreement to pay commissions that lacked an express termination provision and thus in the district court view could not be performed within one year.vysovsky i,wl,at,
after the court summary judgment ruling,eight plaintiffs holesa,imas,kroshnyi,maler,mcfarland,ondusko,redaj,and szycowski proceeded to trial on the remaining fsa claims.the jury ultimately found the corporate defendants liable on all of those claims,except mcfarland prospectus claim under section.it awarded damages ranging from to per claim.the jury found glazman not liable,however,on the claims made against him in his individual capacity.
after trial,defendants moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for judgment as a matter of law,arguing inter alia that plaintiffs fsa claims were barred by the fsa statute of limitations,and the jury award of damages on the fsa claims contravened the court jury instructions,which capped fsa damages at rescission the district court denied the motion in large part,see vysovsky ii,wl,at,but made some modifications to the damages awarded finally,pursuant to the fsa,the district court awarded attorneys fees to the prevailing plaintiffs the sum awarded equaled the roughly contingency fee all plaintiffs agreed to pay under their retainer agreements.vysovsky iii,wl,at.
both parties now appeal defendants argue primarily that the district court abused its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the claims the judgments in favor of six plaintiffs should be reversed on the ground that those plaintiffs fsa claims are and no plaintiff is entitled to any damages under the fsa because,in accordance with the district court jury instructions,any such damages are capped at rescission and the evidence at trial showed that each plaintiff made a net profit on his franchise.
the eight plaintiffs who prevailed at trial on their fsa claims,as well as bulikova and vysovsky,principally from the court summary judgment ruling on their nyll and breach of contract claims.plaintiffs argue,inter alia,that the statute of frauds does not bar these claims because,in their view,the oral agreement to pay commissions is an employment contract that could be performed within one year of its making.in addition,plaintiffs appeal the award of attorneys fees,arguing that the district court erred in its calculation of the fee award.we address each of these arguments below.
discussion 
exercise of supplemental jurisdiction 
defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion by retaining supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims after dismissing all federal claims at the summary judgment stage.although defendants did not object to the district court exercise of jurisdiction at that time,they now argue that the court should not have retained jurisdiction because it interpreted the fsa in a novel way.since a ruling in defendants favor would dispose of the appeal and,we address this issue first.
we review a district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over claims for abuse of discretion.see lundy catholic health of long island,cir see also valencia ex rel.franco lee,cir.district courts have supplemental jurisdiction over claims that form part of the same case or controversy as other claims over which the court has original jurisdiction.a.a court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,however,if,among other factors,the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law,or the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.id.c.courts must consider the values of judicial economy,convenience,fairness,and comity when deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.carnegie mellon cohill.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decided that the advanced stage of the litigation and the court long familiarity with the issues in the case,combined with the likely hardship to both parties should plaintiff be forced to in state court weighed in favor of exercising supplemental jurisdiction.vysovsky i,wl,at.by the time the federal claims were dismissed,the case had been before the district court for over six years.furthermore,discovery had been completed,dispositive motions had been submitted,and the case would soon be ready for trial.see raucci town of rotterdam,cir affirming district court retention of supplemental jurisdiction given the extensive proceedings involving the pendent claims prior to the dismissal of the federal claim.finally,although we ultimately conclude that the district court erred in some of its interpretations of new york law,the issues were not so groundbreaking as to preclude the exercise of jurisdiction,especially in light of the circumstances in which the discretionary decision arose.see mauro new england,cir.we therefore affirm the district court decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims,and now proceed to the merits of this appeal.
fsa claims 
defendants also appeal from the judgments entered against them on plaintiffs fsa claims they contend that the fsa statute of limitations runs from the inception of the franchise agreement,thereby barring any recovery for the six plaintiffs holesa,imas,maler,ondusko,redaj,and szycowski who entered into franchise agreements before march.defendants also argue that,in any event,none of the plaintiffs can recover damages on his fsa claims because the act limits plaintiffs remedies to rescission of the franchise agreement and return to the status quo ante.because each of the plaintiffs is alleged to have collected more revenue from his franchise than he paid in franchise fees,defendants contend,applying the remedy of rescission would actually require plaintiffs to return their net profit to pack.we address these two arguments in turn.
statute of limitations 
the fsa statute of limitations provides that an action shall not be maintained to enforce a liability created under this section unless brought before the expiration of three years after the act or transaction constituting the violation.bus.law.plaintiffs filed their complaint in this action on march,alleging that defendants a sold them franchises without having an offering prospectus registered with the state,in violation of section the prospectus claim and b committed fraud in connection with the sale of franchises,in violation of section,because they induced plaintiffs to enter franchises with a false promise to pay commissions for deliveries the fraud claim.for both claims,therefore,the act or transaction constituting the violation occurred when the franchises were purchased.see united magazine murdoch magazines distribution,d,united magazine,aff,app x,cir holding that the limitations period begins to run at the time that the parties first enter into the franchise agreement leung lotus ride,dep t fsa claims based on franchise agreements that were executed more than three years prior to commencement of the action properly dismissed as untimely see also bayit care tender loving care health care servs.of nassau suffolk,llc,d,in assessing the timeliness of claims made under the fsa,courts have generally determined that the limitations period begins to run when the franchise contract is entered into,and that continuous violations do not toll the statute of limitations.internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,the fsa claims of the six plaintiffs who purchased their franchises prior to march,fall outside the fsa limitations period.
plaintiffs make two arguments in support of their contention that the fsa claims at issue were nonetheless timely filed.first,they argue that the statute of limitations began to run anew when their franchises were transferred from usp network to usp courier in april less than two years before plaintiffs filed their complaint in march,and well within the limitations period.when the transfer occurred,pack provided delivery drivers with a document entitled rules and regulations of pack drivers.the document purported to be an agreement between usp network,usp courier,and the driver.according to plaintiffs,entry into this transfer agreement reflected the start of a new franchise relationship.
in our view,however,plaintiffs transfer theory fails at the start.the first paragraph of the transfer agreement provides that n othing contained in this agreement is intended to alter your subscription agreement with pack network pack courier services,inc,as the case may be.moreover,plaintiffs and defendant glazman testified that there was no change in the operations of pack or its relationship with its drivers as a result of the transfer.plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence establishing that the alleged transfer from usp network to usp courier constituted the beginning of a new franchise agreement that would reset the statute of limitations.see united magazine,d at rejecting plaintiffs claim that changes to their franchise agreements restarted the limitations period see also bayit care,d at noting that,under the fsa,the definition of offer to sell excludes the renewal or extension of an existing franchise where there is no interruption in the operation of the franchised business by the franchisee quoting bus.law.we therefore reject plaintiffs timeliness argument made on this ground.
second,plaintiffs claim that because most of them did not pay their franchise fee in a lump sum when they first entered an agreement with pack,but rather paid the fee through weekly deductions from pay,defendants committed a continuing violation of the fsa each time they deducted a franchise fee payment.therefore,plaintiffs argue,any plaintiff whose paycheck reflected a deduction for a franchise fee installment payment after march,has a timely claim.
this argument also fails to persuade.although we have not yet addressed the issue in a precedential opinion,at least one of the district courts in our circuit has held in a decision we later affirmed by summary order that under the fsa,continuous violations do not toll the statute of limitations.united magazine,d at.plaintiffs have failed to point us to any new york authority supporting a contrary interpretation,fantastic,rejecting plaintiffs argument that the fsa imposes a continuing obligation on franchisors,because to find otherwise would serve to emasculate the statute of limitations,and we see no reason to depart from united magazine reasoning under the circumstances presented here.indeed,this result is congruent,in our view,with the language and purpose of the fsa,which requires certain disclosures and prohibits fraud in connection with the offer and sale of franchises,but does not seek to regulate the ongoing operations of a franchise.see bus.law,see also retail software,lashlee,cir david kaufmann david oppenheim,practice commentaries to new york franchise act,bus.law et,at vii e mckinney.
thus,the statute of limitations bars the claims of all plaintiffs who purchased franchises from pack before march.only ondusko,kroshnyi,and mcfarland bought their franchises after this date.ondusko,however,purchased his franchise not from pack,but from another driver,vysovsky.therefore,ondusko claim is derivative of vysovsky.and because vysovsky purchased his franchise before march,ondusko claim is also.
in sum,only kroshnyi and mcfarland have asserted timely fsa claims.we therefore reverse the district court judgment with respect to the fsa claims of holesa,imas,maler,ondusko,redaj,and szycowski.
available remedies 
we now consider pack argument that the remaining fsa plaintiffs,kroshnyi and mcfarland,are nevertheless barred from recovering damages on their fsa claims because the act limits their remedies to rescission.
the remedies provision of the fsa provides in relevant part 
a person who offers or sells a franchise in violation of various sections of the fsa,including sections and is liable to the person purchasing the franchise for damages and,if such violation w as willful and material,for rescission,with interest at six percent per year from the date of purchase,and reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
bus.law.defendants contend that this provision limits plaintiffs remedies under the fsa to rescission i,the unwinding of the franchise agreement and the refunding of the franchise fee,minus any profits earned.accordingly,defendants maintain,section prohibits the award of damages to plaintiffs like kroshnyi and mcfarland who allegedly earned a net profit on their franchise.building on that premise,defendants argue that the district court erred when it refused to overturn the jury damages awards on the fsa claims and grant judgment for defendants as a matter of law 
defendants offer primarily two arguments to support their reading of the fsa remedies provision first,because section provides for damages based on any violation of the fsa,but provides for rescission only in cases of willful and material violations,defendants claim that rescission must be the maximum remedy available under the act.it would not make sense,the argument goes,to permit plaintiffs to recover damages that would put them in a better position than a rescission remedy,because plaintiffs need not demonstrate willfulness or materiality to obtain damages,but must do so to rescind the agreement.
second,defendants cite a related provision of the statute,section,which provides that a can avoid liability for fsa violations altogether if,before the initiation of suit,the franchisor contacts the plaintifffranchisee and offers to refund the consideration paid together with interest at six percent per year from the date of payment,less the amount of income earned by the franchisee from the franchise.bus.law.defendants claim that this provision demonstrates that the fsa does not contemplate damages for plaintiffs who earned more income from their franchise than they paid in franchise fees,those who earned a net profit.according to defendants,the rescission offer under section would not provide any benefit to a plaintiff who made a net profit because the income earned from the franchise would exceed the consideration paid under those circumstances,rescission would result only in the having to hand over her profits to the.to avoid this absurd result,defendants argue,we should interpret section as limiting recovery under the fsa to plaintiffs who suffered a net loss on their franchise.appellants br.at.
in our view,however,we need not delve into this thorny question of new york law to resolve the instant appeal.even assuming arguendo that defendants interpretation of section is correct,and rescission is the maximum remedy available under the statute,we see no reason to disturb the jury verdict in favor of kroshnyi and mcfarland on their fsa claims.indeed,as explained below,because the district court instructed the jury in accordance with pack own view of the law the jury decision to award damages to these plaintiffs under the fsa turns on the jurors implied factual findings concerning the calculation of plaintiffs profits and losses over the course of the franchise arrangement findings that are entitled to substantial deference on appeal.
with respect to the prospectus claim,for example,the district court instructed the jury that it could award rescission if the failure to register was willful and material,but i f you find that pack failure to register the offering prospectus was not willful and material,then those plaintiffs are entitled to an award of damages short of rescission.emphasis added.moreover,in connection with the fraud claim,the court explained to the jury 
damages for fraud must be in an amount intended to restore the plaintiffs to the position they occupied before the commission of the fraud.this means that plaintiffs damages should be an amount equal to the net expenses,which each plaintiff incurred as a result of deciding to participate in the franchise.if you find that any or all of the plaintiffs made a net profit on their franchise,then they are not entitled to damages for their claim offraud.
emphasis added.after receiving these instructions,the jury awarded kroshnyi on his prospectus claim and on his fraud claim.it awarded mcfarland nothing on his prospectus claim and on his fraud claim.
on appeal,defendants contend that,because each plaintiff received more money in commissions from pack than he paid in franchise fees,the jury damages award is inconsistent with both the court instructions and the evidence adduced at trial appellants br.at.but what defendants are really asking us to do is to reject the jury implicit findings of fact that plaintiffs ultimately suffered a net loss on their franchises,and to grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict.that we may do only if the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the,without considering credibility or weight,reasonably permits only a conclusion in the movant favor.doctor,weible,cir internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,there must be such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture.milbank,tweed,hadley mccloy boon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that is not this case.
defendants contend that the franchise fees charged to each plaintiff were capped at.but because both kroshnyi and mcfarland paid the fees through weekly deductions from along with interest on any unpaid balance,it appears neither plaintiff knew exactly how much he was charged in total,and the evidence was open to interpretation furthermore,in deciding whether either plaintiff made a net profit on his franchise,the jury could properly consider the significant operational expenses that each plaintiff incurred in the course of running his franchise,such as the rental of a cargo vehicle,insurance premiums,vehicle maintenance,taxes,tolls,and fuel,as well as various other expenses like the rental of a radio and beeper,and the cost of uniforms and equipment.indeed,the evidence at trial showed that u.pack deducted large sums from kroshnyi and mcfarland weekly commission checks for vehicle rental,vehicle maintenance,the lease of radios and beepers,and other charges and while neither plaintiff testified about the specific amounts expended on fuel,insurance premiums,uniforms,equipment,taxes,and the like,the jury had before it the offering prospectus and sa,which stated that drivers bore responsibility for these expenses and provided an estimated cost range for each see.
considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as we must we can not say that a reasonable juror would have been compelled to conclude that plaintiffs made a net profit on their franchises.see tuccio marconi,cir stating that judgment as a matter of law is warranted only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,a reasonable juror would be compelled to find in favor of the moving party see also indu craft,bank of baroda,cir w hen reviewing the sufficiency of the damages evidence,we are guided by the principle that if a plaintiff has shown it more likely than not that it has suffered damages,the amount of damages need only be proved with reasonable certainty.therefore,assuming without deciding that defendants are correct that the fsa caps damages at rescission and that plaintiffs who make a net profit on their franchises have no remedy under the statute,we nonetheless affirm the district court award of damages in favor of kroshnyi and mcfarland on their fsa claims 
attorneys fees 
the fsa provides that a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs.bus.law.on,plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion because it failed to calculate the lodestar value when awarding fees.because we reverse the judgments entered in favor of six of the plaintiffs on their fsa claims,as discussed above,we must remand for a recalculation of attorneys fees in any event.upon remand,we strongly suggest that the district court begin its calculation by first performing a lodestar analysis,which calculates reasonable attorneys fees by multiplying the reasonable hours expended on the action by a reasonable hourly rate.see perdue kenny ex rel.winn,addressing lodestar analysis under federal statute matakov keltech,dep t applying the lodestar method under new york law.
breach of contract and nyll claims 
we turn next to plaintiffs argument on that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment for defendants on the breach of contract and nyll claims,concluding that the statute of frauds barred the claims.almost all plaintiffs testified that glazman and others orally promised to pay them a commission for each package delivered defendants deny the existence of this agreement.according to glazman,he would not disclose to drivers the amounts that customers paid pack for deliveries because it was a company secret.instead,drivers were paid according to a price list which we agreed to pay at a minimum to the driver,but the terms changed all the time.id.at.
statute of frauds defense 
amendment of answer 
as an initial matter,plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion by permitting defendants to amend their answer to assert,somewhat belatedly,a statute of frauds defense.the federal rules provide that courts should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.a.indeed,i n the absence of any apparent or declared reason such as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant or undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment the leave sought should,as the rules require,be freely given.foman davis.we review the district court grant of leave to amend for abuse of discretion,and,e xcept when required by the demands of justice in the particular case,almost invariably defer to the discretion exercised by the trial court.evans syracuse city sch,cir.
plaintiffs filed their second and final amended complaint on june.defendants responded with their answer on august.not until november,more than a year after filing the answer and four months after the close of discovery did defendants move to amend their answer to assert the statute of frauds defense as well as the defenses of estoppel,release,and waiver.defendants filed their motion to amend jointly with their motion for summary judgment.
plaintiffs contend that they suffered extreme prejudice from the late amendment because they had no opportunity to conduct discovery about whether there were any terms in the oral agreement that would prevent it from being performed within one year.appellees reply br.at.they also argue that they were prejudiced because if the statute of frauds defense had been asserted sooner,it would have affected their settlement calculations.we are not persuaded.
in our view,plaintiffs suffered little,if any,prejudice from the grant of leave to amend.discovery was not necessary because each plaintiff was a party to the alleged oral agreement and therefore,presumably,well aware of the agreement terms.in any event,the district court explained that e xtensive discovery was conducted on the circumstances surrounding the oral and written agreements.vysovsky i,wl,at.because defendants raised the statute of frauds defense in their motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs had an adequate opportunity to argue against its application to this case.and although the late assertion of the defense may have had an effect on plaintiffs assessment of settlement value,plaintiffs still had ample opportunity to settle between november,when defendants moved to amend and for summary judgment,and october,when the court issued its decision on both motions.
because plaintiffs have neither suffered significant prejudice from the grant of the motion to amend,nor pointed to any evidence of bad faith on the part of pack,we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in granting pack motion to amend its answer to assert a statute of frauds defense.
plaintiffs further argue that the district court erred when it concluded that the alleged oral agreements to pay commissions could not be performed within one year and were therefore barred by the statute of frauds.new york statute of frauds provides,in relevant part,as follows 
every agreement,promise or undertaking is void,unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing,and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith,or by his lawful agent,if such agreement,promise or undertaking 
by its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof or the performance of which is not to be completed before the end of a lifetime.
new york courts generally construe the statute of frauds narrowly,voiding only those oral contracts which by their very terms have absolutely no possibility in fact and law of full performance within one year.d n boening,kirsch beverages.indeed,w herever an agreement has been found to be susceptible of fulfillment within that time,in whatever manner and however impractical,the new york court of appeals has held the provision of the statute to be inapplicable,a writing unnecessary,and the agreement not barred.id.at.
plaintiffs do not allege that the oral commission agreements contained an express termination provision they argue,nonetheless,that the agreements were capable of performance within one year,because they were part of an employment agreement,and new york law presumes such agreements may be terminated at any time by either party.we agree.
under new york law,absent an agreement establishing a fixed duration,an employment relationship is presumed to be a hiring at will,terminable at any time by either party.sabetay sterling drug,see also reddington staten island,cir.for this reason,new york courts have consistently held that oral employment agreements lacking a fixed duration are not covered by the statute of frauds,because they could theoretically be terminated by either party within one year of their making.see,cron hargro fabrics,alleged oral agreement to pay bonuses as part of an employment relationship not barred by statute of frauds hubbell madden constr,dep t stucklen kabro,dep t air masters,bob mims heating air conditioning,dep t 
to support its conclusion that plaintiffs had to allege an express termination provision to relieve the alleged oral commission agreements of the requirements of the statute of frauds,the district court relied on burke bevona,cir.but burke arose from a very different set of facts there,the plaintiff based his breach of contract claim on his allegation that a union local promised him that he would have a job for as long as you live,or for as long as you want,until you retire.id.at.because the alleged lifetime employment agreement in burke was not terminable,it would be barred by the statute of frauds unless it had an express termination provision.id.at.burke does not purport to overrule the long line of new york cases discussed above.see,berardi fundamental brokers,civ,civ.jsm wl,at distinguishing burke and holding that an express termination provision was not required to take the oral agreement to pay bonuses to employees outside the statute of frauds.
we conclude,therefore,that with respect to plaintiffs breach of contract and nyll claims,the district court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants based on the statute of frauds defense.
waiver defense 
finally,we briefly address defendants argument that even if plaintiffs breach of contract and nyll claims are not barred by the statute of frauds,we may affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the alternative ground that plaintiffs,by their course of conduct,impliedly waived these claims.waiver is the voluntary and intentional abandonment of a known right which,but for the waiver,would have been enforceable.nassau trust montrose concrete prods.implied waiver may be found where a party exhibits such conduct or failure to act as to evince an intent not to claim the purported advantage.hadden consolidated edison of.it is well established,however,that negligence,oversight,or thoughtlessness does not create a waiver,and waiver can not be inferred from mere silence.peck peck,dep t.
defendants assert that plaintiffs knew they were not paid commissions on each delivery but failed to object to the calculation of their commission payments until the filing of this lawsuit.although plaintiffs weekly commission statements made no reference to the delivery fees customers paid to pack,defendants argue that plaintiffs could have deduced how much customers were paying by speaking with the customers or reading pack advertising materials,appellants reply br.at,and from that data,calculated the amounts they claimed to be owed.they also contend that four plaintiffs holesa,imas,ondusko,and szycowski admitted that they did not believe they were receiving commissions,and yet they continued to deliver packages for pack.therefore,defendants argue,plaintiffs acquiesced in the way they were being paid and waived any right to collect commissions.id.at.
based on our review of the record,we conclude that plaintiffs have at the very least raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether they voluntarily and intentionally abandoned their right to collect commissions,thus precluding us from affirming summary judgment for defendants on this alternative basis.see voestalpine int l chase manhattan bank,cir stating that where waiver is not established directly,unmistakably or unequivocally,issue of intent to waive right is properly left to the trier of fact.a jury could conclude that plaintiffs,most of whom had limited proficiency in english,were unaware that they were not receiving commissions.plaintiffs inability or failure to compare pack advertising materials to their commission statements is at least as consistent with mere negligence,oversight,or thoughtlessness,which is not enough to create waiver,as it is with the voluntary and intentional abandonment of a known right.the testimony by holesa,imas,ondusko and szycowski also fails to establish that those plaintiffs knew that they were not receiving commission payments and voluntarily and intentionally waived that right therefore,the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants on the breach of contract and nyll claims can not be upheld under defendants alternative theory of waiver.
in sum,we conclude that the fsa statute of limitations runs from the inception of the plaintiffs franchise relationships with defendants.accordingly,the statute of limitations bars the claims of the six plaintiffs holesa,imas,maler,ondusko,redaj,and szycowski who began working for pack more than three years before the filing of the complaint.we nevertheless affirm the jury award of fsa damages to plaintiffs kroshnyi and mcfarland,both of whom filed timely claims.we further conclude,however,that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs breach of contract and nyll claims based on the statute of frauds.a jury could find that the oral agreements to pay commissions were employment agreements,presumed terminable,and thus capable of performance within one year.the statute of frauds therefore does not bar their enforcement.we have considered the
