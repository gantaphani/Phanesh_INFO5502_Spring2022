and joint official liquidators of sphinx spc sphinx appeal from an order of the district court affirming an order of the bankruptcy court approving the settlement of a preference action pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.because we conclude that investors have no standing to contest the settlement,and that the joint official liquidators are precluded from appealing the settlement,we affirm the district court order.
background 
appellant investors each hold various interests in sphinx,an exempted investment company incorporated and organized under the companies law revision of the cayman islands cayman companies law.in an spc,each investor assets and liabilities are held in a particular portfolio,or cell,managed by the company 
prior to the commencement of this litigation,the directors of sphinx had hired plusfunds group,plusfunds,a registered investment advisor,to manage sphinx in exchange for management fees.investors allege that plusfunds in turn hired refco alternative investments rai to oversee investments for sphinx.according to investors,rai regularly executed trades for sphinx,as directed by plusfunds,and oversaw its margin cash.investors further allege that rai,at plusfunds direction,caused sphinx excess margin cash to be invested in accounts at its affiliate,refco capital markets,rcm,the debtor in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding 
on october,five days before refco,refco filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and two days after refco announced it had discovered a substantial,previously undisclosed liability that caused a crisis of confidence in rcm ability to accommodate client withdrawals,a total of was transferred from the sphinx accounts at rcm to its affiliate refco,llc,and ultimately to accounts held on behalf of the cells at lehman brothers.investors allege that this transfer was made at the behest of plusfunds ceo chris sugrue,who investors further allege maintained previously undisclosed allegiances to refco.
with the authorization of the bankruptcy court,on december,the committee commenced an adversary proceeding on behalf of rcm seeking avoidance and recovery of the transfer made to the cells,naming as defendants sphinx,and sphinx acting on behalf of each of the cells.there was evidence that the transfer was preferential,and,on january,the committee filed a motion for summary judgment in the adversary proceeding.sphinx opposed the motion,arguing that whether refco was insolvent at the time of the transfer was a material issue of fact,and that,even assuming that the elements for a preference were satisfied,it was inequitable to allow rcm to recover the entire million because rcm and its affiliates had abused the bankruptcy process to the detriment of sphinx.on april,at the close of discovery,and on the eve of the summary judgment argument,the committee and sphinx agreed to a settlement whereby sphinx,on behalf of the cells,would return million to the rcm estate the settlement.sphinx also agreed to waive any claim against rcm related to the transfer,including any claim pursuant to h of the bankruptcy code 
investors claim that the settlement was the result of an incestuous relationship between refco,plusfunds,and sphinx.in re refco,wl,at,quotation marks omitted.investors point out that preference actions are typically settled with the transferee retaining some premium over what it might expect to receive as a general creditor this premium reflects the risk that the estate might not prevail in the preference action.here,investors argue,sphinx agreed to return all but about fifteen percent of the purported preference and to abandon any future claims against the rcm estate arising from the transfer at issue the committee responds that the settlement was fair given the weakness of sphinx defenses,and the cost,expense,and delay associated with further litigating the legal and factual issues in the adversary proceeding.the committee also argues that the inclusion of the h waiver in the settlement was reasonable because in order to assert a claim pursuant to h,sphinx would have been required to repay the full amount of the transfer,which sphinx contended it could not do consistent with cayman law,sphinx,unlike other creditors of the rcm estate,would recover on its related claims against rcm immediately through the settlement and did not have to wait for a plan of reorganization,and even if sphinx satisfied the requirement for making a h claim by returning the entire amount of the transfer,plus interest,other parties may have sought to equitably subordinate sphinx claim against rcm.
investors filed objections to the settlement in bankruptcy court,arguing that it was not the product of honest bargaining but,rather,collusion and fraud.they further argued that the evidence suggested that the proposed settlement was not a properly authorized corporate act by sphinx.finally,investors asserted that the settlement was an attempted fraud that was consummated by abuse of the bankruptcy process.investors claimed that plusfunds,refco,and sphinx were three faces of the same entity,that refco control over sphinx eliminated any meaningful adversity between the negotiating parties,and that this rendered the proposed settlement length,collusive,and in bad faith.investors br.at.
on june,while the settlement was sub judice,involuntary liquidation proceedings were commenced in the grand court of the cayman islands against sphinx and an affiliated parent entity,sphinx strategy fund,strategy.on june,the grand court of the cayman islands issued an order appointing a provisional liquidator for strategy and imposing a stay of all actions,suits,or proceedings against sphinx until the hearing of the petition for winding up.refco,wl,at.on june,the bankruptcy court heard oral arguments on investors objections.prior to reaching the merits of the settlement,the bankruptcy court denied investors request to stay the hearing in light of the grand court order because the court did not believe the stay was intended to reach the bankruptcy proceeding i do not believe that a motion by the creditors committee here for approval of its entry into the settlement agreement is in any way against either strategy or sphinx.that is because the issues that i am to determine in this motion go to the effect of the settlement on the debtors before me and their creditors.id.quoting bankruptcy court transcript.
after hearing arguments from all parties,including investors,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement as being in the best interests of the debtors,their estates and creditors.the bankruptcy court held that investors lacked standing to object because they were not a party in interest under b of the bankruptcy code.the court held as a matter of law that the settlement affected investors as equity holders in sphinx only indirectly.the court noted that reviewing the settlement fairness to investors was outside its purview because such review 
would entirely skew the task of a bankruptcy court and be extremely unfair to debtors and trustees in that it would force them,in essence,to continue negotiating and potentially litigating not only with the defendants that they dealing with in litigation,but also parties who claim an interest in those defendants,which is simply inappropriate.id.at quoting bankruptcy court transcript.
the court acknowledged investors allegation that the settlement was the product of fraud,but stated that the only relevant inquiry in bankruptcy court is whether the debtor acted in good faith to ensure that the settlement is favorable to the estate,and,in this case,there was no dispute that the committee acted in the best interests of the estate.
investors appealed the approval order to the district court,arguing that their interest was sufficiently direct,adverse,and pecuniary to establish appellate standing,they were a party in interest under b and therefore had standing to object in the bankruptcy court proceeding,the scope of judicial review in a bankruptcy proceeding was broad enough to consider the rights of affected third parties and,therefore,the bankruptcy court erred when it held that it was legally precluded from considering whether the settlement was fair to investors,and the bankruptcy court abused its discretion because it did not accord the grand court order comity.see refco,wl,at citations and quotation marks omitted.
investors arguments to the district court were equivocally supported by appellants kenneth krys and christopher stride,joint official liquidators jols of sphinx.on august,the cayman court entered a order for sphinx and appointed krys and stride to serve as jols.the jols stepped into the shoes of sphinx and assumed the power to bring or defend any action,suit,prosecution or other legal proceedings,whether civil or criminal,in the name and on behalf of the company.jols br.at quoting cayman companies law a.on september,the jols filed a brief in the district court,expressing their concern.at the time the jols filed their brief,they were in the process of investigating the details behind the settlement,and had not reached any firm conclusions about its legitimacy.
the district court rejected each of investors arguments.first,the district court found that investors were not directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by the challenged ruling of the bankruptcy court because they do not hold a direct interest in the debtor.refco,wl,at.the court therefore held that investors did not have standing to appeal the settlement.id.at citing in re colony hill,cir.second,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that investors were not a party in interest within the meaning of b.the district court noted that a party must be a creditor or debtor to have standing to object to a settlement.id.citing in re comcoach,cir.because investors were neither,the district court held that the bankruptcy court properly declined to consider investors objections to the settlement.id.at.third,the district court held that the bankruptcy court appropriately declined to evaluate the fairness of the settlement from the perspective of the investors.id.at.the bankruptcy court only obligations in evaluating the settlement were to the debtors estate,creditors,and shareholders.id.finally,with respect to the bankruptcy court refusal to stay the proceeding because of the grand court order,the district court held that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion.id.at.the district court agreed that to stay the bankruptcy proceeding in favor of an involuntary proceeding in the cayman islands after the settlement was announced would cause needless delay,and,in any event,the committee motion to approve the settlement was not against sphinx and was therefore not covered by the cayman court injunction.id.the district court did not make any substantive rulings with respect to the jols arguments 
on appeal to this court,investors argue that the district court erred in dismissing their appeal of the bankruptcy court order for lack of appellate standing.investors assert that the approval of the settlement will cost them tens of millions of dollars,thereby imposing upon them a direct,pecuniary harm sufficient to confer and appellate standing.investors br.at.in the alternative,investors assert that when the sphinx directors breached their fiduciary duty by entering a fraudulent settlement,the funds at issue became the res of a constructive trust,of which investors were the beneficiaries.because investors hold a constructive trust over the money used to fund the settlement,they argue,they have standing under the direct,pecuniary interest test.id.at.investors further contend that,even if their interest is not direct and pecuniary,the rule limiting appellate standing in the bankruptcy context to parties with a direct,pecuniary interest is a prudential one,not constitutionally mandated,and,as such,courts have been willing to relax the rule in the interests of justice,id.at.investors argue that the appellate standing rule should be relaxed in this case so that the bankruptcy process is not employed to consummate a fraud.id.at.at a minimum,investors claim,they should have been allowed to intervene under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a,as they expressly sought to do in the bankruptcy court.id.at.investors assert that the district court ignored the factual record when it stated that investors were aware of the adversary proceeding for approximately five months but failed to request intervention until after the settlement was announced,refco,wl,at,because it was only after the settlement was announced that investors had reason to intervene.investors br.at.finally,investors assert that the district court erred in concluding that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by failing to accord comity to the order of the grand court of the cayman islands.id.at.
discussion 
like the district court,we review the bankruptcy court articulation of the legal standards applicable to the evaluation of a settlement under bankruptcy rule de novo,in re iridium operating llc,cir,including the bankruptcy court view of the principles governing who may contest the settlement as a party in interest under b.the bankruptcy court application of those principles to the settlement is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.
whether investors have standing 
investors claim they had standing to appear before the bankruptcy court and object to the settlement because they are a party in interest within the meaning of b of the bankruptcy code.that section,investors argue,is to be construed broadly to allow all parties affected by the case to be heard.bankruptcy code b was not intended to exclude injured parties from the judicial process,but instead to underscore that in bankruptcy,which so directly concerns issues of property rights,all affected entities should have access to justice.investors br.at.
section b provides that the term party in interest includ es the debtor,the trustee,a creditors committee,an equity security holders committee,a creditor,an equity security holder,or any indenture trustee.we previously explored the contours of the term party in interest in a slightly different context in comcoach,at there,we stated that w hen interpreting the meaning of code terms such as party in interest,we are governed by the code purposes.id.at citation omitted.one of those purposes is to convert the bankrupt estate into cash and distribute it among creditors.id.bankruptcy courts,we noted,were established to provide a forum where creditors and debtors could settle their disputes and thereby effectuate the objectives of the statute.id.
we acknowledged in comcoach that the term party in interest is not defined by the code.id.but we noted that a real party in interest is the one who,has the legal right which is sought to be enforced or is the party entitled to bring suit,and we rejected as incompatible with the purposes of the code the notion that any particular creditor interest may be asserted by anyone other than that creditor.id 
in reaffirming comcoach underlying principle,we see no need to limit standing in the b context solely to the class of creditors and debtors permitted by comcoach in the quite different context of d see supra note.for,even granting b the benefit of somewhat greater that might be warranted by the additional parties listed in the text of b but not in the text of d investors equity argument still reads into b a degree of separation from the primary parties in a bankruptcy proceeding that we are unwilling to countenance.to the extent that the rights of a party in interest are asserted,those rights must be asserted by the party in interest,not someone else.the principle set forth in comcoach therefore applies with equal force to this case.we reaffirm it today.
investors can not claim that they seek to enforce any rights distinct from those of sphinx as a creditor and a defendant in an adversary proceeding.the record establishes that sphinx is a single legal entity,and that the individual cells are not legally separate entities from sphinx.by investing in sphinx,investors placed control of their funds entirely within the hands of the sphinx directors or managers acting on behalf of the directors.only sphinx,not individual investors,or even investors
