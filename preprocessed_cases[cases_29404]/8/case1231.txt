plaintiff appellant christopher phillips appeals from an august,judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut bryant,which dismissed phillips medical malpractice claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.phillips,as the administrator of his sister karen cato estate,sued defendant appellee generations family health center generations in connecticut state court,alleging that generations negligently failed to timely diagnose the colon cancer that caused cato death.generations,however,receives federal funding under the public health service act and has been deemed a federal employee by the department of health and human services hhs.see g n.the case was removed to federal court,and the court applied the statute of limitations and procedural requirements of the federal tort claims act ftca.ultimately,the district court dismissed the case on the ground that phillips had failed to file an administrative claim with hhs within the ftca limitations period.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for the district court to reconsider the case in light of our clarification of the governing legal standard 
background 
karen cato was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer in late or early.she was only years old at the time.in january of,cato consulted with gerhardt nielsen,a lawyer for pegalis erickson,llc pegalis,about whether she might have a medical malpractice claim against her health care provider,generations,for failure to timely diagnose her cancer.nielsen informed cato that an expert would need to review her medical records to determine whether generations had acted negligently,and he therefore requested cato medical records from generations and another health care provider.however,he warned cato that it was unlikely that she would have a claim because the standard of care for a patient of her age did not necessarily require routine colon cancer screening.cato told her brother,phillips,that she had spoken to a lawyer at pegalis about a prospective medical malpractice claim.
cato passed away on april.she was survived by phillips,an adult son named zane deshong,and a old son.no later than april,phillips called nielsen to inform the lawyer that cato had died and that deshong would be contacting nielsen shortly to discuss cato legal affairs.deshong,who was on active military duty on a submarine in the pacific,was impossible to reach for months at a time.because nielsen believed that he did not have authority to review any of cato medical records absent permission from deshong,nielsen took no further action on the case until deshong called pegalis on july.deshong gave nielsen permission to review the medical records,and nielsen advised that they should appoint someone to serve as the administrator of cato estate.
o ver the next eight months the firm attempted to work with deshong to attend to legal details,but this became impractical because deshong remained on active duty in the pacific.app x at.deshong,therefore,informed nielsen in march of that phillips would assume responsibility for cato legal affairs.in july,phillips again contacted nielsen and learned that pegalis had received some of cato medical records but required further records from another provider,lawrence memorial hospital.nielsen advised phillips to become the administrator of cato estate so that phillips could request the additional records.according to nielsen,pegalis would coordinate with the law offices of vincent deangelo the deangelo office,a connecticut law firm,on these matters.nielsen also explained that cato records needed to be reviewed by a medical expert before a malpractice claim could be filed under connecticut law and that the records from lawrence memorial were essential to the expert analysis 
in order to determine generations ownership and funding structure,nielsen visited generations website,looked at its medical records,and had a paralegal perform a corporate search.according to nielsen 
the website for generations did not contain any information indicating that this was a federally funded facility nowhere on the site did it indicate that there was any federal funding involved.the website did indicate that generations family health center receives health care to the homeless funding agency wide an internet search for health care to the homeless revealed that there are numerous private and state funded organizations nationwide providing aid for the homeless,but revealed no connection of such programs to the federal government or to federal funding if generations was a facility,the website not only did not reveal that fact but contained information which,if logically considered,effectively concealed that funding everything about generations suggested that it was a private,entity.it certainly held itself out that way.the generations website affirmatively creates the impression that this is a private health care facility,not a branch of the federal public health service.
app x at.furthermore,a corporate search at the connecticut secretary of state office did not reveal that generations was a federal entity.although hhs has created a publicly accessible online database of all its deemed employees and established a phone hotline that prospective plaintiffs can call to determine if a particular provider is a federal employee,nielsen was apparently unaware of these resources and,in any event,did not suspect that generations might be a federal employee.
after phillips was appointed as the administrator of cato estate on march,he requested cato medical records from lawrence memorial hospital.however,nielsen was concerned that connecticut statute of limitations might expire before phillips received the records and before the medical expert could complete the report required by.a.to avoid this danger,on march,the deangelo office filed a petition with the connecticut superior court for an automatic extension of time for phillips to file his potential complaint.see.b.when it became clear that the medical records from lawrence memorial still would not arrive in time,the medical expert concluded on the basis of the existing records that phillips had a good faith basis for a malpractice claim.phillips filed his complaint against generations in connecticut superior court on june.the suit was timely under connecticut law.
over four months later,the united states attorney office notified phillips that the case had been removed to federal court because generations and its employees were acting within the scope of federal employment as employees of the public health service at the time of the incident out of which the plaintiff claim arose.app x at.in short,certain health centers that receive federal funding under the public health service act and serve medically underserved populations can be deemed by hhs as federal health providers even if they are private organizations.see g n.these federal health providers are considered federal employees for purposes of medical malpractice claims,and plaintiffs wishing to sue the providers or their employees must comply with the requirements of the ftca.see id.
under the ftca,before a claimant can file suit,he or she must first present the claim to the appropriate federal agency in this case hhs within two years of the date the claim accrued.b.the claimant can only initiate his or her lawsuit once the claim has been denied by the agency or if the agency has failed to make a decision within six months after the claim was filed.a.here,after the case was removed to federal court,the government moved to dismiss phillips complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because phillips had failed to file an administrative claim with hhs.
phillips argued that,even though he had not filed an administrative claim with hhs within the ftca limitations period,he was eligible to take advantage of the savings clause of the westfall act.under the westfall act,where the plaintiff has filed his or her tort suit against the wrong party,an otherwise untimely administrative claim filed after the federal government has entered the case shall be deemed to be timely presented if the claim would have been timely under the ftca statute of limitations had it been filed on the date the underlying civil action was commenced.d.as a practical matter,when a district court determines that the savings clause applies,it typically dismisses the plaintiff suit without prejudice and grants the plaintiff leave to file an administrative claim with the appropriate agency.see id.
phillips contended that he commenced his underlying civil action in connecticut state court within the ftca statute of limitations for three separate reasons his claim did not accrue until at the earliest of,which was less than two years before he filed suit he commenced his state action on march,by filing his petition for an extension of time with the connecticut superior court and the limitations period should have been equitably tolled because there was no reason to suspect that generations was a federal entity.the district court rejected each of these three arguments and dismissed phillips suit with prejudice.on the first issue,the district court determined that phillips claim accrued at the latest on april,meaning that his june,complaint was not filed within the ftca statute of limitations.the district court also rejected phillips second argument,holding that the filing of a petition for extension of time to file a potential complaint could not commence an action.phillips generations family health,cv,wl,at.
lastly,assuming arguendo that equitable tolling was available under the ftca,the district court held that phillips would not be entitled to tolling because he and his lawyers failed to diligently investigate generations federal status.the district court concluded that pegalis could have easily discovered generations status by visiting the hhs online database of deemed federal employees or by calling the government hotline.id.at.moreover,according to the district court,pegalis should have known to investigate the federal nature of a potential defendant as part of its standard due diligence because it advertises itself as a top tier medical malpractice firm.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied almost exclusively on our recent decision in ex rel.castillo united states,cir,finding that the case all but dictated the result.had held that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny equitable tolling to a plaintiff whose law firm did literally nothing to determine the federal status of plaintiff health care provider.id.at.the district court here,quoting,reasoned that it is hard to understand why any lawyer,let alone a lawyer at a firm specializing in medical malpractice,would not investigate the federal nature of potential defendants as part of standard due diligence in every medical malpractice case.phillips,wl,at quoting,at.furthermore,the district court rejected phillips contention that there was no reason to suspect that generations was federally funded or a deemed federal employee,concluding that common sense let alone years of experience in medical malpractice litigation would alert a reasonable advocate to the possibility that a community health clinic that provides healthcare to homeless individuals might be federally funded.id.at quoting,at.
as explained in a separate summary order filed simultaneously with this opinion,the district court properly rejected phillips first two arguments.however,for the reasons discussed below,we are concerned that the district court may have mistakenly interpreted our opinion in to dictate the result in this case as a matter of law.most importantly,the district court did not fully consider whether,despite the differences between this case and,phillips lawyers had reason to know that they should have investigated generations federal status.because we can not be certain on the present record whether the district court decision should be affirmed under the correct legal standard,we remand for reconsideration.
discussion 
we review a district court determination that equitable tolling is inappropriate for abuse of discretion,at.we have previously explained,however,that this term obscures more than it reveals and that the operative review standard for equitable tolling determinations in the end will depend on what aspect of the lower court decision is challenged.belot burge,cir.if a district court denies equitable tolling on the belief that the decision was compelled by law or i f the decision to deny tolling was premised on an incorrect or inaccurate view of what the law requires,the decision should be reviewed de novo.id.along the same lines,if the decision to deny tolling was premised on a factual finding,the factual finding should be reviewed for clear error.id.only where the court has understood the governing law correctly,has based its decision on findings of fact which were supported by the evidence,and the challenge is addressed to whether the district court decision is within the range of possible permissible decisions will we actually review for abuse of discretion in both name and operation.id.at.
whether equitable tolling is available at all under the ftca is an open question in this circuit.although we have sometimes hinted that equitable tolling might be appropriate,see valdez ex rel.donely united states,cir celestine mount vernon neighborhood health,cir,we have explicitly declined to resolve whether the ftca statute of limitations is jurisdictional and,hence,not subject to tolling,at.the district court similarly declined to address this issue and,instead,held that phillips would not be entitled to equitable tolling even if it were available.as such,in reviewing the district court conclusion,we will also assume arguendo that equitable tolling is available and analyze whether phillips would be entitled to tolling under the particular facts of his case.we leave it for the district court to consider in the first instance on remand,if necessary,whether the ftca statute of limitations is jurisdictional.
although equitable tolling is applicable only in rare and exceptional circumstances,at internal quotation marks omitted,we have recognized that it is sometimes necessary as a matter of fairness,johnson nyack,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to qualify for equitable tolling,the plaintiff must establish that extraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his claim on time,and that he acted with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll.doe menefee,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff must also show that his lawyers were reasonably diligent in determining the appropriate parties to sue,and what,if any,restrictions on the time and forum for bringing such a claim might exist,at.
we have had only a few opportunities to consider how this standard applies in this specific context,where a medical malpractice plaintiff does not realize that her health provider is a deemed federal employee and files her claim in state court after the ftca limitations period has expired.first,in celestine mount vernon neighborhood health center,we cautioned that where the federal statute of limitations is shorter than the state statute,a plaintiff reasonably thinking that he has a state law claim may bring suit within the state window,but still find himself barred under the westfall act because the suit was outside of the federal limitations period.at.although we decided the case on other grounds,we opined that it would be unjust to treat such a timely state suit as federally barred and that this concern may well require equitable tolling under such circumstances.id.
a few years later,in valdez,we again suggested that the government failure to disclose that health providers are federal employees may warrant equitable tolling because,otherwise,patients are not aware of their providers federal status.at.we explicitly faulted hhs for creat ing a potential statute of limitations trap by refusing to formulat e a regulation that would require notice to a patient that the doctor rendering service to him is an employee of the united states.id.we also observed that t he number of cases in which the united states has sought to take advantage of this trap suggests that it is aware of the consequences of its failure to disclose the material facts of federal employment by doctors who might reasonably be viewed as private practitioners.id.yet,despite this knowledge,the government had done nothing to help plaintiffs avoid the potential trap.this failure,we thought,was problematic.id.at.therefore,although we did not definitively resolve the issue because equitable tolling would not have saved the plaintiff claim,we strongly criticized the government conduct in taking advantage of these situations.id.
finally,in,we considered whether equitable tolling was warranted for another plaintiff who fell into this statute of limitations trap.in that case,the plaintiff law firm was planning to file a medical malpractice suit against its client doctor in new york state court when it belatedly realized,almost by accident that the doctor was a deemed federal employee,at.one of the plaintiff lawyers had learned that a doctor in an unrelated case had been deemed a federal employee and,therefore,placed a call to the government hotline in order to inquire about the federal status of the defendant.id.at.although the plaintiff suit would have been timely under new york law,by the time the firm realized its error,the ftca two year limitations period for filing an administrative claim had expired.the plaintiff argued that the limitations period should be tolled,but the district court found that equitable tolling was inappropriate because the law firm exhibited a lack of diligence when it did literally nothing to determine whether the doctor was a employee until after the ftca limitations period had expired.id.at.
on appeal,we held that the district court decision was not an abuse of discretion.id.we thought that the case did not raise the same concerns as valdez for two principal reasons the government had provided publicly available sources of information the online database and telephone hotline about providers federal status,and lawyers had reason to investigate whether the seemingly private health clinic might have been deemed a federal employee.id.at citing valdez,at.although we acknowledged that the online database and hotline established by hhs might not be helpful to every plaintiff,we emphasized that was represented by counsel who had previously confronted factually similar circumstances and therefore had specific notice of the fact that some ostensibly private doctors are deemed federal employees for purposes of medical malpractice claims under the ftca.id.under these circumstances,we reasoned,there is no meaningful difference between the regulation we hypothesized in valdez requiring health providers to notify their patients about the provider federal status and the easily accessible public databases created by hhs id.
there was no question in and there is no question here that the government has created publicly available resources to help plaintiffs discover deemed employees.most of our discussion,therefore,involved whether lawyers should have known to investigate the defendant federal status.we first explained that law firm lacked diligence because it did not investigate the issue even though it was a top firm in the medical malpractice field and had previous experience with th e very issue when,o n at least two prior occasions,the united states removed to federal court medical malpractice claims against persons deemed federal employees that the f irm had improvidently filed in state court.id.at.we further elaborated that i t is hard to understand why any lawyer let alone a lawyer at a firm specializing in medical malpractice with specific prior acquaintance with this issue would not investigate the federal nature of potential defendants as part of standard due diligence in every medical malpractice case.id.moreover,if the firm had simply looked into the issue,e ven the most cursory investigation would have shown that the plaintiff doctor was a federal employee.id.a ll the f irm had to do was either call a number or enter the name of the provider into the online database maintained by hhs.id.
additionally,we suggested that the plaintiff lawyers had even greater reason to suspect that the defendant might be a deemed federal employee because common sense and years of experience in medical malpractice litigation would alert a reasonable advocate to the possibility that a community health clinic with the professed mission of improv ing the health status of underserved communities would be federally funded.id.in fact,we noted,one of the requirements for a health provider to be deemed a federal employee is that it serves a population that is medically underserved.id.emphasis added.
the government contends that our reasoning in dictates the result in this case,emphasizing our pronouncement that i t is hard to understand how any lawyer would not investigate the federal nature of potential defendants as part of standard due diligence in every medical malpractice case.appellee br.at,quoting,at emphasis added.although this statement,particularly given that it refers to any lawyer and every malpractice case,might at first blush appear to require that malpractice lawyers always call the federal hotline or search the hhs database,we do not agree that established such a per se rule.as an initial matter,did not purport to establish a blanket rule of law but instead merely reviewed the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see,at.moreover,reading our decisions in valdez and together,it is clear that we did not establish a per se rule because we relied on certain facts in that were not present in valdez and might not be present in other cases 
for example,we emphasized in that,unlike in valdez,the plaintiff law firm knew from personal experience that ostensibly private doctors could turn out to be deemed federal employees and,therefore,had been put on notice that inquiring about a health provider federal status might be necessary.id.at.in distinguishing valdez,we explained that u nder these circumstances,where the lawyers had previously confronted factually similar situations involving seemingly private doctors,the availability of the government online database sufficed to assuage our concerns that a plaintiff would not be aware of the potential statute of limitations trap.id.emphasis added.we therefore implied that a lawyer lack of knowledge that private clinics might be deemed federal employees could be relevant in determining whether the plaintiff and his lawyer exhibited sufficient diligence.although we could have simply dismissed valdez as dicta,we instead emphasized the distinctions between the cases,and thereby also implied that under other circumstances where the law firm did not have direct prior experience,we might reach a different result.
additionally,we stressed in that the plaintiff lawyers had reason to suspect that the health care provider might have been a federal employee because the health clinic mission statement used the exact same term as the federal statute defining the health providers eligible for federal status underserved communities to describe its target population.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.although we concluded that this language should have led the plaintiff lawyers to suspect that the clinic received federal funding,we did not analyze whether lawyers would have reason to suspect that an ostensibly private entity was actually a federal employee where the provider website was less clear about its funding sources and core mission.
therefore,did not impose an absolute duty on the medical malpractice bar to check the hhs online database or call the hotline in every case.we instead determined,based on all the relevant facts,that the district court did not abuse its discretion.in distinguishing valdez,we also indicated that courts should consider,as part of this analysis,whether the plaintiff lawyer had or should have had reason to suspect that the ostensibly private clinic might be a deemed federal employee.accord santos,at,considering whether plaintiff had been alerted to the need to explore their providers federal employment status in
