this appeal by plaintiffs from the dismissal of their complaint by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york raises once again the troublesome issue of an appellant failure to file a timely appeal because of the appellant compliance with an individual calendar rule promulgated by a district judge.see camacho city of yonkers,cir see also fruit of the loom,am.mktg,cir.because our court is without jurisdiction to consider an appeal if the notice of appeal was not timely filed,this appeal is dismissed.
background 
plaintiffs are ari weitzner,an ophthalmologist based in brooklyn,ny,and ari weitzner,which is ari weitzner professional corporation plaintiffs.the complaint alleges that plaintiffs received four unsolicited faxes sent by defendant cynosure,cynosure,a manufacturer and distributor of products for medical and aesthetic use,and that,by sending these unsolicited faxes,defendant violated the telephone consumer protection act,tcpa.in addition to pursuing their individual claims,plaintiffs seek to represent a nationwide class of more than persons or entities to which cynosure allegedly sent unsolicited faxes.
prior to bringing this action,the corporate plaintiff had brought similar claims against the defendant in the state courts of massachusetts.in,it filed a purported class action against cynosure in the massachusetts superior court,seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief for itself and the putative class members the massachusetts action.following discovery,motion practice,and oral argument on the class certification motion,the massachusetts superior court denied class certification.
plaintiffs then instituted the instant action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.cynosure then confessed judgment in the massachusetts action,acknowledging liability for injunctive relief the plaintiff,and the maximum damages available to the plaintiff under the tcpa.over the plaintiff objections,the massachusetts superior court entered final judgment in the case,awarding ari weitzner,in damages and permanently enjoining defendant from sending unsolicited faxes to it,dismissing the class allegations with prejudice,and awarding defendant certain costs.weitzner appealed to the massachusetts appeals court.
while the state appeal was pending,the court below ordered plaintiffs to show cause why the case should not be dismissed as res judicata by reason of the massachusetts superior court judgment.the district court rejected plaintiffs request for a stay or administrative closure pending resolution of the state appeal and then dismissed this suit as and.the court entered judgment on march.
ten days later,on march,plaintiffs served on defendant a motion for reconsideration of the judgment under.b.plaintiffs did not file the motion with the court.d.their failure to file the motion was in observance of the district judge individual rule d,which prohibits litigants from filing a motion until the motion is fully briefed and ready for adjudication.the rule instructs the moving party instead to serve the motion on the adversary and to advise the court by letter that the motion has been served 
it appears that,having received notification,the district court met with counsel and issued a scheduling order for submission of the filed motion.the scheduling order,dated march,provided,as requested by the parties,that cynosure would serve its response to plaintiffs motion by april,and that plaintiffs would serve their reply by april.on april,cynosure timely served its opposition to plaintiffs motion.plaintiffs did not serve their reply until august,at which point plaintiffs finally filed the motion for reconsideration with the clerk of the district court.defendant then objected,arguing that the motion should be denied because it was not made within a reasonable time as required by.c.without mention of defendant untimeliness argument,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on the merits,entering the order of denial on february.on march,less than thirty days after the district court denial of the motion for reconsideration,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the march,judgment.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
the threshold matter we must resolve is defendant contention that no appeal lies from the judgment because the notice of appeal was not filed for over a year after its entry well beyond the day limit prescribed by fed.frap a a.the rules provide a mechanism for an appellant to toll this day time limit by filing a motion for reconsideration no later than days after the judgment is entered.frap a a vi.however,as plaintiffs did not file their motion for reconsideration for some five months after the entry of judgment,well beyond this day window,defendant contends that time to appeal from the judgment was not tolled,with the consequence that our court lacks jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs appeal from the judgment.
although plaintiffs did not file the motion for reconsideration within days as the rule literal terms require,they served the motion well within the day period allowed for tolling,raising the question whether the specific requirement to file should be strictly interpreted.the drafting history of frap rule a a vi suggests that the requirement to file,rather than serve,a motion for reconsideration within days in order to toll time to appeal was a conscious choice see also fruit of the loom,at distinguishing between service and filing of motions.
in support of the timeliness of the appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court implicitly rejected defendant contention that the motion for reconsideration was untimely by ruling on the merits of the motion.but two different time limits are at work here.the issue we face is not whether the motion for reconsideration was timely,permitting it to be considered by the district court.the question is whether that motion was timely for purposes of tolling frap rule a a day time limit for the filing of a notice of appeal,under frap rule a a vi.the district court did indeed ignore defendant objection to the motion for reconsideration as not being made within a reasonable time pursuant to.c.compare ja with ja.frap rule a a vi,however,imposes a more stringent standard for the tolling of time to appeal,explicitly requiring filing of the motion for reconsideration within days of judgment.see fed.prac.proc.ed.rule b allows the motion to be made within a reasonable time but under appellate rule a a vi only those rule motions filed within the appellate rule stated limit now days suspend the time for appeal.thus,the subparagraph makes a time limit of its own rather than simply looking to the civil rules to decide the timeliness of a motion.
plaintiffs next ask,in effect,that their failure to file within days be equitably excused because the motion would have been filed within days had they not delayed filing so as to comply with the district judge individual rule d,requiring that filing be deferred until the motion is fully briefed.we are not at liberty,however,to grant plaintiffs equitable relief from the day filing requirement unless that requirement should be deemed a rule rather than a jurisdictional rule under the terminology adopted by the supreme court in bowles russell,d the supreme court ruled in bowles that the day time limit for the filing of a notice of appeal under frap rule a a is jurisdictional and therefore may not be waived for equitable reasons.at.
bowles explained that the litmus test for a jurisdictional rule is its institutional provenance time limits that are mandated by statute as opposed to those resulting from judicial recommendation with congressional acquiescence under.are jurisdictional,meaning that they are not subject to waiver or equitable exception.at noting the jurisdictional distinction between rules and limits enacted by congress.thus,the bowles court found that the time limits of frap rules a and a were jurisdictional because,although set forth in a federal rule,these limits were also imposed by congressional statutes a and c.see bowles,at like the initial day period for filing a notice of appeal a,the limit on how
