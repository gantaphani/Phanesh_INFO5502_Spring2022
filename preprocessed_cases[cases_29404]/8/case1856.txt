judit and ernest gottdiener,ervin tausky,and suan investments collectively the investors appeal from a grant of default judgment to blair,and kenton wood collectively broker.the default judgment granted broker motion to confirm in part and vacate in part the award of an arbitration panel.
the investors argue,inter alia,that the southern district of new york lacked personal jurisdiction over them and was an improper venue.the investors also argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to vacate the default judgment.these arguments are directed to restoring the part of the award vacated in the present actions and to breathing life into their own motion to vacate the arbitral award,which was filed in the southern district of florida.and transferred to the after entry of the default judgment.although personal jurisdiction existed in the and there was proper venue,we vacate so much of the default judgment as vacated parts of the arbitration award.we confirm the award because it was not manifestly contrary to law,after finding that the investors waived their arguments regarding florida law by not raising them in the action.
background 
a the arbitration 
the investors maintained securities trading accounts with broker.each of the investors signed separate account agreements and opened trading accounts with blair in new york.each agreement specified that disputes between the investors and broker be resolved by arbitration and that 
the award of the arbitrators,or the majority of them,shall be final,and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court,state or federal,having jurisdiction.i consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the city of new york for the purpose of compelling arbitration,staying litigation pending arbitration,and enforcing any award of arbitrators.
on may,investors filed a statement of claim against broker with the national association of securities dealers nasd in new york city alleging violations of the federal securities and other laws.when filing their claim,the investors signed a nasd regulation arbitration uniform submission agreement,which provided that 
the undersigned parties further agree to abide by and perform any award s rendered pursuant to this submission agreement and further agree that a judgment and any interest due thereon,may be entered upon such award s and,for these purposes,the undersigned parties hereby voluntarily consent to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction which may properly enter such judgment.
on december,the investors amended their claims to assert violations of the new jersey blue sky law,contending that they were new jersey residents.less than three weeks later,on january,the investors,in a collective change of mind,asserted that they were florida residents during their entire relationship with broker and requested that the matter be transferred to a nasd office in florida.the dispute was transferred to florida,and on june,the investors amended their claim to assert violations of the florida blue sky law.the arbitration took place before a panel of three arbitrators in september and october in the nasd boca raton,florida offices.
at the commencement of the arbitration,the investors initially sought compensatory damages interest return of commissions punitive damages sic costs and attorneys fees,but in their submissions,which were considered by the arbitrators before rendering a decision,the investors requested slightly different relief,including compensatory damages punitive damages costs interest and a finding that each respondent violated section,florida statutes.the differences in the relief sought are monetarily significant in that the compensatory and punitive damages requested were higher and the request for prejudgment interest followed the request for compensatory and punitive damages and costs,implying that prejudgment interest should apply to each.
on january,the arbitrators awarded in compensatory damages and in punitive damages to the investors.both awards included prejudgment interest accruing from may,until the date the award is paid in full.the investors moved to have the arbitrators recalculate the compensatory damages to include damages required under florida law,and broker filed a response defending the award.on march,the arbitration panel denied the motion.
b broker new york petition 
broker filed a notice of petition and petition to confirm in part and vacate in part an arbitration award new york petition in the supreme court of new york county.the petition had a return date of april,and stated that,as allowed by section b of the new york,answering papers had to be served on the movant seven days before that date.the investors were served with these documents on april.in the new york petition,broker argued that the award should be confirmed,except for the portion that awarded prejudgment interest on punitive damages.broker asserted that this part of the award was in manifest disregard of the law and contrary to public policy.on april,the investors removed the new york petition to the with an explicit reservation of all rights and defenses,including but not limited to all rights and defenses directed to the inadequacy and impropriety of service of process and personal jurisdiction.the investors asserted that they had not submitted to the jurisdiction of the state court in new york and further believe d that neither the state court in new york,nor the had personal jurisdiction over them.after removal,the investors took no further action on the new york petition until the entry of a default judgment as described infra.
on june,broker sought and received a clerk certificate of default based on the investors failure to respond to the new york petition,relying upon noncompliance with rule c,which states in relevant part that i n a removed action in which the defendant has not answered,the defendant shall answer or present the other defenses or objections available under these rules within days after the filing of the petition for removal.c.broker then moved in the district court for entry of default judgment under rule b on june.on june,the investors filed an opposition to entry of default judgment,cross motion to vacate default,and cross motion to dismiss or transfer.in contesting the entry of default against them,the investors argued that broker new york petition was a motion,not a complaint or pleading as such,default was improper because the rules do not provide for entry of default judgment on a motion.moreover,the investors asserted that the new york petition was incomplete as it lacked a memorandum of law.they also claimed that they had a meritorious defense in that broker had never called the rule against prejudgment interest on punitive damages to the attention of the arbitrators.finally,the investors sought either a dismissal of the new york petition for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue,arguing that the balance of convenience plainly favors florida,or a transfer to the,where there was a pending,related action described below.
c investors florida petition 
while the investors did not respond directly to the new york petition after they removed it to the,on april,they filed their own petition to partially arbitration award and to determine prejudgment interest,attorney fees and for other relief florida petition in a florida state court.the florida petition asked the court to vacate the compensatory damages portion of the arbitration award as being in manifest disregard of the law because the arbitrators specifically found a violation of.stat.ch.but failed to award the full statutory damages as directed by.stat.ch.the florida petition requested confirmation of the remainder of the award and the calculation of attorneys fees,which had been deferred by the arbitrators.
on may,broker removed the florida petition to the and filed an answer to it on june.on july,broker moved to stay the florida proceedings until the district court in the ruled on the new york petition or,in the alternative,to transfer venue of the florida action to the on august,the district court in the.transferred the florida petition to the 
d judgment on the new york petition 
on august,before the transfer of the florida petition,judge owen granted a default judgment in the,confirming the award in part but vacating the portion adding prejudgment interest to the punitive damages.after holding that it had personal jurisdiction over the investors,the district court held that the certificate of default was properly entered per rule c because the new york petition complied with state procedural rules,and a federal court takes a removed action in the posture in which it receives it.therefore,the investors had a duty to answer the new york petition and could not ignore it once they removed it to federal court.moreover,the district court found that there was no good cause to set aside the entry of default under rule c because the investors had not presented a meritorious defense to broker claim that the award of prejudgment interest on punitive damages was made in manifest disregard of the law.finally,the district court denied the motion to transfer venue to florida because the action was first filed in new york,there were no special circumstances,and many of the events underlying the action occurred in new york.
on september,the investors filed a rule e motion to alter or amend the default judgment.the investors claimed a due process violation in that the default judgment effectively disposed of the florida petition without addressing the merits.they also contended that the district court erred in setting aside the prejudgment interest on punitive damages.the district court denied the motion on may.
discussion 
a personal jurisdiction 
we first address the investors claim that the lacked personal jurisdiction over them.we review district court decisions on personal jurisdiction for clear error on factual holdings and de novo on legal conclusions.mario valente collezioni,confezioni semeraro paolo,cir citing titan,guangzhou zhen hua shipping,cir.we hold that the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over the parties for two reasons.first,the investors consented to personal jurisdiction in new york.second,even absent consent,the investors transacted business in and had sufficient contacts with new york to allow new york courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over them.
parties can consent to personal jurisdiction through clauses in contractual agreements.see equip.rental,szukhent,d and it is settled that parties to a contract may agree in advance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.here,the investors consented to jurisdiction in the when they executed their cash account agreements with broker.these agreements contained a clause explicitly stating that the investors consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the city of new york for the purpose of enforcing any award of arbitrators.
while clauses are regularly enforced,carnival cruise lines,shute,d,several conditions must be met.a court must first determine that the existence of the clause was reasonably communicated to the parties.see effron sun line cruises,cir.the investors do not claim an unawareness of the jurisdictional consent clause it was plainly printed on the cash account agreements.second,a clause will be upheld unless the clause was obtained through fraud or overreaching.jones weibrecht,cir citing the bremen zapata,d.the investors make no claim that their consent to the cash account agreements was procured by fraud or overreaching.
finally,unless it is clearly shown that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust,clauses will be enforced.it is on this ground that the investors argue the cash account agreement clause should not be enforced.the investors claim that because the cash account agreements limit new york courts jurisdiction to enforcing any award of arbitrators emphasis supplied,that they did not consent to jurisdiction in new york to vacate any part of the award and that any reading otherwise is unreasonable and unjust.
we disagree.the cash account agreements were an agreement to jurisdiction in the new york courts for both confirmation and vacatur proceedings.as such,the enforcement of the jurisdictional consent clause is neither unjust nor unreasonable.the purpose of the clause was to consent to new york jurisdiction for all proceedings,including compelling arbitration,staying litigation pending arbitration,and enforcing any award of arbitrators.the use of the word enforce rather than the word confirm is significant.to enforce is t o give force or effect to.black law dictionary ed.because a rbitration awards are not,they must be given force and effect by being converted to judicial orders by courts these orders can confirm vacate the award,either in whole or in part.hoeft mvl group,cir.here,broker petitioned the court to confirm in part and vacate in part the arbitration award.that request simply sought to give effect to the arbitration award.the partial vacatur of the award sought by broker does not alter the nature of the action,which we believe is properly considered to involve enforcing the arbitration award.
furthermore,it is irrational to consent to jurisdiction in a court for purposes of confirming an award but not for purposes of vacating all or part of it.a party opposing confirmation of an award may rightly respond by asserting grounds for partial or whole vacatur the right to do so can not rationally be truncated by a personal jurisdiction clause permitting only the enforcement of arbitration awards.if we were to accept the investors interpretation,applications to confirm arbitration awards would have to be litigated separately from any application to vacate the award,even if only a partial vacating is sought.we can not attribute such an irrational and wildly inefficient meaning to the clause.
we hold,therefore,that the investors consented to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of new york.
the investors transacted business in new york 
even absent consent,the still had personal jurisdiction over the investors.the investors agree that subject matter jurisdiction in the is based on diversity of citizenship.in diversity cases,the issue of personal jurisdiction is governed by the law of the forum state,here,new york civil practice law and rules section,new york statute,see agency rent a car,grand rent a car,cir,so long as the district court exercise of jurisdiction comports with the requirements of due process.see metropolitan life ins,cir.
a permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over an party if that party transacts any business within the state and if the claim arises from these business contacts.see cutco,naughton,cir.to meet the transacting business element under a,it must be shown that a party purposely availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within new york and thereby invoked the benefits and protections of its laws bank brussels lambert fiddler gonzalez rodriguez,cir quoting galleries franklyn,alterations in original.to determine whether a party has transacted business in new york,courts must look at the totality of circumstances concerning the party interactions with,and activities within,the state.id.
there are sufficient business contacts to support personal jurisdiction over the investors under new york statute.the investors entered into a brokerage account agreement with broker and executed numerous stock trades through broker new york offices on various new york exchanges.see,credit lyonnais sec.usa,alcantara,cir holding that personal jurisdiction was proper under a based on defendants active account with plaintiff security broker from which a series of transactions were made that formed the basis of the lawsuit.furthermore,the investors contacts with new york provided fair warning of the possibility of being subject to the jurisdiction of new york.see kreutter mcfadden oil.
to meet the arising out of requirement of a,there must be a substantial nexus between the transaction of business and the claim.agency rent a car,at mcgowan smith.the action in the arose out of the arbitration award,which resolved the investors claims against broker for fraudulently and negligently handling the investors investment accounts.these accounts were located and managed in new york.thus,there is a sufficient nexus between the transaction of the business and the claim to comply with the requirements of a.
finally,the constitutional requirements of personal jurisdiction are satisfied because application of a meets due process requirements.see united states montreal trust,cir.
the investors also argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to transfer venue to the.we review a denial of a motion to transfer venue for abuse of discretion.olinick sons dempster,cir.
we find that venue was proper in the.as discussed above,the cash account agreements signed by the investors specifically designate new york state and federal courts as proper fora to contest or confirm awards.section of the federal arbitration act faa states that venue is appropriate in any jurisdiction to which the parties have agreed.as discussed,the cash account agreements make venue appropriate in the 
even without the clauses in the cash account agreements,venue in the would be appropriate.in cortez byrd chips,bill harbert const,the supreme court held that the faa venue provision must be read permissively to allow a motion to confirm,vacate,or modify an arbitration award either where the award was made or in any district proper under the general venue statute,d.as this matter was before the district court based on diversity jurisdiction under,the applicable venue statute provides that 
a civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship may,except as otherwise provided by law,be brought only in a judicial district where any defendant resides,if all defendants reside in the same state,a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated,or a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced,if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.
for present purposes,section a is dispositive.a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in the under cortez,with regard to enforcement of arbitration awards,the events giving rise to the claim are those events giving rise to the claim resolved in the arbitration,not just the arbitration proceeding itself.cortez,at.the fraud and manipulation alleged by the investors involved conduct by broker relating to securities traded on the new york exchanges or underwritten by broker itself house stocks,and the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and negligent supervision arose out of broker conduct in new york.thus,venue in the was appropriate.
although venue would also have been proper in florida,the district court in the did not abuse its discretion by refusing to transfer the case.see bates c s adjusters,cir noting that the venue statute does not require the district court to determine the best venue,only a suitable one.broker filed its new york petition before the investors filed their florida petition.as such,the rule weighs in favor of the action.w here there are two competing lawsuits,the first suit should have priority,absent the showing of balance of convenience or special circumstances giving priority to the second.first city bank trust simmons,cir internal quotations,citation,and alterations omitted.
the investors claim that broker commenced this action through an improper anticipatory filing during settlement talks and that this constitutes special circumstances sufficient to preclude application of the rule.see ontel,project strategies.however,even assuming that the claimed circumstances are special,the only evidence of settlement april,fax rejecting a settlement offer but stating that there may be some basis to conclude a settlement does not show active settlement discussions with the investors.moreover,broker filed its new york petition in the face of a quickly approaching deadline,after which it would not have had the right to contest the arbitration award at all.see notice of a motion to vacate,modify,or correct an award must be served upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered.with the deadline looming,the investors could not have been surprised by broker filing.
finally,the investors have not satisfied their burden under a by showing that transfer was warranted for the convenience of the parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice.district courts have broad discretion in making determinations of convenience under section a and notions of convenience and fairness are considered on a basis.in re cuyahoga equip,cir.some of the factors a district court is to consider are,inter alia the plaintiff choice of forum,the convenience of witnesses,the location of relevant documents and relative ease of access to sources of proof,the convenience of parties,the locus of operative facts,the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses,and the relative means of the parties.albert fadem trust duke energy,d.applying these factors,the district court was well within its discretion in denying the investors requested venue transfer.first,broker chose new york as its forum,a decision that is given great weight.piper aircraft reyno,d.second,new york is a convenient forum for all the parties the investors have homes in new jersey and have at times claimed to be new jersey residents broker is located in new york.finally,documents and other evidence regarding the arbitral award are freely available in new york.thus,the investors can not convincingly argue that new york is an inconvenient forum 
c default judgment 
the investors advance several arguments as to why the district court entry of default judgment should be set aside.in considering these,we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.pecarsky,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
the investors obligation to respond 
the investors argue that a default judgment was inappropriate because they had no obligation to respond to the removed new york petition.their position is that the petition constituted a motion and that.a and c apply only to removed actions begun by a complaint and not to motions.the investors also note that the district court never ordered them to respond to the new york petition and never held a status conference to set a briefing schedule.they further note that broker failed to comply with local rule by not including a memorandum of law.we agree that the removed new york petition should have been treated as a motion but disagree that the investors had no obligation to respond.
rule a provides that w hen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise,the clerk shall enter the party default.rule tracks the ancient common law axiom that a default is an admission of all allegations against the defaulting party.teddy bear beargram,cir.like all general provisions of the federal rules,rule is meant to apply to civil actions,where only the first step has been,the filing of a the court thus has only allegations and no evidence before it.
we agree with the investors that rule does not operate well in the context of a motion to confirm or vacate an arbitration award.see,typographical union aa job printing,citing traguth zuck,cir.as the very name implies,they are motions in an ongoing proceeding rather than a complaint initiating a plenary action.any application to the court hereunder shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of motions,except as otherwise herein expressly provided.productos mercantiles e industriales,faberge usa,cir noting that a district court properly treated a petition to the court for modification of an arbitration award as a motion in accordance with the express provisions of the faa.
