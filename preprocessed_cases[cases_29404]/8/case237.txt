this case requires us to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel in somewhat unusual circumstances.while engaged in a chapter bankruptcy action,the appellant,kevin guay,brought numerous claims against the appellees,government officials and a police officer,seeking damages for an allegedly illegal search of his property.guay,however,failed to amend his bankruptcy schedules,as required,to disclose the existence of his claims as newly acquired assets prior to obtaining a discharge from bankruptcy.as a result,the appellees moved for summary judgment on the basis of judicial estoppel,even though appellant failure to disclose his claims did not give him an unfair advantage in this proceeding.it was enough,appellees argued,that appellant successfully adopted a position in the bankruptcy proceeding inconsistent with the position he takes here.agreeing,the district court granted summary judgment for appellees.we affirm.
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment,in this case,the appellant.agusty reyes dep t of educ.of,cir.for clarity sake,our recitation of the facts is divided into subsections that describe the chronology of events in two parallel actions.
bankruptcy proceedings 
on september,kevin guay and his wife filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new hampshire.on june,the case was converted to a chapter proceeding.the claims advanced here did not appear as an asset on the guays initial bankruptcy schedules,as the events giving rise to the claims had not yet occurred.
civil lawsuit 
in early,while still in bankruptcy,the guays were subjects of a police investigation into alleged violations of state environmental protection laws on march,defendant sean ford,a concord,new hampshire police detective,secured search warrants allowing extensive excavation of two properties owned by the guays.during execution of the warrants on march and,officers also searched the guays home,which was not included in either warrant.the officers also denied the guays and their tenants access to other properties the couple owned for which no warrant was obtained.the search caused extensive damage to the guays properties and was widely reported in television and print media.
on june,kevin guay,acting pro se,filed suit in federal court under against ford and various other defendants claiming a violation of his fourth,fifth and fourteenth amendment rights he also raised state law claims of malicious prosecution,malicious abuse of process,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.a month later,lorraine guay,also pro se,filed a substantially similar suit and the district court ordered the two actions consolidated.
c.the guays failure to disclose the existence of their claims to the bankruptcy court 
throughout their bankruptcy proceeding,the guays failed to file amended asset schedules identifying their lawsuits as assets,as required by a and a.during an august,meeting of the guays creditors,an attorney for the state of new hampshire asked the guays about various civil lawsuits in which they were plaintiffs,including those at issue here.the lawsuits were discussed among the guays,their counsel,counsel for the state,and the bankruptcy trustee,and the guays counsel offered to provide the trustee with copies of all the relevant filings.it is unclear whether these documents were ever provided,but the guays never formally disclosed the existence of the claims by amending their asset schedules.
later in august,the state of new hampshire filed a motion seeking an order requiring the guays to demonstrate why they should not be held in contempt for failing to file required monthly operating statements and amended bankruptcy schedules.the motion noted that these filings were required both by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure and by the bankruptcy court order converting the bankruptcy matter from a chapter to a chapter proceeding.in response to this motion,the bankruptcy court ordered the guays to file the additional information required by bankruptcy rules and,including information concerning any property interest acquired subsequent to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.the order required the guays to file this information by october.
before that deadline arrived,the bankruptcy court granted the guays a discharge on october pursuant to.this order discharged all debts eligible for discharge in a chapter bankruptcy,but did not dismiss the case or end the trustee responsibility for the estate.accordingly,in response to the court earlier order,the guays filed an affidavit with the bankruptcy court on october stating that no amendments to their petition or asset schedules were necessary.
several days later,the state of new hampshire filed another motion in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking an order finding the guays in contempt for failing to file monthly operating reports and the disclosures required by bankruptcy rule.the guays filed an opposition to this motion,stating that the debtors have filed an affidavit stating that the information provided in their bankruptcy schedules as amended was accurate and there are no changes,and again affirming the completeness and accuracy of their bankruptcy schedules and failing to identify their lawsuits as assets.
shortly thereafter,in a december order,the magistrate judge handling this civil action ordered the parties to submit additional briefing on the issue of whether the bankruptcy trustee,and not the guays,was the real party in interest in this lawsuit.in doing so,the court noted that the trustee had not abandoned the action.in their supplemental brief,the defendants raised the issue of judicial estoppel for the first time.subsequently,on january,the guays filed with the bankruptcy court a report of unpaid chapter obligations in which they identified their claims in this lawsuit the chapter trustee then filed a notice of abandonment with respect to the guays lawsuits,explaining that she had determined that the lawsuits are burdensome and of inconsequential value to the estate.this notice was served on the guays creditors,who were given the opportunity to object to the trustee action if they believed the lawsuits had significant value.none objected.
d.the district court application of judicial estoppel 
the appellees moved to dismiss the guays claims on multiple grounds,including judicial estoppel.they argued that,because the guays failed to disclose their claims to the bankruptcy court,they were barred from bringing the same claims in this action.deferring resolution of the judicial estoppel issue until the factual record was better developed,the district court adopted in march the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissed most of the guays claims for failure to allege facts supporting the claims.the only surviving claims were kevin guay malicious abuse of process claim against ford,the city of concord,and the concord police department,and the fourth amendment claims of both guays against ford in his personal capacity.
after several months of discovery,the remaining defendants moved for summary judgment,again raising the judicial estoppel defense.on november,after de novo review,the district court adopted the recommended decision of the magistrate judge and granted the motion on the basis of the guays failure to disclose their claims in their bankruptcy proceeding.
typically,a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.velez thermo king de,cir.however,when reviewing application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel the applicable rubric is abuse of discretion.alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir.in alternative system concepts,we explained that the abuse of discretion standard is appropriate even when reviewing a judicial estoppel ruling on a motion for summary judgment.id.at.we identified several reasons for applying the standard in this context,including the discretionary nature of judicial estoppel,the district court closer relationship to the facts of the case and the litigants conduct,the flexibility of the abuse of discretion standard,and the fact that other circuits that have addressed the question have unanimously settled on abuse of discretion as the appropriate standard.id.at.we concluded that t he fact that this case arises in the summary judgment context does not affect our decision to review the trial court determination for abuse of discretion.id.at see also thore howe,cir reviewing application of judicial estoppel upon a motion for summary judgment under the abuse of discretion standard.
under the abuse of discretion standard,we will not lightly substitute our judgment for that of the district court,and will reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment.lamboy ortiz ortiz velez,cir quoting tang state of,dep t of elderly affairs,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court has noted,deference is the hallmark of review.joiner,d.
a.the doctrine of judicial estoppel 
the equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel is ordinarily applied to prevent a litigant from pressing a claim that is inconsistent with a position taken by that litigant either in a prior legal proceeding or in an earlier phase of the same legal proceeding.alternative.concepts,at quoting intergen grina,cir.where one succeeds in asserting a certain position in a legal proceeding,one may not assume a contrary position in a subsequent proceeding simply because one interests have changed.new hampshire maine,d.we have explained that,t he doctrine primary utility is to safeguard the integrity of the courts by preventing parties from improperly manipulating the machinery of the justice system.alternative.concepts,at.although we have characterized the archetypal judicial estoppel case as one in which a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts,id.internal quotation marks omitted,such tactics are not a prerequisite for application of the doctrine.a party is not automatically excused from judicial estoppel if the earlier statement was made in good faith.thore,at.
there are two generally conditions for the application of judicial estoppel.first,the estopping position and the estopped position must be directly inconsistent,that is,mutually exclusive.alternative.concepts,at.second,the responsible party must have succeeded in persuading a court to accept its prior position.id.there is also a third factor that asks whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.new hampshire,at.we generally have not required a showing of unfair advantage.see thore,at noting that this circuit has rejected benefit as a prerequisite to application of the doctrine alternative.concepts,at noting that unfair advantage is not a formal element of a claim of judicial estoppel.where unfair advantage exists,however,it is a powerful factor in favor of applying the doctrine.see perry blum,cir alternative.concepts,at.
finally,it is that a failure to identify a claim as an asset in a bankruptcy proceeding is a prior inconsistent position that may serve as the basis for application of judicial estoppel,barring the debtor from pursuing the claim in a later proceeding.see moses howard,e very circuit that has addressed the issue has found that judicial estoppel is justified to bar a debtor from pursuing a cause of action in district court where that debtor deliberately fails to disclose the pending suit in a bankruptcy case.payless wholesale,alberto culver,cir h aving obtained judicial bankruptcy relief on the representation that no claims existed,plaintiff can not now resurrect them and obtain relief on the opposite basis.
b.the district court application of judicial estoppel to the guays claims 
in adopting the magistrate judge recommended decision that judicial estoppel barred the guays claims,the district court emphasized the guays failure to disclose their claims in the bankruptcy proceeding and the discharge obtained in that proceeding.kevin guay however,raises three arguments on appeal he did not take contradictory positions in his bankruptcy and civil cases,the bankruptcy court did not adopt the schedules in that proceeding,and even if his position here is inconsistent with that taken in the bankruptcy proceeding,and even if the bankruptcy court adopted his position in that proceeding,it is not equitable to apply judicial estoppel in this case.
the guays inconsistent positions before the bankruptcy court and the district court 
under the rules governing the bankruptcy proceeding,appellant had an obligation to disclose all assets to the bankruptcy court,a and a,including legal claims and potential claims,see moses,at a debtor is required to disclose all potential claims in a bankruptcy petition.howe richardson,cir like all of debtor property,his legal claims became part of the bankruptcy estate under the bankruptcy code.this disclosure must take the form of a schedule identifying all assets,a,and the debtor must amend his asset schedules and petition if circumstances change during the bankruptcy proceeding,see a stating that estate property includes a ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case moses,at a debtor is under a duty both to disclose the existence of pending lawsuits when he files a petition in bankruptcy and to amend his petition if circumstances change during the course of the bankruptcy.
the guays failed to meet this baseline obligation to amend their bankruptcy schedules,even when ordered by the court to do so.in september,the bankruptcy court ordered the guays to file certain information required by the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,including amended asset schedules.in response,the guays filed an affidavit stating 
we have reviewed our bankruptcy petition and amendments as filed and find that there is no additional information to include on our petition or amendments.
we make the foregoing declaration under penalty of perjury.
the guays again denied the existence of the claims they seek to bring here in their opposition to new hampshire motion for contempt.they stated that,i n accordance with the court request,the debtors have filed an affidavit stating that the information provided in their bankruptcy schedules as amended was accurate and there are no changes.accordingly,in addition to neglect of their general duty to disclose newly acquired assets,the guays twice represented to the bankruptcy court that no such assets existed.
these averments,and their general failure to update their bankruptcy schedules,are plainly inconsistent with the guays conduct in bringing their claims now.as the eleventh circuit has explained,b y failing to update her bankruptcy schedule to reflect her newly filed claim,debtor represented that she had no legal claims to the bankruptcy court while simultaneously pursuing her legal claim in the district court.these actions,both taken under oath,are clearly inconsistent.robinson tyson foods,cir.
the bankruptcy court acceptance of the position advanced in the guays asset schedule 
a bankruptcy court accepts a position taken in the form of omissions from bankruptcy schedules when it grants the debtor relief,such as discharge,on the basis of those filings.compare cannon stokes potter,cir debtor had represented that she had no claim against defendant that representation had prevailed she had obtained a valuable benefit in the discharge of her debt,and payless wholesale,at debtor having obtained judicial relief on the representation that no claims existed,can not now resurrect them and obtain relief on the opposite basis,with divittorio hsbc bank,usa,in re divittorio,stating that a position advanced in bankruptcy schedules had not been accepted when the bankruptcy court ha s not granted the debtor any relief,such as a discharge,based upon representations made in them.
here,the guays were discharged from bankruptcy on october.although discharge preceded the guays representations to the court that no changes to the schedules were necessary,it occurred months after the guays became aware of their claims and the obligation to amend the schedules had arisen.accordingly,the bankruptcy court acce
