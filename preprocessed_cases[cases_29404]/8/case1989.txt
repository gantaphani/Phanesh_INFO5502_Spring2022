at issue in this appeal is whether the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge,the venue for multidistrict securities litigation arising from the collapse of worldcom,was authorized to enter an injunction ordering an alabama state court to postpone the trial of a related case until after the district court had completed its own trial.on april,the district court ordered the alabama action to be rescheduled from october,to a date no earlier than sixty days following the completion of a class action trial that is scheduled to begin in the district court on january.see in re worldcom.sec,d.the plaintiffs in the alabama action,collectively known as the retirement systems of alabama rsa,who are not plaintiffs in the securities litigation in the district court,appeal from the injunction.
we conclude that the district court injunction was barred by the act,which permits a federal court to enjoin a state court proceeding only where expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.the district court reasoned that the trial date of october,in the alabama action would disrupt the district court own trial date of january,and that an injunction postponing the alabama action was therefore necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.see in re worldcom.sec,d at.we hold that the necessary in aid of its jurisdiction exception to the act does not permit a district a district court managing complex,multidistrict litigation such as the worldcom securities enjoin state court proceedings simply to preserve its trial date.
background 
a.the securities litigation in the district court 
on june,worldcom announced a massive restatement of its financial statements,precipitating the filing of numerous individual and class actions in state and federal courts across the country.
on august,numerous class actions that had been filed in the southern district of new york were consolidated before judge cote under the caption in re worldcom.securities litigation.the consolidated class action complaint named former officers and directors of worldcom,underwriters of worldcom may and may bond offerings,worldcom former auditor arthur andersen,worldcom chief outside analyst jack grubman,and grubman employers,salomon smith barney and citigroup.the complaint asserted claims under sections,a and of the securities act of securities act and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of exchange act.
worldcom filed for bankruptcy in july largest bankruptcy filing in united states history.thereafter,the defendants in various state court actions removed those actions to federal court on the ground that they were related to worldcom bankruptcy.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl panel ordered that actions pending in federal courts across the country,including actions that had been removed from state court,be centralized in the southern district of new york before judge cote.prior to the mdl panel order,however,a handful of actions removed to federal court had been remanded to state court.one of these state court actions,retirement systems of alabama morgan chase,no.cv a pr.cir,montgomery county the alabama action,is pending in the alabama circuit court for montgomery county,and is the subject of this appeal.
in december,the consolidated class action and the actions transferred by the mdl,the securities litigation were consolidated for pretrial purposes.the district court certified a class on october,and shortly thereafter set a date of january,for the trial of the consolidated class action,with the trials of the individual actions to follow.
in november,the defendants in the securities litigation requested that plaintiffs counsel in one of the remanded state court actions be required to participate in depositions in the securities litigation to avoid duplicative discovery.this request led to an exchange in which the parties,judge cote,and the state court judges in the remanded actions attempted to coordinate discovery in their related actions.on january,judge cote issued a discovery coordination order the coordination order,and sent it to the state court judges in the three remanded actions the alabama action,and actions in illinois and pennsylvania that were approaching or were already in the discovery stage.the coordination order,which invited the state judges to sign it if they wished to adopt it,provided that d iscovery and trial in the remanded a ctions shall not delay or interfere with discovery in and trial of the class action in the securities litigation in the southern district of new york,and that the first trial would be the class action trial in the securities litigation,scheduled for january.id.at.
the state court judges in each of the three remanded actions have generally coordinated discovery in those actions with discovery in the securities litigation.additionally,the state court judges in two of the remanded actions,those in illinois and pennsylvania,scheduled their respective trials to follow the class action trial in the securities litigation.in contrast,judge charles price,presiding over the alabama action,declined to adopt all the principles of the coordination order,and scheduled trial to begin on october,months in advance of the class action trial date in the securities litigation.
b.the alabama action 
the alabama action was filed on july,months after the first class action was filed in the southern district of new york.the complaint alleges violations of federal and alabama statutory and common law,including claims under sections,and of the securities act that are also pleaded in the securities litigation.the defendants include two former worldcom officers former cfo scott sullivan and former ceo bernard ebbers,six investment banks that are also named in the securities litigation bank of america,morgan chase,banc of america securities llc,morgan securities,citigroup,and citigroup global markets,arthur andersen,and bear stearns.only bear stearns is not a defendant in the securities litigation.as described by the district court 
the alabama action arises from and pleads the same course of conduct on which the securities litigation is premised.it seeks damages for one of the two massive bond offerings at issue in the securities may bond well as for intermedia bonds sold in october of by bear stearns.even the latter category of claims,however,emanates from the same underlying financial fraud within worldcom that is the basis of the claims in the securities litigation.
id.at.the plaintiffs in the alabama action are several retirement funds,collectively referred to as the retirement systems of rsa.notably,rsa is not a party to any of the various federal actions consolidated in the securities litigation,and expressly opted out of the consolidated class action.
the alabama action was removed to the united states district court for the middle district of alabama,but then remanded to state court on september.the defendants in the alabama action appealed the remand order,and on june,the eleventh circuit dismissed their appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.on january,the supreme court denied the defendants petition for a writ of certiorari.
on february,the defendants in the alabama action moved in that case for the adoption of judge cote coordination order.on march,before judge price had ruled on the motion,defendants moved in the alternative to modify judge price scheduling order by extending the trial date of october,by nine months.on march,judge price denied defendants motions.
c.the district court injunction 
after judge price denied defendants requests for a later trial date,defendants applied to judge cote,pursuant to the all writs act,for an order directing rsa to show cause why a writ should not issue that would stay trial of the alabama action until after the conclusion of the class action trial in the securities litigation.the district court entered the requested order to show cause on march.rsa and judge price filed responses to the order,and alabama attorney general filed an amicus curiae brief in opposition to the all writs act application.
on april,the district court ordered that the circuit court of alabama is enjoined from resolving any summary judgment motion or beginning the trial in the alabama action until at least sixty days following the entry of a verdict in the class action trial in the securities litigation.worldcom,d at.the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that the injunction was precluded by the act,which bars a federal court from enjoining a state court proceeding unless the injunction is expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.the court held that the injunction was necessary in aid of its jurisdiction because it was necessary to preserve the schedule in the securities litigation and to keep the federal mdl litigation on its own path to judgment.worldcom,d at see also id.at a limited injunction of the alabama action is warranted here to the extent that its schedule interferes with the class action trial in the securities litigation.
the district court determined that,i f the alabama action proceeds to trial in october,or at any time before the class action trial,it will inevitably delay the beginning of the class action trial far beyond january.id.at.the district court identified two causes for the delay.first,the court found that a decision on a summary judgment motion or any verdict in the alabama action will necessarily engender complicated and motion practice in the class action in order to permit the ramifications,including any collateral estoppel effect,of that litigation to be determined before the class action trial begins.id.second,the court found that t he energies of the defendants in the class action who are also defendants in the alabama action will necessarily be diverted by the need to prepare for and participate in the alabama action october trial.id.at.the court concluded that t he date for the class action trial will be held hostage to the alabama action,and this court ability to control the schedule of this complex,securities litigation will be hamstrung.id.at.
the district court also noted that following an enormous investment of effort,the class action is at an advanced stage,id.at,that the alabama plaintiffs have not been able to articulate any valid reason why their action should be tried in,id.at,and that the injunction will impact only the timing of the alabama action,id.
proceedings in this court 
on april,rsa and the circuit court filed an interlocutory appeal from the district court injunction on may,rsa moved in the district court for a stay of the injunction,which was denied.this court,on june,granted rsa motion to expedite the appeal.on june,rsa filed a motion for a stay in this court,which the motions panel referred to the merits panel.
we heard oral argument on the morning of august.that afternoon,we entered a summary order vacating the district court injunction,and stating that an opinion would follow in due course 
ii.discussion 
rsa argues on appeal that the district court injunction violated the act,violated the eleventh amendment,was contrary to the doctrine,and was contrary to the abstention required by younger harris,d.because we hold that the injunction violated the act,we do not reach the other grounds.
standard of review 
we review the district court issuance of an injunction for abuse of discretion.see in re,cir.to the extent a district court injunction involves questions of law,review is plenary but a district court findings of fact may be overturned only if clearly erroneous.see id.
the district court found that an injunction was necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,and concluded that an injunction was therefore permissible under the all writs act and the act.see worldcom,d at.we review the district court factual finding of necessity for clear error,see,at,and its interpretation of the all writs act and the act de novo.
b.the all writs act and the act 
statutory language 
the all writs act,a,provides federal courts with the power to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.this grant of authority is limited by the act,which bars a federal court from enjoining a proceeding in state court unless that action is expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.if the district court injunction was in fact necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,then the injunction was authorized by the all writs act,and was not barred by the act.if,as rsa argues,the injunction was not necessary in aid of the district court jurisdiction,then it exceeded the district court authority under the all writs act the absence of another applicable statutory the act 
in interpreting the act,the supreme court has directed that a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy.atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.
injunctions in in rem and in personam actions 
the supreme court in kline burke construction,addressing the propriety of enjoining actions under the all writs act,distinguished in rem from in personam actions.a federal court with jurisdiction over an in rem action may enjoin a state court action involving the same res,because the effect of filing the in rem action in federal court is to draw to the federal court the possession or control,actual or potential,of the res,and a state court exercise of jurisdiction necessarily impairs,and may defeat,the federal court jurisdiction.id.at.in contrast,an in personam action involves a controversy over liability rather than over possession of a thing a controversy over a mere question of personal liability does not involve the possession or control of a thing,and an action brought to enforce such a liability does not tend to impair or defeat the jurisdiction of the court in which a prior action for the same cause is pending.id.at.the court held that where the action first brought is in personam and seeks only a personal judgment,another action for the same cause in another jurisdiction is not precluded.id.the court concluded that a federal district court,hearing a suit in equity arising from a contract dispute,lacked authority under the all writs act to enjoin a parallel action in arkansas state court for breach of contract.see id.at.
since kline,the supreme court has never held that a district court may enjoin,as necessary in aid of the district court jurisdiction,a parallel in personam state action.see vendo,d plurality opinion we have never viewed parallel in personam actions as interfering with the jurisdiction of either court.there is no dispute that the securities litigation,although a complex,multidistrict litigation,is an in personam action against defendants.defendants argue that,under our decision in in re,the securities litigation is the virtual equivalent of a res,id.at,so that the district court was authorized to enjoin a related action in the alabama circuit court.
and its application 
we recognized in that an injunction may be appropriate even in in personam actions under certain limited circumstances.involved a federal multidistrict securities action brought by a class of annuity holders against of the annuities.see at.eighteen of the defendants signed stipulations of settlement with the plaintiff class,and the district court gave preliminary approval to the settlements and scheduled a fairness hearing.see id.at.representatives of forty states in the national association of attorneys general,who were not parties to the lawsuit,expressed concern that the proposed settlement would not adequately compensate class members.the state of new york gave notice of its intent to file a parens patriae action in a new york court to seek restitution on behalf of the new york citizens in the plaintiff class.see id.at.the district court enjoined the states pursuant to the all writs act from filing suit in state courts,reasoning that any such lawsuits would likely impair the federal court jurisdiction by undermining the settlements reached with the eighteen defendants and the ongoing settlement negotiations with the other eight defendants.see id.of the states appealed,claiming that the district court had exceeded its authority under the all writs act.see id.at.
we held that the district court injunction was authorized under the all writs act we acknowledged that the mere existence of a parallel lawsuit in state court that seeks to adjudicate the same in personam cause of action does not in itself provide sufficient grounds for an injunction against a state action in favor of a pending federal action.id.at.we held,however,that a s for the defendants participating in the stipulated settlements,the injunction was necessary or appropriate in aid of the court jurisdiction,id.at,because t he circumstances faced by the district court threatened to frustrate proceedings in a federal action of substantial scope,which had already consumed vast amounts of judicial time and was nearing completion,id.at.we further explained 
the existence of multiple and harassing actions by the states could only serve to frustrate the district court efforts to craft a settlement in the multidistrict litigation before it.the success of any federal settlement was dependent on the parties ability to agree to the release of any and all related civil claims the plaintiffs had against the settling defendants based on the same facts.if states or others could derivatively assert the same claims on behalf of the same class or members of it,there could be no certainty about the finality of any federal settlement.any substantial risk of this prospect would threaten all of the settlement efforts by the district court and destroy the utility of the multidistrict forum otherwise ideally suited to resolving such broad claims.
id.at.we concluded,i n effect,unlike the situation in the kline burke construction line of cases,the district court had before it a class action proceeding so far advanced that it was the virtual equivalent of a res over which the district judge required full control.id.
we held that the question was closer as to the class claims against the eight defendants who had not yet settled 
so long as there is a substantially significant prospect that these defendants will settle in the reasonably near future,we conclude that the injunction entered by the district court is not improper.if,however,at some point in the continued progress of the actions against the remaining defendants it should appear that prompt settlement was no longer likely,we anticipate that upon application the injunction against parallel actions by the states might be lifted in that event the situation would fall within the kline rule that in personam proceedings in state court can not be enjoined merely because they are duplicative of actions being heard in federal court.
id.at.we therefore affirmed the district court injunction.
clearly,our decision in did not create a blanket rule or presumption that a federal court in any multidistrict action may enjoin parallel state proceedings we held that an injunction of related state court proceedings could be warranted even in an in personam action,but it was crucial to our analysis that most of the defendants had already settled,and that there was a substantially significant prospect that the other eight defendants will settle in the reasonably near future.id.indeed,we added that if it should appear that prompt settlement was no longer likely the situation would fall within the kline rule that in personam proceedings in state court can not be enjoined merely because they are duplicative of actions being heard in federal court.id.
defendants argue that here,as in,an injunction was necessary to prevent proceedings in the alabama action from thwarting settlement discussions in the securities litigation.they also argue that,even setting aside the prospects of settlement,the injunction was proper because a trial in the alabama action would interfere with the trial schedule in the securities litigation.
whether the injunction was justified as necessary to preserve the prospects of settlement 
defendants first the district court injunction was justified under by the need to protect the possibility of settlement in the securities be quickly rejected.
the district court did not rely on the prospect of a prompt settlement in concluding that an injunction was proper.nevertheless,defendants assert that,at the time of the district court injunction,t he parties had been involved in settlement discussions under the auspices of two federal judicial officers,which would alone be sufficient under to sustain the district court conclusion.appellees br.at citations omitted.
defendants do not directly allege that here,as in,there was a substantially significant prospect of settlement in the reasonably near future,at,or that prompt settlement was likely,id.they simply note that settlement discussions in fact occurred,and on may,two weeks after the district court injunction,two and citigroup global markets a memorandum of agreement with the plaintiff class in the securities litigation,settling the class action claims.see in re worldcom.sec,civ,civ,wl,at may.yet the fact that settlement discussions occurred in no way suggests that prompt settlement was likely.nor can the district court injunction be retroactively justified by the bare fact that,two weeks later,two defendants settled the class action claims against them.
even if defendants had demonstrated that,as in,a prompt settlement in the securities litigation was likely,they have failed to explain how the district court injunction was necessary to protect that prospective settlement.defendants therefore have not shown that the rationale of an actual or impending settlement in a federal action from being undone or thwarted by the district court injunction of the alabama action.
ii.whether the injunction was justified as necessary to preserve the district court trial date 
the district court found that the injunction was necessary in aid of its jurisdiction because an october trial in the alabama action would inevitably delay the beginning of the class action trial far beyond january.worldcom,d at.the court relied on broad language in that the need to enjoin conflicting state proceedings arises because the jurisdiction of a multidistrict court is analogous to that of a court in an in rem action where it is intolerable to have conflicting orders from different courts.id.at quoting,at emphasis omitted.as discussed above,did not hold that multidistrict class actions are,in general,to be deemed virtual in rem proceedings it involved circumstances where an injunction was necessary to preserve a settlement or the prospects of an imminent settlement.defendants nonetheless argue that there are other circumstances,including the circumstances of this case,in which a district court may,as necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,enjoin a related proceeding.
as an initial matter,we note that a federal district court,even assuming it has some interest in avoiding delay in its own proceedings,has no interest that can be vindicated by the exercise of the federal injunction being the first court to hold a trial on the merits.we have held that a district court may not issue an injunction simply to be the first court to reach a judgment and thereby avoid issues of collateral estoppel 
there is no reason why a state court can not or should not determine issues of fact and state law relevant thereto as they come up in the state litigation.the subsequent effect of collateral estoppel,far from requiring the federal court to stay proceedings in the state court,is a result which should be welcomed to avoid the task of reconsidering issues which have already been settled by another competent tribunal.
vernitron benjamin,cir.accordingly,the district court could only have sought to justify its injunction as necessary to preserve its trial date,rather than as necessary to allow it to hold the first trial.
at issue,therefore,is whether an injunction that is necessary to avoid delay in the district court
