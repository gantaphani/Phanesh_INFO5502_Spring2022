introduction 
underlying this appeal are massive asbestos liability claims against appellee corning,incorporated corning,and a company in which corning owns of the stock,pittsburgh corning corporation pcc.however,the immediate issues are whether a state or federal forum will determine certain insurers claims that their policies do not cover asbestos claims against corning and whether we have jurisdiction to review the determination of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge that the claims belong in federal court because they are core to pcc pennsylvania bankruptcy proceeding.
the appellants in this procedurally complicated appeal are insurers that issued liability coverage to appellee corning.because ten of the policies that appellants issued also provided coverage for corning affiliates,we refer to the casualty company,american home assurance company,travelers casualty surety company,and the london market the affiliate insurers 
the affiliate insurers wish to have their liability to corning assessed in new york state supreme court while corning prefers a federal forum.as we explain in more detail below,before we can decide whether this declaratory judgment action,commenced in state court,should be tried there,we must thread our way through issues of appellate jurisdiction,abstention,and bankruptcy law.for the moment,we confine ourselves to a brief outline of the procedural history of this appeal and the issues it presents.
corning owned half the stock in pcc.in,liability claims forced pcc into bankruptcy.in,in a new york state court,two of corning insurers,mckinley insurance company and everest reinsurance company everest,brought a declaratory judgment action against corning and all of corning excess insurers including appellants.mckinley and everest sought a declaration that they owed no liability to corning for asbestos claims whether those claims stemmed from corning activities or from pcc.corning removed the lawsuit to the united states district court for the southern district of new york and sought transfer to the western district of pennsylvania where pcc bankruptcy proceeding was pending.the insurers,both plaintiffs and defendants,moved for a remand,arguing that mandatory abstention pursuant to c applied because they had commenced a lawsuit in state court and their claims against corning were not core to pcc bankruptcy proceeding.
the district court remanded claims against those insurers whose policies specifically excluded pcc from coverage,but held that because the affiliate insurers policies could potentially cover pcc,claims against these insurers were core to the pennsylvania bankruptcy proceeding and abstention was neither required nor appropriate.the court also stayed adjudication of the affiliate claims pending resolution of an adversary action between pcc and the affiliate insurers in pennsylvania.
the affiliate insurers appeal from the district court order,and corning moves to dismiss the appeal.corning principally contends that the district court order is neither final nor within our collateral order jurisdiction.because the district court order finally and conclusively determined the important collateral issue of whether the affiliate policy claims will be adjudicated in state or federal court,we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.because resolving corning entitlement to coverage from its insurers is not core to pcc reorganization proceedings,we vacate the district court order and remand for a determination of whether the issues in this lawsuit can be speedily resolved in state court.see c.
background 
corning and ppg industries,ppg are equal owners of pcc.between and,pcc manufactured and sold unibestos,which contains asbestos.corning also produced an product,corhart.thousands of individuals allegedly injured by unibestos have sued both pcc and corning.others have sued corning based on their exposure to corhart.
on april,pcc filed a voluntary chapter petition in the bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania.on may,pcc announced a plan of reorganization that included a billion trust for asbestos claimants.according to the plan,both ppg and its insurers would contribute to this fund.the plan did not include contributions from corning insurers.nor was corning a party to the plan or the bankruptcy proceeding.
in may,ppg filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court against its insurance carriers,including some of the carriers who are defendants in this lawsuit.
on july,mckinley and everest,two of corning excess carriers,filed a declaratory judgment action in new york county supreme court against corning and all of the insurers that provided commercial general liability coverage for corning between and.mckinley and everest sought a declaration that they had no obligation to provide coverage for corning with respect to unibestos or corhart they also sought a declaration of their rights and obligations in relation to the defendants including the affiliate insurers.the aggregate value of the affiliate policies issued by the affiliate insurers is million.
on july,corning removed the mckinley lawsuit from state supreme court.the next day corning filed an adversary proceeding against the same insurers in the bankruptcy court.within the adversary proceeding,corning sought a declaration of its rights in each of the policies.within the removed proceeding,corning requested a transfer to the western district of pennsylvania,dismissal of all proceedings for failure to join pcc as a necessary party,or a stay of all proceedings.the insurers moved for a remand to state court or abstention,contending that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction the court was required to abstain the court should exercise its discretion to abstain and remand was required because corning removal procedures were defective.
in a march,opinion and order,the district court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the affiliate insurers claims because these proceedings were core to pcc reorganization in the western district of pennsylvania.the claims against and by the affiliate insurers were core because 
it is undisputed that indemnification insurance is crucial to pcc ability to reorganize.a determination regarding the availability of the million from the ten affiliate policies will be material to that reorganization effort.these affiliate policies are equivalent to approximately of the size of the proposed trust announced in may.comprehensive resolution of the claims at stake in the insurance program will directly affect the core bankruptcy function of distributing and administering the debtor assets.
mckinley ins.corning,wl,at.
having found that the claims against the affiliate insurers were core claims,the court held that it was not required to abstain pursuant to c,which applies only to matters.id.at.in a ruling that is not contested on appeal,the court also found that neither discretionary abstention nor an equitable remand was appropriate.id.at.
based on its abstention analysis,the court determined that it would exercise jurisdiction over the affiliate insurer claims.because t he claims in this action that address the affiliate policies,duplicate d an adversary proceeding pending before the pennsylvania bankruptcy court,the court found it unnecessary to transfer the claims to pennsylvania.id.at.instead,it stayed the action to allow the bankruptcy court to fulfill its obligation to administer pcc bankruptcy estate efficiently.id.
as to the insurers against whom pcc had made no claim for coverage the insurers,the district court remanded,finding that corning ha d failed to show that resolution of the declaratory judgment action with respect to the policies,which not only fail ed to name the debtor,but in fact specifically exclude d the debtor from coverage,ha d a conceivable effect on the debtor bankruptcy estate.id.at.
on june,the district court denied made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.see mckinley ins.corning,wl june.the affiliate insurers filed a timely notice of appeal from that portion of th e court order entered on march,denying,with regard to the ten affiliate policies issued by said parties,the motions to remand,or alternatively,to abstain and remand under c,and staying this action with regard to the affiliate policies.
in the meantime,the affiliate insurers had moved in the western district of pennsylvania for an order withdrawing the district court reference of the affiliate policy claims to the bankruptcy court.after judge cote decision,the pennsylvania district court requested additional briefing on the issue preclusive effect of her holding that the affiliate insurer claims were core to the reorganization proceeding.in response,corning asserted that this determination was issue preclusive because,among other things,the affiliate insurers did not include it in their notice of appeal.
on january,corning moved to dismiss this appeal.the affiliate insurers opposed this motion and sought its consolidation with the appeal.on august,we denied both motions without prejudice to renewal after oral argument.the motion to consolidate was effectively granted at argument and the motion to dismiss is deemed renewed.
discussion 
motion to dismiss.
corning argues that we should dismiss this appeal because the district court order is not final and does not fall within the collateral order exception to the final order rule.the company further argues that appealing the abstention decision violates b,which prohibits appeals of certain decisions to remand or not to remand.finally,corning contends that because the affiliate insurers did not state in their notice of appeal that they appealed from the district court core determination,they can not raise this issue on appeal.
collateral order jurisdiction.
permits appeals of final decisions of the district courts.the affiliate insurers concede that the district court order is not final in the ordinary sense,but contend that it is an appealable collateral order.an appealable collateral order is one that conclusively determine s a disputed question that is completely separate from the merits of the action,effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment,and too important to be denied review.ouackenbush allstate ins,d internal citations,brackets,and quotation marks omitted.corning questions whether the district court order is unreviewable on final appeal,whether it is important,and whether it is conclusive.
ultimate reviewability 
a decision to abstain falls within the collateral order exception because it surrenders federal jurisdiction to a state court.id.at.however,under ordinary circumstances,a refusal to abstain would be reviewable on appeal from a final judgment,making the collateral order exception inapplicable.see beightol ubs painewebber,cir see also in re rupp bowman,cir unlike the reverse situation in which the bankruptcy court abstains and is then bound as a matter of res judicata to honor the judgment of the state court,thus rendering the abstention decision effectively unreviewable on appeal,the instant case poses no such concerns.rather,once the bankruptcy court renders a final judgment,the parties aggrieved by the refusal to abstain will be free to appeal that decision and to challenge the appropriateness of the decision not to abstain.internal citation omitted.
the affiliate insurers argue,however,that the circumstances in this case are not ordinary.because the new york district court stayed the claims,the insurers contend that the pennsylvania district court will have the final say on both abstention and the merits of the claims.thus,there will be no further decision on abstention by the new york district court,which will be obliged to enter judgment in new york in accord with the pennsylvania judgment.moreover,the affiliate insurers argue,corning has attempted to persuade the pennsylvania district court to accord issue preclusive effect to the new york district court determination that the claims are core proceedings.if corning is successful,the pennsylvania district court will not consider the mandatory abstention issue on the merits,and the third circuit will examine the district court determination only to consider whether the court was correct in its issue preclusion holding.the insurers also contend that,even if the pennsylvania district court does not accord issue preclusive effect to the new york district court determination,the pennsylvania court likely will refuse to abstain because the new york district court retained jurisdiction over the claims and there is no longer a pending state proceeding to which the cases could be remanded.
corning suggests in response that the abstention issue can be reviewed after final judgment in pennsylvania.however,corning has been unable to suggest a scenario pursuant to which this review would occur.
we believe that,in the event we were to hold that we lack jurisdiction to consider the claims,the pennsylvania district court almost certainly would view the new york district court abstention decision as issue preclusive.coupled with corning vigorous attempt to obtain the benefit of issue preclusion in pennsylvania,the likely success of that attempt persuades us that the order under review is sufficiently final for purposes of the collateral order exception.the pennsylvania district court will apply the third circuit issue preclusion rules.that court accords issue preclusive effect to a decision from another district court if the issue sought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the prior action that issue was actually litigated it was determined by a final and valid judgment and the determination was essential to the prior judgment.burlington northern.hyundai merchant marine,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
the finality requirement is flexible.see id.at.in particular,the third circuit does not require that the parallel district court have issued an appealable order.id.it will grant preclusive effect if it finds that an action is sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect.id.quoting in re brown,cir.to determine whether the resolution is sufficiently firm,the district court should consider whether the parties were fully heard,whether a reasoned opinion was filed,and whether that decision could have been,or actually was,appealed.id.in this case,the parties were fully heard and the district court issued a reasoned opinion.in the event that we were to dismiss the affiliate insurers appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,we do not believe that the pennsylvania district court would deny preclusive effect based solely on the theoretical possibility that we would review the abstention decision on appeal from a final judgment.
moreover,the claim preclusive effect of the pennsylvania court judgment would bar further litigation in the southern district.therefore,on appeal,we would review only whether the southern district ultimately made the correct judgment on claim preclusion and not whether it correctly abstained as an initial matter.
given the strong likelihood that the district court refusal to abstain will receive no further review if we dismiss this interlocutory corning active attempt to achieve that hold that the district court order satisfies the quackenbush standard.as a practical matter,the district court order would conclusively determine which forum will decide the merits of this dispute.minot,cir.although minot and other cases permitting interlocutory review,see,quackenbush,at,involved decisions to abstain and not,as here,a refusal to abstain,this order,like the orders in quackenbush and minot,conclusively determines where the claims will be litigated.
in light of our holding,we have no need to address the affiliate insurers alternative even if the pennsylvania district court refused to grant issue preclusive effect to the southern district core jurisdiction conclusion,the latter court refusal to abstain and to remand to state court would influence the pennsylvania district court to retain jurisdiction because there would no longer be an action pending in new york in which corning claims could be adjudicated in a timely manner.see c.
ii.conclusive determination 
although corning argues that the district court did not make a conclusive determination on abstention,its argument on this point duplicates its argument on reviewability.we reject it for the same reasons that we rejected the reviewability argument.
iii.importance 
corning also contends that the affiliate insurers failed to establish that the district court refusal to abstain presents an important issue.we disagree.the quackenbush court determined that the rights asserted on appeal from the district court abstention decision are,in our view,sufficiently important to warrant an immediate appeal.at.in quackenbush,the important right was the right to stay in federal court.id.here it is the right of the affiliate insurers to go back to their original forum,new york supreme court.because the concerns of and at least as strong when the district court refuses to abstain as when it abstains,see,we see no material distinction between a right to stay in federal court and a right to return to state court.we therefore hold that,under the particular facts of this case,the issues presented by the district court refusal to abstain are sufficiently important to merit an interlocutory appeal pursuant to the collateral order exception.
b.the remand argument.
a allows a party to remove a pending state proceeding to a district court having bankruptcy jurisdiction.subsection b of that statute allows for remand on any equitable ground and further provides that a n order entered under this subsection remanding a claim or cause of action,or a decision to not remand,is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of this title.
corning contends that the affiliate insurers essentially attack the district court refusal to remand to state court,thus subjecting themselves to section b appellate bar.yet section d provides that a ny decision to abstain or not to abstain made under this subsection other than a decision not to abstain in a proceeding described in subsection c the mandatory abstention provision is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of this title.emphasis added.while corning concedes that section d suggests that mandatory abstention decisions are appealable,it argues that the two statutory sections must be read together to prohibit appeal where remand is the relief requested even though the path to that relief is mandatory abstention.
we have held that we can not review a district court decision to remand even when that decision is based on mandatory abstention.see in re cathedral of the incarnation,cir holding that section b prohibits appellate review of a decision to remand based on mandatory abstention.this holding does not imply its inverse,however.in fact,we noted in cathedral that congress had recently provided for appellate review of determinations not to exercise mandatory abstention.id.at congress amended to allow appellate review of mandatory abstention determinations where the district court has decided not to abstain.d.the legislative history of the amendment strongly suggests that congress viewed this change as carving out a narrow exception to a general rule prohibiting appellate review of abstention decisions.
we must,of course,read section c and d with section b in a manner that gives effect to both absent a positive repugnancy between them.connecticut bank germain,d.there is no positive repugnancy between sections c and d and b.as corning concedes,section d contemplates appellate review of decisions refusing to exercise mandatory abstention.section b,on the other hand,imposes a broad bar against the review of remand decisions.it is not legally or factually impossible to address the abstention decision without reaching the district court remand decision.if we determine that because the claims are not core proceedings,the district court erred by not abstaining,the district court properly could both abstain and remand when this lawsuit is returned to it.however,that reality would not alter the fact that we would have reviewed only the decision not to abstain.under the facts of this case,we can give effect to both statutes and need not determine whether,in other circumstances,it might be impossible to do so.
c.the notice of appeal 
corning posits that because appellants did not specifically appeal from the district court determination that the claims were core claims,it can not make that argument on appeal.the requirement for specificity in a notice of appeal refers to the relief granted or denied.see kowsh board of elections,cir holding that because appellant appealed only from denial of injunctive relief,he could not obtain relief on other claims terkildsen waters,cir stating that the appellant is not required to include assignments of error,or reasons why the lower court was mistaken in the relief it granted.the affiliate insurers moved for abstention remand and the district court denied that request because,in part,it determined that the claims were core claims.having listed the refusal to remand and abstain in their notice of appeal,the affiliate insurers are free to argue that the district court erred in its abstention decision because the affiliate insurer claims are not core claims.see terkildsen,at.
ii.abstention.
corning argues that the district court abstention ruling was correct for three reasons section c mandatory abstention provision does not apply to removed actions the removed action is a core bankruptcy proceeding and the affiliate insurers did not establish that the claims against them could be resolved on a timely basis in state court.
mandatory abstention in removed proceedings.
section c provides that 
upon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a state law claim or state law cause of action,related to a case under title but not arising under title or arising in a case under title,with respect to which an action could not have been commenced in a court of the united states absent jurisdiction under this section,the district court shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced,and can be timely adjudicated,in a state forum of appropriate jurisdiction.
emphasis added.corning argues that once it removed this lawsuit to federal court,there no longer was a lawsuit commenced in state court.a number of courts have accepted this argument.see,in re lazar,cir in re montague pipeline techs,arstk,audre recognition,wl,at may,neuman goldberg,in re ross,in re,see also renaissance cosmetics,development specialists,suggesting but not holding that mandatory abstention does not apply to removed actions.
however,other than the ninth circuit,all of the courts of appeals to have addressed this issue hold that mandatory abstention applies to a removed action.see christo padgett,cir in re southmark,cir robinson michigan consol.gas,cir.some district courts in this circuit have reached the same conclusion.see technology outsource solutions,llc,eni,wl,universal well servs.avoca natural gas storage,channel bell assocs.grace,wl,at.
those cases holding that mandatory abstention does not apply to removed cases rely on two premises once removal occurs,there is no longer a commenced state proceeding within the meaning of section c,see,lazar,at,and section b discussion of procedures for removal and remand does not section c,suggesting that the abstention section does not apply to removed actions,see,ross,at.
courts on the other side of the issue emphasize that because section c says is commenced and not is pending,mandatory abstention does not require a pending state law suit on remand to state court,the proceeding will be reinstated and a speedy adjudication can be had and providing for mandatory abstention in removal situations better comports with the plain language of c as well as congress intent that mandatory abstention strike a balance between the competing interests of bankruptcy and state courts.christo,at see also joseph cavender,on the need to conduct abstention analysis in cases removed to federal court,chi.we agree with each of these premises and see no need for an explicit reference in section b to section c or d both statutes must be applied to the factual situations that they go
