are a proposed class of patients who received treatment from new hospital and new health care system,and were uninsured at the time of their treatment.they brought suit in federal court,asserting numerous federal and state causes of action challenging the allegedly inflated rates charged to them by defendants,particularly as compared to those rates charged to patients covered by private or health insurance.
on defendants motions,the united states district court for the southern district of new york loretta preska,dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs complaint in its entirety,including plaintiffs numerous claims.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of three of their claims,arguing that the district court should not have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over these claims after all claims supporting original jurisdiction had been dismissed at a very early stage in the proceedings.plaintiffs argue in the alternative that even if the district court was correct to reach the merits of their claims,it erred in its conclusions and in denying without discussion plaintiffs request for injunctive relief.we have jurisdiction under.
we need not reach plaintiffs alternative arguments because we agree that this case is the usual case in which all claims are eliminated before trial such that the balance of factors to be considered judicial economy,convenience,fairness,and comity will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims.cohill,d.accordingly,we vacate that portion of the district court order dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs appealed claims and remand the case with instructions to dismiss those claims without prejudice.
background 
we accept as true the allegations of plaintiffs amended class action complaint.see hernandez coughlin,cir.defendant new health care system,nyphs is a federation of health care facilities in new york,new jersey,and connecticut,including approximately acute care and community hospitals in the new york metropolitan area.defendant new hospital nyp is an nyphs and the teaching hospital of the medical colleges of columbia and cornell universities.nyp has a number of campuses,including the new york weill cornell medical center weill cornell.nyphs and nyp are organizations under section c of the internal revenue code.
plaintiff shkelqim kolari was admitted for treatment at weill cornell for severe burns to his arm in october.at the time of his admission,kolari was uninsured.he was discharged about ten days later,and billed approximately for his hospital stay.kolari required outpatient care on a biweekly basis,and returned to weill cornell for treatment accordingly.but on each visit,and prior to receiving treatment,kolari was required to sign a form guaranteeing payment of all charges and to pay.on several occasions,kolari was unable to afford the fee and was refused treatment.
plaintiff sarah vail was admitted to weill cornell for treatment of pregnancy complications in november.like kolari,she was uninsured at the time of her admission.she was discharged after three days and two nights and was billed approximately for her care.kolari and vail have received calls correspondence from unknown persons attempting to collect on their unpaid hospital bills.
although initiated by kolari as a putative class action in july,an amended class action complaint added vail as a named plaintiff in september.named as defendants were nyp and nyphs collectively,nyp defendants,and the american hospital association the aha,identified as a trade association for the hospital industry kolari and vail proposed to represent a class consisting of a ll persons who received any form of healthcare treatment from defendant nyp nyphs and who were uninsured at the time of treatment.am.compl.
plaintiffs amended complaint stated a host of federal and claims,primarily based on the factual allegation that the nyp defendants,aided by the aha,charged the proposed class of uninsured individuals unreasonable,discriminatory,and exceedingly inflated rates for medical services that bear no relation to the actual cost of such services,appellant br,in spite of defendants avowed charitable purposes and status.plaintiffs made repeated reference in their complaint to the higher rates charged by the nyp defendants to uninsured patients as compared to those rates charged to patients insured privately or through programs such as medicare and medicaid.according to plaintiffs,by setting excessive rates for health care services,the nyp defendants are able to negotiate discounted rates with private and government insurers that nonetheless yield generous reimbursements.in the meantime,uninsured patients,who do not benefit from any discount,are stuck with the artificially inflated rates.this lawsuit is apparently one of dozens filed across the country asserting the same central claim against other hospitals.see leo crowley,hospitals prevailing in charity care cases,at 
the nyp defendants moved under rule b and to dismiss the complaint as against themselves,and the aha moved separately to dismiss the claims against it the district court heard oral argument on the motions and thereafter granted them,dismissing plaintiffs claims and exercising supplemental jurisdiction to dismiss plaintiffs claims as well.kolari,d.
plaintiffs appeal,but only as to their claims of breach of contract,breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing,and violation of section of the new york general business law they do not appeal the dismissal of their claims or any other claim plaintiffs primarily challenge the district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over these claims.plaintiffs also,in the alternative,argue that even if the district court properly exercised jurisdiction,it erred in dismissing these claims and in dismissing without discussion the injunctive relief requested in plaintiffs amended complaint.
ii.discussion 
federal district courts have supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.as the supreme court stated in discussing predecessor judicial doctrine of pendent jurisdiction,however,this is traditionally a doctrine of discretion,not of plaintiff right.united mine workers gibbs,d.subsection c of confirms the discretionary nature of supplemental jurisdiction by enumerating the circumstances in which district courts can refuse its exercise.city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons,d.of particular relevance here,a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.c.
once a district court discretion is triggered under c,it balances the traditional values of judicial economy,convenience,fairness,and comity,cohill,at,in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction.see russian news agency russian kurier,cir.in weighing these factors,the district court is aided by the supreme court additional guidance in cohill that in the usual case in which all claims are eliminated before trial,the balance of factors will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims.at.see also gibbs,at.needless decisions of state law should be avoided both as a matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties,by procuring for them a reading of applicable law i f the federal law claims are dismissed before trial the state claims should be dismissed as well.we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion,valencia ex rel.franco lee,cir,and depending on the precise circumstances of a case,have variously approved and disapproved the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction where all claims have been dismissed,see id.at collecting cases.
in choosing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction here,the district court did not explicitly balance the cohill factors.instead,it relied on considerations of federal health care policy that it believed were raised by plaintiffs claims.kolari,d at where,as here,the state claims are so closely tied to questions of federal policy,the argument for exercise of supplem
