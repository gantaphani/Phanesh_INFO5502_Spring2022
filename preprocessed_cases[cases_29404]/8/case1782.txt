this appeal is an offspring of a criminal tax fraud prosecution.in the course of the criminal prosecution,judge kaplan asserted ancillary jurisdiction over a state law contract claim brought against kpmg,llp,by sixteen of the defendants in the criminal case,all former partners and employees of kpmg,seeking to force it to pay their legal expenses.kpmg appeals from the decision allowing the ancillary proceeding and from the denial of its motion to compel arbitration of the contract claim.construing kpmg appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus,we grant the petition.we vacate the order of the district court asserting ancillary jurisdiction over the contract claim as beyond the district court power.the issues regarding kpmg motion to compel arbitration are therefore moot.
background 
the full history of the proceedings underlying this appeal is reported in united states stein,d stein i united states stein stein kpmg llp,d stein ii.familiarity with these opinions is assumed,and we recount here only those facts pertinent to the disposition of the present appeal.
the underlying criminal prosecution is said to be the largest criminal tax case in american history.stein ii,d at.nineteen defendants are charged with conspiracy and tax evasion,including the appellees,who are former partners or employees of the accounting firm kpmg.id.the defendants are alleged to have,inter alia,devised,marketed,and implemented fraudulent tax shelters that caused a tax loss to the united states treasury of more than billion.in connection with the alleged tax shelters,kpmg entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government,agreeing to cooperate fully with the government and to pay million in fines and penalties.stein i,d at.if kpmg performs its obligations under the agreement,it will escape prosecution.id.
the particular dispute giving rise to this appeal concerns policies adopted by the department of justice in response to highly visible public concerns over the compliance by business firms with federal and state law.see leonard orland,the transformation of corporate criminal law,brook.fin.com.the policies were established in the thompson memorandum,which set out standards to be followed by federal prosecutors in determining whether to bring criminal prosecutions against firms as well as their agents see mem.from larry thompson,deputy attorney general,dep of justice,to heads of department components,united states attorneys,re principles of federal prosecution of business organizations,thompson mem.gov dag cftf ganizations.pdf.one such standard deemed a firm voluntary payment of wrongdoing agents legal expenses a factor favoring prosecution of the firm.id.at.
during the course of the investigation,and prior to the indictments in this matter,kpmg negotiated with and paid the legal fees of some,but not all,of the appellees.upon indictment,however,kpmg stopped these payments.stein i,d at.in stein i,the district court found that the government had used the threat of prosecution to pressure kpmg into cutting off payment of the appellees legal fees and thereby violated appellees fifth and sixth amendment rights to a fair trial and the effective assistance of counsel.id.at.the merits of that ruling are not before us on this appeal.
the district court suggested that the constitutional violation could be rendered harmless if the appellees could successfully force kpmg to,for some of the appellees,their legal expenses.id.at.the court sua sponte instructed the clerk of the district court to open a civil docket number for an expected contract claim by the appellees against kpmg for advancement of their defense costs.id.at.the district court stated that it would entertain the claims pursuant to its ancillary jurisdiction over this case.id.
the district court acknowledged a more obvious remedy for the constitutional violations it had of the explicitly left that possibility open as an incentive for the government to strongarm kpmg to advance appellees defense costs.id.at.in short,having found that the government violated appellees constitutional rights by threatening to bring one indictment,the district court sought to remedy the violation by threatening to dismiss another.
following this invitation,the appellees filed the anticipated complaints against kpmg.in the complaints,fifteen of the sixteen appellees relied primarily on an contract with kpmg based on kpmg alleged history of paying its employees legal expenses.the sixteenth appellee,jeffrey stein,relied on an express breach of his written separation agreement with kpmg.in response,kpmg moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and on the merits.it also argued that the case should be referred to arbitration under arbitration agreements between kpmg and the various appellees.the district court denied kpmg motions in stein ii,d.
the stein ii opinion contained three principal holdings i a reaffirmation of the court earlier holding that ancillary jurisdiction existed over the contractual fee dispute between appellees and kpmg ii a rejection of kpmg argument that the contract claims of all of the appellees,save stein,were foreclosed by written agreements containing merger clauses and iii a finding that enforcement of any applicable arbitration clause would be against public policy.the court concluded that arbitration might interfere with the district court ability to ensure a speedy trial,could lead to a dismissal of possibly meritorious criminal charges,would endanger the appellees rights to a fair trial,and would risk imposing unnecessary costs on taxpayers if the appellees should become indigent.id.at.
the opinion closed by setting the trial of appellees advancement claim for six weeks later,october,following an abbreviated period of limited discovery.id.at.the procedural rules governing the trial were left to the future,the district court noting that i t is not now entirely clear exactly how this will play out.id.at.although the district court stated that kpmg would have the protections inherent in the federal rules of civil procedure,id.at,the court elsewhere stated that the advancement claim,although civil in nature,is a criminal case to which the civil rules do not apply,id.at.it further expressed its intention to apply the civil rules only to the extent they are consistent with the criminal rules.id.at.
on appeal,kpmg argues that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over appellees advancement claims and also that,if jurisdiction exists,the district court further erred by refusing to compel arbitration.
discussion 
a appeal or mandamus 
appellees argue that we have no appellate jurisdiction to review the district court assertion of ancillary jurisdiction because the denial of kpmg motion to dismiss appellees advancement complaint was an unappealable interlocutory order in a criminal case.kpmg responds that we have jurisdiction under the federal arbitration act the faa to review the district court refusal to compel arbitration,and that we may then exercise pendent jurisdiction over the question of ancillary jurisdiction.
these arguments in turn spawn a tangle of counter and.section of the faa provides for interlocutory appeal from a refusal to stay an action under section of the faa,or of a refusal to compel arbitration under section.a.kpmg,however,did not ask for a stay under section anywhere in its notice of motion to dismiss,and section applies only to orders by any united states district court which,save for the arbitration agreement,would have jurisdiction under title.however,the district court does not have jurisdiction over the advancement claim under title.moreover,even if kpmg is deemed to have constructively petitioned for a stay under section,an exercise of pendent jurisdiction would require us to find that the issue of ancillary jurisdiction is inextricably intertwined with an issue over which the court properly has appellate jurisdiction,as where the same specific question underl ies both the appealable order and the order,or where resolution of the nonappealable order is subsidiary to resolution of the appealable order.sa celanese ag,cir citations omitted.
to undertake pendent jurisdiction,therefore,we would have to find that the issue of ancillary jurisdiction is inextricably intertwined with the denial of the motion to compel arbitration,presumably on the grounds that the district court reasons for asserting ancillary jurisdiction and for finding that arbitration would be against public policy were the same,the need to afford an adequate and timely remedy for the constitutional violations.see stein i at ancillary proceeding needed i n order to guarantee appellees right to choose their own counsel stein ii at having found the constitutional violations,the overreaching issue is what to do about it,and need to promptly vindicate appellees fifth and sixth amendment rights are factors rendering arbitration clauses contrary to public policy.
we decline to resolve the question of appellate jurisdiction.we suggested at oral argument that it might be more appropriate to exercise our mandamus power.the parties were invited to file supplemental briefs on the issue,and judge kaplan himself filed a submission on the issue.
we have in the past treated an appeal as a petition for leave to file a writ of mandamus.in re repetitive stress injury litigation,cir in re hooker investments,cir.however,we have generally done so only after finding a lack of appellate jurisdiction.repetitive stress injury litigation,at hooker investments,at.there has been criticism of the practice of resorting to mandamus without first resolving the issue of appellate jurisdiction,acf,eeoc,d powell,dissenting from denial of certiorari,but there is nevertheless precedent for doing so,see,in re globe newspaper,cir guam united states dist.court of guam,cir wilk am.medical,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,fed.prac.proc.juris d.while the practice of resorting to mandamus only in the absence of jurisdiction may be of value in alerting courts to the danger of allowing mandamus to become a substitute for an appeal and thus to swallow the rule against interlocutory appeals,acf,at,the circumstances here fully justify the exercise of mandamus power without deciding whether we have appellate jurisdiction.
in turning to mandamus,we simply recognize that t he traditional use of the writ in the aid of appellate jurisdiction both at common law and in the federal courts has been to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction roche evaporated milk ass n.because the actions of the district court were well outside its subject matter jurisdiction,our resort to mandamus does not in any way expand the potential use of that writ and avoids our unnecessarily addressing complex jurisdictional issues.
the jurisdictional issues are complex,but largely because,as we explain below,the proceeding challenged on this state law contract action against a within a federal criminal well outside the subject matter jurisdiction conferred by congress on the federal courts.it is hardly surprising,therefore,that there is no statute or body of caselaw that clearly affords or clearly precludes appellate review of the commencement of such a proceeding.for example,the failure of congress to mention title as well as title in section of the faa is not evidence of an intent to preclude interlocutory appeals from orders refusing to compel arbitration in criminal cases.rather,it is evidence that congress did not expect such issues ever to arise in criminal cases.indeed,the complexities surrounding our appellate jurisdiction underline the paucity of grounds supporting the district court assertion of ancillary jurisdiction.
were we to opine on the various arguments over appellate jurisdiction,we would have to address issues involving the faa and pendent jurisdiction that arise only because of the happenstances of this unique case.there is no need for a precedent regarding appellate jurisdiction in this context because our issuance of the writ disposes of this matter and renders the existence of future such cases unlikely.however,opining on the jurisdictional issues does risk the making of statements that might be misleading in future cases in a different context.we therefore turn to the mandamus remedy without deciding the jurisdictional issues.
b the merits 
as discussed above,mandamus is available to confine courts to their designated jurisdiction.other touchstones of mandamus review are usurpation of power,clear abuse of discretion and the presence of an issue of first impression.steele rothschild,cir internal quotation marks omitted.three conditions must be satisfied before the writ may issue first,the party seeking relief must have no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires,second,the petitioner must show that his right to the writ is clear and indisputable,and third,the issuing court must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.cheney united states dist.court,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the writ is,of course,to be used sparingly.in addition to avoiding its use as a substitute for an appeal,discussed above,the principal reasons for our reluctance to condone use of the writ are the undesirability of making a district court judge a litigant and the inefficiency of piecemeal appellate litigation.mallard united states dist.court,d.in the present matter,all of the standard requirements for granting mandamus relief are met,while the reasons underlying the traditional reluctance to resort to the writ are either not present or favor granting the writ.
appellees argue that kpmg right to relief is not clear and indisputable because the proper scope of ancillary jurisdiction is not by our caselaw.to be sure,t he boundaries of ancillary jurisdiction are not easily defined and the cases addressing it are hardly a model of clarity.garcia teitler,cir.however,because ancillary jurisdiction can not be limitless and still be ancillary,boundaries there must be,and the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction here is clearly outside those boundaries.
as garcia stated,ancillary jurisdiction is aimed at enabling a court to administer justice within the scope of its jurisdiction.id.internal quotation marks omitted.ancillary jurisdiction is intended to permit disposition of claims that are,in varying respects and degrees,factually interdependent by a single court,and to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.id.quoting kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.
the most common exercise of ancillary jurisdiction is,probably,to resolve fee disputes between a party and its attorney arising in litigation in which the attorney represented the party.see,cluett,peabody,cpc acquisition,cir novinger dupont de nemours,cir.in garcia,for example,we upheld the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction to compel an attorney to return a retainer obtained to represent a party in the underlying litigation after the district court had ordered the attorney to withdraw as counsel because of misconduct.garcia,at.exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over a fee dispute between a party and an attorney functioning as an officer of the court in litigation over which a court has jurisdiction is,however,a world away from the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction in a criminal proceeding to adjudicate a contract dispute between the defendants and a former employer.
when a court undertakes to resolve claims arising from a relationship between a party to an action and the party attorney in that action and involving the attorney conduct of that litigation,the parties to the ancillary proceeding are already before the court as a litigant and officer of the court the relevant facts are generally more accessible to that court than to another and the ability of the court to conduct and dispose of the underlying litigation may turn on,or at least be greatly facilitated by,resolution of the issues raised in the ancillary proceeding.however,when a to the primary proceeding is sought to be joined as a defendant in the ancillary proceeding,the need for the ancillary proceeding and the efficiencies provided by it must be both sufficiently great to outweigh the prejudice t
