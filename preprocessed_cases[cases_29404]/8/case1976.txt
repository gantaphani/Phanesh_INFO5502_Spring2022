the central issue raised in these appeals is whether section of the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of revives previously expired securities claims.although these cases involved different parties,were decided by different district courts,and have not been formally consolidated on appeal,we heard them on the same day and now resolve them together because they present substantially identical issues.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the respective judgments of the district courts,in each case finding that section of extended the statute of limitations for private securities fraud cases from the longer of one year from the date of discovery or three years from the date of occurence to the longer of two years from the date of discovery or five years from the date of not revive plaintiffs expired securities fraud claims.in the case of mcbride ernst young llp,we further affirm judge platt finding that plaintiffs therein did not commence their action against defendant ernst young within the applicable statute of limitations,and therefore hold that judge platt properly dismissed the complaint against ernst young.
background 
in each of these cases,plaintiffs initiated actions for securities fraud prior to the passage of.then,after was enacted on july,plaintiffs in one case appended additional claims and,in the other,joined an additional defendant,to try to take advantage of extended statute of limitations.the full histories of these cases are reported in the orders of the district courts.see in re enter.mortgage acceptance,d mcbride ernst young llp,mem.order,see also in re computer assocs.class action sec,d.below,we recount only those facts relevant to the disposition of these appeals.

in june,plaintiffs aetna life insurance company aetna and great southern life insurance company great southern filed securities fraud complaints against enterprise mortgage acceptance company emac.in re enter.mortgage acceptance,d at.in those complaints,aetna and great southern alleged that emac violated section b of the securities act of and rule,promulgated thereunder,when,in private placements between and,emac sold aetna and great southern interests in loans to gasoline stations,car washes,quick lube businesses,and convenience stores.aetna and great southern contended that emac fraudulently induced them to participate in these offerings with false and materially misleading statements and omissions regarding emac lending practices and that,as a result of their investments in emac,aetna and great southern suffered substantial losses.
in aetna initial complaint,filed on june,aetna asserted federal claims concerning its,and purchases,and great southern,in its june,complaint,asserted state claims concerning its purchases as well as federal claims concerning its purchases.in re enter.mortgage acceptance,d at.aetna subsequently withdrew the federal claims relating to its and purchases,conceding that these claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.id.at.in may,aetna and great southern filed new complaints,again under section b and rule,concerning aetna and purchases and great southern purchases.emac moved to dismiss these claims as,but aetna and great southern argued that their claims had been revived by.id.at.
judge kram rejected the argument that revived stale securities fraud claims and granted emac motion to dismiss those federal claims that related to aetna and great southern and purchases of emac securities.id.at.this appeal followed.

standard of review 
we review de novo the determination that section of does not revive already expired securities fraud claims,see,perry dowling,cir de novo review for issues of statutory interpretation,which is a question of first impression for this court.
ii.analysis 
retroactive application 
the supreme court has recognized that though congress is empowered to enact retroactive legislation,retroactive statutes raise such special concerns,ins cyr,d,that congressional enactments will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result,bowen georgetown,d internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.consequently,those cases where the court has found truly retroactive effect adequately authorized by statute have involved statutory language that was so clear it could sustain only one interpretation.lindh murphy,d.
in landgraf usi film products,d,the supreme court set forth a test for determining whether a statute applies retroactively.at the first stage,a court must determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.id.at.if congress has done so,the inquiry ends,and the court enforces the statute as it is written.see id.if the statute is ambiguous or contains no express command,the court proceeds to the second stage of the landgraf test and determine s whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.if the statute,as applied,would have such an effect,it will not be applied retroactively absent clear congressional intent to the contrary.id.
in accordance with landgraf,we begin by looking to the plain language of section of.because the language of section does not unambiguously revive previously stale securities fraud claims,and because section legislative history does not suggest that congress intended to provide for retroactive application of the revised statute of limitations,we next inquire whether extending the statute of limitations to revive expired claims would have a retroactive effect.upon review of the relevant factors,we conclude that extending the statute of limitations to revive stale claims would have such an effect.accordingly,because neither the language nor the legislative history of section requires that we do so,we decline to apply section retroactively to revive plaintiffs previously expired securities fraud claims and instead defer to the longstanding presumption against retroactive application.
congressional intent 
section amends b to provide 
a a private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws,as defined in section a of the securities exchange act of a,may be brought not later than the earlier of 
years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or 
years after such violation.
b effective limitations period provided by section b of title,united states code,as added by this section,shall apply to all proceedings addressed by this section that are commenced on or after the july,date of enactment of this act.
c no creation of in this section shall create a new,private right of action.
public company accounting reform and investor protection act of,stat,codified in part at b.
on the basis of the foregoing,plaintiffs urge that because section b states that the revised statute of limitations shall apply to all proceedings that are commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act,and because plaintiffs proceedings were commenced subsequent to the july,date of enactment their claims are timely.id.b,stat.at at note.although section b is perhaps most naturally read as applying to any proceeding that is commenced after july,enactment,the statute contains none of the unambiguous language that the supreme court has asserted would amount to an express retroactivity command,see landgraf,at.stating that the language all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment amounted to an explicit retroactivity command emphasis added martin hadix,d describing the sentence,t he new provisions shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment as unambiguously address ing the temporal reach of the statute quoting landgraf,at.nor that which congress has used in previous statutes to indicate its intent to revive claims,see,interstate banking and branching efficiency act of,a,stat,codified at d c i amending the act to provide that the corporation may bring an action on such claim without regard to the expiration of the statute of limitation applicable under state law higher education technical amendments of,stat,codified at a eliminating statute of limitations with regard to recovering on defaulted student loans by stating no limitation shall terminate the period within which suit may be filed.
plaintiff argument that unambiguously revived previously expired securities fraud claims is also not assisted by section c,which states nothing in this section shall create a new,private right of action.plaintiffs contend that,with this language,congress was merely confirming that section was only lengthening the statute of limitations and not expanding upon existing types of securities claims.although plaintiffs reading of section c is a plausible one,the issue is not free of doubt.assuming plaintiffs claims had already expired,plaintiffs were barred from bringing their claims prior to the enactment of on july.according to their construction,however,they were able to bring these claims on july.where a plaintiff is empowered by a new statute to bring a cause of action that previously had no basis in law,a new cause of action has,in some sense of the word,been created.see hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d in permitting actions by an expanded universe of plaintiffs with different incentives,the amendment essentially creates a new cause of action,not just an increased likelihood that an existing cause of action will be pursued.see also chenault united states postal,cir recognizing that a statute of limitations may not be applied retroactively to revive a claim that would otherwise be stale under the old scheme.
the lack of clarity that results from the tension that may be implied between b and c undermines plaintiffs contention that,in enacting section,congress made its intentions for retroactivity unmistakably clear.the requirement of congressional clarity,moreover,must be met both in order to overcome the presumption against retroactive application and to obviate the need for proceeding to the second stage of the landgraf test.see landgraf,at.as the landgraf court recognized,r equiring clear intent assures that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.id.at.
it also bears noting that the legislative history of section does not clearly indicate that congress intended that section apply retroactively to revive expired securities fraud claims.see rabin,cir w e look to legislative history to determine the intent of an ambiguous statute.see also landgraf,at.examining legislative history to determine congressional intent at first stage of the landgraf test.section precursor,section of the proposed corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of,was introduced by senator patrick leahy in march.nothing in the senate committee report for the proposed act indicates that the extension of the statute of limitations was intended to revive expired claims or that congress was even considering such a thing.see.nor do the statements senator leahy made during the conference committee meeting on,reflect any intention to revive expired claims see conference report on corporate responsibility legislation,july,reprinted in federal news service.and where congress does not clearly indicate its intention for retroactive as here,does not seem even to contemplate must move to the second stage of the landgraf inquiry.
retroactive effects 
because there is no clear evidence that congress intended for section to apply retroactively,we next ask whether retroactive application of section would have retroactive effects,whether it would produce the kind of result that motivated the presumption against retroactive application in the first place.see landgraf,at.describing the presumption against retroactivity as rooted in e lementary considerations of fairness,which dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly.
this second step of the landgraf test has sometimes been described as an inquiry into whether the statutory change affects substantive or procedural rights.see,vernon cassadaga valley cent.sch,cir a pplying landgraf requires courts to determine whether a portion of a statute operates retroactively or prospectively,and,in connection with that determination,to resolve whether the statutory provision at issue is substantive or procedural.see also landgraf,at.because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct,the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive.to this end,plaintiffs seize upon the procedural label and argue that c ontrolling precedent in this court unequivocally holds that new statutes of limitations are procedural and do not have any disfavored retroactive effect.
but while we noted in vernon that retroactive application of a revised statute of limitations generally does not have an impermissible retroactive effect,at,we did not create a categorical exception from landgraf s presumption against retroactive application of legislation.see martin,at.when determining whether a new statute operates retroactively,it is not enough to attach a label,procedural,collateral to the statute we must ask whether the statute operates retroactively.statutes of limitations protect interests in reliance and repose,am.trucking,smith,d,guard against stale demands,bell morrison,pet.story,and limit the circumstances in which a reviewing court can grant relief,see,klein shields,cir.because,in different contexts,a statute of limitations may fairly be described as either procedural or substantive we decline plaintiffs invitation to designate all statutes of limitations procedural and thereby hold that any revised statute of limitations shall have retroactive effect unless congress has clearly indicated otherwise.
nor can we accept plaintiffs assertion that no reliance interest can attach in the instant cases because the conduct plaintiffs allege,if proven,would have been unlawful at the time it occurred.the imposition of legal liability for actions that were lawful when they were undertaken is one example of an impermissible retroactive effect,cyr,at,but it is by no means the only instance where retroactive application of legislation would be undesirable.see soc y for the propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas,story,e very statute,which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed to have an impermissible retroactive effect.see also hughes aircraft,at.recognizing that each of justice story examples of an impermissible retroactive effect constituted a sufficient,rather than a necessary,condition for invoking the presumption against retroactivity.
in our view,the resurrection of previously claims has an imp
