based in puerto rico,méndez sells iraqi dinars dinars,the official iraqi currency.according to the complaint,between september and august,a number of banks in puerto rico closed or refused to open accounts for méndez.most objected to serving money services businesses msbs or stated related administrative reasons,including the sheer volume of transactions.the banks,méndez says,also 
have conditioned the opening and continuation of regular checking accounts,lines of credit,savings accounts and all other regular bank services upon plaintiff not depositing or withdrawing from any such bank account or credit lines,united states of america currency or legal tender money derived from the sale of dinars.
in the same time frame,arvelo according to the complaint published critical comments and articles on his website and also made unspecified public statements about méndez sale of dinars in puerto rico,which méndez claims have prompted closures of his accounts as well as government oversight of his business.arvelo postings apparently suggest that the dinars are counterfeit that méndez has been operating illegally that the general sale of iraqi dinars is illegal and that the sale of dinars is not a legitimate business accepted by banking institutions.
on october,méndez brought suit in federal district court in puerto rico against the named banks and arvelo,seeking million plus treble damages.he alleged three federal causes of action based respectively on the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,the sherman act,and the bank holding company act bhca,e.the complaint also included claims of abuse of right and defamation under puerto rico law.

méndez now appeals from the dismissal of the rico and bhca claims he ignores his sherman act claim,which is thus abandoned.our review,as already noted,is de novo,and is informed by recent supreme court decisions that require in a complaint more than labels and conclusions and stress that a formulaic recital of the elements of a cause of action will not do.bell atl.twombly,see also ashcroft iqbal,holding twombly to apply to all civil actions.
to read through méndez complaint and opening brief he filed no reply and the answering briefs of the banks arvelo has remained silent is to be left initially in a state of puzzlement.the banks do not deny that they have refused to provide méndez with accounts for his dinar business,but do not trouble to explain why méndez alleges conspiracy,seemingly among the banks and clearly between arvelo and the banks,also without explaining why the banks or arvelo have any motive to cooperate or to undermine him.
yet modest research among public documents provides some enlightening information about the phase of the case that involves the banks.it turns out that the usa patriot act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of the,amended the bank secrecy act bsa,in ways that imposed more stringent requirements aimed at money laundering.
one consequence has been several criminal cases brought against banks doing business with msbs,including one of the bank defendants in the case before us given these cases and general uncertainty about regulation under the amended bsa,many banks believe they could bear responsibility for the bsa compliance of msb customers despite statements to the contrary from the office of the comptroller of the currency.bank secrecy act impact on money services businesses hearing before the subcomm.on fin.insts.consumer credit of the comm.on fin,cong.statements of jeb hensarling ann jaedicke,deputy comptroller for compliance policy,office of the comptroller of the currency.
unsurprisingly banks have increasingly shunned risky entanglement with msbs.at a house hearing in it was noted that o ver the past year,at least three national banks have ceased offering services to msb,and some institutions have also discontinued service,and this is blanket discontinuance by these institutions of all msb.id.at statement of spencer bachus,chairman,subcomm.on fin.insts.consumer credit.similarly,a bill proposed congressional findings that,due to regulatory guidance and expectations of federal banking agencies and the secretary of the treasury,
many insured depository institutions have refused or closed money services businesses accounts in order either not to incur the burden,risk or potential liability for undertaking a de facto regulatory function,or else to avoid supervisory sanctions for not exercising such oversight.
the defendant banks now before us may have no incentive at the motion to dismiss stage to offer explanations that may raise factual issues unfit for resolution except upon summary judgment or trial.but,happily for them,they have no need to establish their own motives unless and until méndez makes out a plausible federal claim under twombly and iqbal standards.this case bears out the wisdom of the supreme court requirements in screening out rhetoric masquerading as litigation.
a cardinal requirement of civil rico liability is the allegation of the commission,or attempt or conspiracy to commit,defined predicate acts needed to establish a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.c.acts in two defined categories were alleged by méndez mail or wire fraud,and extortion.we begin with the allegations of fraud which,under applicable pleading rules.b,must be alleged with particularity.
as to the banks,méndez complaint states that the cancellations contained misrepresentations inasmuch as the banks knew that the plaintiff was not a money service business,and that,even if the plaintiff was,the banks had substantial regulatory guidance to effectively provide the services with no regulatory risk.so,his first theory is that the banks denied him the use of accounts for his dinar sales because they deemed him to be within the msb category this,he says,must be fraudulent because he does not operate as one since he does not provide the myriad of services associated with msb operations.
but the very regulation he cites makes clear that to do any buying or selling of currency,exceeding with any other person in one day,is enough for msb status under the regulation further,méndez goes on in his own complaint to say that while he does not provide a full bevy of services listed in the regulation,regulations require that his business register because the business might qualify as such,that is,as an msb.this is not an allegation of fraud but an affirmation of the truth of the supposed false statements.
on appeal,méndez instead asserts the second theory,in which a different falsehood is being perpetrated,namely,that the banks say that they do not want to have accounts used to conduct msb activities but their real reason for refusing to deal with méndez is that they wish to drive him out of the dinar selling business in order to take it over for themselves.but there is no allegation that the banks supply dinars to anyone,that they have taken any steps to become such suppliers,or that they have expressed any interest in doing so.
in all events,the predicate fraud statutes cover only material falsehood,which has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.united states moran,f d,cir quoting neder united states.even if th
