this appeal tells a cautionary tale of the risks run by parties who adopt a attitude toward deadlines.the defendants in this windows,awi and the estate of ismael the estate acted in that fashion.the district court,after patiently granting several extensions and issuing pointed warnings,finally decided that enough was enough.it held the defendants to the deadlines previously announced,denied certain of their motions for noncompliance with the court scheduling order,disregarded the defendants tardy opposition to a motion for partial summary judgment,took the proffer of minerva vélez as true,and resolved the issue of liability in vélez favor.a jury thereafter awarded vélez nearly of a million dollars in damages.the defendants appeal.discerning no semblance of error,we affirm.
travel of the case 
vélez began work for a company owned by ismael nieves in.in time,vélez and nieves became romantically entangled.vélez claims that after she broke off their adulterous affair,she was sexually harassed.she further claims that,in march,this harassment culminated in her dismissal.
on march,vélez commenced an employment discrimination action against awi and nieves in puerto rico federal district court her complaint invoked to title vii and a plethora of puerto rican discrimination statutes.see,laws ann.pretrial discovery revealed a dalliance gone sour and,on the plaintiff account,an ensuing campaign of harassment leading to her discharge.
as this appeal turns largely on the travel and procedural history of the case,we eschew any further discussion of the facts at this point.instead,we set out a procedural chronology each date refers to the time when the filing in question was entered on the district court docket.
march.the plaintiff instituted the action.
april.the plaintiff moved for the entry of default,see.a,because the defendants failed to answer or otherwise plead within the allotted period.
may.the district court ordered the defendants to show cause,on or before may,why a default should not be entered.
may.the plaintiff renewed her motion for entry of default,noting that neither defendant had responded to the order.
may.the district court defaulted both defendants.
june.citing nieves sudden death in a helicopter accident on may,awi asked the district court to set aside the default and afford the defendants additional days within which to answer the complaint.
june.the district court granted the plaintiff request to substitute the estate in nieves stead as a party defendant.see.a.the court also granted awi request to set aside the default and ordered the defendants to answer or otherwise plead by july.the court warned that failure to comply on or before the aforementioned date shall result in the court default and proceeding with a damages hearing.
july.the defendants answered the plaintiff complaint.discovery then ensued.
november.the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.
december.the defendants opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment was due,but none was filed.
december.the district court granted the defendants until december to submit their opposition.
december.instead of filing their opposition by the extended deadline,the defendants moved for a further extension.
december.the district court held an omnibus scheduling conference the osc.
december.the court entered an order that,inter alia,directed the defendants to file i no later than january,answers to the plaintiff interrogatories ii no later than january,a legal memorandum,concerning the admissibility of hearsay and other evidence following a party death prior to discovery and iii no later than january,a memorandum detailing awi finances and the estate assets.the court admonished that the defendants failure to comply with any of these directives would result in sanctions including elimination of all defenses set forth in their answer to the complaint.
in tandem with these orders,the court further extended the time for filing an opposition to the plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment.the court fixed february as the due date for the opposition,warned the defendants that n o extensions will be given,and advised them that,should they fail to file an opposition on or before the aforementioned date the court shall consider plaintiff motion as unopposed.
january.the defendants served their answers to interrogatories.
january.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,alleging that the plaintiff did not have a cause of action against nieves and,therefore,could not sue the estate because supervisors are not personally liable under title vii.
january.the defendants moved for an extension of time,up to and including february,within which to file the hearsay memorandum and comply with the remaining commands of the osc.although the court took no immediate action on this motion,the defendants failed to make the required filings.
february.citing the plaintiff delay in completing her deposition and answers to interrogatories,the defendants moved to extend the deadline for filing an opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment from february to february.
february.this was the date set by the district court for the filing of the opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment.although the court had not yet ruled on their last previous motion for an extension,the defendants asked for another extension,this time to march,for the filing of their opposition.
march.the defendants made multiple submissions i they finally filed their opposition to the plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment ii in the same memorandum,doubling in brass as a motion to dismiss,they claimed for the first time that the plaintiff had failed to file a timely administrative complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc and that,as a consequence,her action should be jettisoned for want of jurisdiction and iii in a separate memorandum,they addressed the district court hearsay concerns.
march.faithful to its earlier warning that no extensions of time would be countenanced,the district court disregarded the defendants filings,denied their sundry extension requests,and deemed the plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment unopposed.as a sanction for the defendants failure to comply with the court earlier order to submit both a legal memorandum anent hearsay evidence which had been filed over two months late and a memorandum detailing the defendants financial resources which had not been filed at all,the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the supervisory liability claim.
march.the district court refused to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
march.the district court handed down an opinion in which it granted the plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment.see vélez cortes nieves valle,d.that decision resolved the issue of liability.
july.the district court convened a damages hearing before a jury and,pursuant to the jury verdict,entered final judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of.
august.the defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
the defendants assignments of error can be grouped under three headings i errors concerning the lower court entry of partial summary judgment ii errors concerning the lower court denial of the defendants two motions to dismiss and iii errors pertaining to the lower court issuance of an order for legal memoranda anent hearsay evidence.we address each grouping in turn.
a.the motion for partial summary judgment.
the defendants principal complaint is that the district court erred in granting the plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment without considering their opposition.on the defendants view of the proceedings,the trial judge decision to commit the case to a schedule caused him to turn a blind eye to the defendants pressing need for additional time to conduct discovery and muster their opposition.
we agree with the defendants that trial courts should refrain from entertaining summary judgment motions until after the parties have had a sufficient opportunity to conduct necessary discovery.see carmona toledo,cir berkovitz home box office,cir.it follows that when a party moves for summary judgment,the opposing party must be afforded a fair chance to obtain and synthesize available information before being required to file an opposition.our cases make it pellucid,however,that this prophylactic rule is not.a party who legitimately requires more time to oppose a motion for summary judgment has a corollary responsibility to make the court aware of its plight.
typically,this is accomplished by way of either a rule f motion or its functional equivalent see golden arch,cir corrada betances,cir.the record on appeal contains nothing of the sort the defendants neither invoked nor substantially complied with rule f.to benefit from the protections of rule f,a litigant ordinarily must furnish the nisi prius court with a timely not by affidavit,then in some other authoritative i explains his or her current inability to adduce the facts essential to filing an opposition,ii provides a plausible basis for believing that the facts can be assembled within a reasonable time,and iii indicates how those facts would influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.see,at.mun.wholesale,cir.such a litigant also must have exercised due diligence both in pursuing discovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in pursuing an extension of time thereafter.resolution trust bridge,cir.
the defendants motions to extend time,filed on february and february,do not satisfy these criteria neither motion identifies a single fact.neither motion indicates whether the desired information can be gathered within a reasonable interval.and neither motion relates how that information,if unearthed,would influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.
what the february motions do attempt to provide are reasons why an extension should be granted.the defendants attribute their predicament to a delay in the taking of the plaintiff deposition,a delay in the plaintiff service of answers to interrogatories,and defense counsel professed need to travel to florida in matters regarding to sic our legal profession.these are more excuses than reasons.the deposition was completed a full two weeks before the deadline for filing an opposition,and the plaintiff answered the interrogatories in approximately the same time frame.far from fact that counsel may have bitten off more than he could chew does not exempt him from meeting deadlines.see mendez banco popular,cir collecting cases see also pinero schroeder fnma,cir per curiam most attorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize their work so as to be able to meet the time requirements of matters they are handling or suffer the consequences.
the defendants now try to rectify some of their earlier omissions.in this court,they attribute the need for a further extension to a motley of events,including nieves untimely demise,a switch in counsel resulting from his death,and the fact that the plaintiff attorneys closed their offices for two weeks.these importunings are too little and too late.a party who seeks to be relieved from a deadline has an obligation,at a bare minimum,to present his arguments for relief to the ordering court.an unexcused failure to do so constitutes a waiver.see mccoy.inst.of,cir explaining that matters not raised squarely in the district court can not be raised for the first time on appeal.
here,moreover,the defendants proffered reasons are less than compelling.nieves died on may,nine months before the due date for the defendants opposition.the switch in counsel occurred in that same time in any event,a party decision to discharge one lawyer and retain another does not serve as a free pass to ignore deadlines.finally,the relevance of the office closing is less than obvious,and the defendants do nothing to enlighten us.
to cinch matters,it would strain credulity to characterize the defendants pretrial discovery efforts in this case as duly diligent.as the chronology indicates,see supra part i,the defendants dragged their feet from the very inception of the action.they had ample time to conduct discovery roughly one year elapsed between the start of suit and the entry of partial summary judgment.by the same token,they had ample time to prepare an opposition the court allowed them over three months from the date the plaintiff filed her motion for partial summary judgment and approximately two months from the date of the osc.in the ordinary course,a party protesting what he believes to be a gadarene rush to judgment in the face of delayed discovery must have offered to the district court a credible and convincing explanation for his inability to obtain the necessary information within the time allotted.see,at.the defendants explanations fall far short.
appellate review of a district court decisions is solely for abuse of discretion.gonzalez,cir trucking,waste,cir.given the circumstances at hand,the district court plainly did not abuse its discretion in proceeding,when it did,to decide the motion for partial summary judgment.after all 
rules are the parties must play by them.in the final analysis,the judicial process depends heavily on the judge credibility.to ensure such credibility,a district judge must often be firm in managing crowded dockets and demanding adherence to announced deadlines.if he or she sets a reasonable due date,parties should not be allowed casually to flout it or painlessly to escape the foreseeable consequences of noncompliance.
the defendants have a fallback position they claim that genuine issues of material fact existed in the record and that the plaintiff was not entitled to a liability finding as a matter of law.we review the merits of the entry of partial summary judgment de novo.garside osco drug,cir.our response will be brief.
because the defendants failed to file an opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment by the deadline february,the district judge was entitled to consider the motion as unopposed and to disregard a subsequently filed opposition.see mendez,at collecting cases.in the same vein,the court was obliged to take the plaintiff statement of uncontested facts as true.see see also euromodas,zanella,cir.
that does not mean,however,that summary judgment should automatically follow.even when faced with an unopposed motion for summary judgment,a court still has the obligation to test the undisputed facts in the crucible of the applicable law in order to ascertain whether judgment is warranted.see mendez,at see also.e instructing that if the adverse party fails to respond,summary judgment,if appropriate,shall be entered emphasis supplied.the district court fully understood this nuance.it proceeded to align the undisputed facts and apply the proper adjudicative rules for sexual harassment claims to those facts.we need not dwell on the court resulting handiwork.
by their inaction,the defendants allowed the plaintiff to configure the summary judgment record.confronted with a set of facts that pointed unerringly in one direction,the district court did its duty.we have long proclaimed that when a lower court produces a comprehensive,decision,an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.lawton state mut.life assur,cir.that principle pertains here.on the merits,therefore,we affirm the district court entry of partial summary judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in the district court erudite rescript.see vélez cortes nieves valle,d.
b.the motions to dismiss.
the district court denied both of the defendants motions to dismiss in the course of sanctioning them for their noncompliance with the osc order.a disgruntled litigant bears a heavy burden in attempting to challenge the imposition of a sanction arising out of the violation of a order.see united states v.one bmw,cir.appellate review of such orders is for abuse of discretion,at.an abuse of discretion presents itself when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored,when an improper factor is relied upon,or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed,but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.indep.oil chem.workers of quincy,procter gamble,cir.
