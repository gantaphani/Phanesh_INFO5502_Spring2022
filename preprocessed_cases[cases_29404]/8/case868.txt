louis giuliano and gtwo,llc brought this civil action alleging that defendants stanley fulton,anchor partners,llc anchor and my way holdings,llc my way conspired to participate and participated,through repeated acts of mail and wire fraud,in an illegal racketeering scheme in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,b d.the district court dismissed the amended complaint for failure to state a claim.see.b.we affirm.
we take as true the facts alleged in the complaint when reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim.taber partners i,cir.at the heart of this lawsuit is a joint venture gone sour.we note that the parties who were principally involved in the venture,and in the subsequent conduct that has been alleged to constitute a rico violation,are not defendants in this action.indeed,the defendants here are accused of financing and furthering the racketeering scheme only after it had already been initiated by these other parties,who have been sued by the plaintiffs in state court,and whom we shall,at times,refer to as the alleged conspirators.
the dispute centers around a property in massachusetts that giuliano and an associate,gary piontkowski,discussed purchasing in for the purpose of operating a harness racing track.piontkowski entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the owner of the property and,in,formed plainville racing company,llc prc to operate the proposed racetrack.shortly thereafter,piontkowski assigned his rights in the property to giuliano with the understanding that giuliano,through his company,would secure financing to complete the purchase of the property and to build the necessary facilities.before acquisition of the property was complete,giuliano executed a sublease whereby prc leased,for the purpose of operating the racetrack,a portion of the property from for rent.an addendum to the sublease granted prc the right to exercise an option to purchase the subleased premises for fair market value.
following execution of the sublease,the massachusetts racing commission commission granted prc a harness racing license racing licenses are awarded annually by the commission conditioned on giuliano completing acquisition of the property by december.giuliano obtained the necessary financing and a deed to the property was executed in favor of on november.shortly after closing,however,and less than two weeks before expiration of the purchase and sale agreement,giuliano lender threatened to back out if the loan was not restructured under new terms.given that both the commission deadline and the expiration of the purchase and sale agreement were fast approaching,giuliano agreed to the new terms.
under the restructured loan,a nominee of the lender,a limited liability company formed by the lender under rhode island law,gtwo,llc,took title to the property.giuliano received an option to purchase the property and a master lease giving him control of the property during the pendency of the option.giuliano could exercise the option,at any time before january,by paying back his loan advancement in full plus interest.the lender required and prc to execute a first amendment to lease first amendment to confirm that the sublease between and prc was subordinate to the master lease between and.the first amendment also converted prc option to purchase the subleased premises into an option to purchase leasehold interest.giuliano and piontkowski signed the first amendment with russell paige,an employee of,serving as an attesting witness.
shortly after the restructuring,and in response to the negative cash flow created by prc rent giuliano insisted that piontkowski provide him with an option to purchase all of piontkowski shares of prc stock for million.piontkowski agreed and a stock purchase agreement was executed in favor of giuliano.when giuliano subsequently learned that another company was also a of prc,giuliano had piontkowski execute a second stock purchase agreement that gave giuliano the option to purchase all of the shares of that company.piontkowski then asked giuliano to sign a lease confirmation and acknowledgment agreement lease confirmation that essentially stated,in contravention of the first amendment,that prc option to purchase the subleased premises was binding upon.giuliano refused to sign the lease confirmation,believing that he did not have authority to sign for.
beginning in june of,prc began breaching its obligations under the terms of the sublease and provided prc with several written notices of default.according to giuliano,this is when piontkowski hatched a scheme to seize giuliano property.on june,piontkowski sent a letter to giuliano asserting prc purported right to purchase the subleased premises.attached to the letter was a copy of the lease confirmation that giuliano had previously refused to sign,but which seemingly bore his signature,that prc asserted created privity between prc and the record title owner of the property.giuliano denied the authenticity of the document,alleging that it was a attached signature page actually coming from the first amendment that giuliano had previously signed for his lender.
in two separate letters in the fall of,giuliano notified piontkowski first,of his intent to exercise his options under the stock purchase agreements to acquire all of piontkowski interests in prc and in the other entity,and second,of the termination of prc sublease due to prc defaults.piontkowski,however,refused to sell his ownership interest in prc and refused to surrender the subleased premises.
in late september,piontkowski called a meeting of prc investors to discuss prc application,to be filed in competition with giuliano,for a year racing license.after the investors concluded that the lease confirmation was not authentic,paige,now employed by prc,manufactured a new version of the lease confirmation by cutting and pasting giuliano signature onto a blank lease confirmation form.paige forwarded this forgery to piontkowski,who later circulated it to the prc investors.
in october,prc submitted a year application stating that prc had control of the subleased premises.at a series of commission hearings in october and november,piontkowski and prc presented the forgery as evidence of prc rights to the property.piontkowski and paige testified that piontkowski had never signed the first amendment and had never agreed to subordinate prc sublease to giuliano master lease.moreover,they testified that giuliano had signed the lease confirmation,which acknowledged that prc had a lease with an option to purchase the premises.piontkowski asserted that it was giuliano who had perpetrated the fraud by attaching the signature page from the lease confirmation onto the first amendment.when the authenticity of the lease confirmation was questioned,piontkowski submitted the lease confirmation.relying on the forged documents and perjured testimony,the commission concluded that prc sublease had not been subordinated to the master lease and thus prc had a right to control of the premises.accordingly,on november,the commission granted a year racing license to prc.
piontkowski and prc then filed a complaint in massachusetts state court seeking a declaration that prc had validly exercised its option to purchase the subleased premises.on november,prc used the forgery and perjured testimony to obtain a memorandum of lis pendens from the court that effectively clouded title to the property.throughout the course of these state proceedings,prc submitted numerous fraudulent filings to the court.the state court relied on these fraudulent misrepresentations in denying giuliano motion to dismiss.
on november,giuliano filed his own massachusetts state court action against piontkowski and prc seeking specific performance of the stock purchase agreements.in their answer,piontkowski and prc again relied on the forgery.because the ultimate objective of the racketeering scheme was to unite the alleged conspirators control of both the racing license and the racetrack property,and since prc was the entity they were using to achieve that end,the alleged conspirators misrepresentations in this state action were intended to further the scheme by preventing giuliano from seizing control of prc.
in december,anticipating the expiration of giuliano option,alfred ross,one of prc investors,solicited financing from stanley fulton and anchor.fulton and senior management from anchor met with ross and piontkowski in arizona later that month to discuss financing the acquisition of the property.fulton was apprised of the fraudulent basis of prc and piontkowski claims against giuliano and was made aware of the means and objectives of the illegal scheme.despite this knowledge,fulton and anchor agreed to provide million toward acquisition of the property.mindful of giuliano outstanding claims under the stock purchase agreements,the alleged conspirators formed a straw holding company to shield the property from the potential reach of giuliano.all of prc investors,including ross and piontkowski,combined with fulton and anchor to create ourway realty,llc ourway.
the scheme was successful.with the lis pendens clouding record title,giuliano was unable to obtain the financing necessary to exercise his option before it expired on january.shortly thereafter,prc released,without consideration,its claim against that it had a lease with an option to purchase,thus lifting the cloud on title.the alleged conspirators then acquired the property,ourway took title,and prc entered into a series of leases with ourway.prc did not,however,pay any rent to ourway,and the leases explicitly provided for the automatic termination of prc leasehold interest should giuliano gain control of prc 
according to giuliano,the alleged conspirators have persisted in their misrepresentations to the state courts and to the commission.in the three years following ourway acquisition of the property,prc and piontkowski continued to deny falsely,in state court and commission filings,any knowledge concerning the origin of the forgery.these misrepresentations were allegedly made with the full knowledge and acquiescence of the defendants.
on october,ourway filed an application for a year racing license.the application stated ourway intention to purchase all of prc assets in exchange for a cancellation of debt owed by prc to ourway for accrued unpaid rent.ourway application stated that piontkowski would continue as the manager of the racetrack.the proposed transfer of prc assets to ourway is the most recent ploy to defeat giuliano efforts to reacquire control of the property.
on october,giuliano and henceforth giuliano moved to file an amended complaint in massachusetts federal district court alleging that the defendants were conspirators and active participants in a pattern of racketeering activity whereby mail and wire communications were used to defraud the plaintiffs of valuable property in violation of b d.the district court allowed the amended complaint,but nevertheless dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.the court held that the plaintiffs failed to allege a pattern of racketeering activity sufficient to make out a rico claim because the alleged predicate acts did not amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
in this appeal,giuliano argues that the district court minimized or ignored three important factors that the alleged illegal scheme was carried out over a period of more than four years that the alleged scheme was both extensive and complex and that the alleged scheme posed a societal threat because it perpetrated a fraud on the massachusetts state courts and on the commission.according to giuliano,having overlooked these factors,the court failed to comprehend the true breadth and depth of the alleged racketeering activity.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim,at.when reviewing a.b dismissal,w e accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint,draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff favor and determine whether the complaint,so read,sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.martin applied cellular,cir.
to state a rico claim,plaintiffs must allege four elements conduct,of an enterprise,through a pattern,of racketeering activity.kenda pot money leagues,cir quoting sedima,imrex,d.racketeering activity means any act that violates one of the federal laws specified in the rico statute,see,including the mail and wire fraud statutes,and.at least two acts of racketeering activity must occur within ten years of each other to constitute a pattern.id.the supreme court has construed the pattern element as additionally requiring a showing that the racketeering predicates are related,and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.northwestern bell,d.this is the continuity plus relationship standard.efron embassy suites,cir.
the supreme court has identified two methods for establishing continuity.under the approach,continuity is established by showing a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time that amount to a threat of continued criminal activity,at.because the rico statute was only intended to reach criminal conduct,p redicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy the continuity requirement.id.under the approach,a rico plaintiff need not wait for a pattern to develop,but may state a claim so long as the alleged racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future or are part of an ongoing entity regular way of doing business.id.
in this case,the district court declined to find either or continuity.the court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to establish continuity because the only scheme alleged in the amended complaint,to take over certain valuable real estate in massachusetts,presented no danger of continuing racketeering activity indefinitely into the future.relying on efron,at,the court also concluded that the plaintiffs had not shown continuity because the alleged racketeering activity concerned a single scheme with a closed group of targeted victims.because the parties focus their arguments on the correctness of the court continuity holding,we begin our analysis there.
giuliano primary appellate argument is that the amended complaint alleged numerous predicate acts extending over four years and that these allegations of temporal duration and extensive conduct satisfy the requirement for continuity.he points out that a pattern sometimes can be established by examining only the number of alleged predicate acts and the duration of the alleged racketeering activity.see,at.this is because,where the temporal duration of the alleged activity and the alleged number of predicate acts are so extensive that common sense compels a conclusion of continuity,continuity should be found.efron,at see also fleet credit sion,cir holding that an allegation of fraudulent mailings over a period of four and years is sufficient,without more,to state a pattern of racketeering activity.
conversely,where only a few predicate acts are alleged,or where the period of time is short,continuity can never be established.see sion,at.this is because t oo few acts would suggest that the defendants were engaged in only sporadic activity,and too short a period of time would suggest that defendants were not engaged in criminal conduct.id.quoting,at.
some cases,however,fall into a middle ground where the duration and extensiveness of the alleged conduct does not easily resolve the issue.in these cases,we examine other indicia of continuity,see efron,at where plaintiff alleged acts of wire and mail fraud over months,the time frame was not so long,nor were the predicate acts so many,that other indicators of the lack of without significance,including whether the rico allegation concerns only a single scheme that is not far reaching,see kenda,at apparel art int l,jacobson,cir breyer.in such cases,we decline to find the requisite continuity.see,loiselle,cir rico is not aimed at a single narrow criminal episode,even if that single episode involves behavior that amounts to several crimes.
in light of these principles,our first task is to determine
