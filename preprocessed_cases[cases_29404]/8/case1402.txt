the securities and exchange commission sec appeals from a judgment entered august,dismissing the sec complaint against marc gabelli,the portfolio manager of the mutual fund gabelli global growth fund gggf or the fund,and bruce alpert,the chief operating officer for the fund adviser,gabelli funds,llc gabelli funds or the adviser.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
background 
unless otherwise noted,the following facts are taken from the complaint and are presumed to be true.in essence,the sec complaint charges defendants with failing to disclose favorable treatment accorded one gggf investor in preference to other investors specifically,the fact that gabelli funds,investor adviser to gggf,while prohibiting most gggf investors from engaging in a form of trading called market timing,secretly permitted one investor to market time the fund in exchange for an investment in a hedge fund managed by gabelli.compl.
market timing 
market timing refers,inter alia,to buying and selling mutual fund shares in a manner designed to exploit pricing inefficiencies.see exemptive rule amendments of the independent chair condition staff report,available at.gov news studies indchair.pdf.a mutual fund sells and redeems its shares based on the fund net asset value nav for that day,which is usually calculated at the close of the markets at eastern time.prior to,market timers either buy or redeem a fund shares if they believe that the fund last nav is stale,that it lags behind the current value of a fund portfolio of securities as priced earlier in the day.the market timers can then reverse the transaction at the start of the next day and make a quick profit with relatively little risk.
mutual funds like gggf that invest in overseas securities are especially vulnerable to a kind of market timing known as time zone arbitrage,whereby market timers take advantage of the fact that the foreign markets on which such funds portfolios of securities trade have already closed thereby setting the closing prices for the underlying securities before the close of markets market timers profit from purchasing or redeeming fund shares based on events occurring after foreign market closing prices are established,but before the events have been reflected in the fund nav.in order to turn a quick profit,market timers then reverse their positions by either redeeming or purchasing the fund shares the next day when the events are reflected in the nav.
although market timing is not itself illegal,market timing can harm investors in the fund by rais ing transaction costs for a fund,disrupt ing the fund stated portfolio management strategy,requir ing a fund to maintain an elevated cash position to satisfy redemption requests,result ing in lost opportunity costs and forced liquidations unwanted taxable capital gains for fund shareholders and a reduction of the fund long term performance.id.at.see also janus capital grp.first derivative traders,d although market timing is legal,it harms other investors in the mutual fund.
b.the parties 
gabelli funds,an investment adviser within the meaning of section a of the investment company act of and section a of the investment advisers act of the advisers act,is the investment adviser to gggf,an open end investment company,or mutual fund,registered under the investment company act.compl.marc gabelli was the portfolio manager for gggf and its predecessor fund from to and also managed several hedge funds.id.from to,bruce alpert was gabelli funds chief operating officer and the person who directed the adviser market timing police,a group of gggf employees that monitored trading in the adviser mutual funds in order to restrict market timing.id.najy nasser was the chief investment adviser to folkes asset management,now called headstart advisers headstart.id.
c.the alleged misconduct 
the complaint alleges that from until,gabelli and alpert permitted headstart to engage in time zone arbitrage which defendants referred to as scalping that took advantage of stale pricing opportunities in gggf.id.initially the amount of such scalping was limited,but on april,gabelli allegedly agreed to permit headstart to increase its market timing capacity from million to million,in exchange for a million investment by headstart in a hedge fund that gabelli managed.id.headstart million investment,which constituted approximately four percent of gabelli hedge fund assets,was made the day after headstart increase in market timing.id.
between april and the spring of,headstart increased market timing in gggf shares regularly involved between four and fifteen percent of gggf assets.id.eventually,however,following instructions from the fund parent company,gabelli and alpert caused headstart to reduce its ownership in gggf and,in august,to cease its market timing activity,whereupon headstart redeemed its remaining investment in gabelli hedge fund.id.
prior to the cessation,however,and during the same period that gabelli and alpert were approving headstart market timing in gggf shares,alpert and gabelli banned at least other gggf accounts from market timing and rejected market timing purchases totaling at least million.id.as early as december,alpert drafted an internal memorandum that explained that since market timers scalpers have been using the international and global funds in a way that is disruptive to the fund and the management of the portfolio,the adviser was making efforts to identify each account and restrict them for purchasing the funds.id.for the next two years,market timing police employees instructed by alpert to monitor market timing activity within gabelli funds reviewed purchases in global funds if it appeared that the purchase was a market timing trade,the purchase was rejected and sometimes the account was banned from making future purchases.id.yet,during the very same period,alpert instructed the market timing police to ignore headstart market timing activity because it was a marc gabelli client relationship,and assured nasser that headstart accounts would not be blocked.id.
according to the complaint,headstart market timing unfairly favored headstart over all other gggf investors.thus,while headstart three accounts that market timed gggf shares during the relevant period earned rates of return of percent,percent,and percent,respectively,the rate of return for all other gggf shareholders over the same period was,at best,negative percent.id.headstart market timing also caused annual dilution ranging from one to four percent of gggf assets.id.
while headstart was market timing gggf,the defendants allegedly did not disclose to gggf board of directors or to the other gggf shareholders that headstart was market timing,that it was being given an advantage accorded no other shareholder,and that there was a conflict of interest created by the agreement with headstart.as a result,the board was allegedly misled into believing that the adviser was taking all necessary steps to reduce or ban market timing activity in general.id.for example,on february,alpert and gabelli attended a gggf board meeting where they each addressed the board.alpert told the board about the dangers of market timing and the efforts that gabelli funds was undertaking to eliminate this practice,but failed to disclose that headstart was being permitted to market time gggf.immediately after alpert report,gabelli reported on operations of gggf,but also failed to disclose headstart market timing.after the meeting,alpert and gabelli continued to allow headstart to engage in market timing trades.id.
according to the complaint,even after the market timing ceased,the defendants continued to mislead the board and gggf investors.in particular,on september,the same day that the new york attorney general announced he was investigating market timing in mutual funds alpert,in an alleged effort to reassure gggf investors,posted a memorandum the memorandum on the website of gabelli funds parent company.id.the memorandum stated that 
f or more than two years,scalpers have been identified and restricted or banned from making further trades.purchases from accounts with a history of frequent trades were rejected.since august,large transactions in the global,international and gold funds have been rejected without regard to the past history.while these procedures were in place they did not completely eliminate all timers.
id.in light of what gabelli and alpert knew and,indeed,had authorized in market timing by headstart,this memorandum,the complaint alleges,was materially misleading.id.
finally,the complaint alleges that because of the secret nature of the defendants wrongdoing,as well as the defendants affirmative misrepresentations to gggf board and shareholders,the sec did not discover the fraud until late.id.
on april,the sec filed its complaint against the defendants,alleging in its first claim that alpert had violated the antifraud provisions of section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,b,in its second claim that alpert had violated the antifraud provisions of section a of the securities act of,a,and in its third claim that both alpert and gabelli had aided and abetted violations by the adviser of the antifraud provisions of sections and of the advisers act.as relief for these violations,the sec sought injunctions against future violations,disgorgement of gains,and civil monetary penalties.
on july,each of the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.on march,the district court granted the defendants motions in substantial part.first,the district court dismissed the securities act and securities exchange act claims against alpert,finding that alpert statement in the memorandum that for more than two years,scalpers have been identified and restricted or banned from making further trades was literally true and that because this statement was not a misrepresentation alpert had no duty to disclose fully headstart.sec gabelli,civ.dab,wl,at.second,while the district court denied defendants motion to dismiss the advisers act claim,it ruled that the sec could not seek civil penalties for that claim because a the sec did not bring the claim within the statute of limitations period applicable to such penalties,and b the sec is not authorized to seek monetary penalties for aiding and abetting violations of the advisers act.id.at.third,the district court dismissed the sec prayer for injunctive relief because the sec has not plausibly alleged that defendants are reasonable likely to engage in future violations.id.at.thus,the sec advisers act claim against the defendants survived the motions to dismiss,but the district court barred all relief other than disgorgement.
believing that disgorgement would not provide significant relief,the sec moved to voluntarily dismiss the remaining claim without prejudice to the sec refiling this claim if,but only if,the sec were successful in this appeal.the district court granted the motion over the defendants objections and entered judgment accordingly.
the sec now appeals the district court dismissal of its securities act and securities exchange act claims against alpert and the district court rejection of the sec prayers for civil penalties and injunctive relief for the defendants aiding and abetting violations of the advisers act.in addition to opposing the sec appeal,both defendants have,contending that the district court erred in denying their motions to dismiss the sec prayer for disgorgement under the advisers act and,more generally,in denying their motions to dismiss with prejudice the sec claim for aiding and abetting violations of the advisers act.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we first address whether we have jurisdiction to hear the instant appeals.we generally lack jurisdiction over an appeal from a dismissal of some of plaintiff claims when the balance of the claims have been dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a rule a dismissal of the action,because permitting such an appeal would allow the parties to effectively secure an otherwise unavailable interlocutory appeal.chappelle beacon commc ns,cir.however,in purdy zeldes,cir,we recognized an exception to this rule where a plaintiff ability to reassert a claim is made conditional on obtaining a reversal from this court.id.under these circumstances,a judgment may be deemed final,because the plaintiff runs the risk that if his appeal is unsuccessful,his case comes to an end.id.
given purdy,it is clear that we have jurisdiction to consider the sec appeal,since the only dismissal that was without prejudice was expressly conditioned on the sec promise not to reassert this claim unless its appeal of this dismissal was successful on appeal.however,given the strong policy against interlocutory appeals,we see no reason to extend the narrow exception announced in purdy to the defendants.nor do we think we should exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the.the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction which allows us,where we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of one ruling,to exercise jurisdiction over other,otherwise unappealable interlocutory decisions,see myers hertz,cir internal quotation marks omitted should be exercised sparingly,if ever,bolmer oliveira,cir internal quotation marks omitted.assuming the doctrine applies here at all,we see here none of the exceptional circumstances,papineau parmley,cir internal quotation marks omitted,that would warrant its invocation at this juncture.we therefore limit ourselves to the sec appeal.
standard of review 
turning to the merits of that appeal,we review the district court grant of the motions to dismiss de novo,accept ing all allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.operating local annuity trust fund smith barney fund mgmt.llc,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,however,a complaint must allege a plausible set of facts sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.quoting bell atl.twombly,d.
c.the securities act and securities exchange act claims against alpert 
applying these standards,we first consider whether the district court erred in dismissing the securities act and securities exchange act claims against alpert that were premised on the theory that his statements in the memorandum of were materially misleading.that memorandum,as noted,stated that for more than two years,scalpers have been identified and restricted or banned from making further trades but that the adviser did not completely eliminate all timers.the district court was apparently of the view that because such statements were literally true,they could not be misleading.see gabelli,wl,at.
the law is well settled,however,that literally true statements that create a materially misleading impression will support claims for securities fraud.see list fashion park,cir see also rule,b.here,the complaint plausibly alleges that a reasonable investor reading the memorandum would conclude that the adviser had attempted in good faith to reduce or eliminate gggf market timing across the board,whereas,as alpert well knew but failed to disclose,the adviser had expressly agreed to let one major investor,headstart,engage in a very large amount of gggf market timing,in return for headstart investment in a separate hedge fund run by gabelli.the district court therefore erred in dismissing the securities act and securities exchange act claims.
alpert further argues,however,that even if the statements in the memorandum were misleading,the district court determination can be affirmed on either of two alternate grounds a failure to adequately allege materiality or a failure to adequately allege intent.
as to materiality,a complaint may not properly be dismissed on the ground that the alleged misstatements or omissions are not material unless they are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.ganino citizens utils,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the complaint alleges that,pursuant to an undisclosed agreement between the defendants and headstart,the latter was
