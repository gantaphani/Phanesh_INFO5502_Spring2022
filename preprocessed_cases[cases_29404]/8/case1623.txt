jack woods woods appeals from the august,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york irizarry,dismissing for lack of standing his complaint asserting a private cause of action under b,the medicare secondary payer statute the msp.woods argues primarily that the msp private cause of action provision,b a,which allows a private party to bring suit to recover from a primary insurer amounts the insurer was required,but failed,to pay,grants all private parties standing to bring suit to recover such funds in a qui tam action on behalf of the government.he also contends,in the alternative,that he has suffered an injury sufficient to grant him standing to bring his action against regardless whether b a creates a qui tam action.because we conclude that b a does not authorize a private party to bring a qui tam action and that woods does not otherwise have standing to pursue the claims asserted in his complaint,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
procedural history 
on february,woods,proceeding pro se,filed a complaint against in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.as alleged in the complaint,empire health choice,empire is a medicare carrier and rendering services on behalf of beneficiaries of the medicare program.among empire purported duties in administering the medicare program is ensuring that claims primarily covered by a beneficiary private insurance are paid by the primary insurer,not medicare.the complaint further asserted both that empire had failed to ensure that such claims were paid by the applicable primary insurers and that empire was itself a primary insurer directly responsible for a substantial portion of the unpaid amounts.it contained no allegations,however,indicating how woods had been individually injured by empire alleged conduct.rather,it stated merely that woods was a resident of the state of new york,that empire actions required the government to incur substantial costs in order to realize only partial recovery of the amounts owed to it,and that millions would be saved annually for the taxpayers of america if empire adhered to its alleged duties.drawing upon these factual allegations,the complaint asserted that empire was liable under b a for all amounts paid from medicare funds for which empire,as an insurer,was primarily liable.
instead of filing an answer,empire moved to dismiss woods complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim on which relief might be granted.see.b.following the filing of this motion,woods delayed filing any papers in opposition,repeatedly requesting extensions of time to which empire consented.these requests eventually culminated in a deadline of august,for woods to submit any opposition to empire motion.that date passed without woods making any filing.accordingly,by letter dated september,empire requested that its motion be deemed unopposed.the district court initially granted this request.shortly after the district court issued this order,however,woods,still proceeding pro se,submitted a letter requesting vacatur and the award of one last extension of time.the district court agreed,vacating its previous decision and granting woods until october of that year to file papers opposing empire motion.
on october,empire counsel received a fax from attorney edward bailey,who purported to represent woods and who represents woods in this appeal,containing papers responding to empire motion.in addition to a memorandum of law,the opposition papers contained documentary evidence of empire use of medicare funds to pay for medical care received by woods.the fax cover sheet indicated that a hard copy of the opposition papers would follow by mail.no such copy followed within the next week,however.only after empire counsel repeatedly requested a hard copy of the document was it eventually delivered on november.empire then requested that the district court consider the purported opposition papers void on account of improper and untimely service and deem empire motion unopposed.the district court granted this request.in so doing,it also noted that bailey had yet to file a notice of appearance on behalf of woods,causing woods to remain technically a pro se litigant.
some months later,the district court issued a decision granting empire initial motion and dismissing woods suit for lack of standing.noting that woods complaint contained no allegations indicating that empire had failed to make a required payment for medical care received by woods or that woods was even a medicare recipient,it determined that woods did not possess standing under the ordinary requirements.in addition,it concluded,drawing upon several differences between the msp and several statutes recognized as establishing qui tam actions,that the msp did not create a qui tam action allowing any private party to bring suit on behalf of the government to recover any amounts erroneously paid by medicare instead of a primary insurer.this appeal followed.
b.the medicare secondary payer statute 
under b a i,medicare generally may not pay for any item or service if payment has been made,or can reasonably be expected to be made,with respect to the item or service under a primary plan.on the other hand,if the relevant primary plan has not made or can not reasonably be expected to make payment with respect to such item or service promptly,medicare may make the necessary payment.id.b b i.should,however,it be determined that the primary plan was in fact obligated to pay for the item or service at issue,the primary plan must reimburse medicare for that payment.see id.b b ii.under these circumstances,the government may bring an action for reimbursement against any entity required to make such a payment or any entity that has received payment from a primary plan or from the proceeds of a primary plan payment to any entity.see id.b b iii.furthermore,the government is subrogated to the extent of payment made by medicare but required to be paid by a primary plan to any right under the msp of an individual to payment under a primary plan.id.b b iv.
in addition to the governmental action described above,the msp also establishes a private right of action to recover amounts owed by a primary plan.specifically,it states that 
there is established a private cause of action for damages which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided in the case of a primary plan which fails to provide for primary payment or appropriate reimbursement 
id.b a.the msp does not further describe the private action it establishes.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of woods complaint for lack of standing pursuant to.b and b.see klein.futures,bd.of trade,cir.w e presume the general factual allegations embrace those facts necessary to support the claim and are constrained not only to accept the truth of woods jurisdictional allegations,but also to construe all reasonable inferences to be drawn from those allegations in woods favor.brooklyn legal servs.legal servs,cir citation omitted.
in order to have standing to bring suit,a plaintiff is constitutionally required to have suffered a concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent that is traceable to defendant conduct and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d port.teachers ass bd.of,cir.in addition to the constitutional requirements,standing doctrine ordinarily embraces several prudential requirements,including,inter alia,the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights and the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.allen wright,d see also lerner fleet bank,cir ctr.for reproductive law policy bush,cir.
even if we construe woods pro se complaint liberally,see bertin united states,cir,it manifestly fails to establish his standing to bring this action.the complaint identifies woods merely as a resident of the state of new york.it alleges no direct injury to him whatsoever.instead,the complaint asserts only that the government has suffered substantial p
