this appeal involves a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company for allegedly defrauding the federal medicaid and medicare programs.the suit is based on the false claims act,an unusual federal statute that allows private parties,called relators,to stand in for the united states and bring what are known as qui tam actions because qui tam actions let private individuals recover damages for wrongs done to the united states,a special threshold bar the rule sometimes stands in their way.it is that bar that is in dispute here.
the rule is so named because it blocks qui tam suits that are filed while similar enough ones are already pending.in this case,the district court ruled appellants qui tam suit could not go forward because a florida pharmacy years before had brought one a lot like it.we agree with the district court on that point and thus affirm the dismissal of appellants suit.because that decision takes care of this appeal,we do not decide the other issues the parties discuss.
to understand why we are only now considering the rule in a case that began nine years ago,we need to describe the two qui tam actions involved,the alleged fraud each identified,and the complicated procedural path that led the district court to decide their similarities required the later suit dismissal.to do all of that,though,we first need to go back nearly two decades,to.
that was when ven a care of the florida keys,the pharmacy,filed the first of the two qui tam actions involved here.ven a care alleged a number of pharmaceutical companies had fraudulently inflated the prices of their drugs,thus securing higher reimbursements through medicare and medicaid than they deserved.among the many companies named in ven a care complaint was baxter healthcare corporation.
baxter status as a defendant was kept from public view for more than a decade because ven a care filed its qui tam suit under seal.see b,false claims act complaints must be filed in camera and may be kept under seal at the government behest.but in,the united states decided not to intervene in ven a care case,and that led to the complaint unsealing see id.b b.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation then consolidated ven a care suit with nearly one hundred similar actions most filed under laws other than the false claims act in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.see in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,d in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price.
about a year later,in october of,baxter and ven a care reached a settlement agreement.baxter agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars to be shared between ven a care and the united states.in return,the settlement agreement and release purported to fully and finally release,acquit,and forever discharge baxter from any and all civil,regulatory,administrative claim,action,suit,demand,right,cause of action,liability,judgment,damage,or proceeding which has been asserted,could have been asserted,or could be asserted in the future for or arising from any of the covered conduct.the agreement defined covered conduct as baxter submission of inflated price and cost figures,and its subsequent receipt of reimbursements,for any and all drugs manufactured,marketed sold by or on its behalf.
despite that agreement,the false claims act prevented ven a care from voluntarily dismissing its action against baxter without the federal government consent.see b.but ven a care soon did get that consent,and the district court then entered judgment dismissing ven a care action against baxter,thus seemingly ending baxter role in the case.baxter involvement in false claims act litigation,however,was not over.instead,a new front of litigation had opened.
years before the dismissal of ven a care suit,linnette sun,one of baxter former employees,and greg hamilton,an employee of one of its longtime customers had teamed up to file a qui tam action of their own against baxter,and that action was still pending when baxter settled with ven a care ven a care and baxter were aware of sun and hamilton suit when they concluded their settlement talks,but they did not directly alert sun and hamilton to their impending agreement instead,after the united states signed off on baxter settlement with ven a care and that suit had been dismissed,baxter moved for summary judgment in sun and hamilton case.
in doing so,baxter argued the ven a care settlement released not only the pharmacy claims against it,but also sun and hamilton claims as well.sun and hamilton countered they were not parties to the ven a care action and the united states consent to the settlement was,as the government put it,to the dismissal with prejudice only of claims pled in relator ven a care complaint against baxter.statement of the united states regarding the consent of the united states to the dismissal with prejudice of claims pursuant to b in a related matter,in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,cv pbs,ecf emphasis added.sun and hamilton thus argued the ven a care settlement agreement should not be read to release their claims.the district court disagreed,however,and granted summary judgment.
but baxter was still not free and clear.sun and hamilton argued in a motion for reconsideration that even if the ven a care settlement did cover their claims,the agreement could not release those claims until sun and hamilton got a hearing on whether the proposed settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable under all the circumstances.c b.their argument depended on their characterization of the settlement as an alternate remedy the united states had chosen to pursue for baxter fraud.see id.c.
the district court agreed with sun and hamilton that the settlement was an alternate remedy under the act,but that presented a procedural puzzle about how sun and hamilton could get the fairness hearing.after all,the ven a care suit had already been dismissed,and thus that case was over.the district court suggested a possible solution might be available through an arguably novel construction of federal rule of civil procedure b,which allows parties to move to reopen judgments in certain limited circumstances.in response,sun and hamilton filed a motion in ven a care case against baxter to which sun and hamilton were not parties that argued they had a right to a fairness hearing under the false claims act that required reopening the ven a care judgment.
that motion,in turn,led to the ruling we now focus on in this appeal.in responding to sun and hamilton rule b motion,baxter for the first time argued that,wholly apart from the settlement agreement with ven a care,sun and hamilton could not proceed with their suit.the reason,baxter argued,was that ven a care qui tam action which was pending when sun and hamilton filed theirs stated all the essential facts of the fraud alleged by sun and hamilton.as a result,baxter contended,the ven a care complaint had triggered the false claims act bar and thus,sun and hamilton suit could not go forward.
the district court agreed,and denied the rule b motion solely for that reason,entering identical orders in both sun and hamilton own lawsuit and the ven a care case in which they sought to intervene.the court thus left unaddressed the issues about the statutory right to a fairness hearing sun and hamilton might enjoy and its potential bearing on reopening the ven a care case.the district court then dismissed sun and hamilton suit.
sun and hamilton now appeal that judgment of dismissal.they challenge not only the district court ruling but also its earlier summary judgment decision finding that ven a care settlement with baxter also released sun and hamilton claims against baxter.baxter and ven a care defend both rulings as appellees.
the rule is,at least in this circuit,jurisdictional.united states ex rel.wilson bristol myers squibb,cir the fca rule is jurisdictional.but united states ex rel.shea cellco,srinivasan,concurring in part and dissenting in part noting that circuit has not definitively ruled on bar jurisdictional character.if we affirm on that ground,therefore,we would not reach whether baxter settlement agreement with ven a care independently released sun and hamilton claims,as the district court initially held.nor would we reach whether the government,by consenting to the ven a care settlement,secured an alternate remedy for baxter alleged fraud,such that sun and hamilton were entitled to a fairness hearing before that settlement agreement could take effect,as the district court later determined.nor,further,would we reach whether sun and hamilton,as,could move to reopen the ven a care judgment,as the district court also ruled.and so we skip over these various issues the district court acknowledged they presented a procedural pretzel so we may focus on an issue that precedes them all whether the district court was right to accept baxter defense.
we begin with the portion of the false claims act that gives rise to the rule b.it states that,when a private party files a qui tam action under the false claims act,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.
of course,lawsuits,like anything else,may be related along many dimensions.and the ways in which a subsequent filing might be based on the facts of an earlier one are many as well.but this circuit has explained that what matters,given this statutory language and the act underlying purposes,are two things the relationship between the fraud alleged in the two qui tam actions,and the extent to which the facts alleged in the qui tam action suffice to provide the government with notice of the fraud that has been alleged by the second.see wilson,at united states ex rel.heineman guta guidant,cir united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir.
this focus makes good sense.by limiting when qui tam suits may be brought,the act in section b does not guarantee that anyone with useful information about fraudulent conduct against the united states may recover damages by bringing a suit based on such knowledge.rather,the act seeks to ensure the federal government receives the information it needs to launch a meaningful investigation into fraudulent conduct.wilson,at.that purpose of the qui tam action under b is satisfied when the government receives a complaint that contains genuinely valuable information of sufficiently quality.heineman guta,at quoting united states ex rel.lacorte smithkline beecham clinical,cir.and treating such a complaint as precluding a similar enough one furthers the act purposes in another way.such treatment provide s incentives to relators to promptly alert the government of any fraud.wilson,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.there is thus no reason to read section b to let relators sue merely because they offer additional information that might also help the government carry out its investigation.
against this background,the rule requires that we check to see whether the complaint in the first qui tam suit provided enough detail to ensure that the government knows the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme for once the government knows that much,it has enough information to discover related frauds.id.at quoting united states ex rel.branch consultants allstate ins,cir.or,as we have put the point elsewhere,to provide sufficient notice to the government of the alleged fraud and bar a complaint under b,complaints must provide only the essential facts to give the government sufficient notice to initiate an investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices also alleged in the action.heineman guta,at.
in this way,the statement in heineman guta that a complaint need provide only sufficient notice to initiate an investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices,id.at,informs the essential facts test,it does not supplant it.before barring a second complaint,we must ask not merely whether the complaint provides some evidence from which an astute government official could arguably have been put on notice,id.at,but also whether the first complaint contained all the essential facts of the fraud it alleges,id.at citation omitted.
under this essential facts standard,a claim can not go ahead if it states all the essential facts of a claim or the same elements of a fraud described in an earlier suit.wilson,at quoting duxbury,at.it follows that there need not be identity between the two complaints to trigger the rule.t he rule still bar s a later claim even if that claim incorporates somewhat different details.id.at alteration in original quoting duxbury,at.
with this legal framework in mind,we compare the ven a care complaint to the sun and hamilton complaint.see in re natural gas royalties qui tam litig.appeals,cir the bar is designed to be quickly and easily determinable,simply requiring a comparison of the complaints.united states ex rel.poteet medtronic,inc,cir in order to determine whether a relator complaint runs afoul of b bar,a court must compare the relator complaint with the allegedly complaint.in doing so,we review de novo whether the first complaint meets the essential facts test,as that test presents a question of law about the statutorily required threshold for notifying the government of the fraud alleged in the suit.wilson,at.
in many qui tam suits involving the rule,a central question is whether the two actions concern the same fraud or distinct ones.but sun and hamilton lead with a different contention.they claim the ven a care complaint was so vague and conclusory when it came to baxter conduct that it was as if the complaint alleged no fraud at all.thus,they argue that only they provided the type of information necessary to give the government a meaningful head start on its investigation into baxter fraud.they stress they identified names,meetings,statements,and documents specific to baxter fraudulent scheme,while,they argue,ven a care set forth none.
but sun and hamilton are not fair to the ven a care complaint.the ven a care complaint did lack the detail sun and hamilton sets forth,but it was not bereft of facts specific to baxter allegedly fraudulent conduct.the ven a care complaint did at numerous points attribute the fraud to the defendants through the use of plural indefinite pronouns,such as each or all.but that way of identifying the defendants does not make the ven a care complaint any less useful to the federal government.baxter was covered by those same words,and the false claims act surely should not be read to discourage a relator from alleging a fraud perpetrated by many defendants.
in any event,ven a care complaint contained a separate section devoted solely to baxter.in that section,ven a care alleged baxter knowingly made false representations about the price and cost of its drugs in order to receive fraudulently inflated reimbursements from medicare and medicaid and further made or used false records or statements regarding its prices and costs of the drugs and submitted same to medicare and medicaid.ven a care also alleged baxter got reimbursed for a number of drugs including the drug recombinate,which baxter manufactured above their true costs and prices.indeed,even sun and hamilton acknowledge ven a care disclosed a pricing spread for recombinate.the contention that ven a care complaint entirely lacked allegations,therefore,is simply wrong.
sun and hamilton are on stronger ground in saying their complaint showed greater familiarity with how baxter pulled off the supposed fraud.by drawing on their inside knowledge as a former employee of baxter and a former employee of a longstanding customer of baxter,respectively,sun and hamilton did offer far more detail than ven a care about particular actors within baxter and the role those actors played.whether that matters,however,is a different issue.
we have made clear the rule does not necessarily protect more detailed,complaints from less detailed,ones.see wilson,at.so long as the first complaint sets forth the essential facts of the fraud alleged in the second complaint,it does all it needs to do under the rule.id.at.thus,sun and hamilton must show not only that they provided more detail than ven a care,but also that ven a care did not provide enough detail even if it provided some.
exactly how specific a complaint must be to provide the essential facts is not something we have previously described with precision.and precision may be too much to ask,given the nature of the inquiry.still,important guidance may be found in our decision in heineman guta.
there,we explained that,for purposes of b,a complaint need not contain the kind of detailed and particularized allegations of fraudulent conduct such as the names of the particular persons responsible for carrying out certain aspects of an alleged fraud required to fulfill the heightened pleading standard for fraud cases set forth in federal rule of civil procedure b see heineman guta,at.we also addressed an argument much like the one sun and hamilton now press that an qui tam complaint was too unspecific to bar a qui tam suit,even if rule b did not establish the minimum amount of detail a qui tam complaint must provide to trigger the false claims act bar.
heineman guta involved a relator who brought a qui tam action that claimed her employer and one of its affiliates had engaged in a kickback scheme to promote the sale and use of cardiac devices they manufactured.id.at.thirteen months before that relator sued,however,another former employee had filed a qui tam complaint against the same company.id.at.the second relator argued the complaint filed by the first,which the parties agreed disclosed a fraudulent scheme nearly identical to the one alleged in the second relator complaint,id.at,fail ed the essential facts test because it lack ed allegations that the scheme actually caused physicians to implant the employer devices or that those devices were covered by medicare,id.at.we rejected that argument because a complaint need not contain a detailed narration of how the scheme led to the submission of false claims to trigger the rule.id.instead,we found sufficient for purposes of section b the first complaint allegations that the company caused false statements and claims to be made to the government for reimbursement under medicare through multiple forms of kickbacks designed to induce physicians and hospitals to use their devices.id.
ven a care complaint,too,did not offer a of events or a detailed narration of how the alleged fraud played out.but the complaint did identify the key highlights about how baxter conducted the supposed fraud.the complaint detailed the particular pricing mechanism baxter used for carrying out the alleged fraud leveraging the knowledge that medicare and medicaid based their reimbursement payments on cost and price estimates that were reported by various commercially available drug pricing compendia,and thus entering into special arrangements with select wholesalers in order to artificially inflate the estimates that were supplied to the compendia and then reported by them.the complaint specified the drugs involved including,among many others,the recombinate.the complaint described the time period during which the scheme occurred the period starting from on or before december,and continuing through the date on which it was filed,december.and the complaint set forth what ven a care contended was corroborating evidence of baxter fraud namely,a chart listing various reported costs and prices.
ven a care complaint thus hardly resembles the example sun and hamilton cite in their brief of a complaint they contend could not possibly trigger the bar a complaint stating nothing more than baxter is committing pricing fraud against the government.nor is the ven a care complaint the kind of overly broad and speculative complaint we have indicated can not suffice to notify the government of a fraudulent scheme.id.at.instead,ven a care complaint contained the essential facts of baxter alleged fraud,and thus gave the government sufficient notice to initiate an investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices.id.at.
this conclusion is consistent with our other precedents,even though sun and hamilton say otherwise.sun and hamilton rely in particular on our decision in duxbury.there,we held an qui tam complaint about an allegedly fraudulent scheme involving drug pricing did not bar a second relator suit alleging the same defendant had engaged in an promotion scheme at.standing on its own,duxbury might be read to support sun and hamilton position.duxbury did say the complaint contained a number of allegations that discuss,in significant detail,the alleged promotion scheme,and duxbury did allow that second,more detailed complaint to survive the bar.id.at emphasis added.
but our decision to allow the second suit to go forward in duxbury did not rest on the greater detail in the later complaint.instead,as we later explained in wilson,the key difference was that the complaint alleged a complex promotion and direct marketing scheme,while the original complaint focused on kickbacks and in fact nowhere refer red to an promotion scheme.wilson,at alteration in original quoting duxbury,at.thus,even if the initial complaint in duxbury provided some evidence relevant to the complex promotion and direct marketing scheme,it still did not provide the essential facts about the complex fraud because that fraud was described and identified only in the complaint and nowhere in the earlier one.id.
so understood,duxbury is a very different case from this one.with one possible caveat we address below,sun and hamilton and ven a care do not dispute that their respective complaints each focused on the same fraudulent scheme.and,as we have explained,each described that scheme in significant detail.the only divergence in their complaints,therefore,is the same one we thought too slight in wilson.as there,the later relators here sun and hamilton included many details about the underlying scheme the first relator ven a care did not supply.but the use of comparatively greater detail in describing the same underlying fraud is not what matters for the rule.otherwise,the essential facts test would be reduced to an identical facts test.see wilson,at.and,as we explained in wilson,such an understanding of the essential facts test can not be right because once the government knows the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme,it has enough information to discover related frauds.at quoting branch consultants,at.
simply put,once the government gets sufficiently valuable information from a qui tam complaint about the same fraud alleged by a complaint,the purposes of the rule have been fully served and here,both complaints focused on the very same fraud baxter allegedly committed,and the first of the complaints,ven a care,provided enough specific information about the alleged fraud to satisfy the rule.
sun and hamilton do make one final argument.this one does not focus on the comparatively greater detail they supplied about the fraud in question,or on the supposedly insufficient detail ven a care offered.instead,sun and hamilton argue their complaint and theirs alone sketched out the inner workings of baxter fraudulent scheme after the year,and that baxter post conduct resulted in a fraudulent scheme separate from the fraud ven a care identified.thus,at least as to baxter post conduct,sun and hamilton portray themselves to be like the second relator in duxbury the only one who sufficiently alleged the complex promotion scheme 
this argument would have some force if true.but sun and hamilton complaint suggests baxter fraud did not change much after or,at least,not enough to distinguish it from the fraud described in the ven a care complaint.
according to sun and hamilton,in the new york medicaid fraud control unit apprised various pharmacy directors of a pattern of misrepresentations by drug manufacturers of the average wholesale prices and acquisition costs of their drugs.as a result,sun and hamilton alleged,some of the industry reporting compendia agreed to stop reporting average wholesale price values published by drug manufacturers and to instead report figures on the basis of true market prices.
sun and hamilton alleged baxter got around this new practice by providing the compendia with what baxter called list sales prices.although they went by a different name,these list sales prices like the average wholesale prices the compendia now refused to accept also reflected artificially inflated amounts paid b
