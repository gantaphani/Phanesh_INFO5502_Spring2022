the petitioner,jose maria guerrero,is a native and citizen of the dominican republic.he seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia,dated december,vacating a prior decision to reopen proceedings,and reinstating a prior order of deportation.because the bia acted pursuant to its discretionary sua sponte authority,we lack jurisdiction to review the petition.
background 
we relate only the necessary factual and procedural background to provide context for our decision.
initial deportation proceedings 
guerrero was admitted to the united states on may,as a lawful permanent resident.on may,he was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in violation of new york law.by virtue of this conviction,the former immigration and naturalization service ins commenced deportation proceedings against guerrero in september,filing an order to show cause osc with the immigration court.the ins charged guerrero with deportability under a b i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b i as an alien convicted of violating a controlled substance law,and submitted the conviction record as evidence.appearing with counsel before an immigration judge ij on april,guerrero through written pleadings admitted the osc factual allegations,and conceded his deportability as charged.as relief from deportation,however,guerrero sought a waiver of inadmissibility under former ina c.see c,repealed by illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,title iii,b,stat,at a later hearing on march,the ij gave guerrero the opportunity to withdraw his pleadings admitting the osc allegations and conceding deportability,and to contest deportability.when he declined,the ij ruled that guerrero admissions and concession of deportability,along with the evidence on the record,sustained the charge of deportability.the ij then pretermitted guerrero application for c the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,precluded c relief for all aliens deportable by reason of having committed any controlled substance offenses and ordered his deportation.
guerrero appealed the ij decision to the bia on april.on february,while the appeal was still pending before the bia,guerrero pled nolo contendere in rhode island state court to a charge of manufacturing delivering a schedule controlled substance cocaine,for which he received a deferred sentence of five years on july,the bia unaware of the rhode island conviction sustained guerrero appeal of the ij march,decision because the aedpa restrictions the ij relied on did not apply retroactively to proceedings commenced on or before april,and guerrero proceedings had commenced when he was served with the osc on september.it remanded the record back to the ij to allow guerrero the opportunity to apply for c relief.
on september,during a hearing on remand,ins orally amended the osc to reflect the rhode island conviction.according to the ins,guerrero was now also subject to deportation under former ina a a iii,a a iii as an alien who,at any time after admission,is convicted of an aggravated felony.the ij,finding the rhode island conviction qualified as an aggravated felony,again pretermitted guerrero claim for c relief on september,and ordered him removed and deported to the dominican republic on the two charges lodged against him.guerrero timely appealed to the bia.and on january,the bia affirmed the ij september,decision,agreeing that guerrero rhode island conviction precluded him from c relief.guerrero was physically removed from the united states to the dominican republic on september.
reopening of proceedings 
on january,guerrero entered the united states,without inspection or admission.more than a year later,on june,he filed an untimely motion with the bia to reopen his proceedings guerrero contended that reopening was warranted because his rhode island conviction had been vacated,and he submitted the may,rhode island state court order vacating said conviction.ins did not respond to this motion.the bia denied the motion to reopen on july,explaining guerrero rhode island conviction remained final for immigration purposes because it was unable to ascertain whether the rhode island state court action was taken pursuant to a rehabilitative statute or to ameliorate the immigration consequences of guerrero conviction.
on march,guerrero filed an untimely motion to reconsider the bia july,decision reiterating that a conviction no longer existed to support his deportability under the a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,and that he was thus not barred from being considered for a c waiver of inadmissibility,guerrero submitted documentation evidencing that the criminal charge underpinning the rhode island conviction had been dismissed on the grounds that the state can not sustain its burden of proof in the prosecution of this matter.ins did not respond to this motion either.
although guerrero motion was untimely the bia nevertheless decided to sua sponte reopen the proceedings on june,remanded the record back to the ij for further consideration of guerrero deportability under a a iii,eligibility for c relief,and any other relief for which he may currently qualify.in doing so,the bia explained that the evidence submitted with the motion was undisputably probative and potentially dispositive of whether a conviction exists to support guerrero deportability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,and by extension to preclude him from being considered for c relief.it further explained mistakenly that because guerrero has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states for over years,he might be able to demonstrate eligibility for section c.
at a hearing on remand on may,before a new ij,ins challenged guerrero eligibility for relief from removal,arguing that he was no longer a lawful permanent resident under p,and that the bia had improperly reopened proceedings in light of his deportation.following further briefing on the issue,the ij issued a decision on november,holding that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate guerrero c waiver application or any other application for relief due to the departure bar of b,which limited its jurisdiction to adjudicate motions filed by aliens who had left the united states the ij ordered guerrero deportation for the third time.
c.the bia sua sponte reconsideration 
guerrero appealed this decision to the bia on december.three days later,on december,ins filed a motion to vacate the june,sua sponte reopening order.on december,the bia issued its decision the subject of this appeal determining that its june,order sua sponte reopening proceedings was issued in error.citing legal and factual errors in its prior decision to sua sponte reopen proceedings,the bia reconsidered the june,decision,and ultimately denied guerrero march,motion to reconsider.accordingly,the bia granted ins motion to vacate vacated its own june,sua sponte order,as well as the ij november,decision ordering guerrero deportation denied guerrero march,motion to reconsider and dismissed guerrero appeal from the ij november,decision as moot.the bia then declared that its january,deportation order remained in effect.
ii.analysis 
advancing multiple arguments,guerrero now petitions for review of the bia november,order the most recent one effectively denying sua sponte reopening proceedings,and asks us to reverse it.but we can not.we lack jurisdiction to do so.
although we typically have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reopen by the bia,there are exceptions to that general rule.peralta holder,cir.one of these exceptions is the review of a decision not to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte,because t here are no guidelines or standards which dictate how and when the bia should invoke its sua sponte power,córdoba quiroz gonzáles,app x,cir alteration in original quoting luis,cir internal quotation marks omitted the bia regulations provide that it may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.cerrato marquez holder,app x,cir quoting a souter.and this decision of whether to invoke its sua spo
