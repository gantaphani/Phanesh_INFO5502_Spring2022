on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court,except as to part iv.
we consider whether medicaid providers can sue to enforce a of the medicaid act.stat.codified as amended at a a.
medicaid is a federal program that subsidizes the states provision of medical services to families with dependent children and of aged,blind,or disabled individuals,whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.like other spending clause legislation,medicaid offers the states a bargain congress provides federal funds in exchange for the states agreement to spend them in accordance with congressionally imposed conditions.
in order to qualify for medicaid funding,the state of idaho adopted,and the federal government approved,a medicaid plan,a,which idaho administers through its department of health and welfare.idaho plan includes habilitation services care for individuals who,but for the provision of such services would require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under the state plan,c and c.providers of these services are reimbursed by the department of health and welfare.
section a of the medicaid act requires idaho plan to 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area a a.
respondents are providers of habilitation services to persons covered by idaho medicaid plan.they sued petitioners two officials in idaho department of health and welfare in the united states district court for the district of idaho,claiming that idaho violates a by reimbursing providers of habilitation services at rates lower than a permits.they asked the court to enjoin petitioners to increase these rates.
the district court entered summary judgment for the providers,holding that idaho had not set rates in a manner consistent with a.inclusion,armstrong,supp.the ninth circuit affirmed.fed.appx.it said that the providers had an implied right of action under the supremacy clause to seek injunctive relief against the enforcement or implementation of state legislation.at citing independent living center of southern cal.shewry.we granted certiorari.
the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl,reads 
this constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made,or which shall be made,under the authority of the united states,shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
it is apparent that this clause creates a rule of decision courts shall regard the constitution,and all laws made in pursuance thereof,as the supreme law of the land.they must not give effect to state laws that conflict with federal laws.gibbons ogden,wheat.it is equally apparent that the supremacy clause is not the source of any federal rights,golden state transit los angeles,quoting chapman houston welfare rights organization,and certainly does not create a cause of action.it instructs courts what to do when state and federal law clash,but is silent regarding who may enforce federal laws in court,and in what circumstances they may do so.
hamilton wrote that the supremacy clause only declares a truth,which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal government.the federalist,cooke ed.and story described the clause as a positive affirmance of that,which is necessarily implied.commentaries on the constitution of the united states.these descriptions would have been grossly inapt if the clause were understood to give affected parties a constitutional and hence congressionally unalterable right to enforce federal laws against the states.and had it been understood to provide such significant private rights against the states,one would expect to find that mentioned in the preratification historical record,which contained ample discussion of the supremacy clause by both supporters and opponents of ratification.see drahozal,the supremacy clause a reference guide to the united states constitution the federalist,at madison.we are aware of no such mention,and respondents have not provided any.its conspicuous absence militates strongly against their position.
additionally,it is important to read the supremacy clause in the context of the constitution as a whole.article i vests congress with broad discretion over the manner of implementing its enumerated powers,giving it authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying them into execution.art.i.we have said that this confers upon the legislature that discretion,with respect to the means by which the powers the constitution confers are to be carried into execution,which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it,mcculloch maryland,wheat.it is unlikely that the constitution gave congress such broad discretion with regard to the enactment of laws,while simultaneously limiting congress power over the manner of their implementation,making it impossible to leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors.if the supremacy clause includes a private right of action,then the constitution requires congress to permit the enforcement of its laws by private actors,significantly curtailing its ability to guide the implementation of law.it would be strange indeed to give a clause that makes federal law supreme a reading that limits congress power to enforce that law,by imposing mandatory private enforcement a limitation with regard to state legislatures.
to say that the supremacy clause does not confer a right of action is not to diminish the significant role that courts play in assuring the supremacy of federal law.for once a case or controversy properly comes before a court,judges are bound by federal law.thus,a court may not convict a criminal defendant of violating a state law that federal law prohibits.see,pennsylvania nelson.similarly,a court may not hold a civil defendant liable under state law for conduct federal law requires.see,mutual pharmaceutical bartlett,slip,at.and,as we have long recognized,if an individual claims federal law immunizes him from state regulation,the court may issue an injunction upon finding the state regulatory actions preempted.ex parte young.
respondents contend that our preemption jurisprudence specifically,the fact that we have regularly considered whether to enjoin the enforcement of state laws that are alleged to violate federal law demonstrates that the supremacy clause creates a cause of action for its violation.they are incorrect.it is true enough that we have long held that federal courts may in some circumstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who are violating,or planning to violate,federal law.see,osborn bank of united states,wheat,ex parte young,supra,at citing davis gray,wall.but that has been true not only with respect to violations of federal law by state officials,but also with respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.see american school of magnetic healing mcannulty,see generally jaffe,judicial control of administrative action.thus,the supremacy clause need not be and in light of our textual analysis above,can not be the explanation.what our cases demonstrate is that,in a proper case,relief may be given in a court of equity to prevent an injurious act by a public officer.carroll safford,how.
the ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity,and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action,tracing back to england.see jaffe henderson,judicial review and the rule of law historical origins.it is a remedy,and we have never held or even suggested that,in its application to state officers,it rests upon an implied right of action contained in the supremacy clause.that is because,as even the dissent implicitly acknowledges,post,at opinion of sotomayor,it does not.the ninth circuit erred in holding otherwise.
we turn next to respondents contention that,quite apart from any cause of action conferred by the supremacy clause,this suit can proceed against idaho in equity.
the power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to express and implied statutory limitations.see,seminole tribe of.courts of equity can no more disregard statutory and constitutional requirements and provisions than can courts of law.ins pangilinan,quoting hedges dixon county,brackets omitted.in our view the medicaid act implicitly precludes private enforcement of a,and respondents can not,by invoking our equitable powers,circumvent congress exclusion of private enforcement.see douglas independent living center of southern,roberts,dissenting slip,at.
two aspects of a establish congress intent to foreclose equitable relief.verizon.public serv.comm of.first,the sole remedy congress provided for a state failure to comply with medicaid requirements for the state breach of the spending clause contract is the withholding of medicaid funds by the secretary of health and human services.as we have elsewhere explained,the express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.alexander sandoval.
the provision for the secretary enforcement by withholding funds might not,by itself,preclude the availability of equitable relief.see virginia office for protection and advocacy stewart,slip,at.but it does so when combined with the judicially unadministrable nature of a text.it is difficult to imagine a requirement broader and less specific than a mandate that state plans provide for payments that are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,all the while safeguard ing against unnecessary utilization of care and services.explicitly conferring enforcement of this standard upon the secretary alone establishes,we think,that congress wanted to make the agency remedy that it provided exclusive,thereby achieving the expertise,uniformity,widespread consultation,and resulting administrative guidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking,and avoiding the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and misincentives that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate application of the statute in a private action.gonzaga doe,breyer,concurring in judgment.the sheer complexity associated with enforcing a,coupled with the express provision of an administrative remedy,shows that the medicaid act precludes private enforcement of a in the courts.
the dissent agrees with us that the supremacy clause does not provide an implied right of action,and that congress may displace the equitable relief that is traditionally available to enforce federal law.it disagrees only with our conclusion that such displacement has occurred here.
the dissent insists that,because congress is undoubtedly aware of the federal courts practice of enjoining preempted state action,it should generally be presumed to contemplate such enforcement unless it affirmatively manifests a contrary intent.post,at emphasis added.but a practice does not justify a rule that denies statutory text its fairest reading.section a,fairly read in the context of the medicaid act,display s a n intent to foreclose the availability of equitable relief.verizon,supra,at.we have no warrant to revise congress scheme simply because it did not affirmatively preclude the availability of a action at equity.see seminole tribe,supra,at inferring,in the absence of an affirmative statement by congress,that equitable relief was unavailable.
equally unavailing is the dissent reliance on a history.section a was amended,on december,to include what the dissent calls the equal access mandate,post,at the requirement that reimbursement rates be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.a,stat.there existed at the time another provision,known as the boren amendment,that likewise imposed broad requirements on state medicaid plans.a a,supp.v.lower courts had interpreted the boren amendment to be privately enforceable under.from this,the dissent infers that,when congress amended a,it could not have failed to anticipate that a broad language or at least that of the equal access mandate would be interpreted as enforceable in a private action.thus,concludes the dissent,congress failure to expressly preclude the private enforcement of a suggests it intended not to preclude private enforcement.post,at.
this argument appears to rely on the canon the rule that,when judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision,repetition of the same language in a new statute is presumed to incorporate that interpretation.bragdon abbott.but that canon has no application here.the language of the two provisions is nowhere near identical and even if it had been,the question whether the boren amendment permitted private actions was far from settled.when congress amended a in,this court had already granted certiorari to decide,but had not yet decided,whether the boren amendment could be enforced through a suit.see baliles virginia hospital,granting certiorari.our decision permitting a action did not issue until june,almost six months after the amendment to a.wilder virginia hospital.the existence of a granted petition for certiorari demonstrates quite clearly that the question whether the boren amendment could be enforced was unsettled at the time of a amendment so that if congress was aware of the parallel which is highly doubtful the course that awareness would have prompted if any would not have been legislative silence but rather express specification of the availability of private enforcement if that was what congress intended.
finally,the dissent speaks as though we leave these plaintiffs with no resort.that is not the case.their relief must be sought initially through the secretary rather than through the courts.the dissent complaint that the sanction available to the secretary the of funding is too massive to be a realistic source of relief seems to us mistaken.we doubt that the secretary notice to a state that its compensation scheme is inadequate will be ignored.
the last possible source of a cause of action for respondents is the medicaid act itself.they do not claim that,and rightly so.section a lacks the sort of language needed to imply a private right of action.sandoval,supra at.it is phrased as a directive to the federal agency charged with approving state medicaid plans,not as a conferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries of the state decision to participate in medicaid.the act says that the secretary shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection a,the subsection that includes a.b.we have held that such language reveals no congressional intent to create a private right of action.sandoval,supra at see also universities research,coutu.and again,the explicitly conferred means of enforcing compliance with a by the secretary withholding funding,suggests that other means of enforcement are precluded,sandoval,supra,at.
spending clause legislation like medicaid is much in the nature of a contract.pennhurst state school and hospital halderman.the notion that respondents have a right to sue derives,perhaps,from the fact that they are beneficiaries of the medicaid agreement,and that intended beneficiaries,in modern times at least,can sue to enforce the of private contracting parties.see lord,williston on contracts,ed.we doubt,to begin with,that providers are intended beneficiaries as opposed to mere incidental beneficiaries of the medicaid agreement,which was concluded for the benefit of the infirm whom the providers were to serve,rather than for the benefit of the providers themselves.see pharmaceutical research and mfrs.of america walsh,thomas,concurring in judgment.more fundamentally,however,the modern jurisprudence permitting intended beneficiaries to sue does not generally apply to contracts between a private party and the government,astra usa,santa clara county,slip,at see williston,supra,at,at murray,corbin on contracts,ed.much less to contracts between two governments.our precedents establish that a private right of action under federal law is not created by mere implication,but must be unambiguously conferred,gonzaga,at.nothing in the medicaid act suggests that congress meant to change that for the commitments made under a.
the judgment of the ninth circuit court of appeals is reversed.
it is so ordered.
opinion of breyer,
richard armstrong,et,petitioners exceptional child center,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i join parts i,ii,and iii of the court opinion.
like all other members of the court,i would not characterize the question before us in terms of a supremacy clause cause of action.rather,i would ask whether federal courts may in these circumstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who are violating,or planning to violate,federal law.ante,at post,at sotomayor,dissenting.i believe the answer to this question is no.
that answer does not follow from the application of a simple,fixed legal formula separating federal statutes that may underlie this kind of injunctive action from those that may not.t he statute books are too many,the laws too diverse,and their purposes too complex,for any single legal formula to offer courts more than general guidance.gonzaga doe,breyer,concurring in judgment.rather,i believe that several characteristics of the federal statute before us,when taken together,make clear that congress intended to foreclose respondents from bringing this particular action for injunctive relief.
for one thing,as the majority points out,a of the medicaid act,a a,sets forth a federal mandate that is broad and nonspecific.see ante,at.but,more than that,a applies its broad standards to the setting of rates.the history of ratemaking demonstrates that administrative agencies are far better suited to this task than judges.more than a century ago,congress created the interstate commerce commission,the first great federal regulatory agency,and endowed it with authority to set reasonable railroad rates.ch,stat.it did so in part because judicial efforts to maintain reasonable rate levels had proved inadequate.see sharfman,railway regulation an analysis of the underlying problems in railway economics from the standpoint of government regulation.
reading a underscores the complexity and nonjudicial nature of the task.that provision requires state medicaid plans to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers to assure care and services equivalent to that available to the general population in the geographic area.a a.the methods that a state agency,such as idaho department of health and welfare,uses to make this kind of determination may involve subsidiary determinations of,for example,the actual cost of providing quality services,including personnel and total operating expenses changes in public expectations with respect to delivery of services inflation a comparison of rates paid in neighboring states for comparable services and a comparison of any rates paid for comparable services in other public or private capacities.see app.to reply to brief in opposition idaho code ann.
at the same time,a applies broadly,covering reimbursements provided to approximately million doctors,serving over million patients across the nation.see of health and human,office of inspector general,access to care provider availability in medicaid managed care.and states engage in efforts to obtain public input on proposed plan amendments.see,kansas medicaid design and implementation of a public input and stakeholder consult process,prepared by deloitte consulting,llp describing public input on kansas proposed medicaid amendments.
i recognize that federal courts have long become accustomed to reviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality the determinations made by agencies.see fpc hope natural gas.but this is not such an action.instead,the lower courts here,relying on the standard articulated in orthopaedic hospital belshe,required the state to set rates that approximate the cost of quality care provided efficiently and economically.at.see inclusion,armstrong,supp,idaho,aff,fed.appx.to find in the law a basis for courts to engage in such direct could set a precedent for allowing other similar actions,potentially resulting in rates set by federal judges of whom there are several hundred outside the ordinary channel of federal judicial review of agency decisionmaking.the consequence,i fear,would be increased litigation,inconsistent results,and disorderly administration of highly complex federal programs that demand public consultation,administrative guidance and coherence for their success.i do not believe congress intended to allow a injunctive action that poses such risks and that has the other features i mention.
i recognize that courts might in particular instances be able to resolve requests for injunctive relief quite easily.but i see no easy way to separate in advance the potentially simple sheep from the more harmful goats.in any event,this case,i fear,belongs in the latter category.see belshe,supra,at.compare brief for respondents,claiming that respondents seek only to enforce federally approved methodology,with brief for united states as amicus curiae,the relevant methodology has not been approved.see also idaho code ann.describing in general terms what appears to be a complex methodology,while leaving unclear the extent to which idaho is bound to use,rather than merely consider,actual provider costs.
for another thing,like the majority,i would ask why,in the complex area,other forms of relief are inadequate.if the secretary of health and human services concludes that a state is failing to follow legally required federal rules,the secretary can withhold federal funds.see ante,at citing.if withholding funds does not work,the federal agency may be able to sue a state to compel compliance with federal rules.see tr.of oral arg,solicitor general and respondents acknowledging that the federal government might be able to sue a state to enjoin it from paying less than what a requires,arizona united states,allowing similar action in another context.
moreover,why could respondents not ask the federal agency to interpret its rules to respondents satisfaction,to modify those rules,to promulgate new rules or to enforce old ones see e.normally,when such requests are denied,an injured party can seek judicial review of the agency refusal on the grounds that it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.and an injured party can ask the court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.see also tr.of oral arg.arguing that providers can bring an action under the administrative procedure act apa whenever a waiver program is renewed or can seek new agency rulemaking japan whaling american cetacean,apa challenge to the secretary of commerce failure to act.
i recognize that the law may give the federal agency broad discretionary authority to decide when and how to exercise or to enforce statutes and rules.see massachusetts epa.as a result,it may be difficult for respondents to prevail on an apa claim unless it stems from an agency particularly egregious failure to act.but,if that is so,it is because congress decided to vest broad discretion in the agency to interpret and to enforce a.i see no reason for this court to circumvent that congressional determination by allowing this action to proceed.

justice sotomayor,with whom justice kennedy,justice ginsburg,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
suits in federal court to restrain state officials from executing laws that assertedly conflict with the constitution or with a federal statue are not novel.to the contrary,this court has adjudicated such requests for equitable relief since the early days of the republic.nevertheless,today the court holds that congress has foreclosed private parties from invoking the equitable powers of the federal courts to require states to comply with a of the medicaid act,a a.it does so without pointing to the sort of detailed remedial scheme we have previously deemed necessary to establish congressional intent to preclude resort to equity.instead,the court relies on congress provision for agency enforcement of a an enforcement mechanism of the sort we have already definitively determined not to foreclose private actions and on the mere fact that a contains relatively broad language.as i can not agree that these statutory provisions demonstrate the requisite congressional intent to restrict the equitable authority of the federal courts,i respectfully dissent.
that parties may call upon the federal courts to enjoin unconstitutional government action is not subject to serious dispute.perhaps the most famous exposition of this principle is our decision in ex parte young,from which the doctrine derives its usual name.there,we held that the shareholders of a railroad could seek an injunction preventing the minnesota attorney general from enforcing a state law setting maximum railroad rates because the eleventh amendment did not provide the officials with immunity from such an action and the federal court had the power in equity to grant a temporary injunction.at.this court had earlier recognized similar equitable authority in osborn bank of united states,wheat,in which a federal court issued an injunction prohibiting an ohio official from executing a state law taxing the bank of the united states,at.we affirmed in relevant part,concluding that the case was cognizable in a court of equity,and holding it to be proper to grant equitable relief insofar as the state tax was repugnant to the federal law creating the national bank,at.more recently,we confirmed the vitality of this doctrine in free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight.there,we found no support for the argument that a challenge to governmental action under the appointments clause or principles should be treated differently than every other constitutional claim for which equitable relief has long been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally.at.
a suit,like this one,that seeks relief against state officials acting pursuant to a state law allegedly preempted by a federal statute falls comfortably within this doctrine.a claim that a state law contravenes a federal statute is basically constitutional in nature,deriving its force from the operation of the supremacy clause,douglas seacoast products,and the application of preempted state law is therefore unconstitutional,crosby national foreign trade council,accord,mcculloch maryland,wheat,that states have no power to enact laws interfering with the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by congress is the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the constitution has declared such a state law is unconstitutional and void we have thus long entertained suits in which a party seeks prospective equitable protection from an injurious and preempted state law without regard to whether the federal statute at issue itself provided a right to bring an action.see,foster love,state election law that permitted the winner of a state primary to be deemed the winner of election to congress held preempted by federal statute setting date of congressional elections shaw delta air lines,state law preempted in part by the federal employee retirement income security act of railroad transfer service,chicago,city ordinance imposing licensing requirements on motor carrier transporting railroad passengers held preempted by federal interstate commerce act campbell hussey,state law requiring labeling of certain strains of tobacco held preempted by the federal tobacc
