in broad strokes,this case concerns a tort involving a vessel on navigable waters.more specifically,the case involves a diving accident off a recreational vessel anchored in shallow but navigable lake waters.before the,it would have been beyond doubt that such facts would place this case squarely in the jurisdiction of the federal courts,because the traditional test for admiralty tort jurisdiction simply asked whether the tort occurred on navigable waters.
but in,the supreme court began refining the situs rule,or locality test,for admiralty tort jurisdiction to weed out absurd cases that had little to do with maritime commerce,such as planes crashing into lakes or swimmers colliding into each other.in three subsequent cases,the court further developed this test,creating a multi part inquiry designed to address cases at the margin of admiralty jurisdiction.in addition to location,the prevailing test now focuses on whether the incident giving rise to the tort,defined at an intermediate level of possible generality,has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,and whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident bears a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.tandon captain cove marina of bridgeport,cir.
applying this test,the united states district court for the northern district of new york sannes,held that admiralty jurisdiction was lacking here.the district court reasoned that a recreational injury occurring on a recreational vessel anchored in a shallow recreational bay of navigable waters could not disrupt maritime commerce and did not bear a sufficient relationship to traditional maritime activity.although we believe the district court correctly articulated the supreme court modern test for admiralty tort jurisdiction,we respectfully disagree with its conclusion that jurisdiction is lacking here.indeed,the supreme court has instructed us that,ordinarily,every tort involving a vessel on navigable waters falls within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

factual background 
the district court found that,on july,petitioner appellant bruce germain,claimant appellee matthew ficarra,and three others left brewerton,new york,on the shore of lake oneida,for an excursion on germain foot motor boat,game day.see ficarra germain,supp.lake oneida is connected to and part of the new york state erie canal system.id.using a federal shipping lane,the five headed to the shallow three mile bay,a popular spot for recreational swimming on lake oneida that is less than a nautical mile from the federal shipping lane.id.when germain,ficarra,and the three other guests anchored at around,the bay was already crowded with other boats.id.
around,germain began preparing for the return trip to brewerton,and ficarra and the other passengers began returning to the boat.id.at some point while germain and the other passengers were preparing the vessel for the return trip,ficarra dived off the port side into the water.id.ficarra climbed back on board and entered the water again,this time doing a back flip from the back of the boat that resulted in his striking his head on the lake floor.id.at.germain and others then jumped into the water to assist ficarra.id.local rescue and police boats later arrived at the scene,and they took ficarra back across lake oneida to brewerton via the federal shipping lane id.at.doctors later determined that ficarra suffered a serious spinal cord injury causing paralysis and quadriplegia.id.
procedural history 
on june,ficarra filed suit against germain in new york state supreme court,asserting claims for negligence under new york law.ficarra complaint alleges,among other things,that germain was negligent for failing to operate,captain,anchor,maintain,or control his vessel in a safe and reasonably prudent manner to protect the safety and welfare of his boat passengers to properly and adequately instruct his passengers on safe boating and diving practices to properly and adequately inspect the area in which his boat was anchored and to adequately warn his passengers of the dangerous conditions existing at the time of the aforementioned incident.
on july,germain removed ficarra negligence suit to the united states district court for the northern district of new york.on august,ficarra moved to remand the action back to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the claims alleged in his complaint were not within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.
on august,germain filed a petition in the united states district court for the northern district of new york seeking exoneration from or limitation of liability under the limitation of liability act of,and rule f of the supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions rule f on august,the district court kahn,issued an order in the limitation proceeding directing germain to submit a brief explaining why his petition should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.app.as ordered,germain filed a brief,affidavit,and related exhibits in support of his limitation petition,and he also filed these same papers in opposition to ficarra motion to remand in the separate negligence action.
both the negligence action and limitation proceeding were then transferred to a different judge on december.in a single memorandum decision and order,the district court sannes,concluded that ficarra claims did not meet the modern test for admiralty tort jurisdiction.see ficarra,supp.at and because the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear either action,it remanded the negligence suit and dismissed the limitation petition.id.at.
germain filed notices of appeal in both actions,but he voluntarily withdrew the notice of appeal in the remanded negligence suit,recognizing that,under d,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,unless the case was removed pursuant to or.accordingly,the only appeal presently before us is the district court dismissal of germain limitation petition.
discussion 
the key issue on appeal is whether federal courts have admiralty jurisdiction over claims for injury to a passenger who jumped from a vessel on open navigable waters.they do.but before we reach this question,we must first address ficarra primary argument that the present appeal is an improper attack on the district court remand order.it is not.
ficarra primary argument in opposition to germain appeal is that germain appeal of the limitation petition dismissal is an improper attack on the district court remand order,which germain did not indeed,could not appeal.in short,and as discussed in greater detail below,because admiralty cases involving petitions for limitation of liability may proceed on dual tracks in state and federal court,germain is entitled to appeal the dismissal of his limitation petition.
the constitution provides that t he judicial power shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.const.art.iii.congress codified this constitutional grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in,which provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.the interaction between the exclusivity clause and the saving to suitors clause of has caused much confusion.see,lewis lewis clark marine,what the drafters of the judiciary act intended in creating the saving to suitors clause is not entirely clear and has been the subject of some debate.
adding to the confusion is a separate statute,the limitation of liability act of,which congress enacted to encourage ship building and to induce capitalists to invest money in this branch of industry.tandon,at quoting lewis,at.as we explained in tandon,u nder the present version of this statute,the liability of the owner of a vessel for any claim,debt,or liability covered by the act shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight.id.at quoting a.
more specifically,the limitation of liability act creates a form of action peculiar to the admiralty and maritime context,allowing the owner of a vessel to file a petition in federal court seeking total exoneration from or limitation of liability for damages caused by the negligence of his captain or crew.id.at see also a rule typically,o nce the owner files a petition for limitation,all other claims and proceedings against the owner related to the matter in question shall cease.tandon,at quoting c.notice is then sent to all persons asserting claims affected by the limitation proceeding,who may file claims and challenge the petitioner right to limitation or exoneration.see id.if the petition for limitation of liability is granted,the owner can be liable on the covered claims only up to the total value of his vessel and its pending freight that amount will then be distributed pro rata among the proven claims.id.
as this brief discussion reveals,s ome tension exists between the saving to suitors clause and the limitation act.one statute gives suitors the right to a choice of remedies,and the other statute gives vessel owners the right to seek limitation of liability in federal court.lewis,at.to resolve this tension,the courts of appeals have generally permitted claimants to proceed with their claims in state court where there is only a single claimant or where the total claims do not exceed the value of the limitation fund.id.at.in lewis,the supreme court endorsed this practice,and it further clarified that 
t he district courts have jurisdiction over actions arising under the limitation act,and they have discretion to stay or dismiss limitation act proceedings to allow a suitor to pursue his claims in state court.if the district court concludes that the vessel owner right to limitation will not be adequately protected where for example a group of claimants can not agree on appropriate stipulations or there is uncertainty concerning the adequacy of the fund or the number of claims the court may proceed to adjudicate the merits,deciding the issues of liability and limitation.but where the district court satisfies itself that a vessel owner right to seek limitation will be protected,the decision to dissolve the injunction staying the state court proceeding is well within the court discretion.
id.at citations omitted.in sum,the court case law makes clear that state courts,with all of their remedies,may adjudicate claims against vessel owners so long as the vessel owner right to seek limitation of liability is protected.id.at see also benedict on admiralty ed.thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed.charles wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.
because cases that involve limitation petitions may proceed on dual tracks in state and federal court,there is nothing impermissible about germain present appeal.the district court concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was lacking for either proceeding,a conclusion that necessitated remanding ficarra negligence suit and dismissing germain limitation petition.but since the district court may still be able to adjudicate his limitation petition if admiralty jurisdiction is present,germain appeal of the limitation petition dismissal is proper,even if that appeal presses the existence of subject matter jurisdiction,contrary to the premise of the district court remand order that jurisdiction was absent.
having addressed the propriety of the present appeal,we must now decide whether the appeal has any merit.as a threshold matter,a lthough the limitation of liability act provides a federal cause of action for a vessel owner seeking exoneration or limitation,it does not provide an independent foundation for federal admiralty jurisdiction.tandon,at quoting mlc fishing,velez,cir.per curiam.in other words,
that a vessel owner may file a petition for limitation does not mean the district court necessarily has jurisdiction to hear it.instead,the district court will only have admiralty jurisdiction to hear a petition for limitation if it already has admiralty jurisdiction over the underlying claims that the petition seeks to limit.
id.as in tandon,our present task is therefore limited to determining whether the underlying claims raise a civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction that the district court could hear under.id.
in answering this question,we first discuss the history of the modern test for admiralty tort jurisdiction,placing that test in the context of the problem it was designed to address.we then apply that test to the facts of this case,bearing in mind this jurisprudential history.although we disagree with the district court application of the modern test,the test is far from a model of clarity and it is more than understandable how the district court,in its thoughtful opinion,could have gone off course.
traditionally,admiralty jurisdiction over tort actions was determined largely by the application of a locality test.sisson ruby.that is,t he traditional test for admiralty tort jurisdiction asked only whether the tort occurred on navigable waters.if it did,admiralty jurisdiction followed if it did not,admiralty jurisdiction did not exist.grubart,at see also the plymouth,every species of tort,however occurring,and whether on board a vessel or not,if upon the high seas or navigable waters,is of admiralty cognizance.
in,however,congress expanded this narrow rule when it enacted the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act,which provides that 
t he admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the united states extends to and includes cases of injury or damage,to person or property,caused by a vessel on navigable waters,even though the injury or damage is done or consummated on land.
a.as the supreme court explained,t he purpose of the act was to end concern over the sometimes confusing line between land and water,by investing admiralty with jurisdiction over all cases where the injury was caused by a ship or other vessel on navigable water,even if such injury occurred on land.grubart,at.
after this congressional modification to gather the odd case into admiralty,a series of four supreme court cases tinkered with the traditional locality test to keep a different class of odd cases out.id.emphasis added.in the first case,executive jet aviation,city of cleveland,a plane crashed into lake erie after its jet engines inhaled a flock of seagulls shortly after takeoff from burke lakefront airport in cleveland,ohio.because the plane crashed into navigable waters,admiralty jurisdiction arguably existed under the locality test but the court observed that a purely mechanical application of the locality test was not always sensible or consonant with the purposes of maritime law,as when for example the literal and universal application of the locality rule would require admiralty courts to adjudicate tort disputes between colliding swimmers.grubart,at citation omitted quoting exec.jet,at.
in light of this concern,the court decided to pull back on the locality test,at least in the aviation context.the court noted that,u nlike waterborne vessels,aircraft are not restrained by one dimensional geographic and physical boundaries.for this elementary reason,the court conclude d that the mere fact that the alleged wrong occurs or is located on or over navigable waters whatever that means in an aviation context is not of itself sufficient to turn an airplane negligence case into a maritime tort.exec.jet,at.rather,the executive jet court believed i t was far more consistent with the history and purpose of admiralty to require also that the wrong bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.id.it therefore held that unless such a relationship exists,claims arising from airplane accidents are not cognizable in admiralty in the absence of legislation to the contrary.id.in so holding,the court adopted,at least in the aviation context,the position of several lower courts that a maritime locality is not sufficient to bring the tort within federal admiralty jurisdiction,but that there must also be a maritime nexus some relationship between the tort and traditional maritime activities,involving navigation or commerce on navigable waters.id.at.
although the court clearly limited executive jet holding to the aviation context,that did not stop lower courts from extending its reasoning particularly the maritime nexus requirement to other circumstances,an extension the court expressly endorsed in foremost insurance richardson.in that case,two pleasure boats collided on the amite river in louisiana.id.at.although the court conceded that pleasure boats themselves had little to do with the maritime commerce lying at the heart of the admiralty court basic work,it nonetheless found the necessary relationship,maritime nexus,in t he potential disruptive impact upon maritime commerce of a collision between boats on navigable waters,when coupled with the traditional concern that admiralty law holds for navigation.grubart,at alterations in original quoting foremost,at.the court elaborated that if these two boats collided at the mouth of the lawrence seaway,there would be a substantial effect on maritime commerce,without regard to whether either boat was actively,or had been previously,engaged in commercial activity.foremost,at 
the court thus held that executive jet maritime nexus requirement could be satisfied if the incident in question has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,which would be the case for the recreational vessel collision in foremost.see grubart,at explaining foremost.this conclusion was based at least in part on the court view that,a lthough the primary focus of admiralty jurisdiction is unquestionably the protection of maritime commerce,t he federal interest in protecting maritime commerce can be fully vindicated only if all operators of vessels on navigable waters are subject to uniform rules of conduct.foremost,at.in a footnote,however,the court remarked that n ot every accident in navigable waters that might disrupt maritime commerce will support federal admiralty jurisdiction.id.at.rather,it is only when this kind of potential hazard to maritime commerce arises out of activity that bears a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity,as did the navigation of the boats in foremost,that admiralty jurisdiction is appropriate.id.
eight years later,this footnote would morph into the modern multi part test for admiralty tort jurisdiction.in sisson ruby,the court was called upon to decide whether admiralty jurisdiction extends to tort claims arising after a defective caught fire on a pleasure boat docked at a marina,with the resulting fire burning the pleasure boat,other boats docked nearby,and the marina itself.at.in concluding that admiralty jurisdiction covered the claims related to this fire,the court separated foremost footnote discussing the maritime nexus requirement into two components.see grubart,at.under the sisson test,after determining that the location test is satisfied,courts must first determine the potential impact of a given type of incident by examining its general character and whether this type of incident is likely to disrupt maritime commercial activity.sisson,at.second,the party seeking to invoke maritime jurisdiction must show a substantial relationship between the activity giving rise to the incident and traditional maritime activity.id.at.
the court explained that the first part of the connection inquiry does not turn on the actual effects on maritime commerce of a particular incident r ather,a court must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether such an incident is likely to disrupt commercial activity.id.at.for example,the court described the general features of the incident in sisson as a fire on a vessel docked at a marina on navigable waters,in executive jet as an aircraft sinking in the water,and in foremost as a collision between boats on navigable waters.sisson,at.
the court further explained that,under the second part of the connection inquiry,the relevant activity is defined not by the particular circumstances of the incident,but by the general conduct from which the incident arose.id.at.for example,in sisson,the relevant activity was the storage and maintenance of a vessel at a marina on navigable waters,in executive jet,the relevant activity was not a plane sinking in lake erie,but air travel generally,and in foremost,the relevant activity was navigation of vessels generally.sisson,at.under this second prong,the sisson court reiterated foremost lesson that t he fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction is the protection of maritime commerce and that interest can not be fully vindicated unless all operators of vessels on navigable waters are subject to uniform rules of conduct.id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.moreover,t he need for uniform rules of maritime conduct and liability is not limited to navigation,but extends at least to any other activities traditionally undertaken by vessels,commercial or noncommercial.id.the sisson court conclude d that,just as navigation,storing and maintaining a vessel at a marina on a navigable waterway is substantially related to traditional maritime activity.id.
finally,in jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,the court considered whether admiralty jurisdiction extended to claims related to flooding in the downtown chicago loop after operators of a crane sitting on a barge in the chicago river drove piles into the riverbed above an underwater tunnel,allegedly weakening the tunnel and causing the flooding.at.before upholding admiralty jurisdiction on such facts,the court affirmed and further developed the sisson test,explaining that,under sisson,a party seeking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction over a tort claim must satisfy conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity.id.at.first,a court applying the location test must determine whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.id second,in applying the connection test,the court examines two issues the court must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce and the court must determine whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.
the grubart court further explained that the first connection prong turns on a description of the incident at an intermediate level of possible generality,id.at,focusing on the general features of the incident,id.at.the court elaborated that,a lthough there is inevitably some play in the joints in selecting the right level of generality when applying the sisson test,the inevitable imprecision is not an excuse for whimsy.id.at in grubart,the court concluded,the general features of the incident at issue here may be described as damage by a vessel in navigable water to an underwater structure.id.at.
in contrast,the second connection prong turns on whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity,and courts should ask whether a tortfeasor activity,commercial or noncommercial,on navigable waters is so closely related to activity traditionally subject to admiralty law that the reasons for applying special admiralty rules would apply in the suit at hand.id.at.navigation of boats in navigable waters clearly falls within the substantial relationship,foremost storing them at a marina on navigable waters is close enough,sisson whereas in flying an airplane over the water,executive jet,as in swimming,the relationship is too attenuated.id.at citations omitted.in grubart,the activity giving rise to the incident was characterized as repair or maintenance work on a navigable waterway performed from a vessel,which,the court concluded,also fell within the substantial relationship.id.quoting sisson,at.
in affirming the complicated sisson test,however,the grubart court also cautioned that sisson should be viewed as a test to weed out torts without a maritime connection,not an arbitrary exercise for eliminating jurisdiction over even vessel related torts connected to traditional maritime commerce.id.at.in other words,a lthough the modern test tempers the locality test with the added requirements looking to potential harm and traditional activity,it reflects customary practice in seeing jurisdiction as the norm when the tort originates with a vessel in navigable waters,and in treating departure from the locality principle as the exception.id.at.
to drive this point home,the court devoted considerable attention to the criticism that i f the activity at issue in grubart was considered maritime related,then virtually every activity involving a vessel on navigable waters would be a traditional maritime activity sufficient to invoke maritime jurisdiction.id.at quoting grubart br.the court responded bluntly that this is not fatal criticism,because the court ha d not proposed any radical alteration of the traditional criteria for invoking admiralty jurisdiction in tort cases.id.rather,the court explained that it ha d simply followed the lead of the lower federal courts in rejecting a location rule so rigid as to extend admiralty to a case involving an airplane,not a vessel,engaged in an activity far removed from anything traditionally maritime.id.it further remarked 
in the cases after executive jet,the court stressed the need for a maritime connection,but found one in the navigation or berthing of pleasure boats,despite the fact that the pleasure boat activity took place near shore,where states have a strong interest in applying their own tort law,or was not on all fours with the maritime shipping and commerce that has traditionally made up the business of most maritime courts.although we agree with petitioners that these cases do not say that every tort involving a vessel on navigable waters falls within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction no matter what,they do show that ordinarily that will be so.
id.at emphasis added citations omitted.
we recently applied the executive jet line of cases in tandon,which involved a brawl on a marina dock,with some of the brawlers falling into the surrounding navigable waters the type of perverse and casuistic borderline situation that could have satisfied the locality test and that the modern test was designed to exclude.tandon,at quoting exec.jet,at.applying the grubart test,we held that admiralty jurisdiction did not reach the claims relating to this brawl because this type of incident does not have a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce.id.at.
after summarizing the executive jet line of cases,we restated the grubart test as follows 
first,we ask whether the alleged tort meets the location test that is,whether it occurred on navigable water or was caused by a vessel on navigable water.second,we ask whether the alleged tort meets both subparts of the connection test that is,whether the general type of incident involved has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,and whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident bears a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.only if the location test and both subparts of the connection test are met will admiralty tort jurisdiction be proper under.
id.at citation omitted.later in that opinion,we explained that t he first part of the connection test looks to the nature of the incident that immediately caused the underlying injury the second part,by contrast,looks to the nature of the broader activity giving rise to that incident.id.at.
applying the first part of the connection test,we noted that t he overall purpose of the exercise is to determine whether the incident could be seen within a class of incidents that pose more than a fanciful risk to commercial shipping.id.at quoting grubart,at.we conclude d that the incident at issue in that case was best described as a physical altercation among recreational visitors on and around a permanent dock surrounded by navigable water.id.
after so defining the incident,w e conclude d that this type of incident does not realistically pose a threat to maritime commerce,for four reasons a fistfight on and around a dock can not immediately disrupt navigation a fistfight on a dock can not immediately damage nearby commercial vessels the class of incidents we consider ed t here include d only fights on permanent docks that d id not pose the same risks to maritime commerce as a fistfight occurring on a vessel on navigable water and the class of incidents we consider ed t here involve d only physical altercations among recreational visitors,not persons engaged in maritime employment.id.at.because we concluded that the incident failed to satisfy the first part of the grubart connection inquiry,we ended our analysis there.id.at.
responding to the argument that the struggling bodies could themselves pose a navigational hazard,id.at,we noted that,a t worst,an incident of this sort might temporarily prevent commercial vessels from mooring at the permanent dock around which the fight occurred.but the potential impact of such a temporary disruption is simply too meager to support jurisdiction,id.at citation omitted.and in response to the argument that a fight on a dock surrounded by navigable water may require emergency responders to come to the dock by boat and leave by boat,potentially snarling naval traffic in nearby waters,w e recognize d that other courts have found the potentially disruptive impact of a maritime emergency response enough to satisfy the first part of the connection test in some cases,but t hose cases generally dealt with incidents occurring either aboard a vessel or else in open water.id.we further acknowledged that w here such an incident takes place on a vessel or in open water far from the shore,the potential danger to commercial shipping posed by a maritime emergency response may be more significant.id.
the alleged tort here involves a vessel on navigable waters factors the supreme court has reminded us will ordinarily place a case within the bounds of admiralty jurisdiction.see grubart,at.nonetheless,the district court applied the grubart test and concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was lacking,emphasizing the recreational nature of the vessel and its passengers as well as the location of the incident in shallow waters.we disagree that these factors remove the case from admiralty jurisdiction.
working through the grubart test,the district court began by noting that the parties agree the location test has been met since the alleged tort occurred on a navigable body of water,oneida lake.ficarra,supp.at.
turning to the first step of the connection test whether the general type of incident involved has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce the district court set forth a general description of the incident,which,as noted,must be described at an intermediate level of possible generality.grubart,at.the district court found that the incident is best described as an injury to a recreational passenger who jumped from a recreational vessel in a shallow recreational bay of navigable waters.ficarra,supp.at.
this description is hardly a fit of whimsy,grubart,at,but we explained in tandon that the description of the incident at an intermediate level of possible generality should be neither too general to distinguish different cases nor too specific to the unique facts of the particular case,at.an overly particularized description will invite future litigation over even the smallest change to the fact pattern,even if that change has little bearing on whether federal courts should or should not exercise admiralty jurisdiction.the description should therefore be general enough to capture the possible effects of similar incidents on maritime commerce.id.at.in this regard,we respectfully believe the district court description is unnecessarily specific.
first,the supreme court has consistently stated that it does not matter for purposes of admiralty tort jurisdiction whether the vessel involved was used for commercial or recreational purposes.see foremost,at see also yamaha motor,calhoun,holding admiralty jurisdiction extends to jet ski accident.this is so because the federal interest can be fully vindicated only if all operators of vessels on navigable waters are subject to uniform rules of conduct.foremost,at see also thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law at ed.thus,the current test extends admiralty jurisdiction to pleasure craft,but only if they are operating on a waterway with commercial navigability.the district court emphasis on the recreational nature of germain vessel is therefore misplaced.
second,the supreme court has never indicated that it matters whether the navigable waters at issue were shallow or deep.that the court has not discussed the depth of navigable waters is unsurprising because t he basic test of navigability for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction is the formula of the daniel ball,and that formula requires,among other things,proof of present or potential commercial shipping.schoenbaum,supra,at.as long as such commercial activity is proved,the particular mode of travel or type of craft flatboat,barge,power vessel,or other method is unimportant id.at.if navigability is satisfied,then,it should matter very little for purposes of the first connection prong whether the navigable waters were shallow or deep.
we noted in tandon that,in considering the type of incident involved,the location of the incident may be relevant,at,but there we focused on the distance from shore or,more accurately,the distance from the nearest dock or marina,rather than the depth of the waters.specifically,in assessing the potential effects on maritime commerce,we noted that a n emergency response to an incident on and around a floating dock is much less likely to ensnarl maritime traffic than an emergency response to an incident on a vessel or an incident in open water.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.the incident here,unlike the incident on and around a dock in tandon,occurred on a vessel and in open water.
third,the district court also relied on tandon observation that the roles of the persons involved can be relevant to the potential effect on maritime commerce.ficarra,supp.at quoting tandon,at.but,as noted,the focus under the first prong of the modern test is on capturing possible effects of similar incidents on maritime commerce.where similar incidents involving different types of persons produce similar effects that have a potentially disruptive effective on maritime commerce,the type of person involved should be omitted from the incident description.as discussed in greater detail below,the potential effects on maritime commerce of an injury to a passenger who jumped from a vessel on open navigable waters include collisions with commercial vessels caused by distracted crews and disruption to maritime traffic caused by maritime rescue.these potential effects may be the same whether the injured passenger was recreational or employed in maritime commerce,and they are also sufficient to satisfy the test.of course,the loss of a maritime employee may have an additional effect on maritime commerce.see tandon,at collecting cases.but,at least here,that additional effect does not change the outcome of the first connection prong,which would be satisfied regardless of the type of persons involved.
accordingly,we think a more appropriate description of the incident,described at an intermediate level of possible generality and general enough to capture the possible effects of similar incidents on maritime commerce,is injury to a passenger who jumped from a vessel on open navigable waters.this description accurately captures the nature of the event giving rise to this suit,and the type of risks that the incident could pose to maritime commerce.id.at.
l ook ing not to the particular facts of the case before us,whether maritime commerce was actually disrupted here but to whether similar occurrences are likely to be disruptive,we conclude that the incident satisfies the first connection prong.first,the district court concluded that the incident would not pose more than a fanciful threat to maritime commerce largely because the location of the incident was in shallow,recreational bays waters unsuitable for commercial shipping.therefore,even if the crew of the vessel was distracted by the passenger jumping overboard,there would be no risk of collision with commercial vessels.ficarra,supp.at to begin with,the district court appears to have assumed that commercial means large,but commercial vessels could include small or vessels used for commercial purposes,fishing boats or boats taking paying passengers to shallow,bays for snorkeling,diving.sinclair soniform,cir.holding that scuba diver claims against the crew of the vessel that transported him to a diving site fell within admiralty jurisdiction.
moreover,the supreme court has taken an expansive view of the possible commercial effects caused by collisions of even small recreational vessels on navigable waters,regardless of the precise location of those vessels in relation to commercial traffic.in foremost,for example,the court supported its finding of potential disruption with a description of the likely effects of a collision at the mouth of the lawrence seaway,an area heavily traveled by commercial vessels,even though the place where the collision actually had occurred apparently was seldom,if ever,used for commercial traffic.sisson,at citation omitted quoting foremost,at.we similarly conclude that the crew of a vessel,commercial or recreational,on open navigable waters could become distracted when a passenger is injured from jumping overboard and that the distraction could risk collision with a commercial vessel.see roane greenwich swim,supp,t hose on board a boat giving their full attention to the saving of the life of a swimmer in difficulty may well be distracted from hazards posed by the approach of other boats unaware of the rescue in progress,or coming at speed in an effort to assist.
second,the district court rejected germain argument that this type of incident may still potentially disrupt maritime commerce because an injured passenger in navigable waters invites rescue.ficarra,supp.at quotation marks omitted.although the district court recognized that some courts have accepted this argument,it found that those cases typically involve rescue at sea or far from shore where the potential risk of an emergency response to snarl commercial shipping traffic is more realistic.id.citing roane,supp.at szollosy hyatt,supp.
but the incident on open navigable waters here is more comparable to a rescue at sea than a rescue at or near a dock.one of the reasons we held in tandon that rescue of brawlers on or near a dock was unlikely to ensnarl maritime traffic was that e mergency responders may have to travel by boat to reach persons injured near a permanent dock,but they will never have to travel far.and once the emergency responders arrive at the scene,they can moor their vessel at the permanent dock,rather than having to focus simultaneously on navigating their vessel and rescuing the injured.at.in contrast,rescue of passengers injured on a vessel on open navigable waters will often come not from shore,dock,or docked vessels but from other vessels on those same navigable waters.here,for example,ficarra was allegedly rescued by boat and rushed five nautical miles across lake oneida back to brewerton through a federal shipping lane.such maritime rescues on open navigable waters could divert resources that would be called upon in the even
