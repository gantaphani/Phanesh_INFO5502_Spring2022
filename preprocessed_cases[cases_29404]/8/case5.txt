a the venue provision of the judiciary act of covered patent cases as well as other civil suits.stonite products melvin lloyd.in,congress enacted a patent specific venue statute.this new statute b predecessor permitted suit in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant or in which the defendant both maintained a regular and established place of business and committed an act of infringement.stat.a corporation at that time was understood to inhabit only the state of incorporation.this court addressed the scope of b predecessor in stonite,concluding that it constituted the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings and thus was not supplemented or modified by the general venue provisions,at.
in,congress recodified the patent venue statute as b.that provision,which remains unaltered today,uses resides instead of inhabit s.at the same time,congress also enacted the general venue statute,which defined residence for corporate defendants.in fourco,this court reaffirmed stonite holding,observing that congress enacted b as a standalone venue statute and that nothing in the recodification evidenced an intent to alter that status,even the fact that c by its terms embraced all actions,at.the court also concluded that resides in the recodified version bore the same meaning as inhabit s in the version.see,at.
this landscape remained effectively unchanged until,when congress amended the general venue statute,c.the revised provision stated that it applied f or purposes of venue under this chapter.in ve holding johnson gas appliance,the federal circuit held that,in light of this amendment,c established the definition for all other venue statutes under the same chapter,including b.in,congress adopted the current version of,which provides that its general definition applies f or all venue purposes.the federal circuit reaffirmed ve holding in the case below.
b in fourco,this court definitively and unambiguously held that the word reside nce in b,as applied to domestic corporations,refers only to the state of incorporation.because congress has not amended b since fourco,and neither party asks the court to reconsider that decision,the only question here is whether congress changed b meaning when it amended.when congress intends to effect a change of that kind,it ordinarily provides a relatively clear indication of its intent in the amended provision text.no such indication appears in the current version of.
respondent points out that the current c provides a default rule that,on its face,applies without exception f or all venue purposes.but the version at issue in fourco similarly provided a default rule that applied for venue purposes,at,and those phrasings are not materially different in this context.the addition of the word all to the already comprehensive provision does not suggest that congress intended the court to reconsider its decision in fourco.any argument based on this language is even weaker now than it was when the court rejected it in fourco.fourco held that b retained a meaning distinct from the default definition contained in c,even though the latter,by its terms,included no exceptions.the current version of includes a saving clause,which expressly states that the provision does not apply when otherwise provided by law,thus making explicit the qualification that the fourco court found implicit in the statute.finally,there is no indication that congress in ratified the federal circuit decision in ve holding.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the question presented in this case is where proper venue lies for a patent infringement lawsuit brought against a domestic corporation.the patent venue statute,b,provides that a ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides,or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.in fourco glass transmirra products,this court concluded that for purposes of b a domestic corporation resides only in its state of incorporation.
in reaching that conclusion,the court rejected the argument that b incorporates the broader definition of corporate residence contained in the general venue statute,c,at.congress has not amended b since this court construed it in fourco,but it has amended twice.section now provides that,e xcept as otherwise provided by law and f or all venue purposes,a corporation shall be deemed to reside,if a defendant,in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.a,c.the issue in this case is whether that definition supplants the definition announced in fourco and allows a plaintiff to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against a corporation in any district in which the corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction.we conclude that the amendments to did not modify the meaning of b as interpreted by fourco.we therefore hold that a domestic corporation resides only in its state of incorporation for purposes of the patent venue statute.
