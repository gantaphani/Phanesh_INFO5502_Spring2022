plaintiffs appellants appeal from a september judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,granting the summary judgment motion of defendant appellee grant thornton llp gt and dismissing the plaintiffs claims arising from gt audit of the financial statements of its client,winstar communications,winstar.the plaintiffs claimed that gt committed securities fraud in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,b the act or the exchange act,and,and made false and misleading statements in an audit opinion letter in violation of section of the act.we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist as to each of these claims.we therefore vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of gt,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in their favor.in re omnicom.sec,cir quotation marks omitted.
winstar was a broadband communications company whose core business was to provide wireless internet connectivity to various businesses.gt served as winstar independent auditor from until winstar filed for bankruptcy in april,and gt regarded winstar as one of its largest and most important clients.
in,however,the relationship deteriorated.winstar warned gt that it would likely terminate the relationship if gt performance on unrelated international tax planning and other accounting matters proved unsatisfactory.in march at least one member of winstar board of directors openly urged during a board meeting that the gt partner overseeing the audit of winstar be removed from the winstar account.gt eventually the winstar account so that the audit was managed by a partner,gary goldman,and a senior manager,patricia cummings,neither of whom had previously reviewed or audited the financial records of a telecommunications company.
as relevant to this appeal,gt audit for included several large account transactions that winstar consummated in an attempt to conceal a decrease in revenue associated with winstar core business.most of the large account transactions involved lucent technologies,lucent,winstar strategic partner,and all of them were consummated at the end of winstar fiscal quarters in.together,the transactions accounted for million in revenue,or approximately percent of winstar reported operating revenues and percent of its core revenues that year.at the time,gt considered these transactions to be red flags,warranting the accounting firm heightened scrutiny.however,gt ultimately approved winstar recognition of revenue in connection with each of these transactions.
we discuss the evidence relating to each category of transaction in turn.
questionable sales 
the first category of questionable transactions involved a series of six and transactions,primarily reported as equipment sales,for which there was little evidence that any goods or services were ordered and delivered.for example,for the third quarter of winstar recognized million in revenue for the sale of lucent equipment to anixter brothers,anixter,a wire and cable distributor.there were several unusual aspects of this sale.first,anixter ordinarily purchased equipment directly from lucent,not winstar.second,equipment sales were not part of winstar core business of creating and operating wireless networks.third,during gt audit cummings noted that the anixter transaction was apparently completed on september,the last day of winstar fiscal quarter,but gt work papers included no documents reflecting the sale completion beyond a purchase order from winstar to lucent and an invoice from lucent to winstar.moreover,neither the purchase order nor the invoice included an itemized list of the goods sold or indicated the shipping terms,even though the items were to be shipped on september,and delivered on october,absent too was any document evidencing anixter agreement to purchase the items.lastly,not a single employee of lucent,winstar,or anixter who was asked about the equipment sale could recall it.
five other transactions that were not part of winstar core business were consummated at the end of one of winstar fiscal quarters and were barely documented.winstar nevertheless recognized a total of million in revenue associated with these five transactions.first,winstar recognized million in revenue in the first quarter of for a feasibility study that winstar was scheduled to conduct for lucent,but which had not been delivered by at least.second,winstar recognized million in revenue in the first and second quarters of in connection with the sale of lucent equipment to williams communications,williams.the equipment was shipped by lucent,not winstar,on the last business day of the first and second quarters march,and june,respectively,with no written agreement.third,winstar recognized million in revenue in the second quarter of in connection with the sale of lucent equipment to vocall communications corporation vocall on june.although the sale was referenced in a series of purchase orders,it was not referenced in any executed,final agreement or shipping document.fourth,winstar recognized million in revenue in the third quarter of in connection with the sale of unspecified winstar equipment to cignal global communications cignal,which was contracted for on september,the last day of that quarter.however,gt was unable to produce a document evidencing that the equipment had been shipped to cignal during that quarter.fifth,winstar recognized million in revenue in the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of wireless radio equipment radios to lucent under an agreement dated december.gt endorsed the recognition of revenue even though its work papers included shipping documents with conflicting dates,no document specified the goods purchased,and lucent,not winstar,was in the business of manufacturing and selling radios.the same agreement also involved a million promotional credit purchased by lucent for services that had not yet been rendered by winstar.although gt specifically advised winstar that recognizing and recording the amount of the credit as revenue was improper and in violation of generally accepted accounting principles gaap winstar nevertheless recognized the full million in revenue.
each of these transactions appears to have violated the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab,issued by the securities and exchange commission sec,which states that four conditions must be satisfied before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of goods or services exists,delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable,and collectibility is reasonably assured.sab at 
gt requested that winstar counterparties provide additional documentary evidence of the relevant sales underlying each questionable transaction.by doing so,consistent with sab,gt sought to obtain independent support for winstar recognition of revenue for each transaction in other words,support from documents that were not generated by winstar itself.as of february,gt still had not received responsive documents from four of these customers.nonetheless,it issued an audit opinion letter opining that winstar financial statements accurately reflected its financial condition and complied with gaap.
bifurcated accounting 
in connection with at least three other transactions,winstar employed a bifurcated accounting scheme that gt ultimately approved prior to its audit of winstar financial statements.two of these transactions involved leasing or subleasing fiber optic network capacity in units called indefeasible rights of use irus.winstar accounted for these irus using a dubious bifurcated accounting method,pursuant to which it recognized as much as percent of the revenue from the leases upon execution of the lease,reflecting the cost of optical equipment optronics that transmitted data over fiber optic cable cable or fiber.winstar then would recognize the balance of the revenue in later quarters,as payments were received over the span of the lease,representing the customer actual use of the network.in other words,winstar split the value of the leases so that the revenue associated with the optronics was reported separately from revenue associated with the cable.by employing this accounting method,winstar was able to recognize million in revenue up front in.
during discovery,a forensic accountant retained by the plaintiffs opined that the rules of the financial accounting standards board and interpretive rules of the sec prohibited the division of leases for fiber optic networks because both the cable and the optronics were essential to the network.winstar conceded that the fiber and the optronics were not separable,and that no other company previously had employed this bifurcated method in accounting for irus.indeed,winstar specifically advised gt that the bifurcated approach had been criticized by the accounting firm deloitte touche llp deloitte.
gt was in any event aware that revenue associated with an iru contract could be recognized only if the leased circuit was operational,or lit,in the language of the fiber optics field.in the third and fourth quarters of,however,winstar had failed to light many of its iru circuits,a fact that should have precluded the company from recognizing revenue associated with those irus.
in the midst of gt audit,winstar sent form letters dated december,and december,to the counterparties to the two iru transactions,and cignal,respectively,to confirm that the iru circuits had been deliver ed and accept ed.a representative of cignal signed a form letter confirming delivery and acceptance of the circuits.by contrast,wam net senior vice president of finance responded to a letter from winstar as follows to our knowledge the circuits are not currently in place.a subsequent amended letter from a different employee,which does not appear in the record but which cummings referenced in an email,purported to accept the circuits but did not address the earlier letter response.after receiving the amended letter,gt did not further review whether the circuits were installed and operational.even though it appears not to have received the amended letter until after february,gt approved winstar recognition of revenue for the iru circuit sale on february.
while gt appears to have neglected to verify that iru circuits were operational,there was evidence that gt actually knew that the leased cignal iru circuits were inoperative.gt nevertheless approved winstar recognition of revenue for the cignal irus in the third quarter of.
winstar employed a similar bifurcated accounting method in the fourth quarter of for its sale of radios to lucent.the agreement between the two companies provided for winstar to install the radios,but winstar recognized revenue for the transaction immediately,upon delivering them to lucent gt expressed doubt that the radios and installation services were separable but it nevertheless approved of winstar recognition of million in revenue in connection with the transaction.
round trip transactions 
several of the transactions discussed above involved transactions with cignal and at a time when the two customers were struggling financially.typically refers to reciprocal agreements,involving the same products or services,that lack economic substance but permit both parties to book revenue and improve their financial statements.teachers ret.of la hunter,cir.the two principal transactions that were the focus of discovery involved a scheme pursuant to which winstar overpaid both companies for purportedly unrelated goods and services in exchange for their purchase of irus,equipment,and services from winstar by the end of winstar third fiscal quarter of cignal,and the end of the fourth quarter of.
both transactions were material to winstar financial performance in.in the larger of the two transactions,winstar recognized approximately million in revenue in the third and fourth quarters of in connection with sales to cignal while it paid cignal million under a separate agreement during the same time period and an additional million in the first quarter of.similarly,winstar recognized million in revenue in connection with sales to in the fourth quarter of,even as it paid million in the same quarter for prepaid marketing and the lease of a data service center.in february gt questioned the a rms length nature of the transactions.it later acknowledged that the transactions raise d a concern within gt as to whether or not absent winstar payment collectability was reasonably assured.nevertheless,gt approved winstar recognition of the full amount of revenue for both transactions.
d.the audit opinion letter 
by letter dated february,gt issued an unqualified audit opinion letter stating that winstar annual form k report for fiscal year complied with gaap and fairly represented winstar financial condition at the end of that year 
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of winstar communications,inc 
we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states.those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion,the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of winstar communications,and subsidiaries as of december,in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.

investment by the jefferson plaintiffs 
from december to february,the jefferson plaintiffs purchased over million worth of winstar stock.the investment portfolios of most of the jefferson plaintiffs were managed by ronald clark,the chief investment officer for allianz of america allianz.the remaining entities deferred to clark to select their investments in united states securities.although clark enjoyed ultimate authority for these investment decisions,he relied on recommendations from a team of analysts,including livia asher,who recommended that allianz purchase winstar stock.based on asher recommendation,clark caused allianz and the other jefferson plaintiffs to invest in winstar.
clark,it appears,did not personally review winstar financial statements prior to making the decision to invest in winstar.instead,he relied on asher to review the statements as part of her job.during discovery,however,asher acknowledged that she was uncertain of the date of,or reason for,her recommendation that allianz purchase winstar stock.nor could she specifically recall reading winstar form k report.however,asher testified that she probably flipped through every single page of the report,based on her practice.she explained,i ca imagine any reason why i would not have looked at this,given our position in the stock and given what i would normally do.asher added that she habitually read auditors opinion letters included in forms k to make sure that auditors believed that an issuer reports were kosher,but she did not specifically recall reviewing gt audit report.
winstar decline 
winstar stock reached a price per share of over in march.in may lucent provided winstar with financing in the form of a renewed credit facility in the aggregate amount of billion.almost a year later,however,in march,asensio company asensio,an investment firm,issued a press release criticizing winstar ability to pay its debts and explaining that certain measurements of winstar financial performance were questionable due in part to winstar revenue recognition from businesses and sales of equipment and services to related parties.joint app.at.the same press release warned that a ny adjustment to winstar aggressive revenue accounting and capitalization of cash expenditures would negatively and materially impact winstar reported earnings and analyst sic opinions of its operations.id.at.on march,asensio issued another press release reporting on winstar debt collapse,again criticizing its revenue accounting practices and noting,winstar has recognized revenues that created a slew of uncollected items its revenues include sales to related parties and items such as equipment sales and installation services.id.at.
the asensio press releases preceded a significant downgrade in winstar credit rating on april.moreover,on april,winstar announced that lucent was cancelling winstar credit facility,that winstar would delay filing its form k report for,and that winstar was considering a reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
by the time of the asensio press releases,winstar revenues and its stock price had decreased significantly during a marketwide decline in the prices of technology stocks.however,the press releases,coupled with the subsequent announcements of winstar financial troubles,were followed almost immediately by an additional steep decline in winstar stock price,from over per share before march to per share by.on april,winstar filed for bankruptcy.
during discovery,an economist retained by the plaintiffs as an expert witness attributed the decline in winstar stock price to,among other causes,the partial disclosure of winstar alleged fraud by asensio.the economist calculated that members of the putative class who had purchased winstar common stock lost as much as million,that class members who purchased winstar notes lost up to million,and that the jefferson plaintiffs lost over million by investing in winstar stock.
procedural history 
on april,the lead plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint in the southern district of new york against winstar,gt,lucent,and certain winstar executives alleging securities fraud under section b of the exchange act,b.in december the jefferson plaintiffs filed a separate complaint in the district court against gt,claiming violations of both section b and section of the exchange act,a as a result of various settlements among the parties,the claims against gt were all that remained by.after discovery,gt moved for summary judgment to dismiss the plaintiffs claims and also moved unsuccessfully to preclude the plaintiffs expert loss causation analysis.
in september the district court granted gt motion for summary judgment,concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether gt acted intentionally or recklessly,as required under section b of the exchange act,and the jefferson plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that such a dispute existed as to whether they actually relied on gt audit opinion letter,as required under section of the exchange act.in re winstar commc ns sec,cv gbd,wl,at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in its favor,grain traders,citibank,cir.we will affirm the judgment only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.there is no genuine issue of material fact where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.durakovic.servs.bj pension fund,cir quotation marks and brackets omitted.put another way,a n issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.omnicom,at quotation marks omitted.

plaintiffs may satisfy the scienter requirement by producing evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.see eca,local ibew joint pension trust of chicago jp morgan chase,cir.scienter based on conscious misbehavior,in turn,requires a showing of deliberate illegal behavior,novak kasaks,cir,a standard met when it is clear that a scheme,viewed broadly,is necessarily going to injure,ausa life ins.ernst young,cir alterations omitted.
in ausa life,we applied this standard to representations by the accounting firm ernst young e y,which,as plaintiffs allege with respect to gt,consistently noticed,protested,and then acquiesced in the financial misrepresentations of an audit client under pressure from the client management.id.at.we held that by issuing an unqualified audit report despite its knowledge of accounting improprieties by the client,e y intentionally engaged in manipulative conduct,id.at quotation marks omitted,in violation of section b.we explained that 
e y is not an accounting dilettante.it knows well that its opinions and certifications are afforded great weight,and it must have known that its financial certifications with regard to its client would be compelling to the investors i t is sufficient for the purposes of showing scienter for a plaintiff to allege and prove that a defendant could have foreseen the consequences of his actions but forged ahead nonetheless 
see also sec kpmg llp,d,triable issue as to conscious fraud existed when accountant was a ware of the client earnings pressures but allowed aggressive accounting policies without any serious study to determine that these unusual,indeed unique,accounting treatments would result in financial statements that fairly represented the client financial condition.
scienter based on recklessness may be demonstrated where a defendant has engaged in conduct that was highly unreasonable,representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.rothman gregor,cir quotation marks omitted.recklessness may be established where a defendant failed to review or check information that it had a duty to monitor,or ignored obvious signs of fraud.novak,at.
the district court concluded that winstar engaged in dubious accounting practices,that m uch of the supporting documentation that winstar supplied to gt was a mere contrivance meant to paper the transactions and create the appearance of legitimacy,and that gt failed to uncover the accounting fraud being perpetuated by the winstar defendants.winstar,wl,at.gt does not seriously dispute these conclusions,which are in any event supported by the record before us.the district court concluded,however,that the evidence demonstrated only that gt was performing its role as winstar independent auditor and fell short of demonstrating scienter in the form of either conscious misbehavior or recklessness.id.at.we disagree.
some evidence supports the plaintiffs contention that gt consciously ignored winstar fraud when it approved winstar recognition of revenue for the suspicious transactions.this evidence goes beyond a mere failure to uncover the accounting fraud and,in general,relates to winstar recognition of revenue for the sale of equipment or services without sufficient indicia of delivery,its recognition of all revenue associated with the incomplete sale of telecommunications systems,and its recognition of revenue for sales of irus,equipment,and services to financially unstable companies to whom winstar paid back large sums under separate contractual obligations.
there is also evidence that gt failed to confirm winstar representations regarding these transactions or to retain and review documents evidencing each transaction.indeed,an expert forensic accountant retained by the plaintiffs testified that gt failure to exercise due professional care,gather reliable documents,and issue an adverse opinion in this regard represented a violation of generally accepted auditing standards gaas with regard to all of the challenged transactions.furthermore,the record evidence supports a conclusion that gt knew,even under the terms of winstar bifurcated accounting method a method that had been criticized by deloitte but reviewed and approved,with skepticism,by gt that revenue could not be properly recognized for irus unless the leased circuits were operational.during d
