this is a surprisingly difficult case involving a limitations defense,fixed by contract and statute,for suit by the insured kathy parker claiming a loss under an insurance contract.the matter was resolved on summary judgment in favor of the insurer worcester.thus,in reciting the events,we take the facts as alleged by or in the light most favorable to the insured as the party opposing summary judgment.banco popular de,cir.
in january,michael and kathy parker,husband and wife,moved into a new house at manse hill road,somers,connecticut,purchased from its builder,lhm developers.kathy parker thereafter considered herself a connecticut resident.title in the manse hill house was taken in kathy parker name,and homeowner insurance was obtained,also in kathy parker name,from worcester insurance company worcester,an insurance company headquartered in worcester,massachusetts.almost immediately,kathy parker began to notice hairline,mostly horizontal cracks in the concrete walls of the basement,which formed the house foundation.
the parkers first disregarded the cracks as cosmetic,but in march kathy parker noticed that the cracks were growing larger and that the basement wall seemed to be developing a sandy texture,as if it were disintegrating.that summer,edward noonan,owner of the company that serviced the parkers heating system,told michael that a burner repairman who worked for noonan had commented either that the manse hill house look ed like it about to fall over or that its basement wall was amazing.michael parker then found that some of the cracks had grown wide enough that he could insert his fingers and also that cracking had occurred aboveground in the brick facade supported by the basement wall.
michael parker sought an expert to determine the scope and nature of the cracking problem,but had no immediate success.sometime before late september,the parkers advised worcester of problems with the foundation wall.kathy parker homeowner policy required that,in the event of a loss,the insured give prompt notice to the requirement distinct from provisions discussed below requiring that any lawsuit be brought within one year of loss.at this point it is useful to outline,in bare bones terms,pertinent substantive provisions in the policy obtained by kathy parker.
section i,providing property insurance for the house,insured against direct physical loss to the described property but not,among other losses,those involving collapse,other than as provided in additional coverage,or those caused by f reezing,thawing,pressure or weight of water or ice to a f oundation.additional coverage provides coverage for collapse only where due to certain specified causes.another set of exclusions applies to loss due to faulty design,workmanship,construction,or construction materials 
following the parkers report to worcester in september,peter judd,an insurance claims adjuster acting for worcester,inspected the house he then wrote a report on october,concluding that exterior pressure from clay flow or ice had caused the manse hill house foundation to crack,and that the damage to the house was therefore not covered.in a misaddressed letter dated october,judd advised the parkers that,under the pressure or weight exclusion to the policy,coverage was denied the parkers say they never received the letter but admit learning at some point that coverage had been denied.
the foundation condition continued to deteriorate.in june,the parkers finally arranged for an engineer to inspect the premises.this expert said that he did not regard the house as safe,especially during the winter when snow could add to the weight pressing on the foundation,and he surmised that something abnormal had occurred in the process of preparing and mixing the concrete.in late november,the parkers had the house jacked up and much of its foundation rebuilt.repairs continued into,the total cost approximating by late.
before the foundation was replaced,the parkers sent worcester a demand letter dated november.the letter acknowledged the company denial of coverage in,but it claimed that the manse hill house was now collapsing,and that worcester was liable for the repairs needed to prevent collapse.worcester hired ccallc,an architecture and engineering firm,to inspect the parkers home and had tests performed on samples of concrete from the original foundation wall.ccallc concluded that the cracking of the basement walls was due to defective concrete and to high lateral earth pressures due to poor drainage in january,worcester again denied coverage.
on february,kathy parker filed suit in massachusetts state court,alleging breach of contract and violation of massachusetts general laws chapter,which provides multiple damages for consumer fraud and deception.laws ch.worcester removed the case to federal district court on diversity grounds.the parties consented to jury trial by a magistrate judge,c supp.ii.ultimately,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment for the insurer on the ground that kathy parker suit was barred by the applicable limitations period,the parties having agreed that connecticut law applies 
the magistrate judge reasoned that the presence of hairline cracks prior to was too slight to suggest appreciable damage,but the larger cracks and other damage visible by was sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice of a substantial problem.coupled with noonan statement to michael parker in,and the parkers notice to the insurer in september of that year,the magistrate judge found that a reasonable person would have been on notice by the end of that the premises had suffered appreciable damage.kathy parker now appeals.
kathy parker main argument on appeal is that,in ruling that her claims were,the magistrate judge misconstrued connecticut law and improperly resolved genuine issues of material fact.the insurance contract in question provides explicitly that n o action can be brought against the insurer unless the action is started within one year after the date of loss.although strict,this provision accords with a connecticut statute requiring that policies that provide fire insurance coverage contain a period of limitations,a bocchino nationwide mut.fire ins.
the magistrate judge assumed,and we agree,that the limitations period is subject to at least one implicit qualification that,in the case of a injury or loss,the period begins to run only when a reasonable person would have learned of the injury or loss.although there is no connecticut case in point,a number of cases in other jurisdictions adopt some form of discovery rule in similar situations absent more explicit language,no one would expect an insured to be stripped of coverage where a reasonable person would not have detected the injury or loss.alternatively,kathy parker brief summarily asserts that there was no loss until the repairs themselves were made,beginning in november but this theory,which is not seriously developed,would allow the insured to postpone a claim almost indefinitely simply by deferring the repair work.
at argument,counsel for the insurer properly conceded that a discovery rule should apply but suggested that it was enough that the parkers knew that some kind of appreciable damage had occurred by.this is a plausible position and is seemingly the view taken by the magistrate judge.specifically,the magistrate judge assumed that under connecticut law the date of loss or inception of loss in this case would be the date on which there was a sufficient problem to put a reasonable person on notice of the occurrence of appreciable damage to the premises.
kathy parker,by contrast,argues primarily that the one year period began to run only when she knew or should have known of the threatened collapse of the house and,she argues,this occurred only after her expert so reported in.because suit followed within one year,in february,she says that she met the requirement.of course,the house itself never collapsed,but for prudential reasons connecticut allows a claim,where a collapse is covered,as soon as structural integrity is substantially impaired.beach middlesex mut.assurance.
