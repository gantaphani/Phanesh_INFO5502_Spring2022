this case requires us to decide whether,in,the trustees of the residuary trust created by the will of john rockefeller in may be made to contribute to cleanup costs of environmental contamination allegedly caused by corporations controlled by rockefeller in washington state between and.the answer to that question turns on a number of provisions of federal and state law.
the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of,as amended,cercla,imposes liability for cleanup costs on persons who are responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.see a.a party who has been sued for such contamination may then seek contribution from others in the chain of title or from certain polluters the potentially responsible parties.such potentially responsible parties include,as relevant here,the owners and operators of the property at the time of the hazardous waste disposal.see id.f.while cercla does not expressly permit contribution claims against,such as beneficiaries of the estates of such potentially responsible parties,our precedents require us to analyze applicable state law to determine whether such liability may be imposed.see marsh rosenbloom,cir.here,the applicable state law is a provision of new york probate law,see.powers trusts law a,which holds testamentary beneficiaries liable for certain debts of a decedent.where the applicable state law would permit such contribution claims,those claims must be brought within three years of the date of entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs.g b.separately,cercla requires subrogation claims to be brought within three years of the payment of a claim.see id.g.
asarco llc asarco appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge dismissing its second amended complaint.as part of its chapter bankruptcy,the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas richard schmidt,bankruptcy judge approved two settlement agreements related to the environmental contamination at the everett smelter and the monte cristo mining area together,the sites,located in washington state.as a result of those settlements,asarco eventually paid the united states,the state of washington,and the port of everett million for costs related to the remediation of the sites.asarco then sought contribution,directly and as a purported subrogee,from the trustees of the residuary trusts created by the will of the late john rockefeller,which now benefit his,alleging that the remediation costs were fairly attributable to activities of corporations controlled by rockefeller,which owned and operated the contaminated sites.
we assume arguendo that new york law permits the imposition of liability on testamentary beneficiaries in such circumstances,but nevertheless conclude that the district court properly dismissed asarco contribution claims because they are barred by the applicable statute of limitations,and its subrogation claims because asarco is not a subrogee.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the second amended complaint,and the bankruptcy documents it references,set forth the following facts,which we must accept as true in adjudicating a motion to dismiss under rule b,drawing all reasonable inferences in asarco favor.pension comm.of the of montreal pension plan banc of am.sec.llc,cir.
located in the baker snoqualmie national forest in snohomish county,washington,the monte cristo mining area mcma includes several large mine complexes,and the former site of an ore processing and concentrating facility.the former everett smelter plant property and surrounding area are located in everett,washington,some miles from the mcma.predecessors of asarco,a limited liability company organized under delaware law,operated everett smelter from approximately to,and the mcma from approximately to.before asarco operation of the sites,the puget sound reduction company psrc held legal title to the everett smelter,which was psrc principal business activity.psrc was operated by john rockefeller directly and through his personal agents acting at his direction and under his control.rockefeller also had interests in companies that owned or operated several of the mcma mines.asarco alleged,and the district court assumed arguendo that rockefeller control of those corporate entities was exercised in a manner that warrants piercing the corporate veil and imposing personal liability on rockefeller for the actions of those corporations.
between and,under rockefeller ownership and operation of the sites,substantial quantities of slag a material containing various hazardous substances and smelting wastes were discharged at the everett smelter.further,various mining wastes were discharged at the mcma as a result of the mining activities,as well as the storage,processing,and transportation of mining ore.the discharge of those waste products caused various hazardous substances,including arsenic,lead,and other heavy metals and substances to be released into the environment,contaminating the sites.
rockefeller died in.in his will and its codicils,he established a residuary trust for the primary lifetime benefit of his granddaughter,margaret strong de cuevas,which upon her death was divided into two separate trusts for the benefit of her children,rockefeller.those trusts,which will not terminate until the deaths of those,still contain substantial assets received directly from rockefeller estate or derived from the original assets so received.
ii.prior proceedings 
bankruptcy proceedings 
on august,asarco filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.the united states,state of washington,and the port of everett filed proofs of claim for remediation costs,future response costs,and natural resource damages.on april,pursuant to federal rule bankruptcy procedure a the bankruptcy court approved a settlement of the everett smelter claims.under the terms of the settlement,the state of washington and port of everett were allowed a general unsecured claim in the amount of million,to be allocated between the two.on june,the bankruptcy court approved a similar agreement under which the state of washington and the united states were allowed general unsecured claims totaling just over million,settling the mcma claims both settlements became effective when they were approved by the bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy court approved asarco reorganization plan on november,and the plan became effective on december.the everett smelter and mcma claims were paid on the latter date.
district court proceedings 
after emerging from its chapter bankruptcy reorganization,asarco pursued its right under cercla to require other potentially responsible parties to reimburse it for those parties fair share of remediation costs.asarco filed the original complaint in this action against the trustees on may,alleging substantial response costs and seeking contribution for rockefeller environmental liabilities at the everett smelter site only.asarco amended its complaint on july,to include a similar claim for contribution for rockefeller liabilities at mcma.the trustees moved to dismiss the amended complaint,and with the consent of the trustees and leave of the district court,asarco filed its second amended complaint on october.the second amended complaint included two additional claims against the trustees for contribution at both sites,by asarco as subrogee of itself as the former and.the trustees moved to dismiss the second amended complaint,and the district court granted the motion in an oral ruling.
the district court noted that under cercla the owner and operator of a facility is liable for cleanup costs,and assumed that if john rockefeller were alive today,he could be held liable as the owner and perhaps even the operator of the sites.the district court refused,however,to impose such liability on the beneficiaries of rockefeller estate.first,citing new york estates,powers trusts law a the district court held that any liability under cercla or for contribution could not be a debt of john rockefeller because cercla did even exist at the time of his death.second,relying on this court decision in marsh rosenbloom,cir,the district court concluded that the trustees could not be held liable under a theory of trust fund liability.
the district court then addressed the trustees other defenses.under g b,no action for contribution may be commenced more than three years after the date of entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs.because the bankruptcy court approved a settlement as to the everett smelter site on april,the district court concluded that the statute of limitations for the everett smelter claim expired on april,more than a year before this action was commenced on may.similarly,the bankruptcy court approved a settlement as to the mcma on june,and thus the statute of limitations expired on june.no claims regarding the mcma were filed,however,until july,the date of the first amended complaint.the district court determined that with respect to the claims relating to the mcma,the first amended complaint did not relate back to the original may,complaint.
the district court rejected asarco argument that the statute of limitations did not begin to run as to any of its claims until december,when the plan of reorganization became effective and the payments were made.while agreeing that the bankruptcy proceeding is not finished until it is indeed finished,id.at,the district court noted that the bankruptcy court literal ly approved settlements in april and june,which were not the subject of renegotiation or review in any meaningful way,and that the limitations periods for the contribution claims began to run on the dates when the settlements were thus approved.
finally,the district court rejected asarco arguments that it could invoke the statute of limitations for cercla subrogation claims,g.that provision also provides a statute of limitations,but it is instead triggered upon payment of a claim rather than the entry of a judicially approved settlement.the district court determined that the kind of transactions which are necessary to create subrogation simply did not take place in the bankruptcy of asarco,because an entity can not be subrogated to pay its own liability,id.at.asarco timely filed a notice of appeal,and we now affirm.
discussion 
on appeal,asarco contends that the district court erred in dismissing its complaint for several reasons.it argues that the district court erroneously refused to apply the trust fund theory,a common law doctrine under which beneficiaries of estates have been held liable for a decedent personal cercla liability that,contrary to the district court conclusion,new york probate law expressly permits holding testamentary beneficiaries liable for the debts of a decedent imposed by a later enacted retroactive statute that the district court erred in concluding that asarco direct contribution claims were barred by the statute of limitations in e and g b and that the district court erroneously concluded that asarco could not pursue a subrogation claim under g because the transactions at issue in asarco bankruptcy did not meet the basic requirements of subrogation.after setting forth the applicable legal standards,we address each of those arguments in turn.
legal standards 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court judgment granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true.absolute activist value master fund ficeto,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.in adjudicating a motion to dismiss,a court may consider only the complaint,any written instrument attached to the complaint as an exhibit,any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference,and any document upon which the complaint heavily relies.in re thelen llp,cir.
cercla primary purposes are axiomatic to encourage the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to place the cost of that cleanup on those responsible for creating or maintaining the hazardous condition.price trucking norampac,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to effectuate those goals,cercla looks backward in time and imposes liability.marsh,at.thus,somewhat akin to the common law rules applicable to activities,the statute imposes strict liability on facility owners and operators,on persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste at the relevant site,and on persons who transported hazardous waste to the site,often collectively referred to as potentially responsible parties.see a niagara mohawk power chevron,cir.
but cercla provide s property owners an avenue of reprieve it allows them to seek reimbursement of their cleanup costs from others in the chain of title or from certain polluters the potentially responsible parties.niagara mohawk,at.in this case,the relevant avenue of reprieve is f b,which provides a right of contribution to property owners that have settled their cercla liability with a state or the united states through either an administrative or judicially approved settlement.
the parties agree,because the complaint in this matter was dismissed for failure to state a claim,that if rockefeller were alive today,he would be liable under cercla,as either an owner or an operator of the sites.there is also no dispute that asarco settled its cercla liability through a judicially approved settlement.the question,therefore,is whether cercla permits a right of contribution against the beneficiaries of a potentially responsible party estate.
ii.asarco arguments 
trust fund theory under federal law 
we acknowledge at the outset that cercla does not contain any provision that imposes liability directly upon the estates of the four classes of potentially responsible parties,witco.beekhuis,cir,much less the beneficiaries of such estates.that can not end the inquiry,however,because our precedents make clear that under some circumstances,the liability of potentially responsible parties may pass to certain of their.for example,while cercla does not specifically provide that a successor corporation may be held liable for response costs,new york serv,cir,we have held that cercla encompasses such successor liability,see id.
asarco contends that we should craft a rule of federal common law under cercla mandating that a decedent personal liability is transferred to those who benefit from the decedent estate,a rule known as the trust fund doctrine.appellant br.see peele.trust.at.such an approach,however,is foreclosed by our precedents.as we recently reiterated,where federal statutory regulation is comprehensive and detailed,as cercla is,we presume that matters left unaddressed are left subject to the disposition provided by state law.price trucking,at internal quotation marks omitted.
our decision in marsh,at,illustrates that principle.there,the state of new york appealed from an order dismissing its claims under cercla against the of a dissolved delaware corporation.the relevant provision of delaware law established a continuation period,beginning at dissolution,for dissolved corporations to wind up their affairs and for unknown claimants to assert claims against the corporation.id.at citing ann.tit.the state asserted its claims several years after the corporation had been dissolved,and outside the corporate period established by delaware law.id.at.in affirming the district court dismissal,we declined to create a rule of federal common law that would have displaced delaware law regarding actions against dissolved corporations,concluding that cercla does not suggest that the entire corpus of state corporation law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff cause of action is based upon a federal statute.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the same conclusion necessarily obtains with respect to federal claims against decedents estates,which,by longstanding precedent,are governed by state probate law and procedures,unless federal law specifically provides otherwise.see,pufahl parks estate,forrest jack.cercla gives no indication of any intention to displace state probate law,any more than it displaces state law regarding successor liability in the case of dissolved corporations.
accordingly,we agree with the district court rejection of asarco argument that the trustees may be held liable by application of a trust fund theory as a matter of federal law.
new york probate law 
having concluded that state law governs whether liability may be imposed against the beneficiaries of rockefeller estate,we turn next to asarco arguments based on new york law.the relevant new york statute provides 
subject to the other provisions of this article,distributees and testamentary beneficiaries are liable,in an action,to the extent of the value of any property received by them as such,for the debts and reasonable funeral expenses of a decedent,the expenses of administering his estate and all taxes for which the estate is liable,which have not previously been recovered from the personal representative or from any other source 
powers trusts law a the relevant question is whether the debts of a decedent may arise as a result of legislation enacted following the decedent death,and which has been expressly made retroactive.
cercla by its terms has unlimited retroactivity,commonwealth edison united states,and it is by now settled that congress intended cercla to have such retroactive effect.see,united states.monsanto,cir united states ne.pharm.chem,cir.such retroactive application does not violate the due process clause,and does not convert cercla into a bill of attainder or an ex post facto law.see monsanto,at.
although asarco does not identify any case in which new york courts have interpreted debts of a decedent to include debts created by legislation that has been expressly made retroactive,and is not otherwise constitutionally infirm,it does cite cases that might support such a conclusion by negative pregnant.essentially,those cases hold that new york courts will generally presume that new york statutes do not impose liability retroactively on the estates of decedents,and will not consider as debts of a decedent liabilities retrospectively imposed by legislation after the decedent death where such retrospective imposition would be unconstitutional asarco argues that we can infer that new york law would recognize as such debts liabilities retrospectively imposed where,as in the case of cercla,the legislature clearly did intend to impose such liability and the statute has been held constitutional.
we are hesitant to rely on inference to decide an important issue of new york law.we might,of course,certify the issue to the new york court of appeals for its definitive resolution.see second cir.local a,tit,a see also const,b.we do not do so in this case,however,because the answer to the potential certified question is not determinative of a claim before us.in re thelen,at internal quotation marks omitted.in light of the conclusions we reach below regarding the statute of limitations,even if new york would consider liabilities imposed by cercla long after rockefeller death to be debts of a decedent chargeable to his estate or its beneficiaries,asarco claims are,in any event.
we therefore assume arguendo that new york law would permit the imposition of liability against john rockefeller testamentary trusts under these circumstances,and proceed to consider the statute of limitations issues.
statute of limitations contribution claims 
cercla contribution claims are subject to a statute of limitations,which provides that n o action for contribution for any response costs or damages may be commenced more than years after entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.g b.the event triggering the beginning of the limitations period entry of a judicially approved settlement is the point of contention here.the district court,relying on the plain language of that provision,concluded that the statute of limitations began to run for the everett smelter site on april,and for the mcma on june.asarco contends that the district court committed legal error by ignoring the bankruptcy context in which the everett site and mcma site agreements were negotiated and approved,appellant br,and that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the date its reorganization plan became effective.we disagree.
we review the interpretation of federal statutes de novo.grace zotos int l,cir.o ur obligation is to look to the plain language of the statute to effectuate the intent of congress.id.
the plain language of g b contradicts asarco contention that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until its reorganization plan was either approved by the bankruptcy court or became effective.see rsr commercial metals,cir t he statute of limitations for contribution actions runs from the entry of the settlement,g b,not from the date that each provision of that settlement takes effect.pursuant to its authority under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a,the bankruptcy court approved settlements for the sites,which,by the terms of each settlement,resolved asarco liability for the corresponding government entities for the response costs incurred at each site.moreover,each settlement was effective once approved by the bankruptcy court and was not conditioned on the confirmation of a reorganization plan.we have no doubt that the bankruptcy court approval of the settlement falls within g b.
asarco contends that the bankurptcy court approval of the settlement agreements only resolved the disputed proofs of claim and did not immediately trigger cercla statute of limitations for direct contribution claims because n o moneys could be paid at that time,and because it could not even be definitively stated how much would be paid at the time the bankruptcy court approved the two agreements.appellant br.therefore,asarco argues,the date that the reorganization plan became effective is the most logical triggering event for the statute of limitations because o nly upon the reorganization plan judicial confirmation and effective date was the contribution amount finally determined and payable,in this case,december,
it is a sufficient answer to say that congress chose to tie the limitation period to the entry of a judicially approved settlement and not to approval of a reorganization p lan.we note as well,however,that under the terms of the statute a judicially approved settlement need only resolve a potentially responsible party liability,and not fix the settlement amount.see f b.such a resolution occurs when a potentially responsible party is released from cercla liability,which the everett smelter and mcma settlements accomplished with respect to asarco.see niagara mohawk,at rsr,at.moreover,given that the confirmation of a reorganization plan could plausibly take years,tying the statute of limitations to that date would do nothing to ensure the principal purpose of limitations periods in this setting,namely ensur ing that the responsible parties get to the bargaining and sooner rather than later.rsr,at.
because the bankruptcy court approved a settlement as to the everett smelter site on april,and as to the mcma on june,we agree with the district court that the statute of limitations for the everett smelter expired on april,more than a year before this action was commenced on may.
as to the mcma,the statute of limitations expired on june,after this action was filed,but before asarco filed its first amended complaint on july.it was only in that amended complaint that asarco first asserted a claim relating to the mcma.thus,as asarco concedes,that claim is unless it relates back to the filing of the initial complaint.see.c b.
upon de novo review,we find no error in the district court determination that the mcma claims do not relate back the original complaint.see slayton am.exp,cir.for a claim to relate back under rule c b,the basic claim must have arisen out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading.id.in
