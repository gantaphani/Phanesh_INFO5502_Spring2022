plaintiff appellant cole fowlkes appeals from a december,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska,chief judge,dismissing his in forma pauperis complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.fowlkes,who as male but was born biologically female,alleges that his union,ironworkers local the local,and two of its business agents,danny doyle and kevin the local,doyle,and,together,defendants,discriminated against him on the basis of sex and retaliated against him for filing an earlier action against them.the discrimination and retaliation alleged by fowlkes primarily consisted of refusing to refer fowlkes for work through the local hiring hall.
the district court construed fowlkes complaint as stating federal claims under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,and related state and claims.invoking its authority pursuant to e b to screen an in forma pauperis complaint at any time,the district court,acting sua sponte,held that fowlkes failure to exhaust administrative remedies for his title vii claims deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.on the understanding that no federal claim remained after the title vii claims dismissal,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the related state and claims,and entered a judgment dismissing fowlkes complaint in toto.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the district court erred in its determination that fowlkes failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over his title vii claims.in addition,we conclude that fowlkes has stated a federal claim under the national labor relations act nlra,et,for the local breach of its duty of fair representation.accordingly,we vacate the judgment dismissing fowlkes amended complaint and remand the cause to the district court.on remand,the district court shall consider whether any equitable defenses excuse fowlkes failure to exhaust his administrative remedies for his title vii claims conduct further proceedings on fowlkes duty of fair representation claim and reevaluate whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over fowlkes pendent state and claims and conduct any further proceedings on those claims as it determines may be warranted.
background 
fowlkes is a journeyman ironworker and a member of local.as a journeyman ironworker,fowlkes would in his words detonate cement from torch to steel,preparing it for the welder.am.compl.at.although fowlkes was born biologically female and was named colette,he now as a man,preferring to be called cole and to be referred to in the masculine.id.at appellant br.at.
to place its members at job sites,the local ran a hiring hall,and doyle and,as business agents for the local,participated in the placement process.fowlkes alleges that,beginning as early as,the local refused to refer him to jobs for which he was qualified,i ntentionally passing over fowlkes by choosing other men to receive the construction work that he sought.am.compl.at.fowlkes further alleges that received calls specifically requesting him for particular jobs for which he had the requisite skills,but that and doyle passed him over in favor of others with lesser skill level.id.at.the local failure to refer fowlkes for assignments allegedly continued through in that year,fowlkes claims to have worked a total of only hours as a journeyman,again as a result of defendants refusal to refer and give him work.id.at.
fowlkes alleges that defendants failed to refer him for work for two primary reasons.first,he asserts that defendants discriminated against him on the basis of sex fowlkes claims that if he had acted with a femin in e character or worked with less musc le,he might have not incurred i ntentional passing over.id.at see also id.at alleging that defendants told him that he would get a good job if he would act like a girl.second,fowlkes recounts that doyle and each told him that they refused to refer him for work because he had previously filed a suit against the local he explains that,when he inquired why he was not receiving work despite his position at the top of the out of work list,allegedly responded by saying well you sueing sic us,and doyle similarly replied that fowlkes should have tried to sue us.id.at.
beyond defendants alleged refusal to refer him for work,fowlkes also claims that he was subjected to discriminatory treatment at job sites on account of his sex,and he suggests that the defendants response to that treatment reflects their discriminatory stance towards him.for example,he alleges that in,a welder at a job site told him,i always thought you would be a girl that would work and make the man happy.id.at.the welder became angry at fowlkes response and began throwing welding leads around,endangering fowlkes,who then reported the incident to a superior at the job site.id.at.the superior informed doyle and of fowlkes report and the welder behavior.fowlkes complains that there were no attempts to correct or remove the situation and that doyle and found the actions of the welder amus ing and told fowlkes to just keep working.id.
ii.procedural background 
fowlkes prior action 
on may,fowlkes initiated proceedings before the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,charging the local with discrimination and alleging that the local subjected him to retaliation and discrimination in violation of title vii the eeoc issued fowlkes a right to sue letter dated july,the letter notified him that,after concluding its investigation,the eeoc had decided not to take further action against the local.it advised that fowlkes was free to pursue his title vii claims by filing a federal suit against the local within ninety days of his receipt of the letter.it was not until more than days later,however on january,that fowlkes filed a complaint against defendants in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.
proceeding pro se in that action,fowlkes made essentially the same allegations as he had in his eeoc charge.defendants moved for summary judgment.in early,magistrate judge freeman issued a report and recommendation r r concluding,on the ground that fowlkes action was untimely,that defendants motion should be granted.shortly thereafter,judge kaplan granted defendants motion for substantially the reason given in the r 
fowlkes second action 
in july,fowlkes filed a second complaint,again in the southern district of new york and again proceeding pro se,alleging that defendants violated his civil rights involving employment by subjecting him to harassment and refusing to refer him for work based on his sex compl.at.the allegations in this complaint covered the period from through.concurrently,fowlkes sought permission to proceed in forma pauperis.
in october,the district court granted fowlkes request to proceed in forma pauperis and directed fowlkes to submit an amended complaint within sixty days.in the same order,the district court,citing its authority under e b to screen sua sponte an in forma pauperis complaint at any time,considered its jurisdiction over the matter.it first construed fowlkes complaint as raising claims under three statutes title vii the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law,et and the new york city human rights law nychrl,city admin.code,et.the district court then observed,before a federal court may review a claim under title vii,a plaintiff must first exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge with the eeoc or an appropriate state agency within days of the unlawful discriminatory act.id.at.because fowlkes did not allege that he had filed a complaint with the eeoc or any new york agency relating to conduct occurring after may,the district court subject matter jurisdiction over fowlkes title vii claim was uncertain,it warned.in light of fowlkes pro se status,the district court granted him leave to amend his complaint to detail his title vii and new york state and city human rights law claims of discrimination that were not already raised in the prior action as set forth above,and allege whether he received a determination or right to sue letter or whether he otherwise attempted to exhaust his administrative remedies.id.at.
in november,fowlkes filed an amended complaint,as directed.on december,again acting sua sponte pursuant to its authority under e b,the district court held that fowlkes title vii claim must be dismissed because he does not allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies.id.at citing e.the district court elaborated that because plaintiff has not exhausted his title vii claim,the court does not have jurisdiction over that title vii claim.id.having dismissed the title vii claims,the district court then determined that only state and claims remained and concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate those claims standing alone.it therefore dismissed the case in toto.
fowlkes timely appealed 
discussion 
on appeal,fowlkes argues that the district court erred in dismissing his amended complaint because exhaustion of administrative remedies before filing a title vii action in federal court is a not a jurisdictional requirement,but rather a precondition of suit that may be subject to equitable defenses.on the merits,fowlkes asserts that he has adequately pleaded claims for both violations of title vii and breach of the duty of fair representation under the nlra.he further argues that,assuming he sufficiently pleaded at least one federal claim,the district court erroneously declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his pendent state and claims.
for the reasons discussed below,we agree with fowlkes that a plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies available for title vii claims does not pose a jurisdictional bar to a district court consideration of those claims.we also conclude that he has pleaded an nlra claim that survives e review.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
subject matter jurisdiction and the failure to exhaust administrative remedies for title vii claims 
it is well established that title vii requires a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit in federal court.see,ragone atl.video at manhattan,cir citing e and f legnani alitalia linee aeree italiane,cir same.the purpose of this exhaustion requirement is to give the administrative agency the opportunity to investigate,mediate,and take remedial action.brown coach stores,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the administrative exhaustion requirement applies to pro se and counseled plaintiffs alike.see pikulin city of,cir per curiam.
exhaustion of administrative remedies through the eeoc is an essential element of the title vii statutory scheme accordingly,it is a precondition to bringing such claims in federal court.legnani,at internal quotation marks omitted see also deravin kerik,cir as a precondition to filing a title vii claim in federal court,a plaintiff must first pursue available administrative remedies.the weight of precedent demonstrates that administrative exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement rather,it is merely a precondition of suit and,accordingly,it is subject to equitable defenses.
the distinction has been effectively drawn by the supreme court.in zipes trans world airlines,a group of flight attendants brought a class action alleging that twa unlawfully discriminated against them on the basis of sex in violation of title vii,id.at.approximately of the plaintiffs had not timely filed claims with the eeoc before the suit was brought in federal court.id.at.after the seventh circuit court of appeals held that these claims were jurisdictionally barred,the plaintiffs appealed,asking the supreme court to address the single question whether the timely filing of an eeoc charge is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing a title vii suit in federal court or whether the requirement is subject to waiver and estoppel.id.at.the supreme court sided with the plaintiffs,holding that filing a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court,but a requirement that is subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.id.at emphasis added.according to the court,this conclusion was dictated by t he structure of title vii,the congressional policy underlying it,and the reasoning of its cases.id.particularly relevant here,the court cited in support of its conclusion two cases in which at least some of the plaintiffs seeking relief in federal court like fowlkes with regard to his allegations of,misconduct had never filed an eeoc charge at all.see id.at citing franks bowman transportation,and albemarle paper moody.
in line with zipes,our court has previously ruled that the exhaustion of administrative remedies is a precondition to bringing a title vii claim in federal court,rather than a jurisdictional requirement.francis city of new york,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also boos runyon,cir analyzing the statutory structure of title vii to conclude that the exhaustion requirement,while weighty,is not jurisdictional.for example,in francis,we held that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff title vii claim,even though his proper exhaustion of the claim was not free from uncertainty,because failure to exhaust was merely a defense subject to waiver.id.at.similarly here,the question whether fowlkes properly exhausted his claims is not free from uncertainty,but this ambiguity has no bearing on the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.
occasionally,passing descriptions of the exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional can be found in our circuit jurisprudence.see,fitzgerald henderson,cir if a title vii claimant has failed to pursue a given claim in administrative proceedings,the federal court generally lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate that claim.shah dep t of civil,cir the federal courts generally have no jurisdiction to hear claims not alleged in an employee eeoc charge.but when our decisions have turned on the question whether proper administrative exhaustion of a title vii claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing suit,we have consistently held that it is not.francis,at.we therefore take this opportunity to underscore that the failure of a title vii plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies raises no jurisdictional bar to the claim proceeding in federal court.
as suggested above,the mischaracterization of a title vii plaintiff administrative exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional has practical effect.a c ourt has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements.bowles russell.in contrast,a mandatory but nonjurisdictional prerequisite to suit may be subject to equitable defenses.see id.at souter,dissenting see also fernandez chertoff,cir because the failure to exhaust one administrative remedies is not a jurisdictional defect,it is subject to equitable defenses.by treating the issue of subject matter jurisdiction as a threshold matter here,the district court did not consider any potential equitable defenses that fowlkes might present to excuse his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.
it is not clear from the record,at this stage,whether an equitable principle may excuse fowlkes failure to exhaust before filing his complaint.as fowlkes has urged in his brief on appeal and defendants have challenged two equitable doctrines that the district court will be called on to consider on remand are futility and reasonable relatedness.because of their direct bearing on the facts as alleged,we discuss aspects of each of these possible defenses below.
when an agency has previously taken a firm stand against a plaintiff position,the plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies may be excused on the ground that exhaustion would be futile.skubel fuoroli,cir internal quotation marks omitted kirkendall halliburton,cir noting that the exhaustion requirement for erisa claims is not absolute and may be excused when a plaintiff demonstrates that pursuing administrative remedies would be futile.
though our circuit has not had occasion to consider this particular equitable defense in the context of eeoc title vii exhaustion,fowlkes may have a
