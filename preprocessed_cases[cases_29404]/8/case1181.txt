on february,the district court stayed all proceedings,with the exception of core discovery obligations,until july.
the tcdi database 
on august,the district court held a conference to determine how to proceed in light of the expiration of the july stay.the district court and the parties acknowledged that,throughout the litigation,medical information and discovery responses had been gathered and stored in the databases.nevertheless,the district court discussed the need for a neutral database the tcdi database comprised of responses to a set of interrogatories agreed to by the parties,to gather and house essential information about each plaintiff.the district court explained that the tcdi database was necessary to determine how many of the approximately plaintiffs were pursuing their cases or instead were opting out of the litigation to receive compensation through the vcf under the zadroga act.further,plaintiffs were to certify their answers to the interrogatories,so as to provide reliable information about their claims.finally,the district court explained and the parties agreed that the tcdi database would serve as a tool to choose the cases that would proceed as a group for more intensive discovery.the further discovery would verify the reliability of information provided in the initial discovery process and prepare initial cases for trial.
the district court summarized the discovery and scheduling issues that were raised at the august conference in an order dated august.the district court ordered counsel to create a set of questions with the special masters that each plaintiff would answer and certify.plaintiffs were required to complete the questionnaires in a timely fashion and a ny p laintiff who fail ed to fill out his or her questionnaire in a time period that enable d th e discovery program to proceed would be liable to be dismissed for failure to prosecute their case.app.at.from the information generated by the interrogatories and stored in the tcdi database,the special masters were to generate a list of cases from which counsel and the district court would choose an initial cases to proceed with further discovery.the process was to be completed by october.

dismissal of plaintiffs claims 
in an order dated december,the district court directed defendants to file a motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims for which plaintiffs answered none to the diagnosis interrogatory.the december order also listed the cases that the district court and counsel chose,based on the information in the tcdi database,to proceed to intensive discovery and trial.the remaining cases were stayed pending the full discovery process for these selected cases.
on january,pursuant to rule and the december order,defendants moved for summary judgment against plaintiffs who answered none to the diagnosis interrogatory,arguing that under new york law plaintiffs could not,in light of their responses,maintain their causes of action.in addition,pursuant to rules and,defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs claims for failure to properly certify their interrogatory responses by the december deadline.
plaintiffs opposed the motions.as an initial matter,plaintiffs clarified that of the plaintiffs identified in defendants motion for summary judgment,only plaintiffs were pursuing their claims.plaintiffs argued,among other things,that defendants motion for summary judgment against the plaintiffs who answered none improperly relied on the tcdi database,which was a means for gathering and sorting through basic information about plaintiffs claims,rather than dispositive discovery.plaintiffs submitted over exhibits,consisting of plaintiffs pleadings,core discovery responses,and affidavits alleging injuries and symptoms that they suffered because of work,to demonstrate that genuine material issues of fact existed.specifically,of the plaintiffs,submitted their complaints,submitted their core discovery responses,and completed affidavits after defendants motion for summary judgment was filed the late affidavits.some plaintiffs also amended their responses to the diagnosis interrogatory on the tcdi database to allege specific injuries,including fear of cancer and medical monitoring.to support their claims,plaintiffs submitted an affidavit from shira kramer,explaining that populations have experienced increased risks of wtc cough,new or worsening upper and lower respiratory symptoms,and asthma,among other things.kramer affidavit at.

the district court also granted defendants motion for summary judgment against those plaintiffs who answered none to the diagnosis interrogatory.the district court explained that it would not consider plaintiffs affidavits that disputed their prior sworn answers and accordingly created a material issue of fact after defendants motion for summary judgment.further,the district court found that claims for medical monitoring and fear of cancer are not causes of action under new york law.the district court ordered defendants to identify the specific plaintiffs affected by the july order.
in an order dated august,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims identified by the defendants for the reasons set forth in the july order.
plaintiffs appeal the july and august orders.
discussion 
we address first the district court grant of summary judgment against the plaintiffs who answered none to the diagnosis interrogatory and second the district court dismissal of the claims for failure to prosecute.
summary judgment 
applicable law 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the parties and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.see mullins city of new york,cir.
summary judgment may be granted only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.sec.ins.of hartford old dominion freight line,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the opposing party,summary judgment is improper.id.at.in other words,for defendants to succeed on summary judgment they must establish that plaintiffs are unable to prove at least one of the essential elements of their claims.rubens mason,cir quoting crawford mcbride,dep t.
to establish their claims,plaintiffs must show that they were injured by defendants conduct.specifically,to establish a prima facie case of negligence under new york law,a plaintiff must show the existence of a duty on defendant part as to plaintiff a breach of this duty,and injury to the plaintiff as a result thereof.caronia philip morris usa,cir quoting akins glens falls city sch.codifying common law negligence,new york labor law provides for a general duty to protect the health and safety of employees.see,haider davis,dep t.
under new york labor law,which applies to construction,excavation,and demolition work,contractors and owners and their agents are required,among other things,to provide reasonable and adequate protection and safety to their employees,according to such rules as the commissioner of labor may prescribe.lab.a defendant is liable under if the defendant violated a safety regulation that set forth a specific standard of conduct,and the violation was the proximate cause of plaintiff injuries.wilson city of new york,cir.
application 
in granting summary judgment based solely on plaintiffs response of none to the interrogatory,the district court erred.while we appreciate that the sheer number of cases before the district court made its task of managing this mass tort litigation extraordinarily difficult,the district court was obliged to individually consider each plaintiff answer of none in the context of any other evidence of injury.
the use of the word diagnosed in the interrogatory created some ambiguity.it was possible that a plaintiff manifested symptoms of a condition,illness,or disease that had not yet been diagnosed when he answered the interrogatory.indeed,claims arising from exposure to toxic or harmful substances often present nuanced and questions as to whether and when a legally cognizable injury exists.
for example,under new york law,a cause of action accrues in the toxic tort context when a plaintiff discovers an injury or when through the exercise of reasonable diligence such injury should have been discovered by the plaintiff,whichever is earlier.c.in in re new york county des litigation,the new york court of appeals considered whether a plaintiff action for reproductive injuries resulting from her mother exposure to diethylstilbestrol des was.finding tha
