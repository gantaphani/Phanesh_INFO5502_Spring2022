mark baisch appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york william wall,magistrate judge,granting the motion for summary judgment by frank gallina and insurance agency,on the grounds that baisch did not have standing under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,to bring his claims against any of the defendants,and declining to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over baisch state law claims.
background 
a.the racketeering scheme 
baisch is in the business of providing construction services,including extending financing to other construction firms.the rubinos are father and son contractors who operated raycon construction company.gallina is a shareholder,broker,and of insurance agency,which provides or brokers insurance.gallina and rubino,were friends who were in regular contact.because we are reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment against baisch,the following facts are presented in a light most favorable to baisch.
according to baisch,the defendants defrauded him,as well as nassau county and unnamed insurance companies,by falsifying construction documents,payroll forms,and other documents.starting in,nassau county hired raycon for various construction projects.one of the terms of their contract was that the workers on the projects could not be independent contractors,but had to be employed by raycon.the contract also required raycon to post performance bonds and to provide the county periodically with proof of workers compensation,disability,and general public liability insurance.raycon had to provide the county with estimates of the number and type of workers needed for each project,along with the number of hours to be worked and the hourly rate per worker.baisch claims that the defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity by causing raycon to submit to nassau county fraudulent documents,including inflated estimates and falsified claim vouchers.baisch alleges that by gallina and,who were providing insurance brokerage services to raycon,knew that the rubinos were engaged in racketeering activity.gallina and helped the rubinos and raycon obtain the insurance policies and performance bonds to enable them to continue their racketeering activities,provided them with false certificates of insurance,and fraudulently obtained replacement policies when raycon policies were cancelled for nonpayment.gallina and also prepared false information to be used by the workers compensation and disability insurance carriers in their payroll audits of raycon in order to reduce raycon premiums.
in april,baisch alleges that gallina asked him if he would provide a commercial loan to raycon and the rubinos,whom gallina represented as reliable and creditworthy.baisch claims that he relied on gallina representations when he made his first loan to the rubinos that year and thereafter continued lending them money until july.the rubinos allegedly used those funds to support their fraudulent activity.
in february,after baisch had checked raycon credit,baisch and rubino,entered into a factoring agreement,under which baisch would loan money to raycon approximately equal to the amount of raycon claim vouchers submitted to nassau county.then baisch would collect on each loan when nassau county paid raycon for its claimed work.baisch alleges that gallina urged him to enter the factoring agreement and reiterated earlier misrepresentations of raycon and the rubinos financial reliability.gallina conceded that he arranged for the loan from baisch to raycon so that he could procure the necessary bond for raycon,because raycon lacked the funds needed for collateral.
baisch argues that the rubinos used the factoring agreement to continue the racketeering activities.under the factoring agreement,the rubinos submitted vouchers to baisch between february and may,upon which baisch advanced to raycon more than.baisch alleges that the vouchers were fraudulent and that some of the vouchers were never even submitted to nassau county,leading baisch to provide loans that,under the terms of the factoring agreement,could not be repaid.the rubinos failed to repay ten loans from baisch and only partially repaid four more,leaving unpaid.in august,at a meeting with baisch and baisch attorney,rubino,admitted to baisch that he had submitted false invoices to him in order to obtain the needed loans.rubino,later that month signed a confession of judgment in favor of baisch in the amount of.
supporting his allegation that gallina and knew of rubino fraudulent activities,and hence were racketeering,baisch offers statements by gallina from a videotape surreptitiously recorded in march,about a year after the rubinos began defaulting on his loans and several months after the authorities started investigating raycon fraud schemes.gallina does not deny that he made these statements.rather,gallina argues that his later depositions,in which he denied knowledge of the fraud,are more credible than the recordings.he also does not argue that the videotape should be inadmissible in this civil proceeding.
in the videotape,gallina states 
you know the situation over there and the time sheets that rubino was submitting with phony names on it.he was getting them signed off when he did have any people there rubino has been engaged in these practices for t en years at least that i know of i t been going on forever.he was paying off everybody that he could.
see,i thought it was a matter of okay,he gets these phony time sheets.guys sign off on it.he pays these guys a few bucks for signing off on it.but it must have gone a lot deeper than that for the fbi to come in.
as further evidence of gallina knowledge,baisch offers records of raycon ten cancelled insurance policies from to and internal memos referring to rubino terrible payment history back to.baisch also refers to gallina recorded statements on the videotape stating that he provided insurance certificates to nassau county when he knew that raycon did not have insurance,and to gallina awareness that raycon insurers repeatedly cancelled raycon insurance.nevertheless,gallina continued to seek insurance for raycon and falsely stated on raycon insurance applications in and that raycon insurance had not been cancelled.
in june,rubino,filed a bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of new york,and in october,a discharge was granted.also in october,rubino,was arrested and charged with defrauding nassau county.
b.the district court decision 
baisch commenced this action in august.his amended complaint alleges violations of c and d of rico,as well as violations of state common law.gallina and moved for summary judgment.the motion was heard by a magistrate judge sitting as the district court upon the consent of parties,c,and the district court determined that baisch lacked statutory standing to bring his claims against the defendants under rico.baisch gallina,civ,at august.the district court applied the test to determine whether apart from the directness of the injury,the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be benefitted by the provision at issue.id.at quoting holmes sec.investor prot,d scalia,concurring.
the district court concluded that the factoring agreement and the relationship between baisch,the rubinos,and gallina was too distinct from the overall county scheme to be part of it for the purpose of rico liability and that t here is no evidence to suggest that the intent of the opposed to the factoring to defraud baisch.id.at.relying on its reading of our decision in abrahams young rubicam,cir,the district court concluded that baisch lacked standing on two independent grounds.first,in order for a plaintiff to have standing in rico zone of interests,he must be the target of the racketeering enterprise.id.quoting abrahams,at.the district court concluded that nassau county,not baisch,was the target of the racketeering enterprise.second,the plaintiff injury must flow from the harms that the predicate acts were intended to cause and the laws against them were intended to prevent.id.quoting abrahams,at.the district court found that baisch injury was the result of the rubinos failure to repay him,not the result of the alleged rico enterprise or its predicate acts.id.at.the district court characterized baisch claims as a creative effort to stretch common law fraud into a rico claim.id.at.the district court declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over baisch state law claims,and also found an independent ground for dismissing the claims against rubino,because the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of new york had discharged rubino,debts.id.at.baisch has appealed from the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c,and the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.see celotex catrett,d.when ruling on a summary judgment motion,a court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
rico standing and the test 
baisch argues on appeal that he does have standing to assert his rico claims against the defendants.section c of rico provides that it is unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in interstate or foreign commerce to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity section d provides that it is unlawful for any person to conspire to violate subsection c.section c provides that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section shall recover threefold the damages he sustains.
the supreme court has advised that rico is to be read broadly.this is the lesson not only of congress expansive language and overall approach,but also of its express admonition that rico is to be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.sedima,imrex,d citations and quotation marks omitted.
we recently clarified our approach to rico standing in lerner fleet bank,cir.we need not repeat lerner thorough analysis,but we will review its main points.to demonstrate standing,a plaintiff must plead,at a minimum,the defendant violation of,an injury to the plaintiff business or property,and causation of the injury by the defendant violation.this third requirement is satisfied if the defendant injurious conduct is both the factual and the proximate cause of the injury alleged.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the lerner court then turned to the question of whether to apply separately the statutory standing or test,which seeks to determine whether,apart from the directness of the injury,the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be benefitted by the provision at issue.holmes,at.scalia,concurring.in,the supreme court majority could have addressed this issue in holmes,but thought it was inopportune to resolve the issue at that time,and instead resolved the standing question solely on proximate causation grounds.id.at.in his concurrence,justice scalia argued that a plaintiff has standing under rico only if he or she fulfills the traditional elements of statutory standing of the predicate statutes on which the rico claim is based.holmes,at.scalia,concurring.two of those requirements are proximate causation and the test.id.justice,joined by justices white and stevens,rejected justice scalia approach,concluding that rico does not incorporate the standing requirements of the predicate acts.id.at,concurring.we followed holmes by resolving the standing issue on proximate cause grounds in powers british vita,cir,and later we noted that it is unclear precisely how this test would apply under the complex structure of the rico statute.lerner,at.in lerner,we concluded that if the standing issue may be resolved on proximate cause grounds,the question whether the plaintiff must also satisfy the standing requirements of the underlying statutes whose violations constitute the predicate acts need not be reached.id.at.
nevertheless,we have incorporated the language of the test into our analysis of rico standing.in abrahams,we held that a rico plaintiff must show both that he is within the class the statute sought to protect and that the harm done was one that the statute was meant to prevent.at.in lerner,we noted that abrahams 
used the language of,rather than proximate cause,to discuss standing requirements under the rico statute.yet in so doing,we were not importing an additional standing requirement we merely sought to apply the same standing test endorsed by the holmes court under a more precise terminology.our fear was that use of the proximate cause language in discussions of statutory standing could lead to confusion with its counterpart.as abrahams recognized,however,rico proximate causation is a distinct that sometimes overlaps with analysis.both of these statutory standing principles are grounded on similar policy considerations,imposing limitations on the types of injuries that are sufficiently related to core rico concerns as to be cognizable.thus,the reasonably foreseeable victim of a rico enterprise will often be,unsurprisingly,the type of victim the rico statute seeks to protect.
at.thus,statutory standing is included in our proximate cause analysis.two other circuits have applied the test independently from the proximate cause analysis.see newton tyson foods,cir israel travel advisory,israel identity tours,cir.we have no quarrel with that approach,but because our rico proximate cause analysis adequately incorporates the test concerns in most cases,we have never applied that test independently from our rico proximate cause analysis.we now clarify that it is inappropriate to apply a test independent of this circuit proximate cause analysis.
proximate cause 
lerner test for proximate causation is as follows.first,the plaintiff injury must have been proximately caused by a pattern of racketeering activity violating or by individual rico predicate acts.at quoting hecht commerce clearing house,cir.in other words,a plaintiff does not have standing if he suffered an injury that was indirectly and hence not proximately caused by the racketeering activity or rico predicate acts,even though the injury was proximately caused by some violations committed by the defendants.in lerner,the plaintiff injuries were proximately caused not by the racketeering activity itself,but by the defendant violation of state reporting requirements,which were not rico predicate acts under.thus the plaintiffs lacked standing.id.at.
second,the plaintiff must have suffered a direct injury that was foreseeable central to the notion of proximate cause under rico is the idea that a person is not liable to all those who may have been injured by his conduct,but only to those with respect to whom his acts were a substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation,and whose injury was reasonably foreseeable or anticipated as a natural consequence.lerner,at quoting first nationwide bank gelt funding,cir.as an elaboration of this second prong relating to the directness of the injury,lerner noted that the reasonably foreseeable victims of a rico violation are the targets,competitors and intended victims of the racketeering enterprise.id.at.as the holmes court explained in its opening discussion of proximate cause and direct injury,a plaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.at.
applying lerner first part of the test,we find that baisch injury was directly caused by the rubinos fraudulent factoring agreement.to determine if baisch has rico standing,we first ask if baisch injury was proximately caused by a pattern of racketeering activity violating or by individual rico predicate acts.mail fraud under is listed as racketeering activity in rico,b,and baisch has sufficiently alleged that the defendants racketeering pattern of mail fraud proximately caused his injur
