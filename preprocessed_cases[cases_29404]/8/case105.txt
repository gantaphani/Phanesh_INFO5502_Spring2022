in this qui tam action,the district court dismissed the claims of the relator,robert gadbois,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.while his appeal of that order was pending,subsequent events coalesced to dissolve the jurisdictional impediment to the relator action.he responded to this development by broadening his appeal to include the possibility of supplementing his pleadings.we conclude,as a matter of first impression in this court,that federal rule of civil procedure d is available to cure most kinds of defects in subject matter jurisdiction.for prudential reasons,however,we decline to order such supplementation here but,rather,vacate the judgment below to allow the district court to consider the relator request for supplementation under rule d.
background 
the relator formerly worked as a pharmacist for pharmerica pharmerica.in november of,he filed this qui tam action under seal in the district of rhode island.his complaint alleged that pharmerica had committed numerous infractions related to its distribution of prescription drugs to care facilities in violation of the false claims act fca,and several parallel state statutes.the relator filed an amended complaint as of right in may of.more than two years elapsed before the united states elected not to intervene in the case.in short order,the affected states took a similar stance.
the pleadings were unsealed and,in february of,the relator filed a second amended complaint with leave of court.in due course,pharmerica moved to dismiss,asserting both lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see.b.pharmerica contended,inter alia,that the district court lacked jurisdiction by virtue of the fca bar,which provides that if an action involving the same subject matter is already pending,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.b.in support of this contention,pharmerica highlighted similarities between the relator action and an action that was pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin.
the district court,addressing only pharmerica request for dismissal under rule b and the bar,laid the allegations contained in the relator second amended complaint alongside the allegations contained in the wisconsin pleadings.it concluded that the two actions were based on substantially the same facts and conduct.see united states ex rel.gadbois pharmerica,slip op.at,unpublished.consequently,the court citing the bar dismissed the relator fca claim for want of subject matter jurisdiction.see id.at.it then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the relator claims and dismissed those claims as well.see id.
the relator timely appealed.during the course of briefing,the tectonic plates shifted.first,the supreme court handed down its decision in kellogg brown root services,united states ex rel.carter,which construed the phrase pending action as used in b.the court held that,under the wording of the statute,an earlier suit bars a later suit while the earlier suit remains undecided but ceases to bar that suit once it is dismissed.id.at.accordingly,the dismissal of a section b claim ordinarily should be without prejudice,because the claim could be refiled once the action is no longer pending.see id.at.
less than a month after the court decided carter,a second development occurred the wisconsin action was settled and dismissed.by then,the relator appeal was already partially briefed.positing that these two developments the carter decision and the dismissal of the wisconsin action had significantly affected his case,the relator,in his reply brief and by a separate motion to remand,sought to reformulate his complaint on the fly.he requested,in the alternative,that we either deem his complaint supplemented with the additional fact that the wisconsin action was no longer pending or remand to the district court with instructions to permit him to supplement his complaint under rule d.in an opposition to the relator remand motion and at oral argument,pharmerica argued that neither of these alternatives was appropriate.
ii.analysis 
the peculiar posture of this case makes it advisable for us to consider the relator procedural arguments first.if the relator second amended complaint is a legitimate candidate for supplementation,that would obviate any need to address the degree of similarity between that complaint and the pleadings in the wisconsin action.thus,our starting point is the relator request for relief under rule d.
rule d affords litigants a pathway for pleading any transaction,occurrence,or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.the rule shares the core objective of the civil rules to make pleadings a means to achieve an orderly and fair administration of justice.griffin cty.sch,see.rule d facilitates this objective by promot ing as complete an adjudication of the dispute between the parties as is possible.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed see lasalvia united dairymen of,cir.by the same token,the rule helps courts and litigants to avoid pointless formality although causes of action accruing after the institution of a lawsuit usually can be filed as separate actions,supplementation under rule d is often a more efficient mechanism for litigating such claims.see predator int l,gamo outdoor usa,cir.it follows that supplementation of pleadings is encouraged when doing so will promote the economic and speedy disposition of the entire controversy between the parties,will not cause undue delay or trial inconvenience,and will not prejudice the rights of any of the other parties to the action.wright et,federal practice and procedure,at.
pharmerica acknowledges these principles but insists that they are trumped in this instance by the venerable rule that j urisdiction is determined based on whether it existed at the time the plaintiff filed the original complaint.united states ex rel.estate of cunningham millennium labs.of,cir.noting that we have described the bar as jurisdictional,see,united states ex rel.wilson bristol myers squibb,cir,pharmerica suggests that the fact that the relator claim was barred when brought prevents him from using rule d to cure the jurisdictional defect.this suggestion is bolstered,pharmerica says,by the fca itself,which provides that no one can bring an action based on the same facts as those undergirding a pending action.b.
after careful consideration,we find pharmerica position untenable.we explain briefly.
rule d prescribes that t he court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense.this sentence was added to the rule in.it was designed to combat the rigid and formalistic view that where the original complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,leave to serve a supplemental complaint must be denied.d advisory committee note to amendment.the new language was designed to ensure that the amended rule would give the court broad discretion in allowing a supplemental pleading so that plaintiffs would not be needlessly remitted to the difficulties of commencing a new action even though events occurring after the commencement of the original action have made clear the right to relief.id.
in keeping with this spirit of flexibility,courts generally have read rule d to include defects in subject matter jurisdiction among the deficiencies that may be corrected through a supplemental pleading.the supreme court has signaled its approval of this praxis.see mathews diaz,recognizing that plaintiff had not satisfied a nonwaivable condition of jurisdiction before filing suit,but noting that plaintiff had subsequently satisfied the condition so a supplemental complaint in the district court would have eliminated this jurisdictional issue.the decision in mathews plainly implies that subject matter jurisdiction falls within the cluster of defects that may be cured by a supplemental pleading under rule d.
our sister circuits have not hesitated to make this implication explicit.see,prasco,llc m
