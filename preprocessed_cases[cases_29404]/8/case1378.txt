by her mother and natural guardian paquita castillo,brought this medical malpractice action under the federal tort claims act ftca.the merits of that claim are not before us instead,we must determine whether it is forever barred by the ftca limitations period.see b.
we find that claim accrued no later than february,when castillo consulted an attorney,diligently acting on information received in december,when an early intervention counselor informed her that the injury sustained at birth might have been iatrogenic that is,caused by her doctor and told castillo that she should consider consulting an attorney.the law firm she selected,unfortunately,did not share her diligence.rather than presenting claim to the department of health and human services dhhs within two years of either castillo december conversation with the early intervention counselor or the initial consultation in february,the firm waited until april.that delay made the filing untimely by between two and four months.moreover,the firm dilatory response prevents equitable tolling assuming arguendo that such tolling may be applied in medical malpractice actions brought under the ftca from saving otherwise untimely complaint.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court naomi buchwald,dismissing the complaint as untimely.
background 
wilfred castillo served as castillo regular obstetrician at a prenatal clinic run by urban health plan,uhp,a federally funded healthcare provider serving the south bronx when it came time for castillo to give birth,castillo suggested that she do so at bronx lebanon hospital center,and castillo agreed.on february,castillo delivered 
according to the amended complaint,was born with weakness in her left arm and left leg.in part because of that debility,she was referred to an early intervention counselor who monitored her ongoing care.castillo met with counselor in december.after reviewing some of medical records,the counselor raised the possibility that injury had been caused by medical malpractice and told castillo that she should consider looking into whether or not there was any medical malpractice relating to her daughter birth.
shortly thereafter,castillo saw a television advertisement for fitzgerald fitzgerald,fitzgerald fitzgerald or the firm.according to castillo,that advertisement discussed children with the same type of injuries as,and indicated that such injuries might be caused by medical malpractice during the birthing process.castillo contacted the firm in february and discussed with a paralegal the nature and potential cause of her daughter injury.that consultation led to a retainer agreement,which the parties signed on april.according to the firm,by august of that year it had determined that injuries were caused by medical malpractice during labor and delivery.nevertheless,it did not present claim to dhhs at that time.
on november,castillo attorneys met and discussed her case,but still no action was taken.at a second meeting held in march,the firm initiated a full review of the medical records.after concluding that review,the firm held a third meeting in early december,at which it was decided that the appropriate next step was to file suit.
although the firm decided to bring this action,it evidently had not investigated whom or where to sue.more precisely,the firm appears not to have known that uhp was a federally funded clinic or that castillo was acting as a federal employee during the delivery.see g a.it was therefore unaware that the united states was legally responsible for the care that castillo provided,see id.g n,or that medical malpractice claim had to be preceded by the filing of an administrative claim with dhhs,see b.
the firm belatedly realized this important fact almost by accident.on or just before february,fitzgerald fitzgerald attorney ann chase learned from a colleague that a doctor in an unrelated case had been deemed a federal employee.this prompted chase to inquire into castillo status.she placed a call to a government hotline ftca help established for the very purpose of facilitating such inquiries and discovered that uhp was covered by the ftca.she therefore correctly presumed that castillo might be deemed a federal employee.approximately one month later,on april,the firm presented claim to dhhs.a contemporaneous memorandum circulated among attorneys reveals that the firm recognized the untimeliness of that claim form and intended to ask for permission to file beyond two years.
during the pendency of administrative claim,the firm filed a summons and complaint in state court against castillo and bronx lebanon hospital center.on november,the government removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york,substituted itself for castillo,see d,and moved to dismiss the complaint,alleging that had failed to file her administrative claim within the applicable limitations period,id.b.
the district court found that claim accrued in december when the early intervention counselor encouraged castillo to seek legal advice.ex rel.castillo united states,d.it therefore determined that claim,having accrued more than two years before its april,presentation to dhhs,was untimely.id.at.the district court went on to reject the application of equitable tolling and ultimately granted the government motion to dismiss.id.this appeal followed.
discussion 
date of accrual 
on appeal,argues that the district court erred in finding that her claim accrued at the time of castillo conversation with the early intervention counselor.according to,castillo could not have reasonably believed that her daughter injuries were iatrogenic until her own medical records and her daughter had been analyzed by experts.she therefore submits that her claim did not accrue until july,once fitzgerald fitzgerald received her medical records.alternatively,submits that her claim accrued no earlier than april,the date on which castillo retained counsel.we disagree.
federal law determines the date that an ftca claim accrues.syms olin,cir accord tyminski united states,cir collecting cases.typically,ftca medical malpractice claims accrue at the time of injury.kronisch united states,cir see also barrett united states,cir it has generally been held that under the ftca a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiff injury.however,where a plaintiff would reasonably have had difficulty discerning the fact or cause of injury at the time it was inflicted,the rule of accrual applies.kronisch,at see also valdez ex rel.donely united states,cir.
the rule sets the accrual date at the time when,with reasonable diligence,the plaintiff has or should have discovered the critical facts of both his injury and its cause.barrett,at,citing united states kubrick.this is not an exacting requirement.kronisch,at.a claim will accrue when the plaintiff knows,or should know,enough to protect himself by seeking legal advice.id.internal quotation marks omitted.once an injured party or in this case her guardian knows enough to warrant consultation with counsel,and acts with diligence as did castillo to undertake such consultation,conscientious counsel will have ample time to protect the client interest by investigating the case and determining whether,when,where,and against whom to bring suit.the rule protects plaintiffs who are either experiencing the latent effects of a previously unknown injury or struggling to uncover the underlying cause of their injuries from having their claims before they could reasonably be expected to bring suit at the same time,the rule avoids unduly extending the limitations period for those who could have timely presented their claim to dhhs had they acted diligently in protecting their interests.
we review de novo the district court determination that claim is barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.because the government does not challenge the district court application of the rule of accrual to claim,we must determine when castillo knew enough about the critical facts of injury and its cause to trigger the limitations period.see id.at.
the critical facts of injury were readily discernable shortly after her february,birth.by june,erb palsy had been identified as the cause of the weakness in her left arm and left leg.castillo was well aware of that diagnosis,and it is that injury which forms the basis of this action.see,d at despite the sweeping allegations contained in the amended complaint,plaintiff counsel explained at oral argument that the plaintiff injuries were principally limited to problems with the nerves in her shoulders.castillo was therefore aware of the critical facts of her daughter injury no later than june,well before the december accrual date found by the district court.
since castillo knew the critical facts of her daughter injury at or near the time of her birth,any claim related to that injury accrued once castillo had reason to suspect that injury was iatrogenic kronisch,at.the government submits that castillo had such knowledge when the early intervention counselor raised the possibility of medical malpractice and encouraged her to seek legal advice.disagrees,insisting that castillo could not have suspected that the injury was iatrogenic until she retained counsel,which then received and reviewed the relevant medical records.our decision in valdez,goes a long way toward resolving that dispute in favor of the government.
like the case now before us,valdez dealt with allegations of medical malpractice.elon valdez and her mother,tiffany donely,alleged that their doctor negligence caused elon to suffer severe brain damage shortly after her december,birth.at.although elon injury was immediately evident,donely waited until june,to file suit id.at.the question on appeal was whether the claim accrued before june.id.at.we therefore had to determine when donely discovered or with reasonable diligence should have discovered the potential iatrogenic cause of elon injury.id.at.
the record demonstrated that donely had no reason to believe that there was a potential cause of her daughter injury before elon was discharged from the hospital on march.id.at.it also showed that on february,donely retained counsel,thereby demonstrating sufficient knowledge of the possible iatrogenic cause of the injury to seek legal assistance.id.at.however,the record did not reveal what transpired during the eleven months between elon discharge and donely retention of counsel.the record was therefore silent with respect to the circumstances that led donely to seek legal assistance,and it did not indicate how long she had delayed in seeking legal advice after she had reason to suspect that the cause of elon injury was related to her medical treatment.id.we were therefore unable to pinpoint the date on which the claim accrued.
the key to resolving the dispute now before us,however,is not the specific date of accrual in valdez,but rather our refusal to find that elon claim could not have accrued until donely retained counsel.instead of resolving the case in that manner,we remanded for a determination of what prompted donely to seek representation.id.at.we therefore implicitly held that medical malpractice claims brought under the ftca can,and often will,accrue before a plaintiff actually retains counsel and before counsel requests,let alone receives,the relevant medical records.otherwise,donely claim filed within two years of the date that she retained counsel would have been timely,and there would have been no need for remand to determine the date of accrual.
that a medical malpractice claim will often accrue before counsel is retained makes perfect sense.an accrual date that turns on when a plaintiff or his lawyers finally decides to take action,rather than when the plaintiff was sufficiently alerted to the appropriateness of seeking legal advice,would render the limitations period meaningless.under proposed rule,a plaintiff sufficiently alerted who fails to seek counsel or who retains counsel too complacent to promptly research his claim would,by virtue of that inaction,be saved from the burden that congress placed on ftca plaintiffs in enacting b.moreover,since section b was designed in part to keep courts from having to deal with cases in which the search for truth may be seriously impaired by the passage of time,kubrick,at,such a result would undermine the statutory scheme by unduly and unpredictably lengthening the limitations period.as we said in kronisch,a claim accrues when the plaintiff knows,or should know,enough to protect himself by seeking legal advice.at internal quotation marks omitted.transparently,an injured party can know enough to consult counsel before she actually does so let alone before counsel has fully investigated the case or agreed to be retained.we therefore easily reject argument that her claim could not have accrued until her retained counsel had access to the relevant medical records,a step far beyond an initial consultation.
instead of mechanically setting the date of accrual to coincide with the retention of counsel,the receipt of medical records,or any other event in the litigation process,valdez requires that we determine when castillo was told of or had reason to suspect that the injury suffered related in some way to the medical treatment s he received.at.that is the date by which castillo had sufficient knowledge to protect by seeking legal advice,and it is therefore the date on which claim accrued.see id.at kronisch,at.
there is a strong argument that castillo december conversation with the early intervention counselor provided castillo with the requisite reason to suspect that injury was related in some way to the medical treatment that she received.valdez,at.by then,castillo knew that her daughter was injured at or around the time of her birth.she had also consulted with an early intervention counselor whose job it was to ensure that received the care that her injury required.after sharing some of medical records with that counselor,castillo was informed that injury may have resulted from medical malpractice.at that point,castillo had at least some reason to suspect that injury was related in some way to the treatment that she had received.indeed,the fact that castillo translated that belief into action by contacting fitzgerald fitzgerald in late february and provided the firm with a lot of information about her pregnancy and birth and current condition suggests that the advice from the early intervention counselor was precisely of the sort that would cause a reasonable person to seek to protect himself by seeking legal advice.kronisch at internal quotation marks omitted 
not every conversation related to the nature of an injury,or the possibility of a plausible claim of medical malpractice related to that injury,will trigger the accrual date.the key,again,is identifying the time by which the plaintiff is told of or had reason to suspect that the injury suffered related in some way to the medical treatment received.valdez,at.the record contains few details of castillo conversation with the counselor castillo says only that the counselor told her that she might consider consulting an attorney.without a more complete account of the conversation,we are reluctant to conclude definitively,as did the district court,that the conversation itself was sufficient to put castillo on notice that she should take action to protect her rights.
we need not decide,however,whether the conversation alone was sufficient to trigger accrual of the cause of action,because it is beyond question that castillo was sufficiently on notice by the time she first consulted counsel in february.by that time,castillo had received information from the counselor,had had ample time to absorb the counselor suggestion,and had noticed the law firm advertisement that discussed injuries similar to and indicated that such injuries might be caused by medical malpractice during the birthing process.on this combination of facts,a reasonable person was surely in a position to understand that it would make sense to inquire into the possibility that the injury was iatrogenic.and indeed castillo herself drew exactly that conclusion.thus,the statute of limitations began to run at least as of the time castillo actually undertook to consult counsel about the possibility of a mal
