hugo cruz appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york paul crotty,judge,dismissing his amended complaint.on appeal,cruz argues that the amended complaint allegations that fxdirectdealer,llc fxdd engaged in dishonest and deceptive practices in managing its online foreign exchange trading platform are sufficient to state a claim for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c,and new york general business law h and,and also for breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court dismissal of cruz rico claim and his claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but we vacate the judgment of the district court with respect to cruz new york general business law and breach of contract claims.
background 
the amended complaint alleges the following facts,which we assume to be true and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see ashcroft iqbal,d litwin blackstone,cir.
headquartered in new york city,fxdd provides online foreign currency exchange forex trading and related services to its customers.the forex market operates outside of a regulated exchange and without a central marketplace.retail brokers such as fxdd help provide individual investors with access to the market and often operate online.as market makers,they create their own market and set the prices they offer to their customers.in addition to facilitating trading by customers,fxdd buys and sells currency for its own account,and may act as a counterparty in customer transactions.
to open an account with fxdd and trade on its online forex platforms,customers must sign the fxdd customer agreement the agreement.the agreement warns that,due to market conditions or other circumstances,fxdd may be unable to execute a customer order at the market or specified level and the customer agrees that fxdd will bear no liability for failure to execute such orders.the agreement also provides,however,that all market orders and orders are accepted by fxdd and undertaken on a basis,and when fxdd is unable to execute an order at the market or specified level,orders will be executed on a basis italics in original.in addition,the agreement states,fxdd makes no warranty expressed or implied that bid and ask prices shown represent prevailing bid and ask prices in the interbank market.
several of fxdd promotional,marketing,and advertising materials have represented fxdd trading practices without disclosing the actual risks of participating in fxdd forex market.for example,one advertisement on fxdd website stated that fxdd does not trade against their clients,but facilitates trade via transparent real time pricing,while a advertisement represented that m arket orders are filled instantaneously at the rate you request,with no manual dealer intervention or slippage.
contrary to the representations in these materials and the agreement,fxdd engages in several undisclosed practices that the amended complaint characterizes as dishonest or deceptive,including rerouting profitable customer trading activity to a slow server,which delays trades and allows fxdd to hijack customer profits by buying and selling in the time between a customer order and trade execution refusing to execute profitable customer trade orders by generating false error messages creating false price spikes to trigger a customer stop order for a given trade and manipulating prices so that the change in price between the time the price is quoted and a market order is placed generally favors fxdd over its customers.fxdd undertakes these practices both manually and through automated functions.
cruz,a virginia resident,is a former fxdd customer who signed the agreement in and lost during two years of trading on the fxdd platform.cruz seeks to represent a proposed class of persons in the united states who,from january,to the present,contracted with fxdd to trade on its trading platforms and whose accounts were subject to fxdd allegedly dishonest trade practices.
the district court granted fxdd motion to dismiss the amended complaint in toto.with respect to the rico count,the court concluded that the amended complaint failed to allege predicate acts of mail and wire fraud with the particularity required by rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure because it did not explain why the agreement and marketing materials were misleading.the district court also determined that the complaint failed to allege a rico enterprise distinct from both the alleged pattern of racketeering activity and the rico person who engaged in deceptive conduct.as for the new york general business law claims,the court found that cruz lacked statutory standing because he lived in virginia and had not alleged that fxdd dishonest practices occurred,or that his trades were executed,in new york.separately,the district court dismissed cruz breach of contract claim on the grounds that the agreement disclosed all the relevant risks of using fxdd platform and that fxdd had qualified its obligation to use to execute orders by warning that it might be unable to do so.finally,the district court dismissed the remaining breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim as largely redundant of the breach of contract claim.
discussion 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b de novo.operating local annuity trust fund smith barney fund mgmt.llc,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal,at quotation marks omitted.
civil rico claim 
to establish a rico claim,a plaintiff must show a violation of the rico statute,an injury to business or property and that the injury was caused by the violation of section.defalco bernas,cir quotation marks omitted.to establish a violation of c,in turn,a plaintiff must show that a person engaged in conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.id.at quotation marks omitted.
u nder the distinctness requirement,a plaintiff must allege the existence of two distinct entities a person and an enterprise that is not simply the same person referred to by a different name.city of new york smokes,cir quoting cedric kushner promotions,king,d,rev on other grounds sub nom.hemi,llc city of new york,d.as we have long recognized,the plain language and purpose of the statute contemplate that a person violates the statute by conducting an enterprise through a pattern of criminality.it thus follows that a corporate person can not violate the statute by corrupting itself.see bennett trust of new york,cir.a person is defined as any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property,id.at quoting,while an enterprise is defined as any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other legal entity,and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity,id.quoting.f or an association of individuals to constitute an enterprise,the individuals must share a common purpose to engage in a particular fraudulent course of conduct and work together to achieve such purposes.first capital asset,satinwood,cir quotation marks omitted.
we agree with the district court that cruz rico claim fails because the amended complaint does not allege a continuing rico enterprise distinct from the rico person.accordingly,we do not address whether the amended complaint pleaded mail and wire fraud as predicate acts of racketeering activity with sufficient or pleaded a rico enterprise distinct from the alleged pattern of racketeering activity.
the amended complaint alleges that fxdd is a rico person that conducts the deceptive practices of an association of individuals dubbed the fxdd fraud enterprise.the fxdd fraud enterprise is alleged to consist of the following fxdd itself tradition north america tradition,fxdd parent company advanced technologies group,atg,a former equity stakeholder in fxdd fxdd chief operating officer fxdd managing director and corporate counsel software companies that develop and sell fxdd software software companies and programmers who assisted fxdd in the development of its trading platforms and introducing brokers who receive commissions from fxdd for educating consumers about forex trading.
the amended complaint alleges merely that the members of the enterprise associated together for the common purpose of employing the multiple deceptive,abusive and fraudulent acts described in the amended complaint and that t he overarching purpose of the fxdd fraud enterprise is for each of its members to profit from customers opening live accounts with defendant.as an initial matter,the amended complaint contains no specific factual allegation about the intent of atg or of the software companies,and it affirmatively alleges that the introducing brokers generally were unaware of fxdd deceptive practices.thus,atg,the software companies,and the introducing brokers are not plausibly alleged to share a common purpose to engage in a particular fraudulent course of conduct,first capital asset,at quotation marks omitted,and were properly excluded from the alleged rico enterprise.
we turn,then,to the remaining members of the alleged enterprise fxdd,tradition,corporate counsel,and the chief operating officer.the amended complaint alleges that fxdd corporate counsel and its chief operating officer carry on the regular affairs of fxdd,such as financial operations,including the implementation and supervision of deceptive trading practices.we have long since rejected the idea that a rico enterprise may consist merely of a corporate defendant associated with its own employees or agents carrying on the regular affairs of the defendant,riverwoods chappaqua marine midland bank,cir,and we see no reason to revisit that issue here.the requirement of distinctness can not be evaded by alleging that a corporation has violated the statute by conducting an enterprise that consists of itself plus all or some of its officers or employees.
excluding these officers leaves us with tradition and fxdd.we have held that corporations that are legally separate but operate within a unified corporate structure and guided by a single corporate consciousness can not be both the enterprise and the person under c.discon,nynex,cir,vacated on other grounds,d see cullen margiotta,cir a solitary entity can not simultaneously constitute both the rico person whose conduct is prohibited and the entire rico enterprise,but may be one of a number of members of the rico enterprise,overruled on other grounds,agency holding malley duff,d.fxdd and tradition are alleged to operate as part of a single,unified corporate structure and are,as such,not sufficiently distinct to demonstrate the existence of a rico enterprise.finally and obviously,neither tradition nor fxdd standing alone can constitute an enterprise as an association in fact.accordingly,the district court did not err when it concluded that cruz amended complaint failed to allege a rico enterprise distinct from fxdd 
new york general business law claims 
cruz also claims that fxdd allegedly deceptive practices violate sections and of the new york general business law.section prohibits d eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business,trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state and provides a cause of action to any person who has been injured by a violation of the section.bus.law a,h.section prohibits f alse advertising in the conduct of any business,trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state bus.law.the district court held that cruz lacked statutory standing to bring these claims because he failed to plead that the deceptive practices or relevant trading occurred in new york.we conclude that the complaint alleges a sufficient nexus between cruz transactions with fxdd and new york to fall within the territorial reach of these two provisions of the new york general business law.
the new york court of appeals in goshen mutual life insurance company of new york appears to have interpreted the limiting phrase in this state in sections a and to require that the transaction in which the consumer is deceived occur in new york.goshen mut.life ins.of.as we explain below,we recognize that a split of authority has developed subsequent to goshen about the appropriate territorial test to employ under sections and a test on the one hand,or,on the other hand,a test premised on where the victim is deceived,regardless of where the transaction occurs.mindful of that split,and mindful too that the two tests are not mutually exclusive,we think the appropriate test in this case is to focus on the location of the transaction,and in particular the strength of new york connection to the allegedly deceptive transaction,rather than on the residency of the parties.id.at.this accords with goshen admonition that section was not intended to function as a per se bar to plaintiffs claims of deceptive acts leading to transactions within the state.id.
our approach also accords with goshen more generally.in the first of two cases consolidated for review in goshen,a florida resident who purchased an insurance policy through one of the defendant representatives in florida and who paid his premiums in florida nonetheless claimed that the deceptive insurance scheme occurred in new york because the defendant was there.the second consolidated case involved a mix of plaintiffs some new york residents,some not who alleged that bell atlantic had fraudulently advertised its digital subscriber line service on web and print media.the primary connection to new york in both cases was the defendant principal place of business.in each case,however,the new york court of appeals rejected the section claims of the plaintiffs because they had not alleged that the deceptive transactions themselves occurred in new york.id.at.
subsequently,the appellate division,third department asserted that the interests of new york were implicated when the defendant used a new york address to send and receive misleading correspondence related to a telemarketing scheme.people telehublink,dep t.as a result,the court determined that new york state could file a section claim on behalf of victims of the scheme.id.at.more recently,the third department confirmed that general business law requires the deceptive transaction to have occurred in new york.morrissey nextel partners,dep t citing goshen,at.
by contrast,in meachum outdoor world,dep t,the appellate division,second department held that defrauded plaintiffs who had contracted with the defendants in pennsylvania and who acknowledged that much of the defendants fraudulent activity occurred in pennsylvania nevertheless had pleaded a sufficient new york connection to have a valid claim under section.the court pointed out that the defendants allegedly engaged in deceptive conduct in new york because they mailed misleading literature to new york residents.id.at.
as noted above,we recognize that two divergent lines of decisions have developed since goshen regarding the proper territorial analysis under section.the first line of decisions derives from a statement in goshen that to qualify as a prohibited act under the statute,the deception of a consumer must occur in new york.at.those decisions focus on where the deception of the plaintiff occurs and require,for example,that a plaintiff actually view a deceptive statement while in new york.see,kaufman sirius xm radio,app x cir.the second line of cases appears to be premised on the assertion in goshen that the transaction in which the consumer is deceived must occur in new york.at.these cases focus on where the underlying deceptive transaction takes place,regardless of the plaintiff location or where the plaintiff is deceived.see morrissey,at gotlin lederman,app x,cir.although it is a somewhat close call,our reading of goshen and the cases construing it leads us to conclude that a deceptive transaction in new york falls within the territorial reach of section and suffices to give an victim who engaged in the transaction statutory standing to sue under section 
using that measure,the case before u
