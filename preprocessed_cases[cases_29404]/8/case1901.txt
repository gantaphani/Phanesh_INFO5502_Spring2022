we consider here whether a district court may exercise original jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action brought pursuant to the former to void a contract for lack of approval alleged to be required under the indian gaming regulatory act igra,et.answering that question in the negative,we hold that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action and we affirm the dismissal.
background 
on november,appellant regis mohawk tribe tribe entered into a casino management agreement management agreement with appellee president.regis management company president.as required by igra,the management agreement was submitted to the national indian gaming commission nigc or commission for approval.the nigc approved the management agreement on december.under the management agreement,president was authorized,inter alia,to enter into contracts for the construction of the akwesasne mohawk casino casino.on january,president executed a construction contract construction contract with appellee construction company to build the casino for some million dollars.the construction contract was not submitted for nigc approval.
the casino was completed,and its doors opened on april.business was not as brisk as expected in the first year of operation,and the tribe expelled president,bringing in new management several years prior to the expiration of the management agreement.president brought suit for breach of contract in state court,but the action was stayed by stipulation of the parties after the tribe brought this action to declare the construction contract null and void on either of two grounds first,that the construction contract was not approved by the nigc and,second,that an individual named gary melius had surreptitiously maintained a financial interest in the management agreement and the construction contract notwithstanding the nigc indication that it would refuse to approve the management agreement if melius had a financial interest in it.the management agreement at a states that actions between the parties shall be brought in federal district court or,if the federal court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction,in state court.under the agreement,at,the governing law is as follows the laws of the united states of america,and where such laws are or inapplicable,the laws of the state of new york.

on a motion for summary judgment,the district court hurd,held that the construction contract was not a collateral agreement providing for management of all or part of the gaming operation and thus did not require approval by the commission.see united states ex rel.regis mohawk tribe president.regis mgmt,civ,dist.lexis,at june,decision citing,which defines a management contract requiring nigc approval to include any collateral agreement that provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation.leaving aside the issue of the retroactive effect of amendment,the district court held that,which governs contracts with indians,was inapplicable because t here is no question that the construction contract was executed by president and,neither of which is an indian tribe or an individual indian.id.at.the counterclaims against the tribe were dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity.id.at.

discussion 
this appeal presents the question of whether a casino construction contract purported to be collateral to a gaming management agreement may be the subject of an action in the district court outside the parameters of igra.it also presents the question of whether the tribe may bring a declaratory judgment action under to void a casino construction contract to which the tribe was not a party.at the outset,we examine the statutes.
i.the statutes and igra 
congress enacted the precursors to in the early.see act of march,ch,stat.act of may,ch,stat.the statute took its modern form in and was amended in.when the former was in effect,contracts between indians and required approval by the secretary of the interior secretary under the terms of the statute.any contract with an indian or indian tribe that was not approved by the secretary as required by was null and void by the statute express language.section authorized a qui tam action in the name of the united states to recover amounts paid by indians in excess of what was authorized by the secretary.in this bounty hunter action,see united states ex rel.mosay buffalo,cir,the statute prescribed that half of any amount recovered go to the relator and the other half to the united states treasury for the use of the indian or tribe by or for whom it was so paid.
in,congress enacted igra,et,a more detailed statutory framework regulating indian gaming management agreements and contracts collateral to such agreements.igra specifically provides that the authority formerly vested in the secretary of the interior under,approving contracts between indians and,is transferred to the nigc with respect to contracts regulated by igra.see h.under interim authority to regulate gaming,the secretary retained authority over indian gaming until the commission was organized and its regulations promulgated.since,when the igra regulations were promulgated,indian gaming management contracts have been subject to approval by the chairman of the commission.see management contracts.a management contract is defined in the nigc regulations as any contract,subcontract,or collateral agreement between an indian tribe and a contractor or between a contractor and subcontractor if such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation.management contract.a collateral agreement is defined as a contract that is related,either directly or indirectly,to a management contract,or to any rights,duties or obligations created between a tribe and a management contractor or subcontractor collateral agreement.
under of title,gaming management agreements and certain collateral agreements must be submitted to the chairman of the commission for approval a b.if the chairman fails to act on a management contract or collateral agreement submitted for approval within days or days where the time period is extended,an indian tribe may bring an action in district court to compel a decision.a,d.the chairman,after notice and a hearing,may void any contract if he subsequently determines that any of the various procedural or substantive requirements governing management contracts that are contained in have been violated.f.
igra judicial review provision,provides that d ecisions made by the commission pursuant to sections,and of this title shall be final agency decisions for purposes of appeal to the appropriate federal district court pursuant to the administrative procedure act.d a confers original jurisdiction in the federal district courts only for suits under igra in certain limited circumstances not at issue here by the commission regulations,m anagement contracts and changes in persons with a financial interest in or management responsibility for a management contract,that have not been approved by the secretary of the interior or the chairman,are void.void agreements.
both of the contracts at issue in this case were signed after authority over indian gaming had been transferred from the secretary to the commission,see h,but before was amended so as not to apply to the circumstances presented here.this action was commenced after the amendment of and after the commission promulgated its regulations.the parties agree that the management agreement was approved as required under igra but disagree about whether the construction contract required approval.both sides conceded at oral argument that there had been no final agency action with respect to voiding of the construction contract 
ii.igra and exhaustion of administrative remedies 
the tribe commenced this action in as a qui tam action under.it asserted a single claim seeking a declaration that the construction contract is void for lack of contract approval by the commission as required by igra.by predicating its declaratory judgment action on an alleged failure to comply with the regulatory regime set out in igra,the tribe case presents a threshold issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies available through the commission.
as a rule,plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies before seeking redress in federal court.skubel fuoroli,cir citing pavano shalala,cir.t he long settled rule of judicial administration is that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.myers bethlehem shipbuilding.see also ftc standard oil,d judicial intervention into the agency process denies the agency an opportunity to correct its own mistakes and to apply its expertise and leads to piecemeal review which at the least is inefficient and upon completion of the agency process might prove to have been unnecessary.
where administrative remedies are not prescribed by statute,a plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies can be excused if the claim is collateral to a demand for benefits,exhaustion would be futile,or requiring exhaustion would result in irreparable harm.skubel,at citing pavano,at.where administrative remedies are statutory,however,exhaustion of remedies is mandatory,and the exceptions do not apply.see,booth churner,d w e stress the point that we will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where congress has provided otherwise.
here,the statutory exhaustion requirement could not be more plain.section of igra reads,decisions made by the commission pursuant to section of this title shall be final agency decisions for purposes of appeal to the appropriate federal district court pursuant to the administrative procedure act.if the tribe is correct in its contention that the construction contract required approval pursuant to igra,then the administrative remedy available to the tribe would be submission of the construction contract for approval pursuant to b if,upon submission of the contract,the commission took no action within the statutorily prescribed time frame of days or,in the event of an extension,days,then the tribe would be permitted to bring an action in a united states district court to compel action by the chairman d.in the event that the commission ruled against it,the tribe could appeal the commission decision in united states district court as set forth in.similarly,if the tribe wished to void the construction contract on the ground that it was a contract not submitted for approval as required by igra,or in which an individual held an improper interest,then the tribe could request a hearing before the chairman on the matter pursuant to f,after which appeal could be taken pursuant to.all of the above is written in the conditional tense,of course,because the tribe availed itself of none of the administrative remedies,and the court is left to ponder what might have been.by proceeding directly to the district court in an action nowhere authorized under igra,the tribe impermissibly sought a determination outside the administrative review scheme crafted by congress.
igra confers original federal district court jurisdiction only in limited circumstances not presented here.see d a ante.that congress outlined specific circumstances in which district courts have original jurisdiction strongly suggests its intent to channel all other matters through the normal process of judicial review of final agency action under the administrative procedure act apa.see hartman kickapoo tribe gaming comm n,cir gaming comm nigc,d,citing thunder basin coal reich,d.the clear language of igra,permitting appeal to the district court only after administrative exhaustion,dispels any remaining doubt.w e adhere to a frequently stated principle of statutory construction when legislation expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.tamiami partners,miccosukee tribe of indians of,cir quoting passenger of passengers,d second and third alteration in original.
the tribe argues that administrative exhaustion should not be required in this case because igra and its implementing regulations provide no mechanism for the commission to render decisions with respect to contracts that have not been approved,such as the construction contract at issue here.see.this is an unnecessarily narrow reading of the statute and its implementing regulations.taken together,a,f management contracts,collateral agreement,management contract,void agreements,and,demonstrate that the commission has broad power to determine what does and does not require approval.as discussed,supra,the commission final decisions on contract approval matters are subject to review in federal district court under,and a failure to take action on a contract approval matter is subject to an action in district court to compel such action under d.indeed,even where a tribe has not proceeded strictly under igra but has joined the nigc as a party,at least one court has construed the matter as an action to compel and remanded the case to the nigc for a decision.see,hein capitan grande band of diegueno mission indians,cir.as it is,this court,like the district court below,is without jurisdiction to order any form of relief because the tribe failed to comply with the mandatory,statutorily prescribed remedies that must be exhausted before proceeding to the federal courts 
iii.igra supersedes section 
the tribe contends that the construction contract comes within the ambit of igra and required approval pursuant to and.with no statutory provision under igra that would enable the tribe to proceed directly to federal district court,and having failed to exhaust remedies under igra,the tribe attempts to proceed under.likening the amendment of to the retroactive application of a newly passed statute,the district court in the decision held that the unamended qui tam provision of which was in effect at the management c ontract signing but amended prior to commencement of the action governs this action.this conflating of the two statutory schemes was erroneous.
before the statute amendment,the seventh circuit addressed the survival of the former in the era of igra where gaming management and related agreements are concerned 
when section is read in conjunction with the indian gaming regulatory act,two distinct,successive regulatory regimes can be seen.one is administered by the bureau of indian affairs under section,the other by the national indian gaming commission under the indian gaming regulatory act.in the first regime,contracts relating to indian lands,including casino management contracts,must be submitted to the bureau for approval under criteria undefined by statu
