elenilson ortiz franco petitions for review of an order of the bureau of immigration appeals bia,entered august,which affirmed the decision of immigration judge noel ferris ij,denying all relief,including relief on the sole basis that is the subject of this appeal deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat.we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider this petition for review because,when an otherwise removable alien is denied deferral of removal under the cat,our jurisdiction is limited by a c and d to review of colorable constitutional claims and questions of ortiz franco raises none 
ortiz franco,a native and citizen of el salvador,conceded before the ij that he was removable as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,illegally,and as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation and a crime of moral turpitude.his contention is that,if he is returned to el salvador,members of la mara salvatrucha street gang ms would torture and kill him because of information he provided to federal prosecutors in a proffer session.
ortiz franco applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and deferral of removal under the cat.the ij ruled that his witness tampering conviction rendered ortiz franco ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal,and that he did not sustain his burden of demonstrating entitlement to cat relief because he did not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be subject to torture in which the salvadoran government would acquiesce.the bia affirmed and dismissed the appeal.the petition presented to this court challenges only the denial of deferral under the cat.
background 
ortiz franco entered the united states illegally in.between and,he was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,a class d armed violent felony under new york law attempted petit larceny and possession of a controlled substance.see penal law.
in july,the department of homeland security dhs served ortiz franco with a notice to appear in removal proceedings,alleging that he was removable as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.see a a i.at an initial hearing,ortiz franco conceded removability on the charged ground.in october,dhs additionally alleged that ortiz franco was subject to removal as an alien convicted of violating a law related to a federally controlled substance.see id.a a i ii.a superseding charging document,filed in april,charged that ortiz franco was subject to removal as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.see id.a a i i.ortiz franco conceded removability on these additional grounds.
this petition arises from an order issued years later,following intervening events recounted below.
ortiz franco joined ms in.he and other members were later indicted on federal charges in connection with a fight with a rival gang.ortiz franco attended a proffer session in which he stated that his were members of ms they started the fight and were displaying ms hand signs and saying la mara,la mara,one of the people they were fighting was a former ms member ortiz franco and his had snorted cocaine before the fight and certain of his provided muscle for a drug dealer.the government did not credit ortiz franco account as completely truthful and accurate,declined to hold further proffer sessions,and offered him no cooperation agreement.
since ortiz franco proffer statements might have been admissible at trial,the government gave copies to his.thereafter,defense counsel told the government that ortiz franco had concerns about being deported to el salvador,because of the ms perception,albeit inaccurate,that he cooperated with the government.
the case against ortiz franco expanded into a prosecution in which defendants were charged with inter alia murder,racketeering,conspiracy to distribute cocaine,and witness tampering.ortiz franco ultimately pleaded guilty to witness tampering and was sentenced principally to months imprisonment.
ortiz franco removal hearing resumed in and continued in.he faced limited options,given his criminal record and removability.accordingly,he applied for deferral of removal under the cat.in support of his application,he submitted an affidavit and an additional written statement background information on gang violence and country conditions in el salvador and a letter from the united states attorney office for the eastern district of new york.the letter did not dispute that the statements made by ortiz franco regarding the ms and members of that street gang may put him in some danger,if he is deported to el salvador because of ms perception,albeit inaccurate,that he cooperated with the government the government did not object to a stay of deportation.
ortiz franco offered inconsistent testimony.at one point,he said he joined ms by invitation after he met members of the gang at a bar he frequented later,he said that the members forced him to join.he first denied being involved in the gang fight that led to the prosecution subsequently he testified that he punched his rival after being insulted and seeing his rival coming toward him.as to the witness tampering to which he pleaded guilty,ortiz franco disclaimed wrongdoing and stated that he pleaded guilty because he was pressured to do so by federal agents who scared his children and told them that he would lose them if he went to trial and would not see them for many years.
as to his cat claim,ortiz franco testified that his told him he was in trouble for ratting on them,which he understood to mean that they could kill him his had the information he had given to the federal agents and had made copies of that paper and give n it to other ms members who were in the prison and,although he could not name those who had threatened him,they made the ms hand sign.
asked how he knew that his perceived cooperation would be disclosed to ms members in el salvador,ortiz franco imagine d his had contacts there because ms is a big gang.although ortiz franco testified that gang members must have sent copies of the proffer documents to contacts in el salvador,he had no proof of it.
ortiz franco asserted that the police in el salvador would not protect him because he was a gang member.the ij explained that cat deferral does not stretch under board precedent to a situation where the police can not protect someone,but rather requires proof that the government would acquiesce in the torture,and urged ortiz franco counsel to deal with that issue.counsel inquired of ortiz franco whether,b esides the gangs,any other agency or organization will cause you problems ortiz franco replied,no.specifically,though ortiz franco was afraid of ms,he was not afraid of the government or the police in el salvador,and did not know of any connections between or among ms,the salvadoran government,and his.
the ij doubted ortiz franco truthfulness during the proceedings and ruled that ortiz franco failed to establish that he would be identified as a turncoat ms member by anyone,that the salvadoran government would punish or harm him or that ms has the ability to influence government authorities in el salvador.to the contrary,the ij found that according to background evidence,there has actually been an attempt to broker peace in el salvador between the gangs that the government was seeking to protect the people of el salvador and that no evidence suggest s that the salvadoran government would acquiesce in harm perpetuated against ortiz franco if he were to return to that country.the ij denied the application for deferral of removal under the cat,which permitted ortiz franco to be removed.
the bia affirmed.specifically,the bia upheld the ij key determinations ortiz franco did not establish that he will be identified by anyone in el salvador as an ms member who cooperated with law enforcement officials in the united states,that it is more likely than not that he will experience harm meeting the definition of torture in el salvador,or that the government of el salvador will acquiesce to any harm caused to ortiz franco by criminal gangs unaffiliated with the government.
the petition for review argues that,as to denial of deferral,the agency erred in concluding that he did not show the requisite likelihood of torture or that any torture by gang members would occur with the acquiescence of el salvador.the government counters that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the petition for review because our jurisdiction is limited to consideration of questions of law and constitutional claims,of which ortiz franco raises none.
discussion 
although we have never expressly decided the question,we have sometimes assumed that our review is limited to questions of law and constitutional claims when an alien otherwise removable for having committed a covered criminal offense claims entitlement to deferral of removal under the cat.de la rosa holder,cir pierre gonzales,cir reviewing application for withholding of removal and observing that b ecause pierre is a criminal alien,this court review is limited to constitutional claims and questions of law.
given the uncertain scope of our jurisdiction to decide petitions challenging the denial of deferral under the cat,we have at times avoided the jurisdictional question by assuming hypothetical jurisdiction.see roig holder,app x,cir summary order to the extent our jurisdiction to review the denial of deferral of removal under the cat is unresolved,we may assume jurisdiction and deny a petition on the merits where,as here,the agency denied petitioner claim and his underlying challenges to that decision are without merit.internal citation omitted keita holder,app x,cir summary order we assume,without deciding,that we have jurisdiction in this case of denial of deferral of removal.however,such an assumption is prohibited in all but the narrowest of circumstances.see steel citizens for a better env t,d criticizing exercise of hypothetical jurisdiction as carr ying the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and offend ing fundamental principles of separation of powers and explaining that w ithout jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause internal quotation marks omitted ctr.for reprod.law policy bush,cir recognizing that ordinarily we are not to assume the existence of jurisdiction in favor of reaching an easier merits issue but acknowledging an exception to the rule for limited and peculiar circumstances internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we now consider the issue,and join the majority of courts that have done so,holding that when an alien who is otherwise removable due to the commission of a covered criminal offense seeks deferral of removal under the cat,appellate jurisdiction is limited to review of constitutional claims and questions of law.see escudero arciniega holder,cir escudero asserts only factual issues on appeal because we do not have jurisdiction to review factual determinations made pursuant to removal orders based upon an aggravated felony,we dismiss escudero petition for review of the bia denial of protection under the cat.pieschacon villegas att y,cir this court would lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner disagreement with the bia determination that he failed to sufficiently demonstrate that public officials in colombia would likely acquiesce in his torture this court does,however,have jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law including whether the board adjudicated petitioner application for deferral of removal under an incorrect legal standard.internal quotation marks and citations omitted constanza holder,cir same saintha mukasey,cir finding that because alien was removable by reason of an aggravated felony conviction,a c prohibited evaluation of the factual merits of his cat claim and alien could not repackage his argument in an attempt to create a reviewable legal question where there is none jean pierre att y,cir same tran gonzales,cir pursuant to a c and d,our review of tran cat claim is limited to questions of law or constitutional issues.but see issaq holder,cir holding a decision under the cat to deny even deferral of removal does not fall within the provisions of either a b or a c lemus galvan mukasey,cir same.
the cat provides that n o state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.convention against torture and other cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment pt.i,opened for signature,treaty doc.no.the cat,however,is not by its own force,it confers no judicially enforceable right on individuals.pierre,at medellin texas,d w hile treaties may comprise international commitments they are not domestic law unless congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be and is ratified on these terms.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted id.at a treaty does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law.congress implemented the convention by passing the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra,and directing the executive to promulgate regulations.
farra and its implementing regulations provide generally that withholding of removal shall be granted if an alien demonstrates that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed.d see also id.b b.denial of this relief is,however,mandatory under certain circumstances.d.specifically,an alien is ineligible for withholding of removal or asylum if the attorney general decides that the alien,having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime is a danger to the community of the united states.b b ii see also d.
to give effect to the cat even when an alien has been ordered removed and is subject to the provisions for mandatory denial of withholding of removal,the implementing regulations provide that the alien shall be granted deferral of removal if the alien establishes that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured if removed.a.torture,for purposes of the cat implementing regulations,is severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,that is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.id.a.deferral of removal may be terminated on the government motion if,after a hearing,an alien can not demonstrate the continuing probability of torture if removed.id.d see ali mukasey,cir considering petition for review of order of bia terminating grant of deferral of removal under the cat.
because the cat does not itself confer any judicially enforceable right,pierre,at,it of course also has nothing to say about the scope of judicial review of a right defined by statute or the implementing regulations.congress has,however,specified that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in the implementing regulations,nothing in the farra shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the cat except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act.note united states policy with respect to the involuntary return of persons in danger of subjection to torture.accordingly,this court has jurisdiction to consider a claim under the cat only as part of its review of a final order of removal.
our jurisdiction over a petition for review of a final order of removal is limited,however,when the petitioner is removable by reason of having committed a covered criminal offense.id.a c.review then extends no further than to constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.id.a d.because judicial review of deferral claims is only provided as part of the review of a final order of removal,the scope of such review must likewise be so limited.e see also id.e except as otherwise expressly provided,nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a private right of action or to authorize the consideration of issuance of administrative or judicial relief.
