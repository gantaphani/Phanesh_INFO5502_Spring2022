in this appeal we consider whether a proposed intervenor must demonstrate that it has standing even when there is a genuine case or controversy between the existing parties that satisfies the requirements of article iii of the constitution.the answer is no.
steven sherman,a land developer,previously sued the town of chester the town alleging a regulatory taking.that litigation remains pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york ramos.laroe estates,laroe,a real estate development company,claimed that it,not sherman,currently owns the property that is the subject of sherman dispute and sought to intervene pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.rather than determine whether laroe satisfied the requirements of rule,the district court denied laroe motion on the ground that laroe lacked standing to assert a takings claim against the town.because we do not require proposed intervenors in this circumstance to show that they independently have standing,we vacate the order and remand to the district court to determine in the first instance whether laroe met the requirements of rule.
background 
this is the second time that this court has considered a dispute related to the abandoned marebrook development project in the town of chester.when we last did so,the district court had dismissed sherman regulatory takings claim against the town because it was unripe.sherman town of chester,civ.er,wl,at.we reversed that decision,holding that the claim could proceed even though the town never rendered a final decision on the matter.sherman town of chester,cir.quotation marks omitted.that conclusion was based on the extraordinary facts of sherman case facts that are fully recounted in our previous decision,with which we assume familiarity.we remanded the case back to the district court to consider sherman takings claim on the merits.id.at.
shortly thereafter,laroe filed a motion to intervene,purporting to be the equitable owner of the property at issue in sherman dispute.laroe claims that it entered into a purchase agreement with sherman in june the agreement,pursuant to which sherman agreed to sell laroe three parcels of land within the proposed marebrook subdivision.in exchange,laroe agreed that it would pay for each lot approved for development within the three parcels once sherman plans were approved by the town.the agreement also required laroe to make million in interim payments while sherman sought the town approval.the interim payments were secured by a mortgage that sherman provided to laroe encumbering all of the development property.joint app x.if sherman failed to obtain the town approval of a sufficient number of lots,laroe retained the right to terminate the agreement.over the next year,laroe advanced sherman more than million for the project.
although sherman efforts to secure the town approval stretched on,laroe did not terminate the agreement.but in april td bank,which held a superior mortgage interest in the property,commenced a foreclosure proceeding.hoping to salvage the deal in view of the foreclosure,laroe and sherman signed a new contract the agreement amending their earlier purchase agreement.the agreement provided that the million laroe had already advanced sherman,plus any amount paid to settle sherman obligation to td bank,would constitute the purchase price of the property.once the town approved the development,laroe was required to transfer a certain number of lots back to sherman depending on how many were approved by the town.subject to this requirement,the parties deemed the purchase price for the property paid in full.joint app x at.to resolve td bank foreclosure proceeding,the agreement also granted laroe the sole discretion to settle the debt owed to td bank and alternatively permitted laroe to terminate the agreement if laroe and td bank failed to reach a settlement before the foreclosure sale.laroe ultimately failed to satisfy sherman obligations to td bank.on may,a foreclosure sale occurred,and td bank took possession of the property.laroe nevertheless chose not to terminate the agreement.
throughout this period,sherman and subsequently his estate continued litigating his takings claim.after we remanded the case,laroe sought to intervene.by order dated march,the district court denied the motion,concluding that laroe claim against the town was futile.sherman town of chester,civ.er,wl,at.although the district court acknowledged that legal futility is not mentioned in rule,it reasoned that futility was nonetheless a proper basis for denying a motion to intervene.id.at citing in re merrill lynch.research reports sec,mdl jfk,civ.jfk,wl,at june.relying on our decision in olympic committee intelicense,cir,the district court concluded that laroe lacked standing to assert a takings claim because it was not the owner of an interest in property at the time of the alleged taking.sherman,wl,at quoting olympic,at.
having concluded that laroe lacked standing,the district court did not discuss at length whether laroe otherwise satisfied the requirements of rule,other than to suggest in a footnote that it was not clear that laroe satisfie d rule timeliness requirement,since laroe waited to file its motion until after this court reversed the district court decision dismissing sherman takings claim.id.at.but because the district court concluded laroe lacked standing,it declined to determine whether the motion was timely.id.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
article iii standing 
laroe filed a motion for intervention as a matter of right under rule a or,in the alternative,permissive intervention under rule b.we review a district court denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion.floyd city of new york,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding.mastercard int l visa int l serv.ass n,cir.here,the district court denied the motion as futile because,it held,a party seeking to intervene as of right must independently have standing,and laroe,it concluded,separately lacked standing to assert a takings claim against the town.see sherman,wl,at.although,as the district court acknowledged,legal futility is not mentioned in rule,id.at,we have affirmed denials of a motion to intervene on that basis,united states glens falls newspapers,cir.affirming the denial of a newspaper motion to intervene to ask the district court to vacate a consent order sealing draft settlement documents.but we have not held that a party seeking to intervene as of right must independently have standing.
in fact,we suggested somewhat to the contrary in united states postal service brennan,where a union of postal service employees sought to intervene in a dispute between the postal service and the owners of a small business in rochester,cir.the district court denied the union motion partly because the union lacked standing.although we ultimately affirmed that decision on other grounds,id.at,we explained that the motion should not have been denied for lack of standing,because t he question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered in the framework of article iii,which restricts judicial power to cases and controversies,id.at quotation marks omitted.therefore,we reasoned,there is no need to impose the standing requirement upon a proposed intervenor where t he existence of a case or controversy has been established in the underlying litigation.id.our approach accords with that of the majority but not all of our sister circuits that have addressed this issue see,king governor of the state of new jersey,cir.perry schwarzenegger,cir.city of herriman bell,cir.dillard chilton cty.comm n,cir.united states tennessee,cir.ruiz estelle,cir.but see,city of chicago fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.treating article iii standing as an additional requirement for intervenors united states metro.louis sewer,cir.same united states philip morris usa,cir.same.
although a circuit split on this issue has persisted for some time,the supreme court has expressly declined to resolve it.see diamond charles.instead,in diamond charles,it ruled only that when the original party in the litigation on whose side intervention occurred refuses to appeal and an intervenor wishes to appeal on its own,the intervenor must show that it satisfies article iii standing requirement in the absence of the original party.id.at.but since diamond,the supreme court has certainly suggested although without deciding that an intervenor need not independently have standing where the original party has standing.in mcconnell federal election commission,for example,the court determined that it need not address the standing of the because it was clear that the named defendant,whose position was identical to the,had standing,overruled on other grounds by citizens united fed.election comm n.so it is fair to say that while the supreme court has not explicitly endorsed our approach,it has sub silentio permitted parties to intervene in cases that satisfy the case or controversy requirement without determining whether those parties independently have standing.the district court therefore erred by denying laroe motion to intervene based on its failure to show it had article iii standing.
failure to state a claim 
the town argues in the alternative that we should affirm the district court order because laroe motion also fails to state a claim against the town whether or not laroe has standing.oral arg.tr.that argument,however,is foreclosed by trbovich united mine workers of america.in that case,a union member sought to intervene in a suit by the secretary of labor seeking to set aside the results of a union election.id.at.although,under the relevant statute,only the secretary was authorized to bring such a claim,the union member was permitted to participate on the secretary side of the case,as long as he did not assert any new grounds for relief.id.at.thus,under trbovich,a party need not have a claim of its own to intervene on the plaintiff side of a case at least as long as it asserts the same legal theories and seeks the same relief as the existing plaintiff.
that principle applies here.although it is unclear from the record whether laroe believes the town is directly liable to sherman or laroe for the alleged taking,laroe has acknowledged that its damages are essentially the same as sherman.oral arg.tr.and the town does not dispute that the land that laroe now claims it owns is part of the same parcel of land at issue in sherman takings litigation.even if laroe has no independent claim that could survive a motion to dismiss under rule b an issue we need not decide that does not bar it from continuing to participate in the litigation of sherman takings claim,so long as it seeks relief that does not differ substantially from that sought by sherman.because neither a proposed intervenor lack of article iii standing nor its failure to state an independent claim necessarily renders a motion to intervene futile,the district court should have instead focused its analysis on the requirements of rule,to which we now turn.
laroe filed a motion for both intervention as a matter of right and permissive intervention.convincing us to reverse the denial of a motion for permissive intervention is notoriously difficult.see united states pitney bowes,cir.here,though,we need not address laroe motion for permissive intervention because laroe relies on the same reasons supporting its request to intervene as of right.appellant br.we therefore focus on only laroe motion to intervene as of right.
the district court must grant an applicant motion to intervene under rule a if the motion is timely the applicant asserts an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the applicant is so situated that without intervention,disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect its interest and the applicant interest is not adequately represented by the other parties.mastercard,at see also fed.civ.a.the town of chester argues that laroe fails this test because its application was untimely,it lacks a separate interest in the proceeding,and any interest it has in the litigation is adequately represented by sherman estate.because the factual record before us is insufficiently developed at this stage to allow us confidently to resolve these arguments,we vacate the order and remand to the district court to determine in the first instance if laroe satisfies the requirements of rule.
timeliness 
in determining whether a motion to intervene is timely,courts consider how long the applicant had notice of the interest before it made the motion to intervene prejudice to existing parties resulting from any delay prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied and any unusual circumstances militating for or against a finding of timeliness.pitney bowes,at.
the town contends that laroe waited too long to file its motion to intervene.laroe responds that it first learned of this litigation after the town filed its motion to dismiss in may.although laroe waited until may to inform the district court that it wished to intervene,it explains that it could not have filed its motion earlier because the district court had by then dismissed sherman suit and it could have intervened only after we decided sherman appeal in.
laroe explanation fails to answer why it did not try to intervene before the district court first dismissed sherman takings claim.but even assuming that laroe could have moved to intervene sooner,the litigation is still at an early stage.after we remanded the case,the town filed a motion to dismiss several other claims from sherman complaint that we did not address in our previous opinion.a motion for reconsideration is now pending before the district court.so despite eight years having passed since sherman first filed suit in federal court and more than sixteen years since sherman first applied for subdivision approval,the parties have not even begun discovery.although we recognize that the point to which the suit has progressed is only one factor in the determination of timeliness,naacp new york,this case does not represent an attempt by an intervenor to join a lawsuit at the eleventh hour.
nor are we persuaded that laroe delay in filing the motion prejudiced the town.the town points to two ways in which it may have suffered prejudice.first,it asserts,laroe intervention would create t he possibility of a much more difficult settlement position.oral arg.tr.second,it claims that because laroe contract with sherman was essentially only a mortgage agreement,other creditors may attempt to join the litigation if laroe is permitted to intervene while both arguments may explain how the town is prejudiced by laroe participation in the litigation,neither shows how it would be prejudiced by laroe delay in filing its motion to intervene our only concern on timeliness under rule.indeed,at oral argument the town wisely conceded that timeliness was not necessarily where the prejudice would come in,in this case.oral arg.tr.
laroe,on the other hand,claims it would be prejudiced by the denial of its motion to intervene.it invested a significant sum of money into the project and lost that investment allegedly due to the town onerous regulatory process.sherman estate does not oppose laroe intervention.but laroe informed the district court that sherman widow,the executrix of his estate,was unwilling to pursue the takings claim unless laroe gave her an incentive to move the case forward.laroe letter to the district court,may,ecf.and on appeal laroe represents that sherman estate is without funds and therefore unable or unwilling to pursue the claim.oral arg.tr.sherman death,the alleged refusal of his impecunious estate to pursue the takings claim,and the subsequent sale of the foreclosed property might well prejudice laroe and in any event constitute unusual circumstances militating for a finding of timeliness.mastercard,at.the district court did not address this issue,and on remand it should have the opportunity to do so.
