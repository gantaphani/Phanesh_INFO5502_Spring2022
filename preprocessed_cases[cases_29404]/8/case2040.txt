merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,merrill lynch appeals from the order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge entered on october,remanding claims brought by michael spielman spielman in new york state court.spielman,on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,brought suit on various state law grounds against merrill lynch alleging merrill lynch misled certain of its account holders to believe they would not be charged a transaction fee that they were,in fact,charged.merrill lynch removed the case to federal district court under both the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,f,which permits removal of certain class actions alleging state law claims based on a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,f,and under the general removal statute,b,which permits removal of civil actions over which federal courts have original jurisdiction.on spielman motion,the district court remanded after determining that the alleged misrepresentations lacked a sufficient nexus to the underlying securities to fall within the scope of slusa preemption.
reading the remand order in the most logical light possible,we find that the district court remanded based on its conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider spielman claims under slusa.for the reasons set forth herein,this court lacks appellate jurisdiction under d to review the remand order.accordingly,we dismiss the appeal.spielman request for attorneys fees is not properly before this court and is denied.spielman request for costs is granted under fed.
background 
spielman state suit 
spielman,a new york resident,filed his complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york,new york county,in february against merrill lynch,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york.spielman alleged in the complaint that he opened a cash management account cma with merrill lynch in.one type of security offered by merrill lynch to cma account holders was holding company depository receipts holdrs,an interest in a trust that held shares of common stock issued by twenty specified companies from distinct industry sectors,utilities,telecommunications,pharmaceuticals.spielman alleged that,through a series of confusing statements in its marketing materials,merrill lynch represented that a cma would enable clients,with certain exceptions,to purchase securities such as holdrs without paying a transaction fee.spielman maintains,however,that he was charged a two percent transaction by merrill lynch as an underwriting each holdrs purchase he made during.
spielman suit alleged six causes of action under new york state law breach of contract breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fraud negligent misrepresentation breach of fiduciary duty and violation of new york consumer protection law,bus.law mckinney.spielman complaint alleged no federal cause of action.
removal and remand 
on april,merrill lynch removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to slusa removal provision,c,f,and the general removal statute,b.spielman moved on may,to remand the action back to the originating state court.the district court granted spielman motion to remand after determining that merrill lynch alleged misrepresentations were not made in connection with the purchase or sale of the holdrs securities.spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,wl at,internal quotation marks omitted.merrill lynch appeals the remand order as erroneously granted.
ii.discussion 
the threshold question presented here is whether this court may review the district court remand order.spielman maintains that d prohibits appellate review in this case.he contends that section d,the provision governing reviewability of remand orders generally,prohibits appellate review of remand orders that are predicated on any basis enumerated in c,which includes lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
merrill lynch counters that the district court did not specify whether it remanded under slusa,f d,or the general remand statute,c.merrill lynch urges that slusa remand provision controls,asserting that the remand was based on an interpretation of specific language in the slusa statute,and not on any of the grounds specified in section c.further,merrill lynch maintains that appellate review is available because slusa,unlike section d,contains no express bar on appellate review of remand orders.
because we construe the district court remand to have been based on a perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction under slusa,a remand basis expressly recognized in section c,the order is not reviewable on appeal.see d.
slusa enactment and the scope of federal question jurisdiction 
slusa was enacted in in response to a demonstrably unavailing attempt by congress,through the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.codified in part at,to prevent strike suits,described as meritless class actions that allege fraud in the sale of securities.lander hartford life annuity ins,cir.congress had enacted the pslra to filter out potential strike suits.instrumental to achieving this objective was imposition of more stringent pleading requirements and mandatory discovery stays for securities fraud class actions filed in federal court.the pslra afforded district courts the opportunity in the early stages of litigation to make an initial assessment of the legal sufficiency of any claims before defendants were forced to incur considerable legal fees or,worse,settle claims regardless of their merit in order to avoid the risk of expensive,protracted securities litigation.id.citing conf.although theoretically capable of paralyzing the efforts of potential strike suit plaintiffs,the pslra proved ineffective in actual practice to prevent litigation of meritless suits.
driving enactment of slusa was congress finding that litigants eluded pslra reach with relative ease.confronted with more onerous procedural requirements and dimmed prospects of success under the pslra,litigants simply abandoned use of federal court and filed suit in state court under state securities laws.lander,at and citing.pslra objectives went largely unrealized due to this federal flight loophole.slusa was enacted to close the loophole by mandating federal court as the exclusive venue for class actions alleging fraud in the sale of certain covered securities and by mandating that such class actions be governed exclusively by federal law.id.at citing b c see also f a and f.slusa preemption and removal provisions,read together,accomplish this task.however,examination of slusa statutory language,a necessary predicate step in this analysis,clarifies slusa broad,but not unlimited,scope.
slusa preemption provision provides,in pertinent part 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security 
f a.slusa removal provision makes removable any class action preempted by f a.see f.congress could not have spoken more clearly.the clear and unambiguous language convinces us that slusa was intended to completely preempt the field of certain types of securities class actions by essentially converting a state law claim into a federal claim and creating federal jurisdiction and venue for specified types of state securities fraud claims see beneficial bank anderson,d when the federal statute completely the cause of action,a claim which comes within the scope of that cause of action,even if pleaded in terms of state law,is in reality based on federal law.slusa does not,however,preclude all state enforcement or private causes of action in securities fraud cases.
slusa only converts into federal claims those state claims that fall within its clear preemptive scope,thereby confining federal question jurisdiction under this statutory regime to a subset of securities fraud cases.congress was mindful to preserve the balance between establishing and maintaining national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities and preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of state securities regulators.this balance was achieved by expressly confining slusa preemption and removal to lawsuits in which the plaintiff alleges a state law violation stemming from for purposes of this suit a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security preempted class action f a see abada charles schwab,cir slusa prohibits a private party from bringing a covered class action in federal or state court based on the statutory or common law of a state alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.quoting f.in essence,slusa enactment marked a congressional attempt to close the federal flight loophole and route facially preempted class action lawsuits to federal court for scrutiny and possible summary disposal.
under slusa,then,state securities fraud class actions are removable.see f.removal under slusa does not necessarily sound the death knell of the removed action,however.slusa removal provision ensures that the district court to which the case has been removed can do what exploitation by litigants of pslra federal flight loophole effectively precluded determine that the removed action is,in fact,a preempted class action.quite simply,a district court must examine the complaint to determine whether the substantive requirements necessary to sustain removal under slusa preemption provision,see f,have been satisfied,as these requirements determine whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the action.see caterpillar,at.affirming appellate court remand to state court finding removal of state claim for breach of employment contract improper because requirement for complete preemption under section of the labor management relations act of,not satisfied and federal question jurisdiction not otherwise apparent on the face of complaint.
if a district court determines the action is not a preempted class action and,therefore,removal was improper,the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to further entertain the action.rather than dismiss for want of jurisdiction,both the general remand statute,c,and slusa remand provision,f d,require the district court to remand the removed action back to the originating state court.the question then is the threshold issue raised in merrill lynch whether a remand order such as the one issued in this case is reviewable on appeal.it is this question,which turns on the interplay between section c and slusa remand provision,that we now examine.
b.the general remand statute,c 
the general remand statute,section c,provides,in pertinent part,that i f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.c.section d provides that with the exception of certain civil rights cases,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise d.reading section d in pari materia with section c,as we must,see things remembered,petrarca,d citing thermtron,hermansdorfer,d,section d bars appellate review of remand orders based on any ground recognized in section c,such as perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction,quackenbush allstate ins,d holding that,discretionary remand such as on abstention grounds is not barred from appellate review.
the prohibition against appellate review extends not only to remand orders made in suits removed under the general removal statute,but to orders of remand made in cases removed under any other statutes,as well,things remembered,at.quoting united states rice.modification and emphasis in original,unless congress issues a clear statutory command to the contrary,id.this holds true even if the any other statute contains an express remand provision of its own.id.at.holding that remand provision in b applicable to bankruptcy cases does not operate to the exclusion of sections c and d.courts recognize a strong congressional policy against review of remand orders,sykes texas air,cir,grounded in notions of fairness to litigants by curbing the potential for dilatory tactics 
the touchstone of the analysis in determining whether congress intended a remand order to be reviewable on appeal is not whether congress included a separate remand provision in the statute that authorized removal.rather,we look for congress use of express exclusivity language in that separate remand provision and examine whether congress fashioned an express statutory exception to the section d bar by preserving appellate review for remand orders issued under that particular statute.see things remembered,at.ultimately,we are aware of only three statutory exceptions to section d bar,not one of which is applicable in this case slusa does not constitute a fourth exception.
slusa remand orders are governed by section 
slusa requires a district court to remand an action previously removed under slusa removal provision,f,if it determines that the state action does not fall within slusa preemptive scope.see f d.to state the obvious,federal question jurisdiction to proceed under slusa is dependent on slusa applicability.slusa applicability is triggered if and only if a claim,on its face,falls within slusa preemptive scope.if a claim falls within slusa preemptive scope,by definition,it satisfies slusa substantive requirements necessary to sustain removal,see f.one such substantive requirement is that the alleged securities fraud must have occurred in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.id.finding the fraud did not occur in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security produces three indisputable conclusions the claim does not fall within slusa preemptive scope,slusa does not apply,and most importantly,federal question jurisdiction to proceed under slusa is lacking.
although slusa contains its own removal provision,f,and remand provision,id.f d,it contains no language expressly prohibiting appellate review of remand orders.merrill lynch construes this congressional silence as a clear statutory command preserving appellate review.we,on the other hand,do not think congress silence was intended to impart such import and decline to do so in congress stead.conspicuously absent from slusa is any express language suggesting that it operates to override the appealability exclusion of section d.moreover,in contrast to section d express exception for remand orders issued in civil rights cases,we find no such exception in slusa remand provision or in section d for remand orders issued in slusa removal cases.it is not our place as jurists to supply that which is omitted by the legislature.see west virginia.hosps.casey,d in statutory construction case,t o supply omissions transcends the judicial function.quotation omitted.in this same vein,we do not believe,as merrill lynch seems to imply,that congressional silence should reasonably be construed as a clear statutory command to trump section d jurisdictional bar and create,by implication,appellate jurisdiction.see abada,at finding omission in slusa to any bar of appellate review does not create appellate jurisdiction because section d bar applies regardless of whether the case was removed pursuant to the general removal statute or the removal provisions of slusa.
finding no contrary statutory command in slusa,we hold that reviewability of a remand order based on the perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction in a case previously removed under slusa preemption provision is governed by c and d.thus,a remand order based on a finding that the state law claim evades slusa preemption is merely an alternative,and not incorrect,way of stating that subject matter jurisdiction under slusa is lacking.accordingly,the remand order issued in such a case is not reviewable on appeal.this is true even if the district court determination regarding subject matter jurisdiction is or poorly reasoned.see thermtron,at.section d prohibits review of all remand orders issued pursuant to section c whether erroneous or not.we are convinced that this approach aligns with congress intent and its aware ness of the universality of denying appellate review of remand orders things remembered,at.quoting rice,at.
d.the district court remand order 
turning now to the facts of the case before us,the district court focused on whether the substantive requirements necessary to sustain slusa removal,f a,were satisfied.the district court determined as a matter of law that the purported misrepresentations about fees ultimately charged to cma clients,which were central to the state law claims in spielman complaint,were not made in connection with the purchase or sale of holdrs.without this essential nexus,spielman state law claims were not within slusa preemptive scope,thereby rendering slusa inapplicable and compelling remand,see f d.
merrill lynch maintains that the remand order never expressly addresses subject matter jurisdiction,but rather the district court interpreted the language in slusa preemption and removal provisions when ordering remand.therefore,merrill lynch contends,the district court remanded based on the language in slusa,not section c.this position bears striking resemblance to the argument rejected by the sixth circuit in things remembered.merrill lynch position fares no better here.
things remembered involved application and interpretation of b,the statutory provision applicable to removal and remand of bankruptcy actions.section b permits,but does not require,a district court to remand a bankruptcy action previously removed from state court.if the action is remanded,section b contains language expressly prohibiting appellate review of that remand order.on appeal of the district court remand order,the sixth circuit,in an unpublished opinion,noted that things remembered sought removal pursuant to the general provision,as well as the bankruptcy removal provision,a,and that the notice of removal was untimely under both counterpart provisions,and.the sixth circuit concluded that section d precluded appellate review,as did section b,and sua sponte dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under both sections.see petrarca things remembered,wl cir unpublished opinion.
the supreme court agreed,instructing that t here is no reason d and can not comfortably coexist in the bankruptcy context and gave effect to both provisions.things remembered,at.the court held that section d barred review of the remand order,irrespective of whether the initial removal had taken place under section a,the general removal statute,or section a,the bankruptcy removal statute.id.at.the supreme court made clear that section b remand provision,without some expression about its exclusivity,does not ipso facto render it the exclusive,operative remand provision in the bankruptcy context.id.by the same token,slusa remand provision,which contains no expression of exclusivity,does not,as merrill lynch proposes,render it the exclusive and operative remand provision in the securities litigation context.
nor does section b remand provision,which expressly precludes appellate review of remand orders issued thereunder,provide support for merrill lynch position that congress must explicitly state its intent to preclude appellate review.adopting this position would turn the general rule that remand orders are not reviewable on its head and contravene the strong congressional policy against review of remand orders,sykes,at.
while we agree that the district court never used the words subject matter jurisdiction,federal question jurisdiction,or even jurisdiction when ordering a remand,such phrases are not necessary for our analysis.r eviewability of the remand order depends on the district court basis for granting it,pierpoint barnes,cir,cert.denied,d,a basis which can be ascertained from the plain language used or,when contextually ambiguous,gleaned from a fair,independent reading of the remand order and record as a whole,see mangold analytic,cir holding appellate court has power and responsibility to look past contextually ambiguous allusions and even specific citations to section c to determine by independent review of the record the actual grounds or basis upon which the district court considered it was empowered to remand see also transit cas.certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir,cert.denied,d interpreting contextually ambiguous remand order as based on lack of jurisdiction.
our reading of the remand order convinces us that the remand could not have been predicated on anything other than the district court determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under slusa.to conclude,as merrill lynch urges,that the district court ruling is based on any other reasoning necessarily reads the remand order with legal blinders.we agree that the district court did not expressly state whether its remand order was grounded in slusa remand provision or the general remand provision.we do not think any ambiguity in this respect,however,compels a different conclusion or alters our analysis.whether the district court remand was impliedly predicated on slusa remand provision or the general remand statute,we construe the remand as manifesting a perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction under slusa,thereby precluding our appellate jurisdiction.
we also reject merrill lynch proposal that this court fashion an exception to the scope of the rule in section d in cases where the decision to remand was based on a prior determination of substantive law,which refers to the district court determination that spielman allegations do not satisfy the in connection with requirement for slusa preemption.the ninth circuit pelleport clorox doctrine,to which merrill lynch alludes,grants appellate review if the district court remand decision is based on a resolution of the merits of some matter of substantive law apart from any jurisdictional decision.clorox united states dist.court for dist.of,cir quoting pelleport investors,budco quality theatres,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
merrill lynch maintains that this court should exercise appellate jurisdiction under the doctrine because the district court remand decision was based on the resolution of a substantive legal question,the meaning of the phrase in connection with under slusa.even if the doctrine were available to merrill lynch in some issue we do not decide in this would not create appellate jurisdiction here.the district court interpretation of in connection with was a necessary predicate to deciding the existence of subject matter jurisdiction under slusa.see abada,at.we also find it persuasive that the circuit in which the doctrine originated has commented on this very issue and concluded that i f deciding a substantive legal question is necessary to determine whether subject matter jurisdiction existed,the exception does not apply.see also baldridge,cir.
because spielman complaint did not otherwise raise a federal question,slusa preemption language would provide the only basis for federal question jurisdiction in this case.the district court finding that slusa did not preempt the claim was tantamount to a finding that subject matter jurisdiction to proceed under slusa in federal court was lacking.the remand order,based on this finding,is not reviewable on appeal.
attorney fees and costs 
a secondary issue before us is spielman request that this court grant him costs and attorney fees pursuant to c,which provides that a n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses,including attorney fees,incurred as a result of the removal.id.because we are not remanding the case,but are instead dismissing the appeal from the remand order for lack of appellate jurisdiction,section c does not empower this court to grant spielman request for attorney fees.this issue is one more appropriately addressed by the district court.accordingly,spielman request for fees is denied.on the other hand,spielman request for costs is properly before us,not pursuant to section c,but under rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure.the request for costs is granted.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.spielman request for fees is denied,and costs are taxed against merrill lynch.
i add these words to the comprehensive discussion in judge parker opinion,in which i concur,to offer a framework for disentangling the concepts of preemption,complete preemption,jurisdiction,and the merits in a case such as this one.
the plaintiff has filed in state court a suit based on state law grounds,including common law fraud.the defendant contends that the state law basis for the plaintiff suit is preempted by federal law,and has removed the suit to federal court.if we were concerned with the usual form of preemption,the defendant assertion of preemption would be a defense.see,fleet bank,national association burke,cir observing that preemption is a federal defense concerned citizens of cohocton valley,new york state department of environmental conservation,cir same.because a defense based on federal law does not provide a basis for invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court,see louisville nashville mottley,defendant assertion of the usual form of preemption would not provide a basis for invoking the district court federal question jurisdiction under,and,if only federal question jurisdiction was invoked,the case would therefore not be removable under.metropolitan life insurance taylor,d federal is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff suit.as a defense,it does not appear on the face of a complaint,and,therefore,does not authorize removal to federal court.
in such a case,the district court,without the need to consider the merits of the preemption defense,would be required to remand to the state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,see blab of mobile,comcast cable communications,cir finding that did not give rise to complete preemption,that subject matter jurisdiction over the removed claim was therefore lacking,and that the court necessarily must avoid further consideration of the merits of the preemption defense,and we would be required to dismiss an appeal by the defendant because,pursuant to d,a remand for lack of jurisdiction is not appealable.see things remembered,petrarca,d thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d.the state court would then have an opportunity to consider the merits of the preemption defense.see vorhees naper aero club,cir u pon remand to state court,that court will be free to consider the question whether the federal aviation act preempts the claim vorhees is attempting to present claim on which our jurisdictional ruling rejecting complete preemption or occupation of the field has no bearing.in re loudermilch,cir finding that a district court employee retirement income security act preemption ruling on a motion to remand would have no preclusive effect on the state court resolution of respondents preemption defense in the same case romney lin,cir denying rehearing there are thus some cases in which a state law cause of action is preempted,but only a state court has jurisdiction to so rule.
however,where,as here,the defendant asserts the special form of preemption known as complete preemption,the analysis is altered.in those circumstances where an area of state law is completely preempted,metropolitan life,at,the plaintiff has no viable state law claim the only possible claim is one based on federal law.beneficial national bank anderson,d when the federal statute completely the cause of action,a claim which comes within the scope of that cause of action,even if pleaded in terms of state law,is in reality based on federal law.metropolitan life,at.freeman burlington broadcasters,cir.in such circumstances,a federal court considering a defendant removal petition must consider whether the criteria for complete preemption have been met if so,then the plaintiff has necessarily invoked federal question jurisdiction,even though he did not wish to.moreover,in determining whether the criteria for complete preemption have been met,the district court simultaneously determines both the merits of the defense of complete preemption and the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.in the context of complete preemption,these issues are the opposite sides of the same coin.furthermore,if the district court determines that the criteria for complete preemption have been met,the district court,after ruling in favor of its subject matter jurisdiction,is then obliged to dismiss for failure to state a claim,because the state law basis on which the plaintiff has attempted to proceed has been preempted by federal law.see romney lin,cir.in this circumstance,an appeal lies,as it would from any final judgment dismissing a complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for failure to state a claim.see id.at 
conversely,if the district court determines that the criteria for complete preemption have not been met,then the plaintiff state law suit does not arise under federal law,the district court lacks federal question jurisdiction,and the case must be remanded to the state court for lack of jurisdiction.marcella capital district physicians health plan,cir.the defendant can not appeal because of d 
one further point should be added to clarify the unusual context in which the district court decided the critical legal issue of whether the fraud alleged by the plaintiff was in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.this issue typically comes before a federal court because a plaintiff has filed a complaint alleging violations of section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule,which apply to fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,and a defendant has sought dismissal pursuant to rule b on the ground that the plaintiff allegations fail to meet the in connection with requirement.in that context,the plaintiff claim,even if ultimately unsuccessful and subject to dismissal,would normally be sufficiently colorable as to invoke the federal court subject matter jurisdiction.see bell hood.and,of course,an appeal would be available from a dismissal for failure to state a claim.
in this case,the source of the in connection with requirement is not section b or rule,but the preemption provisions of the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,b,f,and the defendant is seeking to avoid remand of a state court action,rather than to obtain dismissal of a federal court action.perhaps the phrase in connection with has the same meaning in slusa as it has in section b and rule.some courts including the district court in this case have interpreted slusa in connection with phrase in accordance with decisions construing section b and rule see,araujo john hancock life insurance,d,spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,wl,at.but see shaw charles schwab,d.
however,even if the phrase in connection with has the same meaning in slusa as it has in section b and rule,there are at least three procedural differences between the two contexts when the issue is whether the slusa requirement has been met.first,the parties roles are reversed the defendant is urging that the plaintiff has satisfied the in connection with requirement,and the plaintiff is usually resisting such a finding.second,a colorable claim by the defendant that the in connection with requirement has been satisfied is not sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction the district court must definitively resolve the issue at the threshold as part of its jurisdictional inquiry.third,whether appellate review is available depends on the result reached by the district court if,as here,the district court concludes that the plaintiff allegations do not meet the in connection with requirement,then remand is appropriate,and the court conclusion is not reviewable because of d.
in the pending case in which the plaintiff has pled a state law claim of fraudulent,the district court has ruled that the was not in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,that complete preemption does not exist,that the case can not be removed,and that it must be remanded for l
