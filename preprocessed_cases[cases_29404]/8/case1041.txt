george havercombe appeals from the district court dismissal,based upon res judicata,of his employment discrimination action against the department of education for the commonwealth of puerto rico and victor fajardo,education secretary,in both his official and individual capacities.for the reasons explained below,we affirm.
havercombe first sued these defendants on december,in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico alleging employment discrimination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,title vii of the civil rights act,and in that action hereinafter havercombe i,havercombe alleged that from to he had been employed as a teacher and guidance counselor for the puerto rico department of education.beginning in early,according to havercombe,defendants engaged in a course of discriminatory conduct,to wit,work place harassment and failure to promote him because of his race,national origin and age on february,a jury found in havercombe favor,awarding him in damages.that award was reduced by the district court to in april.
on may,less than a month after the district court entered final judgment in havercombe i,havercombe filed the current action in the same district court against the same defendants,once more alleging employment discrimination in violation of the adea and title vii,but also alleging that the discrimination was in violation of the descriptive allegations in the complaint filed in the second action hereinafter havercombe ii were materially the same as those in havercombe 
on may,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim based on principles of res judicata.we review the district court action de novo.see apparel art,amertex enterprises,cir.
under the doctrine of res judicata,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.allen mccurry,d.under the standard this requires a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and later suits and an identity of parties or privies in the two suits.kale combined ins.of america,cir.the parties do not dispute that prongs and are met here.their disagreement revolves around prong.
defendant contends that the allegations of employment discrimination contained in the havercombe ii complaint are essentially identical to those that were litigated,or that could have been litigated,to a final judgment in havercombe both cases state causes of action against the same defendants under title vii and the adea for race,national origin and age discrimination,and both complaints state that the alleged discrimination began in early and continued until the date of the complaint,viz,march,havercombe i and may,havercombe ii.to be sure,havercombe ii alleged that this same conduct went on for two more years than in havercombe and havercombe july,eeoc administrative complaint charging discrimination occurring in the period forms part of havercombe ii but not havercombe i.but nothing in special incident different from what had already occurred in the identified as having taken place after.
defendant argues that neither the addition of the claim nor the inclusion of the later eeoc administrative complaint for conduct in suffices to show that havercombe ii contains a cause of action that is distinct from the cause pleaded in havercombe i.we agree.
we start with the unsurprising proposition that,insofar as havercombe ii complaint alleges incidents of discrimination dating from to the very same dates covered by the amended complaint in havercombe i,havercombe ii is plainly precluded by the first lawsuit.cloaking these same allegations in a new legal theory by adding a cause of action under can not rescue havercombe ii from the judgment in havercombe i for the period to.as this court has said,
a single cause of action can manifest itself in an outpouring of different claims,based variously on federal statutes,state statutes,and the common law a s long as the new complaint grows out of the same transaction or series of connected transactions as the old complaint,the causes of action are considered to be identical for res judicata purposes.
kale,at quotation marks and citations omitted.section,which forbids discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts,see,is another way of presenting the same race discrimination plaintiff suffered and for which the jury in havercombe i found defendants liable in the context of a different legal theory.having brought and prevailed upon his title vii claim in havercombe i,in which he alleged racial discrimination of the type that would be covered by,such as failure to promote,plaintiff can not now go forward with another lawsuit based on the same underlying facts but premised on a different,and in this case narrower,federal statute.see patterson mclean credit union,d distinguishing section from title vii and calling the latter the one with the more expansive reach mak ing it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,whereas section covers only conduct at the initial formation of the employment contract and conduct which impairs the right to enforce employment contract obligations through legal process.plaintiff claim,in so far as it is based on incidents of race discrimination between and,could have been brought in havercombe i but was not.as such,it is res judicata by virtue of the final judgment in havercombe i.as the district court correctly held,t he addition of the section claim does not breath life into this action.
the harder question is whether the alleged subsequent discrimination that continued from until partially covered by a later eeoc administrative complaint filed in can properly be considered to be part of the same transaction or series of connected transactions adjudicated to a final judgment in havercombe i.the verdict in havercombe i was returned on february,and a final judgment was entered in april after defendant motion for remittitur was granted.the trial in havercombe i,however,encompassed only alleged discriminatory conduct during the period.
to decide this question we look first at this circuit approach to res judicata,which follows the restatement second of judgments.see manego orleans board of trade,cir cert.denied,d,adopting the transactional definition of res judicata of the restatement second of judgments.section of the restatement second of judgment provides 
when a valid and final judgment rendered in an action extinguishes the plaintiff claim pursuant to the rules of merger or bar,the claim extinguished includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction,or series of connected transactions,out of which the action arose.
what factual grouping constitutes a transaction,and what groupings constitute a series,are to be determined pragmatically,giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time,space,origin,or motivation,whether they form a convenient trial unit,and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties expectations or business understanding or usage.
restatement second of judgments emphasis added.the restatement explains this pragmatic approach as an outgrowth of the federal rules considerable freedom of amendment and the system willing ness to tolerate changes of direction in the course of litigation,cmt.applying the restatement considerations to this case factual and procedural posture,we conclude that havercombe i extinguished not only the claims for the period alleged in havercombe ii but those continuing through as well.
in so deciding,we look first to the amended complaint in havercombe ii on which the plaintiff relies in order to distinguish this second action from the first.the havercombe ii complaint alleges that defendant have sic subjected plaintiff to a discriminatory and offensive environment in the workplace,which has entailed,inter alia,offensive racial slurs,denial of
