john fiero fiero and fiero brothers,fiero brothers together,fieros appeal from judge marrero dismissal of their complaint,which sought a declaratory judgment that,inter alia,the financial industry regulatory authority,finra lacks the authority to bring court actions to collect disciplinary fines it has imposed.we hold that finra lacks such authority.we therefore reverse the dismissal of the complaint and vacate the money judgment on finra counterclaim.

b the disciplinary action against the fieros 
fiero brothers,a new york corporation,was a finra member firm and registered with the sec.john fiero was the sole registered representative of fiero brothers.as such,the fieros were subject to the regulations and discipline of nasd.
on february,nasd department of enforcement initiated disciplinary proceedings against the fieros,the merits of which are not pertinent to this appeal.on december,an nasd hearing panel held that the fieros had violated section b of the exchange act,rule,and finra conduct rules,and.the hearing panel expelled fiero brothers,barred fiero from associating with any firm in any capacity,and fined the fieros plus costs,jointly and severally.
on appeal,the nac affirmed the hearing panel decision in its entirety.john fiero,adjudicatory council no,wl,at.the fieros did not appeal the nac decision to the sec.

on february,the day after the new york court of appeals issued its ruling,the fieros filed the instant action seeking a declaratory judgment that,inter alia,finra has no authority to collect fines through judicial proceedings finra thereafter filed a counterclaim,seeking to enforce the fine under a breach of contract theory.both parties moved to dismiss the complaint and counterclaim,respectively.
on march,the district court granted finra motion to dismiss the fieros claim,denied the fieros motion to dismiss finra counterclaim,and instructed the clerk to enter judgment in favor of finra

the fieros argue that while the exchange act and finra rules and bylaws authorize finra to impose sanctions on its members,it has no authority to bring judicial actions to collect monetary sanctions.finra argues that it has this authority under the exchange act and from a finra rule submitted to,and not disapproved by,the sec in rule change.see notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of proposed rule change by nasd relating to the collection of fines and costs in disciplinary proceedings,exchange act sec release,docket july,hereinafter sec notice of rule change.we discuss each argument seriatim.
a finra authority under the exchange act 
the first question is whether the exchange act provides finra with the necessary authority.we hold that it does not.
under section b of the exchange act,sro have a statutory authority and obligation to appropriately discipline their members for violation of any provision of the exchange act,the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder,or their own rules,by expulsion,suspension,limitation of activities,functions,and operations,fine,censure,being suspended or barred from being associated with a member,or any other fitting sanction.b.however,there is no express statutory authority for sro to bring judicial actions to enforce the collection of fines 
in the present context the omission is not insignificant.the core issue,of course,is congressional intent,touche ross redington,and,in the discussion that follows,we explain why we believe that congress did not intend to empower finra to bring judicial actions to enforce its fines.
the statutory scheme carefully particularizes an array of available remedies,including permissible actions in the federal courts.these include,of course,a variety of actions by private parties for damages,f,b see redington,at discussing generally private rights of action in the securities exchange act.
also,section d of the exchange act provides express statutory authority for the sec to seek judicial enforcement of penalties.see d.more specifically,the sec may in its discretion bring an action to enjoin any person who is engaged or is about to engage in acts or practices constituting a violation of,inter alia,any provision of the exchange act,the rules or regulations thereunder,or the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member from such practices.id.d.moreover,the sec has explicit authority to seek monetary penalties for violations of the exchange act,the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,or for the violation of a cease and desist order.id.d a.under section e of the exchange act,the sec may also seek writs of mandamus,injunctions,and orders from the federal courts commanding any person to comply with,inter alia,the provisions of the exchange act,the rules,regulations,and orders thereunder,the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member or person associated with a member id.e.under section f,however,the sec is prohibited from bringing any action pursuant to subsection d or e of this section against any person for violation of,or to command compliance with,the rules of a organization unless it appears to the commission that such organization is unable or unwilling to take appropriate action against such person in the public interest and for the protection of investors,or such action is otherwise necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.id.f 
therefore,when congress passed the exchange act,and to this date,sarbanes oxley act of,b,amending dodd frank wall street reform act,stat,amending,it was well aware of how to grant an agency access to the courts to seek judicial enforcement of specific sanctions,including monetary penalties.d a see,sec rosenthal,cv l con,wl cir.june,sec tx.gulf sulphur,cir.
in contrast,there are no explicit provisions in the statute authorizing sro to seek judicial enforcement of the variety of sanctions they can impose.this is significant evidence that congress did not intend to authorize finra to seek judicial enforcement to collect its disciplinary fines.redington,u.at not implying a private right of action where elsewhere in the exchange act congress demonstrated the ability and explicit intent to create private rights of action.
we need not rely upon negative implications alone,however,because there are statutory provisions that weigh heavily against finra claim of enforcement powers through court actions alleging breach of contract.first,finra sanctions are appealable by an aggrieved party to the sec and thereafter to the united states courts of appeals.had congress intended judicial enforcement,it would surely have provided for some specific relief other than leaving sro to commonlaw proceedings in state courts or in federal district courts under diversity jurisdiction second,where finra enforces statutory or administrative rules,or enforces its own rules promulgated pursuant to statutory or administrative authority,it is exercising the powers granted to it under the exchange act.indeed,finra powers in that regard are subject to divestment by the sec under section g of that act.however,congress gave the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the exchange act,and finra breach of contract theory undermines that provision.finra contract enforcement actions may bristle with exchange act legal issues because the most serious fines levied by finra will be for member violations of the act.for example,the fieros were charged with a violation of section b of that act.state court enforcement of finra fines might well,therefore,entail interpretation of the exchange act notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.
one might argue that an inference of congressional intent to authorize such legal actions by finra can be drawn from the seemingly inexplicable nature of a gap in the finra enforcement scheme fines may be levied but not collected.however,the gap does not support an inference of inadvertent omission because significant underenforcement of the securities laws and finra rules is hardly the inevitable result of finra inability to bring actions.finra fines are already enforced by a draconian sanction not involving court action.one can not deal in securities with the public without being a member of finra.when a member fails to pay a fine levied by finra,finra can revoke the member registration,resulting in exclusion from the industry.moreover,where a fine is based on a violation of the exchange act,the violator will also face a panoply of private and sec remedies.see,b.
finally,our conclusion is amply supported by nasd longstanding practices.it has always relied exclusively upon its powers to revoke the registration of or deny reentry into the industry to punish members who do not comply with sanctions.accounting office,sec and cftc most fines collected,but improvements needed in the use of treasury collection service.so far as we can tell,it was not until that the nasd sought to enforce fines or any other sanction through judicial actions in its own right.nasd or any other sro may never even have claimed to have the power to do so until.in that year,as discussed infra,nasd proposed a rule and successfully asked the sec not to disapprove it.the rule notified the public of a new nasd policy of bringing court actions in its name to collect fines.nasd,notice to members,available at http.this rule,and its effect,are discussed in the next subsection.and,even after the change in policy in the effect of which turns in part on the question of statutory authority the action against the fieros is said to be the first case brought under that policy.appellant br.at.
such a longstanding practice supports an inference that nasd believed that it lacked judicial enforcement power.as the supreme court has stated,
authority actually granted by congress of course can not evaporate through lack of administrative exercise.but just as established practice may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general statutory language,so the want of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it,is equally significant in determining whether such power was actually conferred.
fed.trade comm bunte,see also bankamerica united states,finding that the government failure for over years to exercise the power it now claims strongly suggests that it did not read the statute as granting such power.
moreover,nasd longstanding reliance upon these other substantial enforcement methods was known to congress,and congress left that reliance unaltered.this lack of action further indicates that finra is not authorized to enforce the collection of its fines through the courts.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,noting that an implied cause of action under the commodities exchange act was a part of the contemporary legal context in which congress legislated,and that i n that context,the fact that a comprehensive reexamination and significant amendment of the commodities exchange act left intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied a cause of action is itself evidence that congress affirmatively intended to preserve that remedy internal citations omitted.the situation here is different from merrill lynch in that a failure to bring actions,rather than the bringing of actions,was involved,but the principle of congressional acquiescence is the same.
in sum,the issue is one of legislative intent,and we conclude that the heavy weight of evidence suggests that congress did not intend to empower finra to bring court proceedings to enforce its fines.
