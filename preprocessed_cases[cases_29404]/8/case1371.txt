background 
injury and treatment 
hill alleges that,on march,while confined at the jail,he asked to be removed from pod two and placed in the block area after having been told that he would have to perform two particular cleaning details,three days in a row by an officer carissa allen.shortly thereafter,according to hill,the pod was ordered to lock in,and curcione and chawer approached his cell along with other officers and ordered him to prepare to move.after putting on his sneakers,hill was ordered to approach the cell door,turn around with his back to the door,get on his knees,and put his hands behind his head.the cell door then was opened and hill was handcuffed.at that time,he alleges,he was struck in the upper torso and head area several times by officer curcione.he was then led out of his cell into the pod b sallyport where curcione and chawer slammed him against the wall several times.hill says he then began to resist the officers to prevent being forced to the floor.
with his hands cuffed behind his head and with his torso and arms strapped in by an emergency response belt,hill ultimately was thrown to the floor face down.he asserts that curcione and chawer then beg a n to tighten the handcuffs and bind his wrist solely as a means to cause injury.he avers that he ceased resisting at this point.the officers then bent his legs across one another as hill remained face down on the floor.at that point,sergeant williams,the tour supervisor,appeared on the scene.curcione reported to williams that hill had been resistant and force was needed to subdue hill.when hill said that curcione was lying and that the officers had assaulted him,williams purportedly instructed hill to shut up.
hill continued to complain that his handcuffs were too tight and alleges that the officers put a facemask on him,causing his breathing to stop,while lifting him from the floor.he asserts that he then was carried from pod sallyport,to the elevator,and then down to isolation.placed in an empty cell with the handcuffs still on his wrists,hill claims that he was not seen until the next afternoon by a nurse after complaining to an officer in the segregation unit.he was seen by a physician assistant two days after the incident,complaining that his hands were damaged by cuffs and that he suffered from extreme pain and numbness caused by nerve damage.an revealed a broken bone in hill wrist,and a cast was placed on the wrist on april,nine days after the injury occurred.
on april,aikin,a nurse practitioner,confronted hill with an officer report that hill had been working out doing and during recreation.aikin,who had provided motrin pain medication for hill,was told that the officer allegations were not exact and were an attempt to impede hill endeavors in filing a law suit against aiken fellow colleagues in that hill had informed him officer tim blackley of hill intent to do such.hill continued to complain of pain,asserting that motrin was insufficient as pain medication and opined that he should have been referred for a nerve conduction study.hill asserted in his statement of facts appended to his complaint that he would soon be placed in the custody of the state department of correctional services,so the doctor and nurse practitioner believe that the department of correctional services should deal with plaintiff issues.this is what both defendant hohensee and aikin had expressed verbally to plaintiff.
the version of the events leading to hill injury put forward by the corrections officer defendants is somewhat different.according to the officers,the events unfolded as follows sergeant williams,the tour supervisor at the jail on march,received a call from corrections officer carissa allen that hill was refusing to perform his cleaning detail and was using vulgar and obscene language toward allen.after determining that hill had used abusive language toward allen in the past and that the conduct was recurring,willams decided hill should be written up and moved to punitive segregation for his disruptive behavior.accordingly,sergeant williams instructed the correctional emergency response team cert squad leader,paul curcione and another cert member,jeffrey chawer,to proceed to plaintiff cell and escort him to punitive segregation.
responding to that instruction,officer curcione states that,upon arrival outside hill cell,he informed hill that hill was charged with jail rule infractions and ordered him to turn around and put his hands behind his back.instead of doing so,hill began to pack his belongings and,when advised that an officer would pack his belongings for him and again ordered to turn around and place his hands behind his back,hill became boisterous and yelled,i will pack my shit.fearful that hill would provide further resistance and aware that hill was a man approximately tall with a weight of approximately pounds,curcione ordered hill into a kneeling position.
when hill went to a kneeling position,curcione entered the cell with officer chawer.the officers met resistance when they attempted to secure hill hands behind his back.curcione asserts that it was necessary to apply wrist compliance to control hill right wrist for placement in the handcuffs.he describes wrist compliance as manipulating the wrist joint and pressure points to gain control of a resistant inmate.the use of wrist compliance is standard operating procedure and pursuant to training received by a cert officer.
after officers curcione and chawer escorted hill out of his cell,hill again resisted the officers and attempted to pull away from them while yelling obscenities and refusing to obey verbal commands to cease his disorderly conduct.the officers then placed hill on the floor and attempted to gain control of his legs as he kicked at officer chawer and continued to struggle.additional officers were called to the scene and the officers then present were able to take control of hill torso and secure his legs with an emergency response belt.hill then was carried to an observation cell where the handcuffs and belt were removed.during the course of the incident,hill threatened curcione with physical harm several times.
ii.grievance and disposition 
on april,hill filed a grievance dated april,asserting that he was assaulted on march,by officers curcione and chawer as well as others.in describing his injuries on the grievance form,hill alleged that he sustained serious hand and wrist injuries as the result of misuse of handcuffs and force.he noted that he later was seen by a doctor or and was given an that revealed a wrist fracture.noting that he had made two earlier complaints requesting pain medication and a nerve conduction study but received nothing,hill wrote that he still was experiencing extreme pain and loss of sensation in his hands.the grievance form was received by the grievance coordinator at the jail on april.
by decision dated april,the grievance coordinator recognized hill claim that he was assaulted and determined that t here is no evidence to support hill allegation of any wrong doing by any officer.the decision also advised that only the jail physician,hohensee,could authorize the tests hill requested and that hill was to fill out a request slip if he was experiencing pain.hill checked a box on the form on which the decision was given.next to the box were the words i wish to appeal to the chief administrative officer.hill signed that request and dated it april.
responding to hill request to appeal,and on the same form as the grievance,the chief administrative officer for the jail,captain vandetta,wrote the following decision as per minimum standards section j you have two business days to appeal.your above date is not correct that you wrote.this was turned in with two grievances dated.this decision was signed by captain vandetta on april.although hill requested a further appeal and so indicated on the form,captain vandetta wrote this is no longer grievable.
iii.proceedings in the district court 
in his complaint,brought pursuant to and filed on june,hill alleged as to both curcione and chawer that acting under the color of state law,each assaulted plaintiff by deliberately tightening handcuffs around his wrist and bending his hand,breaking his wrist and causing serious and permanent nerve damages sic,which is an eighth amendment violation of the constitution.hill also alleged that sergeant williams violated his eighth amendment rights by being deliberately indifferent to plaintiff suffering at the hands of officers under her supervision.
as to nurse practitioner aikin,hill alleged that aikin acted under color of state law when he denied plaintiff medical care that is,pain medication and nerve conduction study leaving him to needlessly suffer,all in violation of the eighth amendment.the complaint repeats the same allegations against hohensee and includes a further allegation that hill has exhausted his administrative remedies.
on october,defendants aikin and hohensee filed a motion to dismiss the action as against them for failure to state a claim,noting the paucity of allegations referring to any medical treatment they may have provided.by order filed on march,the district court,adopting the february,report recommendation of magistrate judge scott over hill objections,granted the motion.the report recommendation stated 
although the plaintiff alleges that he should have been given different pain medication and be sent for a nerve conduction study,the plaintiff does not assert any medical basis for these claims.at best,the plaintiff disagrees with the various medical professionals as to the nature and treatment of the medical services he received.more importantly,the plaintiff fails to assert any allegations or basis to find that aikin and hohensee acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind to find that they knowingly acted to disregard an excessive risk to hill health.
by motion filed on march,curcione,chawer,and williams sought summary judgment dismissing all claims against them,claiming,inter alia,that they were entitled to qualified immunity,that the force used against hill was reasonable,that hill failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that hill had failed adequately to allege a failure to protect claim.by order entered on march,the district court adopted the february,report recommendation of magistrate judge scott over hill objections and granted summary judgment as requested.dismissal was based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies.noted in the report recommendation were the facts that hill injuries occurred on march,and that he filed his grievance on april,leading to this conclusion inasmuch as the plaintiff did not comply with the requirements of the ncj inmate grievance program or by filing a grievance within five days of the date of the alleged assault,the plaintiff excessive force claim against curcione and chawer should be dismissed.no grievance having been filed against williams,the claim against her also was dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
of the claims against aikin and hohensee 
in analyzing the dismissal of the complaint as against aiken and hohensee for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,we apply a de novo standard of review,accepting as true all of the factual allegations of the complaint.see chambers time warner,cir.the plaintiff has the responsibility to set forth in the complaint facts that state a claim that is plausible on its face.see bell atlantic twombly.the supreme court teaches that a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal.we have noted our obligation to construe pro se complaints liberally,even as we examine such complaints for factual allegations sufficient to meet the plausibility requirement.see harris mills,cir.in our review of the sufficiency of a pro se complaint such as hill,we are constrained to conduct our examination with special solicitude,interpreting the complaint to raise the strongest claims that it suggest s.triestman federal bureau of prisons,f d,cir per curiam internal citations omitted alteration omitted.
applying the foregoing standards,we conclude,in agreement with the district court,that hill has failed to set forth a claim for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.the eighth amendment prohibition of the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments,const.amend.viii,extends to punishments that involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.gregg georgia.an eighth amendment claim arising out of inadequate medical care requires a demonstration of deliberate indifference to a prisoner serious medical needs.estelle gamble.the standard for deliberate indifference includes a subjective component and an objective component.see hemmings gorczyk,cir per curiam.
subjectively,the official charged with deliberate indifference must act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.see wilson seiter.that is,the official must know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.farmer brennan.the objective component requires that the alleged deprivation must be sufficiently serious,in the sense that a condition of urgency,one that may produce death,degeneration,or extreme pain exists.hathaway.coughlin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
medical malpractice does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation unless the malpractice involves culpable recklessness an act or a failure to act by a prison doctor that evinces a conscious disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm.chance armstrong,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this connection,the supreme court has held that a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the eighth amendment.estelle,at.
it has long been the rule that a prisoner does not have the right to choose his medical treatment as long as he receives adequate treatment.see id.at.
it is that mere disagreement over the proper treatment does not create a constitutional claim.so long as the treatment given is adequate,the fact that a prisoner might prefer a different treatment does not give rise to an eighth amendment violation.
chance,at.accordingly,we have noted that the essential test is one of medical necessity and not one simply of desirability.dean coughlin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
hill complaint falls far short of alleging a deliberate indifference on the part of nurse practitioner aikin or hohensee to his serious medical needs.as to each of these medical providers,hill alleges only that he was denied medical care that is pain medication and nerve conduction study leaving him needlessly to suffer.hill contends that the motrin medicat
