in the fall of,amaranth advisors llc amaranth,a hedge fund that had heavily invested in natural gas futures,collapsed.a senate investigation would later conclude that amaranth,in the months leading up to its demise,had taken positions in natural gas futures and swaps so massive that its trading directly affected domestic natural gas prices and price volatility.see staff report of permanent subcomm.on investigations,comm.on homeland security and governmental affairs,excessive speculation in the natural gas market senate report.plaintiffs appellants,traders who had bought or sold natural gas futures during these same months,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that amaranth had manipulated the price of natural gas futures in violation of the commodities exchange act cea,et.plaintiffs appellants also alleged that defendants appellees morgan chase,morgan chase bank,and morgan futures,collectively,had aided and abetted amaranth manipulation of natural gas futures through futures services as amaranth futures commission merchant and clearing broker.the district court scheindlin,in october,and april,orders,concluded that both plaintiffs appellants complaint and amended complaint failed to state claims against morgan.
plaintiffs appellants argue on appeal that the district court did not apply the correct standard for evaluating the sufficiency of their amended complaint and likewise failed to recognize the amended complaint allegations that futures aided and abetted amaranth manipulation within the meaning of section of the cea,a.we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiffs appellants amended complaint failed to state a claim against futures.because we conclude that this is so even under the pleading standards that plaintiffs appellants argue should apply,we do not decide whether the district court application of a more stringent standard was error.
background 
commodity futures trading 
the cea prohibits manipulation of the price of any commodity or commodity future.see,a.while the cea itself does not define the term,a court will find manipulation where defendants possessed an ability to influence market prices an artificial price existed defendants caused the artificial prices and defendants specifically intended to cause the artificial price.hershey energy transfer partners,cir this case is about the alleged manipulation of natural gas futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex.the alleged manipulative scheme,however,also involved a second standardized energy contract natural gas swaps traded on the intercontinental exchange ice,an electronic exchange based in atlanta,georgia.a full understanding of plaintiffs appellants allegations requires background on both of these financial instruments and their respective exchanges.
nymex natural gas futures 
nymex is a futures and options exchange based in new york city.mercantile exch.intercontinentalexchange,cir.we have previously described the basic features of commodity futures trading 
a commodities futures contract is an executory contract for the sale of a commodity executed at a specific point in time with delivery of the commodity postponed to a future date.every commodities futures contract has a seller and a buyer.the seller,called a short,agrees for a price,fixed at the time of contract,to deliver a specified quantity and grade of an identified commodity at a date in the future.the buyer,or long,agrees to accept delivery at that future date at the price fixed in the contract.it is the rare case when buyers and sellers settle their obligations under futures contracts by actually delivering the commodity.rather,they routinely take a short or long position in order to speculate on the future price of the commodity.then,sometime before delivery is due,they offset or liquidate their positions by entering the market again and purchasing an equal number of opposite contracts,a short buys long,a long buys short.in this way their obligations under the original liquidating contracts offset each other.the difference in price between the original contract and the offsetting contract determines the amount of money made or lost.
strobl mercantile,cir.
one type of futures contract traded on nymex is for the delivery of natural gas.in its standard form,this contract obligates the buyer to purchase of natural gas released during the contract delivery month at the henry hub distribution facility in erath,louisiana.trading on the future begins five years before the delivery month and ends three business days before the first calendar day of the delivery month.to determine the future final price,nymex uses a weighted average of the trades executed during the final half hour of trading to on the last trading day.this final half hour is referred to as the contract final settlement period,and final price as the final settlement price.
nymex is a designated contract market,or dcm.as a dcm,nymex may offer options and futures trading for any type of commodity,but is subject to extensive oversight from the commodity futures trading commission cftc.see a.among other things,nymex must maintain an internal monitoring and compliance program that meets statutory criteria listed in the cea.see id.one of these criteria is that nymex establish position limits and accountability levels for each type of contract that it offers for trading.see id.d.a position limit is a cap on the number of contracts that a trader may hold or control for a particular option or future at a particular time,with exceptions provided for traders engaged in bona fide hedging.see id.a a,c.an accountability level provides that once a trader holds or controls a certain number of contracts for a particular option or future she must provide information about that position upon request by the exchange and,if the exchange so orders,stop increasing her position.at the time of the events alleged in the amended complaint,nymex had set a position limit of contracts,net short or net long,for any natural gas future,applicable during the last three days of trading.nymex had also set corresponding accountability limits,which varied in size based on the trader capitalization and applied at all times the future was traded.
all trades on nymex must go through the exchange clearinghouse.to finalize,or clear,a trade,traders must transact with a nymex clearing member a firm approved as a member of the clearinghouse.the seller clearing firm will sell the contract to the clearinghouse,which then sells the contract to the buyer clearing firm.through this act of simultaneously buying and selling the contract,the clearinghouse guarantees both sides of the trade and ensures that neither buyer nor seller is exposed to any counterparty credit risk.the clearing firms,in turn,guarantee their clients performance to the clearinghouse.
to protect itself from risk of nonpayment,the nymex clearinghouse requires that its members deposit margin sufficient to cover any potential losses on their clients open positions.at the end of each trading day,the clearinghouse examines the change in value to these positions and determines whether the firm must post additional margin generally the case if value has decreased or receives payment on margin generally the case if value has increased.this process is called.see mercantile,at.clearing firms engage in the same process with their customers,requiring an initial margin payment for any newly acquired position and conducting a daily recalculation of that margin requirement as the position changes in value.
in addition to clearing members,traders on nymex also interact with futures commissions merchants,or fcms.an fcm is the commodity market equivalent of a securities brokerage house,soliciting and accepting orders for futures contracts and accepting funds or extending credit in connection therewith.first am.discount cftc,see also.fcms must register with the cftc,see id.a,and are subject to numerous regulatory requirements.a firm may be both a clearing member and an fcm.such dual status would enable it to both accept orders from clients and clear any resulting trades.
ice natural gas swaps 
ice is an electronic commodity exchange based in atlanta,georgia.at the time of the events alleged in the amended complaint,ice offered trading in natural gas swaps swaps,unlike futures contracts,do not contemplate delivery of the underlying commodity.rather,in a typical commodity swap,the buyer agrees to pay the seller a fixed amount of money and the seller agrees to pay the buyer the price of an underlying commodity at the time the swap expires.for ice natural gas henry hub swap,this floating value paid by the seller was the final settlement value of the nymex natural gas future for the corresponding month.hence,if the final settlement value of the nymex natural gas future was above whatever price the buyer paid for the swap,the buyer would profit if it was below,the seller would.
since the settlement price of an ice henry hub natural gas swap was pegged to the final settlement price of the corresponding nymex natural gas future,the two instruments were functionally identical for risk management purposes.indeed,arbitrageurs ensured that their prices moved in virtual lockstep with one another.whether a trader decided to transact in ice swaps or in nymex futures often depended on factors such as which market had greater liquidity.
an important difference between the two instruments,however,was that ice did not face the same level of regulatory oversight as did nymex.at the time of the events alleged in the amended complaint,ice qualified as an exempt commercial market,or ecm,under the cea while this status limited both the type of instruments ice could offer for trading and the parties that could trade them,it also exempted ice from most of the regulatory obligations placed upon nymex.see h.as an ecm,ice did not have to set position limits or accountability levels,nor did it need to monitor trading to ensure compliance with market rules and prevent manipulation.
at the time of the events alleged in the amended complaint,ice did not have a central clearinghouse ice did,however,permit its traders to employ clearing firms,and many of the companies that operated as clearing firms on nymex also operated as clearing firms on ice.
factual background 
the following facts are taken from the amended complaint,the allegations of which we accept as true,as well as from other materials referenced in the amended complaint.see,ony,cornerstone therapeutics,cir.
amaranth was a hedge fund based in greenwich,connecticut.founded in,amaranth initially pursued an investment strategy that did not particularly focus on energy trading.this changed over the next,however,and by energy trading consumed over thirty percent of amaranth capital.amaranth profited from this focus on energy when,in late,hurricanes katrina and rita disrupted domestic natural gas distribution.the resultant spike in prices produced returns on amaranth investments so large that energy trading would ultimately account for of the fund performance.by the beginning of,amaranth managed over billion in assets and employed over people.
amaranth continued to focus on energy trading in.among other things,it began to acquire large spread positions in nymex natural gas futures specifically,amaranth acquired calendar spreads between natural gas futures for different months.since many homes and businesses use it for indoor heating,natural gas has a highly seasonal price that rises in the colder winter months and falls in the warmer summer months.by taking large spread positions,amaranth was betting that the difference between these winter and summer prices would increase.
amaranth started to build up short positions for the march,april,and november nymex natural gas futures,while at the same time acquiring a long position for the january future.the sizes of these positions were exceptional.most traders consider control of only a few hundred contracts to be a substantial position a position of nymex natural gas futures contracts,meanwhile,will produce in profit or loss for every cent of price change.amaranth,however,soon acquired positions of over march and april contracts.these positions also represented a substantial share of the market.by february,amaranth controlled over half of the open interest on nymex november natural gas futures contracts,and held a similar percentage of january contracts.
while amaranth was building its spread positions during the first half of,it also engaged in several unusual transactions,referred to by plaintiffs appellants in their amended complaint as slamming the close trades.these trades all followed the same pattern in the weeks leading up to a nymex future expiration,amaranth would simultaneously acquire a long position in the future and a short position in the corresponding swap on ice.then,during the last half hour of trading on the final trading day the final settlement period amaranth would sell most or all of its long position,thus lowering the future final settlement price.this would then lower the final settlement price of the corresponding ice swap,allowing amaranth to profit from its short position in that swap.
amaranth engaged in these slamming the close trades for the march,april,and may nymex natural gas futures.for example,on the march future final trading day,amaranth acquired a long position in the future of over contracts.it then sold off this position during the future final settlement period,lowering the future final price by and realizing a gain for its short positions of over million.amaranth engaged in similar conduct the next two months,building up a large long position,selling it off during the final settlement period,and profiting by virtue of short positions on ice as well as in other nymex natural gas futures also suppressed in price by the trades.subsequent investigations would reveal that amaranth traders discussed smashing the settlement price of these nymex futures and directed floor brokers not to sell the contracts until the final minutes of trading.
in conducting these trades,amaranth violated nymex position limits and accountability levels,which prompted investigations from both nymex and the cftc.nymex also sought to limit amaranth trading for the june future,even contacting futures,amaranth clearing broker,in may to remind it that amaranth needed to remain below applicable position limits.amaranth failed to heed these warnings,and on june it appeared on a list of traders exceeding applicable accountability levels.nevertheless,nymex initial response to amaranth having again exceeded accountability levels was to recommend their temporary increase.then in early august,nymex informed amaranth that it should reduce its positions in the september natural gas future.amaranth responded by shifting its positions in september and october natural gas futures to the corresponding swaps on ice.it subsequently increased the size of those positions.
by early september,amaranth had a total open position in natural gas futures and swaps of contracts.the fund positions kept the spreads between winter and summer natural gas prices artificially high.indeed,energy traders would subsequently describe the spread between winter and summer prices as clearly and ridiculous.the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations would later conclude that amaranth dominated the domestic natural gas market in,and had a direct effect on natural gas prices and increased price volatility in the natural gas market.this investigation would reveal that amaranth traders discussed using the fund large positions to,among other things,push and widen spreads.
by september,however,the market for natural gas moved in ways that disrupted amaranth positions.as the winter months approached,it became clearer that the price of natural gas would not rise considerably the price spreads in which amaranth had invested consequently began to fall.amaranth,faced with ballooning margin requirements,struggled to find the capital or credit necessary to continue buying large positions that could prop up prices.on the brink of collapse,the fund entered into negotiations with several investment banks to sell off its natural gas positions.these negotiations fell through,and on september,amaranth sold most of its natural gas portfolio to morgan.morgan eventually earned million from the takeover.amaranth liquidated the remainder of its assets.
on july,the cftc filed a complaint against amaranth and its head energy trader,brian hunter,alleging that they intentionally and unlawfully attempted to manipulate the price of natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange nymex on february and april,and that amaranth advisors made material misrepresentations to nymex in violation of section a of the cea.cftc amaranth advisors,cv,wl,at.the defendants settled with the cftc for a civil penalty of million.id.at.on july,the federal energy regulatory commission ferc commenced an administrative proceeding against amaranth for civil penalties and disgorgement of profits.see cftc amaranth advisors,llc,d.amaranth likewise settled for a civil penalty of million 
throughout the class period,futures served as amaranth fcm and clearing firm.this meant,among other things,that futures processed and settled amaranth trades on both nymex and ice futures profited from this role between the beginning of and september,it earned over million in commissions from amaranth trading,as well as fees and interest on amaranth margin deposits.
as amaranth clearing broker,futures marked to market amaranth positions on a daily basis in order to determine if amaranth needed to deposit additional margin.this,along with futures other roles as a clearing broker,meant that it knew of amaranth positions and trading activity.as the clearing broker,j.futures also knew when amaranth violated nymex position limits or exceeded nymex accountability levels.indeed,nymex contacted futures directly in may to warn it about amaranth position in the june nymex natural gas future.additionally,futures knew of the positions amaranth took in connection with its slamming the close trades.it similarly knew about the nymex and cftc investigations into amaranth trading.
throughout the class period,futures continued to service all of amaranth trades,including those that put amaranth positions above applicable nymex position limits and accountability levels.on one occasion in late may,futures bypassed its own internal position limits for natural gas futures in order to clear a series of large trading transactions undertaken by amaranth.during the summer months of,futures regularly granted amaranth credit limit increases to support its positions on ice.futures facilitated amaranth transfer of positions from nymex natural gas futures to ice natural gas swaps,which were beyond cftc and nymex scrutiny.this transfer resulted in higher margin requirements for amaranth,and thus increased fees and interest for futures.
procedural history 
on july,plaintiffs appellants filed a complaint on behalf of all traders who purchased and sold nymex natural gas futures contracts between february and september,named as defendants were the entities and individuals that formed amaranth,the entities and individuals that served as amaranth floor brokers,and the entities forming morgan.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that amaranth had manipulated nymex natural gas futures prices in violation of sections c,d,a,and a of the cea,a,and a.the complaint divided this alleged manipulation into two separate schemes the prophecy of amaranth increasingly large spread positions and the slamming the close trades that amaranth executed in connection with the march,april,and may nymex natural gas futures.the complaint further alleged that morgan,by virtue of futures role as amaranth fcm and clearing broker,aided and abetted these manipulations in violation of section a of the cea,a.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss.in an october,opinion,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.see in re amaranth natural gas commodities litig.amaranth i,d.the district court determined as an initial matter that plaintiffs appellants allegations of manipulation were subject to the heightened pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure b.id.at.applying this standard,the court found that the complaint slamming the close allegations,but not its allegations about amaranth exceptionally large open positions,raised a sufficient inference of scienter to state a claim for manipulation under the cea.id.at.turning to the complaint aiding and abetting claim against morgan,the court determined that the complaint raised a strong inference that futures had knowledge of the manipulations and intended their success.id.at but it also concluded that futures actions did not go beyond normal clearing services,and that such routine services could not constitute the kind of overt act necessary for aiding and abetting liability under the cea.see id.at citing greenberg bear,stearns,cir.the court consequently dismissed plaintiffs appellants claim against futures,allowing leave to replead.id.at.
plaintiffs appellants filed an amended complaint on november,bringing the same claims against amaranth and morgan but providing more detailed allegations about the two companies intent.in an april,opinion,the district court concluded that the amended complaint sufficiently stated a claim against amaranth for manipulation based on its acquisition of large open positions,but still failed to state a claim against futures for aiding and abetting manipulation under section of the cea.see in re amaranth natural gas commodities litig.amaranth ii,d.evaluating the complaint under rule b,the district court found that plaintiffs appellants had once again failed to adequately support their contention that futures had committed an overt act in furtherance of the amaranth entities alleged manipulation.id.at.according to the district court,the amended complaint additional allegations still did not show that futures actions went beyond those routinely provided by clearing firms.id.the court declined to consider plaintiffs appellants argument that the provision of routine services could constitute aiding and abetting when considered in light of all the circumstances of the case,explaining that it had rejected that argument when it stated in its first opinion that a clearing broker can not be held liable as an aider and abettor simply because it performed its services.id.at quoting amaranth i,d at.
plaintiffs appellants class action claims against amaranth and the floor broker defendants were eventually certified,and in december the parties reached a settlement agreement dismissing the claims for million.see in re amaranth natural gas commodities,cv,wl,at june.in april,the district court entered final judgments dismissing all remaining claims against the remaining defendants,including futures.plaintiffs appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.fezzani bear,stearns,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.this standard requires that the complaint allege more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully and more than facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability.id.internal quotation marks omitted.applying this standard is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.id.at.
the district court concluded below that plaintiffs appellants amended complaint was subject to the heightened pleading standard of rule b.see amaranth ii,d at amaranth i,d at.it based its conclusion on this circuit statement in atsi communications,shaar fund,a securities manipulation case,that a claim for market manipulation is a claim for fraud.amaranth i,d at quoting atsi,cir.plaintiffs appellants argue that it was error for the district court to extend atsi to the commodities context.as support,they point to other district court opinions that have endorsed a approach to determining whether a manipulation claim sounds in fraud and thus must satisfy rule b.see cftc parnon energy,d,cftc amaranth advisors,d.we need not decide this issue,because we conclude that plaintiffs appellants amended complaint fails to state a claim against futures even under the more relaxed standard of rule a for similar reasons,we need not decide whether the district court erred in subjecting the allegations about futures intent to a strong inference standard.see amaranth i,d at citing tellabs,makor issues rights.
aiding and abetting under the cea 
section of the cea provides a private right of action against a ny person other than a registered entity or registered futures association who violates this chapter or who willfully aids,abets,counsels,induces,or procures the commission of a violation of this chapter.a.this language tracks that of.a,which establishes aiding and abetting liability generally under the cea congress modeled section a itself,moreover,after the federal statute for criminal aiding and abetting,see in re richardson,cftc,wl,at,the section was modeled after the federal criminal aiding and abetting statute.see also bosco serhant,cir noting that the aiding and abetting provision was modeled on,and was intended to be interpreted consistently with,the federal statute that makes aiding and abetting a crime.
accordingly,both the cftc and courts have determined that the standard for aiding and abetting liability under the cea is the same as that for aiding and abetting under federal criminal law.the cftc has held,drawing from judge learned hand classic formulation of criminal aiding and abetting liability in united states peoni,cir,that proof of a specific unlawful intent to further the underlying violation is necessary before one can be found liable for aiding and abetting a violation of the cea.in re richardson,cftc,wl,at.the seventh circuit has likewise noted that t he elements that a plaintiff must allege to state a claim for aiding and abetting under of the cea are therefore the same elements that must be established to prove a violation of.damato hermanson,cir.the seventh circuit articulated these elements,consistent with its own case law on criminal aiding and abetting,as that defendant had knowledge of the principal intent to commit a violation of the act had the intent to further that violation and committed some act in furtherance of the principal objective.id.the third circuit has endorsed the same definition.see nicholas saul stone,cir.
this circuit has yet to articulate a precise standard for aiding and abetting liability under the cea.we agree that section should be interpreted consistently with the criminal law,and that a complaint therefore states a claim for aiding and abetting under u.when it plausibly alleges conduct that would constitute aiding and abetting under.we have not typically evaluated criminal aiding and abetting under a test,however,but have instead continued to follow judge hand statement in peoni that aiding and abetting requires the defendant to in some sort associate himself with the venture,that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about,that he seek by his action to make it succeed.at see also united states frampton,cir citing peoni as the traditional understanding of the law of aiding and abetting.we do not understand this traditional articulation of the standard to differ,in substance,from the standard employed by the seventh and third circuits because this articulation of the test for aiding and abetting is the one with which the courts of this circuit are most familiar,however as well as to avoid the confusion potentially generated by using two different articulations for the same substantive legal standard,we conclude that judge hand formulation,understood in light of our subsequent case law on,most properly states the standard for aiding and abetting under the cea.
we recently reaffirmed peoni continued validity in sec apuzzo,cir,which found the standard helpful for determining aiding and abetting liability under the securities exchange act in reversing the district court dismissal of an sec complaint,we held that the substantial assistance prong of aiding and abetting under the act was commensurate with peoni.id.at.that is,in order to allege substantial assistance,the sec must plead,as peoni instructs,that the defendant associated himself with a violation of the act,participated in it as something that he wished to bring about,and sought by his actions to make the violation succeed.id.as the panel explained,judge hand standard has thus survived the test of time,is clear,concise,and workable,and governs the determination of aider and abettor liability in securities fraud cases.id.
apuzzo is also instructive on how this standard works in the context of rule b determinations.the apuzzo panel observed that a nexus exists between a defendant knowledge of,intent to further,and assistance given to a primary violation.id.at.that is to say,a complaint with weak allegations about a defendant affirmative assistance may still state a claim for aiding and abetting if its allegations about the defendant knowledge and intent are particularly strong,and vice versa.though the panel discussed this nexus within the context of the three discrete elements of aiding and abetting liability under section e,it also suggested that the approach equally applies to a standard like peoni.see id.at i f a jury were convinced that the defendant had a high degree of actual knowledge they would be well justified in concluding that the defendant actions,which perhaps could be viewed innocently in some contexts,were taken with the goal of helping the fraud succeed.we agree.such an evaluation of the different aspects of a defendant asserted relationship to the primary violator,consisting of the alleged aider and abettor knowledge of the primary violation,his intent to further it,and the actions supposedly undertaken to assist it,is inherent in determining whether the defendant in some sort associate d himself with the venture,that he participate d in it as in something that he wishe d to bring about,that he sought by his action to make it succeed.peoni,at.
thus,in sum,the standard for aiding and abetting liability under is the same as for criminal aiding and abetting under.the best articulation of this standard is that found in peoni.inherent in peoni articulation is a relationship between a defendant knowledge,intent,and the nature of assistance given.accordingly,in evaluating a complaint alleging the aiding and abetting of a violation of the cea,allegations about the defendant knowledge,intent,and actions should not be evaluated in isolation,but rather in light of the complaint as a whole.
commodities manipulation requires that defendants possessed an ability to influence market prices an artificial price existed defendants caused the artificial prices and defendants specifically intended to cause the artificial price.hershey,at see also diplacido cftc,app x,cir.there is thus no manipulation without intent to cause artificial prices.accordingly and because aiding and abetting requires knowledge of the primary violation and an intent to assist it,plaintiffs appellants were required to allege that futures knew that amaranth specifically intended to manipulate the price of nymex natural gas futures and that futures intended to help.looking at the amended complaint as a whole,we conclude that plaintiffs appellants allegations of such knowledge and intent,considered in connection with the routine services that futures allegedly provided to amaranth,fail to state a claim for aiding and abetting manipulation under the cea.
as stated earlier,plaintiffs appellants allege that amaranth manipulated the price of nymex natural gas futures in two ways the accumulation of large open positions that artificially propped up natural gas calendar spreads and its slamming the close trades.plaintiffs appellants allege that futures had knowledge of these manipulative schemes because it had information on amaranth daily trading activity and open positions on nymex and ice.this information also meant that futures knew when amaranth was in violation of nymex position limits or accountability levels.plaintiffs appellants further allege that futures performed multiple overt acts to assist amaranth in its manipulations,including the clearing of trades,the extension of credit,and assistance in moving positions from nymex to ice.according to the amended complaint,futures assisted amaranth because of the large commissions futures earned from the fund trading,as well as fees and interest it earned on the fund margin deposits.
with respect to plaintiffs appellants first theory of manipulation the building of large open positions the amended complaint alleges,at most,a very weak inference that futures actually knew of amaranth manipulative intent,much less that it intended to assist in carrying it out.this is for a simple reason while futures may have known about amaranth large positions in natural gas futures and swaps,such large positions do not necessarily imply manipulation.a trader may indeed acquire a large position in order to manipulate prices.but a trader may also acquire a large position in the belief that the price of the future will,for reasons other than the trader own activity,move in a favorable direction.in re crude oil commodity,civ,wl,june,declining to impute intent to manipulate market to defendants simply due to the size of their holdings.put differently,large positions can be indicative either of manipulation or of excessive speculation.the amended complaint contains no allegation from which we can draw the conclusion that a clearing broker like futures would know which is the goal of any particular large position held by a client.
this remains true even if a trader positions violate applicable position limits and accountability levels.as the cea explains,position limits and accountability levels are intended not only to prevent manipulation,but also to diminish,eliminate,or prevent excessive speculation,to ensure sufficient market liquidity for bona fide hedgers,and to ensure that the price discovery function of the underlying market is not disrupted.a b this makes sense excessive speculation,just as much as manipulation,can result in market illiquidity and artificial prices.if the violation of these restrictions does not necessarily entail manipulation,moreover,then neither should their evasion that a trader shifts contracts from nymex to ice in order to maintain a large open position,standing alone,does not reveal why the trader seeks that large position.
the amended complaint factual allegations illustrate these principles in action.by the start of the class period,amaranth had realized large profits from the high spread between winter and summer natural gas prices that occurred after hurricanes katrina and rita wreaked havoc on the gulf coast in.the positions amaranth then acquired were consistent with a belief that the same price pattern would happen again in.thus,while these positions could have suggested manipulative intent,they equally suggested undue confidence that recent history would repeat itself.this strains any inference that futures actually knew as opposed to,for example,that futures simply should have known that amaranth was manipulating nymex natural gas futures 
the allegations supporting plaintiffs appellants second theory of manipulation the slamming the close trades present a closer issue.in contrast to the acquisition of large open positions,futures has provided no obvious legitimate economic reason why amaranth would wait until the final minutes of trading to sell large quantities of a particular future.this type of trading activity,while not dispositive of manipulation,does strongly suggest it.indeed,the district court found that the timing of the sales are suspicious in themselves.amaranth i,d at.
still,per peoni and apuzzo,we must consider futures alleged knowledge and intent regarding amaranth slamming the close trades in connection with futures alleged actions.the amended complaint does not allege that futures did anything more to assist amaranth in these trades than to provide routine clearing firm services.as previous decisions from this circuit recognize,such allegations provide only weak evidence that futures associated itself with amaranth manipulation and participate d in it as in something that it wishe d to bring about.peoni,at.for example,in greenberg.bear,stearns we stated that the mere performance of routine clearing services can not constitute the aiding and abetting of fraud under new york law.see at quoting stander fin.clearing servs.and we have observed more recently that the performance of routine clearing services,without more,can not trigger primary liability under b of the securities exchange act.see levitt morgan,cir.
granted,greenberg and levitt did not involve commodities trading or the cea.their holdings need not control,however,for us to decide the present case.it suffices to conclude that in the circumstances presented here,the provision of routine clearing services,when combined only with allegations that the clearing firm knew of trading activity that was highly suggestive but not dispositive of manipulation,is not enough to state a claim for aiding and abetting under section of the cea 
plaintiffs appellants argue that the amended complaint also alleges that futures performed tasks to assist amaranth,including helping to transfer positions from nymex to ice,extending credit limits,and bypassing internal position limits.but these acts,even if they are,are alleged to have been performed only in connection with amaranth accumulation of large open positions.plaintiffs appellants do not allege that futures transferred positions,extended credit limits,or bypassed internal position limits in connection with amaranth slamming the close trades.without considering the relevance of such actions in other contexts,then,or in conjunction with other evidence of purposeful association with a primary violator,we need only observe here that futures allegedly performed these acts in connection with trading activity that was not as suggestive of manipulation as the slamming the close trades,weakening the force of such allegations in stating an aiding and abetting claim.
in sum,with respect to plaintiffs appellants first theory of manipulation,the amended complaint allegations allow only a weak inference that futures actually knew amaranth was manipulating natural gas futures through the acquisition of large open positions.this,when considered in connection with the amended complaint relatively weak allegations about futures assistance to amaranth,fails to state a claim that futures aided and abetted amaranth market manipulation by purposefully seeking by its own actions to make it succeed.similarly,while the amended complaint more plausibly alleges that futures actually knew amaranth slamming the close trades were manipulative,its allegations concerning futures assistance with those trades are even weaker.this too fails to state an aiding and abetting claim under the cea.
though plaintiffs appellants cite several decisions finding aiding and abetting liability under the cea,none are contrary to our conclusion here.all these decisions involved defendants who had either greater knowledge of the principal wrongdoing or more active involvement in that wrongdoing.in kohen pacific investment management,for example,the defendant allegedly aided and abetted a squeeze on treasury note futures by actually acquiring the dominant positions in those futures.the defendants in cftc johnson,meanwhile,were liable under section because they had allegedly forwarded emails they knew to contain false and misleading information about natural gas transactions.see d,see also in re global minerals metals,cftc,wl june,cftc order confirming settlement offer of defendant that allegedly provided both trading facilities and trading advice to principal manipulator.
nor does futures role as amaranth fcm change the outcome.plaintiffs appellants make generalized assertions that futures placed some of amaranth trading orders as did floo
