this appeal presents primarily two questions about the scope of federal securities laws whether,under b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,and securities and exchange commission rule rule,a corporation outside counsel can be liable for false statements that those attorneys allegedly create,but which are not attributed to the law firm or its attorneys at the time the statements were disseminated and whether plaintiffs claims that defendants participated in a scheme to defraud investors are foreclosed by the supreme court decision in stoneridge investment partners,llc,d.
pacific investment management company,llc and rh capital associates,llc jointly,plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york gerard lynch,judge dismissing their claims against mayer brown,llc mayer brown,a law firm,and joseph collins collins,a former partner at mayer brown.plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated federal securities laws in the course of representing the brokerage firm refco refco.specifically,they claimed that defendants facilitated fraudulent transactions between refco and third parties for the purpose of concealing refco uncollectible debt and drafted portions of refco security offering documents that contained false information.although defendants allegedly created false statements that investors relied upon,all of those statements were attributed to refco,and not mayer brown or collins,at the time of dissemination.
we hold that a secondary can be held liable in a private damages action brought pursuant to rule b only for false statements attributed to the defendant at the time of dissemination.absent attribution,plaintiffs can not show that they relied on defendants own false statements,and participation in the creation of those statements amounts,at most,to aiding and abetting securities fraud.we further hold that plaintiffs claims that defendants participated in a scheme to defraud investors are not meaningfully distinguishable from the claim at issue in stoneridge,and therefore were properly dismissed.
background 
in reviewing the district court dismissal of an action pursuant to.b,we accept as true the following nonconclusory allegations set forth in plaintiffs second amended complaint.see ashcroft iqbal,d south cherry street,llc hennessee group llc,cir.this case arises from the collapse of refco,which was once one of the world largest providers of brokerage and clearing services in the international derivatives,currency,and futures markets.according to plaintiffs,mayer brown served as refco primary outside counsel from until the company collapse.collins,a partner at mayer brown,was the firm primary contact with refco and the billing partner in charge of the refco account.refco was a lucrative client for mayer brown and collins largest personal client.
as part of its business model,refco extended credit to its customers so that they could trade on margin,trade in securities with money borrowed from refco.in the late,refco customers suffered massive trading losses and consequently were unable to repay hundreds of millions of dollars of margin loans extended by refco.concerned that properly accounting for these debts as would threaten the company survival,refco,allegedly with the help of defendants,arranged a series of sham transactions designed to conceal the losses.
specifically,plaintiffs allege that refco transferred its uncollectible debts to refco group holdings,rghi an entity controlled by refco chief executive exchange for a receivable purportedly owed from rghi to refco.recognizing that a large debt owed to it by a related entity would arouse suspicion with investors and regulators,refco,allegedly with the help of defendants,engaged in a series of sham loan transactions at the end of each quarter and each fiscal year to pay off the rghi receivable.it did so by loaning money to third parties,who then loaned the same amount to rghi,which in turn used the funds to pay off refco receivable.days after the fiscal period closed,all of the loans were repaid and the third parties were paid a fee for their participation in the scheme.the result of these circular transactions was that,at the end of financial periods,refco reported receivables owed to it by various third parties rather than the related entity rghi.
mayer brown and collins participated in seventeen of these sham loan transactions between and,representing both refco and rghi.according to plaintiffs,defendants involvement included negotiating the terms of the loans,drafting and revising the documents relating to the loans,transmitting the documents to the participants,and retaining custody of and distributing the executed copies of the documents.
plaintiffs also allege that defendants are responsible for false statements appearing in three refco documents an offering memorandum for an unregistered bond offering in july offering memorandum,a registration statement for a subsequent registered bond offering registration statement,and a registration statement for refco initial public offering of common stock in august ipo registration statement.each of these documents contained false or misleading statements because they failed to disclose the true nature of refco financial condition,which had been concealed,in part,through the loan transactions described above.
defendants allegedly participated in the creation of the false statements contained in each of the documents identified above.collins and other mayer brown attorneys allegedly reviewed and revised portions of the offering memorandum and attended drafting sessions.collins and another mayer brown attorney also personally drafted the management discussion analysis md a portion of the offering memorandum,which,according to plaintiffs,discussed refco business and financial condition in a way that defendants knew to be false.the offering memorandum was used as the foundation for the registration statement,which was substantially similar in content.according to plaintiffs,defendants further assisted in the preparation of the registration statement by reviewing comment letters from the securities and exchange commission sec and participating in drafting sessions.finally,plaintiffs allege that defendants were directly involved in reviewing and drafting the ipo registration statement because they received,and presumably reviewed,the sec comments on that filing.
both the offering memorandum and the ipo registration statement note that mayer brown represented refco in connection with those transactions.the registration statement does not mention mayer brown.none of the documents specifically attribute any of the information contained therein to mayer brown or collins.
plaintiffs,who purchased securities from refco during the period that defendants were allegedly engaging in fraud,commenced this action after refco declared bankruptcy in.they asserted claims for violation of b of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder,along with claims for control person liability under a of the exchange act,a.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims against mayer brown and collins pursuant to.b.see in re refco.sec,d.with respect to plaintiffs claim that defendants violated rule b by drafting and revising portions of refco public documents,the court found that no statements in those documents were attributed to defendants and that plaintiffs had therefore alleged conduct akin to aiding and abetting,for which securities laws provide no private right of action.see id.at.the district court also dismissed plaintiffs rule a and c claims for scheme liability upon concluding that the supreme court decision in stoneridge foreclosed that theory of liability.see id.at.finally,the district court dismissed plaintiffs a claims because plaintiffs failed adequately to plead an underlying violation of federal securities law.see id.at.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim,see.b,assuming all,nonconclusory factual allegations in the complaint to be true.see ashcroft iqbal,d selevan thruway,cir.
this appeal concerns the scope of the private right of action available under b of the exchange act and rule hereinafter,rule liability.section b makes it unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the securities and exchange commission may prescribe.b.rule,promulgated thereunder,provides as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
a to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
the supreme court has held that,to maintain a private damages action under b and rule,
a plaintiff must prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.
stoneridge,at citing dura,broudo,d.
this appeal raises primarily two issues regarding the scope of rule liability in private actions whether defendants can be liable under rule b for false statements that they allegedly drafted,but which were not attributable to them at the time the statements were disseminated and whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for scheme liability under rule a and c 
plaintiffs rule b claim 
plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in holding that attorneys who participate in the drafting of false statements can not be liable in a private damages action if the statements are not attributed to those attorneys at the time of dissemination.along with the sec as amicus curiae,plaintiffs argue that attribution is only one means by which attorneys and other secondary actors can incur liability for securities fraud.they urge us to adopt a creator standard and hold that a defendant can be liable for creating a false statement that investors rely on,regardless of whether that statement is attributed to the defendant at the time of dissemination.according to the sec,a person creates a statement if the statement is written or spoken by him,or if he provides the false or misleading information that another person then puts into the statement,or if he allows the statement to be attributed to him.brief for sec as amicus curiae supporting sec br.at 
defendants respond that,under our precedents,attorneys who participate in the drafting of false statements can not be liable absent explicit attribution at the time of dissemination.without attribution,defendants contend,secondary actors do not commit a primary violation of rule b and their conduct amounts,at most,to aiding and abetting.
analyzing the parties claims requires a brief history of the attribution requirement in our circuit.although we have often held that attribution is required for secondary actors to incur liability,we have for certain other defendants imposed no attribution requirement.compare wright ernst young llp,cir requiring attribution for outside accountant defendants,and lattanzio deloitte touche llp,cir same,with in re scholastic.sec,cir not requiring attribution for corporate insider defendant.upon reviewing this history and the guidance provided by the supreme court,we conclude that attribution is required for secondary actors to be liable in a private damages action for securities fraud under rule.
history of the attribution requirement 
the distinction between primary liability under rule and aiding and abetting became especially important after the supreme court decision in central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.that case involved the issuance of bonds by a public building authority and plaintiffs allegations that central bank of denver,the indenture trustee for the bond issues,aided and abetted the issuer in committing securities fraud by agreeing to delay an independent appraisal of the real property securing the bonds.id.at.after reviewing the text and history of b,the supreme court concluded that the exchange act does not itself reach those who aid and abet a b violation.id.at.to hold otherwise,it explained,would be to impose liability when at least one element critical for recovery under is absent reliance.id.at.
despite holding that rule liability does not extend to aiders and abettors,the supreme court acknowledged that secondary actors could,in some circumstances,still be liable for fraudulent conduct.id.at.specifically,the court explained that 
a ny person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under,assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under rule are met.in any complex securities fraud,moreover,there are likely to be multiple violators 
id.citation omitted.
we considered the effect of central bank on private securities litigation against secondary actors in shapiro cantor,cir.shapiro involved claims against the accounting firm deloitte touche and its for alleged complicity in the deceptive conduct of a limited partnership.id.at.we held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for a primary violation of securities laws against deloitte touche because 
a llegations of assisting,participating in,complicity in and similar synonyms used throughout the complaint all fall within the prohibitive bar of central bank.a claim under b must allege a defendant has made a material misstatement or omission indicating an intent to deceive or defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
id.at footnote omitted see also id.at i f central bank is to have any real meaning,a defendant must actually make a false or misleading statement in order to be held liable under section b.anything short of such conduct is merely aiding and abetting,and no matter how substantial that aid may be,it is not enough to trigger liability under section b.quoting in re mtc techs.shareholders.
the principle that central bank requires the attribution of false statements to the defendant at the time of dissemination first appeared in our decision in wright ernst young llp,at.wright involved claims against the accounting firm ernst young and allegations that the firm orally approved a corporation false and misleading financial statements,which were subsequently disseminated to the public.id.at.
we explained that,after central bank,courts had generally adopted either a bright line test or a substantial participation test to distinguish between primary violations of rule and aiding and abetting 
some courts have held that a third party review and approval of documents containing fraudulent statements is not actionable under section b because one must make the material misstatement or omission in order to be a primary violator.see,in re kendall square research corporation securities litigation,accountant review and approval of financial statements and prospectuses insufficient vosgerichian commodore international,allegations that accountant advised and guid ed client in making allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations insufficient.
other courts have held that third parties may be primarily liable for statements made by others in which the defendant had significant participation.see,in re software toolworks,cir accountant may be primarily liable based on its significant role in drafting and editing a letter sent by the issuer to the sec in re zzzz best securities litigation,an accounting firm that was intricately involved in the creation of false documents and their resulting deception is a primary violator of section b.
id.at quoting mtc.at alterations omitted.we noted that,in shapiro,we had followed the bright line approach.id.we therefore held that a secondary actor can not incur primary liability under rule for a statement not attributed to that actor at the time of its dissemination.id.wright also made clear that attribution is necessary to satisfy the reliance element of a private damages action under rule.id.reliance only on representations made by others can not itself form the basis of liability.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.because the misrepresentations on which plaintiffs claims were based were not attributed to ernst young,we held that the complaint failed to state a claim under rule.id.
despite wright seemingly clear requirement that false statements be attributed to the defendant,our subsequent decisions may have created uncertainty or ambiguity with respect to when attribution is required.in,in in re scholastic.securities litigation,we held that a corporate officer could be liable for misrepresentations made by the corporation,notwithstanding the fact that none of the statements at issue were specifically attributed to him.at.we explained that as vice president for finance and investor relations the defendant was primarily responsible for scholastic communications with investors and industry analysts.he was involved in the drafting,producing,reviewing disseminating of the false and misleading statements issued by scholastic during the class period.id.on that basis,we allowed plaintiffs claims against the defendant to proceed.our opinion in scholastic did not rely on,or even cite,wright or central bank and contained no discussion of the distinction between primary violations of rule and aiding and abetting.
since scholastic,district courts in our circuit have struggled to reconcile its holding with our earlier holding in wright.see,in re warnaco group.sec,d,distinguishing scholastic from wright on the ground that the former involved a corporate insider rather than an outside actor,aff sub nom.lattanzio,global crossing.sec,d,lynch,discussing the tension between wright and scholastic and noting that scholastic might indicate some relaxation of wright attribution requirement.several of our decisions have also held that corporate officers can be liable for false information provided to and disseminated by analysts,even if no statements are attributed to the corporate officers themselves.see rombach chang,cir novak kasaks,cir.like scholastic,these cases did not cite wright or central bank.
notwithstanding this uncertainty we recently confirmed the importance of attribution for claims against secondary actors.in,in lattanzio deloitte touche,we considered claims that the accounting firm deloitte touche had,inter alia,reviewed and approved false or misleading quarterly statements issued by a public company.at.we held that to state a claim against an issuer accountant,a plaintiff must allege a misstatement that is attributed to the accountant at the time of its dissemination,and can not rely on the accountant alleged assistance in the drafting or compilation of a filing.id.at quoting wright,at.we explained that imposing liability on accountants who review and approve misleading statements would be contrary to wright rejection of the substantial participation test.id.at.because the claims against deloitte touche were not based on the accountant articulated statement,we held that rule liability did not extend to the defendants.id.at under central bank,deloitte is not liable for merely assisting in the drafting and filing of the quarterly statements.emphasis added.
creator standard attribution standard 
plaintiffs and the sec urge us to adopt a creator standard that would require us to hold that a defendant can be liable for creating a false statement that investors rely on,regardless of whether that statement is attributed to the defendant at the time of dissemination.they argue that their proposed standard is consistent with the law of the circuit.they distinguish wright and lattanzio on the ground that the defendants in those cases were not alleged to have created the false statements in question,but rather,merely reviewed false statements created by others.plaintiffs and the sec contend that,notwithstanding the broad language that suggests attribution is always required,these cases are best read as holding that a defendant can be liable if he or she creates a false or misleading statement or allows a false statement to be attributed to him or her.their position finds some support in dicta from one of our recent cases.see united states finnerty,cir describing wright as holding that under central bank,a defendant can not incur primary liability for a statement neither made by him nor attributed to him at the time of its dissemination emphasis added quoting wright,at.
notwithstanding the dicta in united states finnerty,we reject the creator standard for secondary actor liability under rule.an attribution requirement is more consistent with the supreme court guidance on the question of secondary actor liability.furthermore,a creator standard is indistinguishable from the substantial participation test that we have disavowed since wright,and it is incompatible with our stated preference for a bright line rule.see wright,at.
accordingly,secondary actors can be liable in a private action under rule for only those statements that are explicitly attributed to them.the mere identification of a secondary actor as being involved in a transaction,or the public understanding that a secondary actor is at work behind the scenes are alone insufficient.see lattanzio,at.to be cognizable,a plaintiff claim against a secondary actor must be based on that actor own articulated statement,or on statements made by another that have been explicitly adopted by the secondary actor.see id.
attribution is consistent with stoneridge 
the supreme court has never directly addressed whether attribution at the time of dissemination is required for secondary actors to be liable in a private damages action brought pursuant to rule.nevertheless,the court recent decision in stoneridge is instructive.
the supreme court focus on reliance in stoneridge favors a rule,such as attribution,that is designed to preserve that element of the private right of action available under rule.see wright,at noting that an attribution requirement prevents plaintiffs from circumvent ing the reliance requirements of the exchange act.in stoneridge,which dealt primarily with deceptive conduct rather than false statements,the court rejected claims brought pursuant to rule against an issuing firm customers and suppliers.at.the court held that plaintiffs claims failed as a matter of law because plaintiffs could not demonstrate that they rel ied upon defendants own deceptive conduct and because i t was the issuing firm charter,not defendants,that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements.id.at emphasis added id.at reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant deceptive acts is an essential element of the private cause of action.emphasis added.we think that reasoning is consistent with an attribution requirement in the context of claims based on false statements.if a plaintiff must rely on a secondary actor own deceptive conduct to state a claim under rule a and c,it stands to reason that a plaintiff must also rely on a secondary actor own deceptive not on statements conveyed to the public through another source and not attributed to the state a claim under rule b.
more generally,stoneridge stands for the proposition that reliance is the critical element in private actions under rule.this general proposition,applied to the specific issue of secondary actor liability,further supports an attribution requirement.attribution is necessary to show reliance.where statements are publicly attributed to a national law or accounting firm,buyers and sellers of securities and the market generally are more likely to credit the accuracy of those statements.because of the firm imprimatur,individuals may be comforted by the supposedly impartial assessment and,accordingly,be induced to purchase a particular security.without explicit attribution to the firm,however,reliance on that firm participation can only be shown through an indirect chain too remote for liability.stoneridge,at.
attribution is consistent with our bright line approach 
the creator standard championed by plaintiffs and the sec can not be reconciled with our unambiguous rejection of a substantial participation test in favor of a bright line rule.in wright,we noted that some courts applying a substantial participation test had imposed liability on secondary actors based on their significant role in drafting and editing false documents or their intricate involv ment in the creation of false documents.see wright,at emphases added quoting a district court description of in re software toolworks,cir and in re zzzz best securities litigation.we went on to explain,however,that the second circuit had rejected a substantial participation test in favor of a bright line rule.id.
a creator standard is effectively indistinguishable from a substantial participation test.according to the sec,the creator standard would extend liability to secondary actors who supplied the writer with false or misleading information or caused a false or misleading statement to be made even if the statement disseminated to the public made no mention of the defendant.sec br.at,as we explained in lattanzio,however,a p ublic understanding that a secondary actor is at work behind the scenes does not create an exception to the requirement that an actionable misstatement be made by the secondary actor and u nless the public understanding is based on the secondary actor articulated statement,the source for that understanding does not matter.at emphasis added.insofar as a creator standard would impose liability on secondary actors,such as defendants here,for their role in drafting and editing false documents on behalf of an issuing firm,it would mark a radical departure from our precedents.
an attribution requirement,on the other hand,is consistent with our preference for a bright line rule distinguishing primary violations of rule from aiding and abetting.see wright,at explaining that,i n shapiro,we followed the bright line test.an attribution requirement makes secondary actors and investors those who sign or otherwise allow a statement to be attributed to them expose themselves to liability.those who do not are beyond the reach of rule private right of action.a creator standard establishes no clear boundary between primary violators and aiders and abettors,and it is uncertain what level of involvement might expose an individual to liability.even the sec struggles to define the precise contours of the creator standard,noting that a person would arguably not cause a misstatement where he merely gave advice to another person regarding what was required to be disclosed and then that person made an independent choice to follow the advice.sec br.at emphasis added.
a bright line rule such as an attribution requirement also has many benefits in application.an attribution requirement is relatively easy for district courts to apply and avoids protracted litigation and discovery aimed at learning the identity of each person or entity that had some connection,however tenuous,to the creation of an allegedly false statement.furthermore,as the supreme court has explained,securities law is an area that demands certainty and predictability.central bank,at quoting pinter dahl,d.uncertainty can lead to many undesirable consequences,f or example,newer and smaller companies may find it difficult to obtain advice from professionals.a professional may fear that a newer or smaller company may not survive and that business failure would generate securities litigation against the professional,among others.id.at.uncertainty also increases the costs of doing business and raising capital.see ralph winter,paying lawyers,empowering prosecutors,and protecting managers raising the cost of capital in america,duke,describing the need to avoid overbroad and amorphous doctrine and to craft legal rules with bright lines as a means of reducing the cost of capital and explaining that o verbreadth and uncertainty deter beneficial conduct and breed costly litigation emphasis added,cited with approval in central bank,at see also central bank,at a shifting and highly disposition of the issue of who may be liable for a damages claim for violation of rule is not a satisfactory basis for a rule of liability imposed on the conduct of business transactions.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.a creator standard would inevitably lead to uncertainty regarding the scope of rule liability and potentially deter beneficial conduct.see winter,ante,at o verdeterrence in regulating capital markets will deter activity that we wish to encourage.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that even if wright and lattanzio were not read explicitly to require attribution in every case,an attribution requirement is most consistent with our circuit preference for a bright line approach to the question of secondary actor liability.accordingly,we reject the creator standard advanced by plaintiffs and the sec and we reaffirm our jurisprudence in wright and,that a secondary actor can not incur primary liability under rule for a statement not attributed to that actor at the time of its dissemination.wright,at see lattanzio,at under central bank,a secondary actor is not liable for merely assisting in the drafting and filing of allegedly false statements.
application of the attribution requirement 
applying the attribution standard to the alleged false and misleading statements in this case,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs rule b claims against mayer brown and collins.no statements in the offering memorandum,the registration statement,or the ipo registration statement are attributed to collins,and he is not even mentioned by name in any of those documents.accordingly,plaintiffs can not show reliance on any of collins statements.see lattanzio,at wright,at imposing liability on secondary actors absent attribution would circumvent the reliance requirement of.
the offering memorandum and the ipo registration statement note that mayer brown,among other counsel,represented refco in connection with those transactions but neither document attributes any particular statements to mayer brown.mayer brown is not identified as the author of any portion of the documents.nor can the mere mention of the firm representation of refco be considered an articulated statement by mayer brown adopting refco statements as its own.see lattanzio,at.absent such attribution,plaintiffs can not show reliance on any statements of mayer brown.see id.at wright,at.
ii.plaintiffs rule a and c claims scheme liability 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs rule a and c claims on the ground that the supreme court decision in stoneridge foreclosed plaintiffs theory of scheme liability.we agree with the district court and we adopt its careful analysis of plaintiffs claims brought pursuant to rule a and c.see in re refco,d at.
in stoneridge,plaintiffs sought to hold two companies liable for their participation in sham transactions that allowed an issuer of securities to overstate its revenue.at.although the defendants conduct was deceptive and enabled the issuer to conceal the misrepresentations in its financial statements,the supreme court found that the essential element of reliance was absent.id.at.it explained that 
defendants deceptive acts were not communicated to the public.no member of the investing public had knowledge,either actual or presumed,of defendants deceptive acts during the relevant times.plaintiffs,as a result,can not show reliance upon any of defendants actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability.
see also id.at it was charter,not defendants,that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements nothing defendants did made it necessary or inevitable for charter to record the transactions as it did.
like the defendants in stoneridge,mayer brown and collins are alleged to have facilitated sham transactions that enabl
