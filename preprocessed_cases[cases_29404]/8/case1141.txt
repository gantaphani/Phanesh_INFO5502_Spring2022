a section of the new york public health law known as the wage parity law sets the minimum amount of total compensation that employers must pay home care aides in order to receive medicaid reimbursements for reimbursable care provided in new york city and westchester,suffolk,and nassau counties the surrounding counties.pub.health law c.the questions presented on appeal are whether the wage parity law is preempted by the national labor relations act nlra,or the employee retirement income security act of erisa,or is unconstitutional under the fourteenth amendment due process and equal protection clauses.we conclude that the wage parity law is neither preempted nor unconstitutional,and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court 
background 
a.the wage parity law 
t he provision of high quality home care services to residents of new york state is a priority concern of the new york legislature.pub.health law.to that end,the state public health law establishes a procedure for licensing home care services agencies lhcsas,which employ home care aides.id.home care aides fall into two main categories home health aides hhas and personal care aides pcas.see see also id.c d.both are qualified to assist patients in daily activities like maintaining personal hygiene and completing household tasks.see id.but hhas must undergo more extensive training than pcas,which allows them to perform other related supportive services essential to the patient health.rules regs.c see also id.b.
notwithstanding the additional training,by,hhas in new york city and the surrounding counties received a lower starting hourly wage than pcas.see carol rodat,new york home care aide workforce a framing paper available at.phi.known as wage inversion,this pay gap arose because many pcas serve lhcsas contracting directly with new york city and therefore benefit from the city living wage law,and because pcas unionized in greater numbers than hhas.id.at.a committee created by governor andrew cuomo to recommend changes to new york medicaid program proposed that lhcsas and other home care aide employers should be required to compensate all of their employees at a level commensurate with local living wage laws in order to receive medicaid reimbursements.see new york state department of health,proposals approved by the nys medicaid redesign team,available at lth last visited.although ultimately not endorsed by the full committee,the proposal was intended to address the inconsistency in wages among home care workers and thereby improve the recruitment and retention of home care aides.see new york state department of health,proposal number,proposals being rated,available at lth last visited.
in,the new york legislature enacted the wage parity law as part of a medicaid reform package.pub.health law c.this addition to the new york public health law requires lhcsas and other employers in new york city and the surrounding counties to pay all home care aides providing medicaidcovered care an applicable minimum rate of home care aide total compensation in order to receive medicaid reimbursements for that care.id.c see also id.c d defining h ome care aide to include home health aide s and personal care aide s.total compensation consists of all wages and other direct compensation paid to or provided on behalf of the employee,including health,education or pension benefits,supplements in lieu of benefits and compensated time off.id.c b.
subdivision three of the wage parity law establishes two applicable minimum rate s of home care aide total compensation one for care furnished in new york city and the other for care furnished in the surrounding counties.each applicable minimum rate increases gradually over the course of three or four years.in new york city,employers must pay home care aides at least ninety percent of the rate mandated by the city living wage law for services performed between march and february.id.c a i.that proportion increases to percent for services furnished between march and february.id.c a ii.from march onward,employers must pay the greater of the rate set by the city living wage law or the prevailing rate of total compensation as of january,id.c a iii.the p revailing rate of total compensation is the average hourly amount of total compensation paid to all home care aides covered by whatever collectively bargained agreement covers the greatest number of home care aides in new york city.id.c c.on january,the collective bargaining agreement that covered the greatest number of home care aides in new york city was the agreement negotiated by service employees international union seiu local.the wage parity law thus references seiu collective bargaining agreement as of january,to define the prevailing rate of total compensation,but does not reference any subsequent changes to that agreement.id.c a iii.
the applicable minimum rate of home care aide total compensation for services furnished in the surrounding counties follows a different schedule.id.c b.beginning in march,employers must pay home care aides in the surrounding counties at least ninety percent of the rate set by new york city living wage law.id.c b i.that rate continues until march,when it rises to percent of the new york city living wage rate.id.c b ii.the statute then requires two additional increases first to percent of the new york city living wage rate in march,id.c b iii,and then,in march,to the lesser of one percent of the rate set by the new york city living wage law or the living wage law of the county in which the care is provided,id.c b iv.
subdivision four of the wage parity law,in relevant part,provides that a ny portion of the minimum rate of home care aide total compensation attributable to health benefit costs or payments in lieu of health benefits,and paid time off,shall be superseded by the terms of any employer bona fide collective bargaining agreement in effect as of january,or a successor to such agreement,which provides for home care aides health benefits through payments to jointly administered funds.id.c.a jointly administered fund is also known as a taft hartley plan.as the district court noted,it is undisputed that by incorporating new york city living wage rate,the total compensation referred to in subdivision four includes a specific hourly amount attributed to health benefit costs at the time of the district court opinion.concerned home care providers cuomo,d.subdivision four thus provides that,for the purposes of the wage parity law,any portion of the minimum rate of home care aide total compensation attributable to such benefits or wage supplements will be superceded in the case of an applicable taft hartley plan by its relevant terms,and such employers can accordingly compensate their home care aides at a rate below the minimum prescribed in the wage parity law.
procedural history 
plaintiffs appellants are five lhcsas and a trade association of home care agencies plaintiffs.they filed suit on february,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,seeking to prevent defendant appellee nirav shah,the commissioner of the new york state department of health,from enforcing the wage parity law the complaint alleges that the law is either preempted by the national labor relations act nlra,et,or the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,or is unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and,on september,the district court granted the motion in part,denied it in part,and entered final judgment.see concerned home care providers,d at.the court concluded that the nlra does not preempt the wage parity law,and that the law does not violate plaintiffs fourteenth amendment rights.see id.at.however,the court determined that subdivision four which excuses grandfathered collective bargaining agreements that include taft hartley plans from complying with certain aspects of the wage parity law runs afoul of erisa express preemption provision because it singles out only one type of erisa plan for unique treatment.id.at quoting mackey lanier collection agency.the court then turned to the severability provisions enacted contemporaneously with the wage parity law,as well as those in the public health law,and decided that subdivision four could be excised from the wage parity law.see id.at.because plaintiffs did not argue that erisa preempts other portions of the law,and because the parties did not request discovery,the district court granted plaintiffs requested relief as to subdivision four,dismissed the remainder of their claims,and entered final judgment.see id.at.
discussion 
plaintiffs now ask this court to decide whether the wage parity law is preempted by the nlra or erisa,or violates their fourteenth amendment rights we review the district court dismissal of their claim de novo,accepting the complaint factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.starr int l fed.reserve bank of,cir.we conclude that neither the nlra nor erisa excepting subdivision four preempts the wage parity law and that the law does not violate plaintiffs constitutional rights.the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed 
nlra preemption 
the nlra does not contain an express preemption provision.instead,t he doctrine of labor law concerns the extent to which congress has placed implicit limits on the permissible scope of state regulation of activity touching upon relations.dep t of labor,emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted.
one form of implied preemption under the nlra,known as machinists preemption,forbids states and localities from intruding upon the labormanagement bargaining process.lodge int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,afl cio.emp t relations comm n.this doctrine rel ies on the understanding that in providing in the nlra a framework for and collective bargaining,congress determined both how much the conduct of unions and employers should be regulated,and how much it should be left unregulated.metro.life ins.massachusetts.sections and of the nlra guarantee employees the right to organize and engage in other forms of protected concerted action,and identify forms of unfair labor practices,a b.the remaining aspects of the bargaining process are left to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.machinists,at internal quotation marks omitted.for a state to define what economic sanctions might be permitted negotiating parties in an ideal or balanced state of collective bargaining is therefore denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that congress meant him to have available.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as the supreme court made clear in metropolitan life,t he framework established in the nlra was merely a means to allow the parties to reach agreement fairly.at see.the statute concern with establishing an equitable process for determining terms and conditions of employment does not extend to the particular substantive terms of the bargain that is struck.metro.life,at emphasis added citing archibald cox,recent developments in federal labor law preemption,ohio.
in contrast to their inability to regulate the bargaining process,states have traditionally possessed broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship,and the substantive labor standards that they enact set a baseline for employment negotiations.decanas sica,see also fort halifax packing coyne,p should not be lightly inferred,since the establishment of labor standards falls within the traditional police power of the state.such m inimum state labor standards affect union and nonunion employees equally,and neither encourage nor discourage the collective bargaining processes that are the subject of the nlra.metro.life,at.instead,they simply give specific minimum protections to individual workers.id.
the wage parity law is a valid exercise of new york authority to set minimum labor standards.states have traditionally sought to remedy the problem of depressed wages by regulating payment rates,and those efforts are not incompatible with the general goals of the nlra.id.at.the wage parity law,which stabilizes minimum wages for the hundreds of thousands of home care aides in new york city and the surrounding counties,is an unexceptional exercise of that traditional power.unlike the nlra,the law is not designed to encourage or discourage employees in the promotion of their interests collectively.id.at.all home care aides in new york city and the surrounding counties benefit from the statute minimum rate of compensation it neither distinguishes between unionized and aides,nor treats employers differently based on whether they employ unionized workers by applying only to medicaidreimbursed care,moreover,the wage parity law is limited to funds over which congress has granted the state a special measure of discretion to craft programs that are responsive to the needs of its communities.cmty.health care ass of shah,cir see also metro.life,at an appreciation of the state interest in regulating a certain kind of conduct may still be relevant in determining whether congress in fact intended the conduct to be unregulated.
although fixing a minimum rate of compensation restricts the terms over which employers and employees may negotiate,the mere fact that a state statute pertains to matters over which the parties are free to bargain can not support a claim of.fort halifax,at.after all,these parties traditionally come to the bargaining table with rights under state law that form a backdrop for their negotiations.id.internal quotation marks omitted.for that reason,in rondout electric,new york department of labor,cir,we upheld a regulation implementing of the new york labor law,which requires employers on public works projects to pay employees an amount equal to the prevailing rate of similarly employed workers in the locality,either in the form of benefits or wages.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.although setting a minimum wage indirectly affects how employers and employees bargain,we concluded that the law is not preempted under the machinists doctrine because it does not favor or disfavor collective bargaining,eliminate particular bargaining tools,or dictate the details of particular contract negotiations.id.at.
the wage parity law mandate that home care aides be paid a minimum rate of total compensation is no different.by setting a total compensation floor,the law may affect the package of benefits over which employers and employees can negotiate,but it does not limit the rights of or collective bargaining protected by the nlra,and is not preempted by that act.metro.life,at.
plaintiffs contend that the wage parity law is unique because it applies only to home care aides in new york city and the surrounding counties.machinists preemption does not,however,eliminate state authority to craft minimum labor standards for particular regions or areas of the labor market.for instance,of the new york labor law,which we addressed in rondout,applies only to employees on public works projects and sets the minimum wage based on the prevailing compensation rate in the locality.rondout,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.other circuits have also upheld local ordinances establishing substantive worker protections in particular industries.see,hospitality ass city of providence,cir upholding local regulation that requires new hospitality employers to retain employees.serv.contractors coal.dist.of columbia,upholding local regulation that applies to employees performing food,janitorial,maintenance,or nonprofessional health care services.and the supreme court has never applied machinists preemption to a state law that does not regulate the mechanics of labor dispute resolution.compare,fort halifax,at upholding severance law that applies only to businesses with or more employees,with machinists,at striking down state law that penalized concerted refusals to work overtime.even assuming,arguendo,that there may be labor standards that are so finely targeted that they impermissibly intrude upon the process the wage parity law,which simply sets a minimum rate of compensation for the hundreds of thousands of home care aides who provide care in new york city and the surrounding counties,is no such law.
plaintiffs also raise two objections to the mechanisms by which the wage parity law calculates the minimum rate of home care aide total compensation.neither argument alters our conclusion.first,plaintiffs contend that,because the minimum rate of total compensation is pegged to new york city living wage law,employees can lobby the city government for higher wages.but the ability to lobby is present with regard to any state law that substantively regulates employment conditions.fort halifax,at.machinists preemption is not a license for courts to close political routes to workplace protections simply because those protections may also be the subject of collective bargaining.id.at.
the second objection that calculating the prevailing rate of total compensation based on the largest collective bargaining agreement covering home care aides in new york city reduces incentives to bargain in the future is similarly unpersuasive.the wage parity law uses the prevailing rate of total compensation as of january,and that prevailing rate can not be used to set the minimum rate of total compensation until march at the earliest.pub.health law c a iii emphasis added.any changes to the largest collective bargaining agreement that might occur after january,have no effect on the rate mandated by the wage parity law.unions,individual employees,and employers therefore remain free to bargain about how to allocate total compensation between wages and other benefits and whether a compensation rate above the january,level is appropriate.the wage parity law use of the largest collective bargaining agreement to set the prevailing rate of total compensation has no more of an effect on incentives to bargain collectively than if the legislature wrote a rate directly into the statute.
the district court correctly decided that the nlra does not preempt the wage parity law.because we uphold the law as a minimum labor standard,we need not,and do not,address defendants argument that the law can also be upheld on the ground that the state actions are proprietary,rather than regulatory.
erisa preemption 
before the district court,plaintiffs argued that erisa preempts the wage parity law because subdivision four singles out taft hartley plans for special treatment.the district court agreed and defendants did not appeal that ruling,but severed subdivision four from the statute rather than invalidating the entire law.see concerned home care providers,d at.plaintiffs now urge us to find the remainder of the wage parity law preempted,either because subdivision four is not severable or because erisa separately preempts the law other provisions.we disagree with both arguments.
to begin with,the district court was correct to sever subdivision four from the wage parity law.severability is a question of state law and,in new york,turns on whether the legislature would have wished the statute to be enforced with the invalid part exscinded,or rejected altogether.greater metro.food council,giuliani,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the new york legislature intent is clear.the wage parity law was enacted in part h of chapter of the session laws of new york state.section of that same part states that,if any subdivision of the act shall be adjudged invalid,the judgment shall not invalidate the remainder thereof,but shall be confined in its operation to the subdivision directly involved.by severing subdivision four,the district court properly followed this clear statutory command.moreover,we agree with the district court that,without subdivision four,the wage parity law will still accomplish the legislative purpose of aligning home care aide compensation in the new york city metropolitan area.
with subdivision four severed,erisa does not preempt the remainder of the wage parity law.unlike the nlra,erisa contains an express provision that preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a emphasis added.the supreme court has fashioned this expansive language into a test a state law is preempted if it has a connection with or reference to an erisa plan.liberty mut.ins.donegan,cir quoting shaw delta air lines,emphasis omitted.
the language of erisa preemption clause is broadly worded.nonetheless,the supreme court has cautioned against preempting state action in fields of traditional state regulation,and has assumed that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.state conf.of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,internal quotation marks omitted.erisa is designed to regulate employee welfare and pension benefit plans.it does this not by requiring employers to provide any given set of minimum benefits,but instead by control ling the administration of benefits plans through reporting and disclosure mandates.id.at.as a result,while its preemption provision sweep s more broadly than state laws dealing with reporting,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like,its basic thrust is to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted see also liberty,at.the statute does not preempt state laws that have only an indirect economic effect on erisa plans.liberty,at internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs first contend that the wage parity law has a connection with erisa plans because employers will have to reevaluate,and possibly enhance,their benefits packages in order to pay employees the applicable minimum rate of home care aide total compensation.both the supreme court and this court have held that such an indirect effect on erisa plans does not trigger preemption.instead,only statutes that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration have impermissible connection s with erisa plans.travelers,at see also cal.div.of labor standards enf.dillingham.the supreme court has,for instance,upheld state laws that require payment of a prevailing wage to certain apprentices on public works projects,see dillingham,at,and that impose surcharges on hospital bills for patients not covered by blue shield plans,travelers,at.both laws have an indirect economic influence on how plan administrators structure plans,but do not bind plan administrators to any particular choice and thus function as a regulation of an erisa plan itself.dillingham,at see also travelers,at.
