this appeal is from the district court award of million in attorneys fees to several groups of plaintiffs attorneys who achieved a class action settlement agreement.it presents the question of what source of law governs the award of such fees in a diversity suit,where the parties settlement agreement contains,inter alia,a provision expressly stating that the parties have not agreed on the source of law to apply to the fee award.we hold that under these circumstances,where there is an agreement that the defendants will pay reasonable fees,state law governs the award of fees.we vacate the fee award,which was based on federal sources of law,and remand for a new determination of the proper reasonable fee award under the relevant state law.
a.the lawsuit 
this suit arises out of alleged engine defects in certain volkswagen and audi vehicles,which plaintiffs asserted were prone to the formation of damaging engine sludge unless particular types of motor oil were used.five putative statewide class actions were filed in five federal district courts,alleging,among other claims,consumer fraud and unfair and deceptive trade practices.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension,d.on august,these suits were consolidated by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation and,as multidistrict litigation mdl cases,were transferred to the district of massachusetts for pretrial proceedings id.at.the massachusetts district court ordered the plaintiffs to file and serve a consolidated amended complaint.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension.
plaintiffs filed their second amended consolidated complaint on october.the factual allegations underlying the complaint were that the liter engines contained in to model audi vehicles and to model volkswagen passat vehicles were defectively designed,and that the defendants concealed this defect.the plaintiffs sought to bring claims on behalf of all persons or entities in the united states who are current or former owners lessees of those particular vehicles.the complaint named as defendants volkswagen of america,a new jersey corporation,volkswagen of america,audi of america,a new jersey corporation,the domestic distributors of the vehicles,as well as volkswagen ag and audi ag,two german corporations.
the second amended complaint raised a number of legal theories of recovery,including that defendants had violated the new jersey consumer fraud act,stat.ann.et,and other state consumer fraud statutes that are the same or substantially similar to the new jersey law.the complaint also alleged breach of contract,breach of implied warranty of merchantability,unjust enrichment,and violation of certain california laws.the complaint stated that diversity subject matter jurisdiction was proper under the class action fairness act of,d,d,and sought a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,actual and treble damages,restitution,and an award of costs,including attorneys fees 
on october,a special master was appointed to supervise all aspects of discovery,to decide all nondispositive pretrial motions,to make recommendations as to all dispositive motions,and to assist the parties in any settlement efforts.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension.
at some point,serious settlement discussions between the parties began,and on december,the special master reported that the parties seem ed very close to reaching an agreement.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension.on may,the special master reported that the parties had begun drafting a proposed settlement agreement and associated documents.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension.may.
b.the settlement agreement 
on september,a proposed settlement agreement was submitted to the district court,along with a motion requesting conditional approval of the settlement and certification of a class for settlement purposes.the final settlement as approved by the court did not change the terms of the proposed settlement.so we discuss several material portions of the proposed settlement the benefits obtained by the class,the appointment of a settlement administrator,the terms as to attorneys fees,and the choice of law provision.
the settlement stated it was not an admission by defendants of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever.the settlement class consisted of all current and former owners and lessees of model year audi vehicles or model year volkswagen passat vehicles equipped with liter turbo engines,comprising a total of vehicles.the proposed settlement offered several benefits to the class,including payment for engine repair or replacement costs,a warranty extension for a subset of the vehicles,a oil change discount for a subset of the vehicles,and an education and information program designed to inform class members of the risks to their engines and means to prevent those risks.the proposed settlement did not place a monetary value on these benefits.
the proposed settlement created an oil sludge settlement administrator to oversee the claims process for class members.the administrator was to record every claim for reimbursement,to determine whether the claim was to be allowed or denied,and to explain the basis for any claim that was denied.
the proposed settlement contained a procedure for providing notice to all settlement class members of the certification and fairness hearing and the settlement agreement.notice of the proposed settlement was to be prepared by defendants,reviewed and approved by class counsel,and disseminated by the settlement administrator.
the proposed settlement also reserve d to the district c ourt exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this action,the p arties,and this settlement agreement for purposes of administering,supervising,construing,and enforcing this settlement agreement.
most relevant to this appeal,the proposed settlement contained a section regarding attorney fees and costs.it provided 
class counsel will submit an application to the court for an award of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses on or before a date to be set by the court fee application.each settling party reserves all rights to appeal from a class counsel fees and expenses award if that party files a timely and proper objection with the court.the class counsel fees and expenses award and final judicial approval shall be separate so that the appeal of one shall not constitute an appeal from the other.
subject to section above,class counsel fees and expenses shall be paid entirely and exclusively by defendants and shall not diminish,invade,or reduce,or be derived from,benefits afforded to settlement class members under this settlement agreement.
any class counsel fees and expenses awarded shall be paid by defendants to class counsel within thirty days of the entry of a final judgment or order by the court with respect to class counsel fees and expenses,except in the event of an appeal,all matters pertaining to an award of class counsel fees and expenses including,but not limited to,any dispute amongst counsel as to their respective attorneys fees and expenses,have been referred to the special master.the special master recommendation with respect to class counsel fees and expenses shall be made to the court 
section of the proposed agreement provided 
it is expressly understood and confirmed that the parties have not agreed to any choice,selection or waiver of state or federal law to be applied to any aspect of the construction,preliminary or final approval,or application of any provision of this agreement of settlement,including but not limited to attorney fees and costs.
the attorneys fees provision expressly states that it is subject to this section.
notice of the proposed settlement with statement about attorneys fees 
on september,the special master issued a recommendation that the district court conditionally approve a class for settlement purposes only and conditionally approve the proposed settlement agreement,with a hearing on the final agreement to be held on march,after notice of the settlement was sent to class members.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension,wl,at,the district court adopted this recommendation in full.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension,wl.
on december,notice of the proposed settlement was mailed to class members,see.e,whose names and addresses were determined by use of volkswagen and audi vehicle identification numbers on record in each state registry of motor vehicles throughout the united states.the proposed settlement agreement provided that the notice was to be drafted by the defendants and reviewed and approved by class counsel,and this procedure appears to have been followed.the notice contained a section addressing the question how will the lawyers be paid that section stated 
class counsel will ask the court for up to million for attorneys fees and up to approximately million for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution and settlement of these actions.the defendants do not dispute class counsel entitlement to an appropriate fee and reimbursement for cost and expenses,but may oppose the amounts requested by class counsel.the defendants will pay whatever attorneys fees and costs and expenses that the court awards without reducing or limiting any of the benefits available to settlement class members.
d.the request for attorneys fees 
on december,class counsel submitted a request for million in attorneys fees,for all attorneys working for plaintiffs as well as costs not to exceed million,under federal rule of civil procedure h.class counsel argued that federal law governed the award of fees.see.h in a certified class action,the court may award reasonable attorney fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties agreement.the argument was that the court should apply the percentage of fund methodology for determining the size of an appropriate fee award,the settlement value was at least million,and million was a reasonable percentage of the value of the settlement.an exhibit outlining the hours expended by class counsel on the suit was provided so that the court could perform a lodestar cross check.based on the hours that class counsel spent on the case they argued that a fee award of million would be reasonable under the lodestar method.
the defendants did not argue that the court should award no attorneys fees at all but strongly opposed the argument that federal law could apply,arguing that any fee award would only be proper under new jersey statute,not federal law.defendants also opposed class counsel fee calculation methodology.they argued that the settlement value could not be determined until after june,when certain reimbursement claims would be due.defendants that said this was particularly necessary as their expert valued the settlement at only approximately million,as opposed to the over million valuation of plaintiffs expert.
on february,the special master issued a report and recommendation which,after finding that federal law governed the attorneys fees award and that the new jersey statute was irrelevant,recommended an award of million in attorneys fees and approximately million in costs.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension,wl,at.on march,the defendants duly filed objections to the recommended fee award and preserved all of the arguments they make on appeal.
the district court held a hearing on both the proposed settlement agreement and the attorneys fees award on march,see.e,h,where defendants again argued that state law must govern the fee award.
on march,the district court issued two opinions.in the first opinion,the district court approved the proposed settlement in re volkswagen audi warranty extension.no appeal has been taken from the approval of the settlement.
in the second opinion,the district court adopted,virtually verbatim,the special master recommendation that the court award million in attorneys fees and approximately million in costs and expenses.in re volkswagen audi warranty extension,d.
the district court applied federal law to determine the amount of fees to award,for two reasons.first,the district court found that where,as here,a fee award is a result of the parties private agreement,federal law governs the decision.id.at.second,the court explained that a fee award pursuant to the state statutes would not be appropriate because plaintiffs would not be prevailing parties within the meaning of those statutes.id.at.the district court also noted that i n the context of a class action settlement in the first circuit,however,fees may be awarded,as part of the court equitable powers over such settlement agreements,from a fund created to benefit the class.id.at.
the district court then applied the percentage of fund method,finding that a million award would be a reasonable percentage of the value of the settlement,against the parties experts estimation at somewhere between million defendants expert and million class counsel expert revised estimate.id.at.the court did not determine the value of the settlement.
the district court also said it applied a lodestar cross check,taking the hours spent by class counsel,reducing those hours by for unnecessary hours,and multiplying the remaining hours by per hour to produce a base lodestar value of id.at.the district court then a ssum ed a multiplier of,which would result in a lodestar value of,which the district court said supported its determination that million in fees was a reasonable percentage of the value of the settlement.id.at.
defendants appealed the award of fees.they also filed a motion to vacate,alter,or amend the fee award under rules b,e,and b,which again argued,among other points,that the district court should have applied new jersey rather than federal law to determine the value of the fee award.the district court denied the motion,in re volkswagen audi warranty extension.july,and the defendants separately appealed that order.
we review a district court determination regarding attorney fees for abuse of discretion.airframe,l commc ns,cir.that said,mistakes of law always constitute abuses of a court discretion,and in addition,we will set aside a fee determination if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight,relied upon an improper factor,or evaluated all the proper factors and no improper ones,but made a serious mistake in weighing them.id.alteration in original quoting gay officers action league puerto rico,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the issue of whether a district court may use a given methodology in structuring an award of attorneys fees is one of law,and,thus,is subject to de novo review.in re thirteen appeals arising out of the san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir.
defendants raise two primary arguments in challenging the attorneys fees award first,defendants claim that the district court erred in applying general principles,rather than state law,to determine the amount of attorneys fees to which class counsel were entitled.second,defendants claim that even if federal law applied,the district court made a number of errors of law and fact in its determination of the fee award.
because the court erred as a matter of law in applying principles instead of the relevant state law,we do not reach the defendants other claim of error.we vacate the fee award and remand for application of massachusetts law principles,as described below.
a.the settlement agreement and choice of law 
we typically review the district court interpretation of a settlement agreement de novo,and do so here.see ricci patrick,cir,cooperativa de seguros de vida de,cir.we also review choice of law issues de novo.see robidoux muholland,cir choice of law determinations are questions of law,which we also review de novo.see also torre brickey,cir per curiam whether state or federal law applies to a particular issue in a diversity action is a question of law which we also review de novo.
the settlement agreement 
it is axiomatic that,under the american rule,e ach litigant pays his own attorney fees,win or lose,unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.hardt reliance standard life ins,see also alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,discussing exceptions to the american rule.
here,the defendants agreed to pay reasonable attorneys fees as part of the settlement agreement.the agreement first provides that class counsel will submit an application to the court for an award of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.the agreement goes on to provide that class counsel fees and expenses shall be paid entirely and exclusively by defendants and shall not diminish,invade,or reduce,or be derived from,benefits afforded to settlement class members under this settlement agreement.the agreement further states that a ny class counsel fees and expenses awarded shall be paid by defendants to class counsel within thirty days of the entry of a final judgment or order by the court with respect to class counsel fees and expenses.
this language makes clear that the defendants agreed to pay reasonable attorneys fees and expenses further,the notice sent to the class made clear that t he defendants do not dispute class counsel entitlement to an appropriate fee and reimbursement for cost and expenses.
however,the settlement agreement expressly disclaims any agreement between the parties as to what choice of law governs the award of attorneys fees 
it is expressly understood and confirmed that the parties have not agreed to any choice,selection or waiver of state or federal law to be applied to any aspect of the construction,preliminary or final approval,or application of any provision of this agreement of settlement,including but not limited to attorney fees and costs.
the fee award here is based on the agreement and not on any statute,federal or state.the question then is what source of law governs the fee award.the district court incorrectly concluded that federal law governed.
to determine the source of law that governs the settlement agreement in this diversity case,we engage in a inquiry.first,we evaluate whether under the erie doctrine,see erie tompkins,federal or state law governs the matter.this assessment is made first because a lthough state law generally supplies the rules of decision in federal diversity cases,it does not control the resolution of issues governed by federal statute.budinich becton dickinson,citations omitted see also const.art.vi,cl.supremacy clause sun oil wortman,it is never the case under erie that either federal or state law if the two differ can properly be applied to a particular issue erie,at except in matters governed by the federal constitution or by acts of congress,the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.
second,if state law governs,and a choice of law must be made,we determine which state law applies by applying the choice of law rules of the forum state subject to the complexities of mdl litigation.see servicios comerciales andinos,del caribe,cir a federal court sitting in diversity first determines whether a particular matter is procedural or substantive for erie purposes only if the matter is procedural does federal law apply if substantive,the court follows the law of the forum state and if a choice of law must be made,the federal court applies the law that would be applied under the conflict of laws rules of the forum state.
federal law does not govern the award of reasonable attorneys fees 
state law,rather than federal law,governs the determination of the award of attorneys fees in this case.
as a general matter,interpreting settlement agreements and their scope is a matter of state contract law.fábrica de muebles álvarez,inversiones mendoza,cir see also,fanning potter,cir same in re chira,cir same howmedica osteonics wright med,same 
we also start with the basic premise that the issue of attorneys fees has long been considered for erie purposes to be substantive and not procedural,and so principles normally govern the award of fees.see iom brown forman,cir where,as here,the court jurisdiction is based on diversity of the parties,a district court award of attorneys fees is governed by relevant state law titan holdings syndicate,city of keene,cir same heel compo,cir same see also,northon rule,cir per curiam same scottsdale ins.tolliver,cir same chin chrysler llc,cir same.
class counsel defend the choice of principles on two grounds first,that rule h,provides a basis for federal law governing the award of attorneys fees and second,in a qualitatively different argument,that federal courts inherent equitable powers provide a basis for applying principles to the award of attorneys fees.we reject each argument and hold that state law applies to interpretation of the settlement agreement.
apparently attempting to argue in this case that the award is procedural under erie,class counsel point to rule h.we reject the argument that rule h provides a basis for applying principles to the award of attorneys fees here.rule h provides in a certified class action,the court may award reasonable attorney fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties agreement.h.the advisory committee notes make plain that t his subdivision does not undertake to create new grounds for an award of attorney fees or nontaxable costs.instead,it applies when such awards are authorized by law or by agreement of the parties.advisory committee notes on the amendment.the text does not say such awards have to be governed by federal fee award principles.
rule h does not provide a grant of authority to apply federal law to award attorneys fees in class actions rather it allows the federal court to make fee awards where they are authorized by law or by the parties agreement.h see also wright,miller,kane,federal practice procedure,at ed noting that the power of the court to award attorney fees in a class action does not derive from the rule itself.the first portion is of no help to class counsel other than certain equitable doctrines,discussed below,they do not claim any federal law authorizes an award of fees here.the portion of rule h authorizing fee awards pursuant to the parties agreement does not here provide a basis governing the award.the settlement agreement itself has no agreement that federal law applies.
it is clear that rule h does not undertake to create new grounds for an award of attorney fees or nontaxable costs.advisory committee notes on the amendment.as a result,rule h is not sufficently broad to cause a direct collision with the state law or,implicitly,to control the issue before the court,thereby leaving no room for the operation of that law.burlington woods,quoting walker armco steel.because there is no conflict between rule h and application of principles to determine the award,class counsel reliance on shady grove orthopedic associates,allstate insurance,is inapposite.
no inherent federal equitable powers 
the district court erred in finding that it had inherent federal equitable powers to fashion an attorneys fee award.
this based on inherent equitable powers argument is not an argument,like the rule argument,that the determination of the award is a matter of procedural law.further,the argument is based on a series of cases which rest on federal question jurisdiction,not diversity jurisdiction.see boeing van gemert,alyeska,hall cole,mills auto lite.
the basis for the award here is the agreement itself,a contract under state law,and not federal law.the fact that attorneys fees are provided for by the settlement agreement is one of several reasons why there is no basis to resort to these federal equitable doctrines.united states ex rel.bogart king,cir where plaintiffs attorneys are awarded fees under statutory regime,there is no need to resort to the common fund doctrine because there is no iniquity to redress given that the defendants paid attorneys fees.
beyond that,this is not a common fund or a common benefit case,and so equitable powers to award attorneys fees are unavailable under those theories.the common fund method should apply only where attorneys seek compensation from a discernable pot of money won by the plaintiffs.see in re thirteen appeals,at see also boeing,at explaining that the common fund doctrine may apply where each member of a certified class has an undisputed and mathematically ascertainable claim to part of a judgment recovered on his behalf,and noting that the doctrine rests on the court j urisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation emphasis added.here,there is no discernable pot.
in any event,the reasonable fees class counsel will receive come not out of the settlement proceeds but are in addition to the settlement proceeds rendering the common fund method inapplicable.see boeing,at for the common fund doctrine to apply,there must be reason for confidence that the costs of litigation could indeed be shifted with some exactitude to those benefiting from the litigation alteration in original quoting alyeska,at internal quotation mark omitted.
by the same token,the common benefit method is unavailable here because this is not a case in which the cost of the fees is being spread around among the parties benefitted the fees are on top of the benefits.see alyeska,at noting that i n this court and decisions there was reason for confidence that the costs could indeed be shifted with some exactitude to those benefiting mills,at stating that the substantial benefit doctrine applies where the court jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit makes possible an award that will operate to spread the costs proportionately among the class members see also savoie merchants bank,cir the common fund doctrine does not apply,however,when fees are sought from the assets of the losing party,and the fee award would not come from a common fund nor be assessed against persons who have derived benefit from the lawsuit.
horizontal choice of state law 
having concluded that state law governs,we turn to the question of which state choice of law principles law applies to determine which state attorneys fees law applies.
in a diversity case,u nder klaxon stentor electric,a court ordinarily must apply the rules of the state in which it sits.piper aircraft reyno,see also auto,llc.indem,cir a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must employ the principles of the forum state.
special rules apply in mdl cases as to determining the forum state.here,the litigation in massachusetts was consolidated from suits filed in federal district courts in multiple states and transferred to the district of massachusetts under.in re volkswagen,d at.where a suit is consolidated and transferred under,courts typically apply the choice of law rules of each of the transferor courts see chang baxter healthcare,cir when a diversity case is transferred by the multidistrict litigation panel,the law applied is that of the jurisdiction from which the case was transferred in re air disaster at ramstein air base,ger.lockheed,cir where a transferee court presides over several diversity actions consolidated under the multidistrict rules,the choice of law rules of each jurisdiction in which the transferred actions were originally filed must be applied.in re korean air lines disaster of,mikva,dissenting when a case is transferred pursuant to a by the panel on multi district litigation,the transferee court must apply the choice of law rules of the states where the transferor courts sit.phelps cont l.bank trust of chi.in re nucorp energy sec.litig,cir in this case,however,we must apply the choice of law rules of illinois because the claims were originally filed in district court in illinois before they were transferred to california by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.see also wright,miller,cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed.in actions transferred under section for consolidated pretrial discovery,the transferee court should apply the substantive law of the transferor state,including its rules.
this approach is consistent with the supreme court holding that where a case is transferred pursuant to a,a court must apply the rules of the state from which the case was transferred.piper aircraft,at see also ferens john deere,holding that the choice of law rules of the transferor court apply regardless of whether the defendant or the plaintiff moves for the transfer under a.
here,a total of seven cases were ultimately transferred to and consolidated in the district of massachusetts,from the following jurisdictions california,florida,illinois new jersey,ohio,and pennsylvania.one additional case was filed directly with the district court,in massachusetts.
most of the states in which the suits originated the exceptions are florida and california follow the most significant relationship test for determining the source of law that applies to contracts that do not contain choice of law provisions,based on section of the restatement second of conflict of laws.see safeco ins.jelen,if the claim raised is a contract,the most significant contacts test is used.citing nile nile,the settlement agreement did not express a choice of law so we look to factors such as those enumerated in restatement second of conflicts of laws.pfizer,emp rs ins.of wausau,noting that section sets forth the general rule governing choice of law in contract actions ohayon safeco ins.of,ohio noting that ohio has expressly adopted section guy liederbach,noting that pennsylvania follow s a flexible conflicts methodology combining interest analysis and the restatement second of conflicts,and citing 
under this approach,t he rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which,with respect to that issue,has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.restatement second of conflict of laws.the restatement enumerates several factors to consider in making this determination 
a the place of contracting,
b the place of negotiation of the contract,
c the place of performance,
d the location of the subject matter of the contract,and 
e the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.
id.the restatement notes that the contacts are to be assessed in the context of the principles of of the restatement.id.the restatement further provides that t hese contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.id.the restatement also explains that i f the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state,the local law of this state will usually be applied.id.
under the restatement approach,it is clear that massachusetts law would be applied in this case.the settlement agreement was drafted to settle litigation that was ongoing in the district of massachusetts.many of the settlement negotiations took place in boston,at settlement conferences with the special master.the agreement was entered into subject to final judicial approval,and so required approval by the district court in massachusetts.the agreement provided that the district court retained exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this action,the parties,and this settlement agreement for purposes of administering,supervising,construing,and enforcing this settlement agreement.the district court approved the settlement agreement,which was incorporated into the judgment and possessed the full force and effect of an order of the court.in re volkswagen,at.
the substance of the litigation also has significant contacts with massachusetts.one of the suits was filed directly in the district of massachusetts.one of the class representatives resides in massachusetts.moreover,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation found that transfer of the suits to the district of massachusetts would serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of the litigation.in re volkswagen,d at.
as a result,the weight of the relevant factors indicates that massachusetts has the most substantial relationship to the issue of attorneys fees under the settlement agreement,and so these five states would apply massachusetts law.
florida applies the lex loci contractus rule,which provides that the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was executed governs the rights and liabilities of the parties.state farm mut.auto.ins.roach,so d,see also shaps provident life accident ins,so d,this court has held that under lex loci contractus,the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was executed governs substantive issues regarding the contract.under this rule,massachusetts law would also apply the settlement is properly viewed as having been executed in massachusetts as that was the location where the settlement agreement was judicially approved,which was an express condition of the effectiveness of the settlement agreement.
under the law of the last transferor jurisdiction,california,a contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to be performed or,if it does not indicate a place of performance,according to the law and usage of the place where it is made.cal.see also frontier oil rli ins,d,we conclude that notwithstanding the application of the governmental interest analysis to other issues,civil code section is the rule that determines the law governing the interpretation of a contract.given that the settlement agreement provided that the district court is to maintain jurisdiction over the settlement for purposes of administering,supervising,construing,and enforcing this settlement agreement,the settlement agreement is properly construed as to be performed in massachusetts.even if it were decided that the state of performance is indeterminable,for the reasons given above it is properly viewed as having been made in massachusetts.either way,under california choice of law rules,massachusetts law would apply to the interpretation of the settlement agreement.
as a result,we conclude that all of the transferor jurisdictions would apply massachusetts law to determine what constitutes reasonable attorneys fees and expenses under the settlement agreement the district court conclusion that state law did not govern was error.we vacate the district court award of fees and remand for resolution of the remaining issues under massachusetts law.
application of massachusetts law 
massachusetts generally follows the american rule and denies recovery of attorney fees absent a contract or statute to the contrary.police comm r of bos.gows.under massachusetts law,there appear to be two permissible approaches to determining attorneys fees pursuant to a contractual agreement.
first,the lodestar approach is permissible in contractual fee cases.see whtr real estate.venture,see also raymond leasing callico,affirming attorneys fees award based on an adjusted number of hours expended multiplied by the hourly rate customarily charged by attorneys with experience and expertise in this particular area of the law.it has been used in some contractual fee cases.
under massachusetts lodestar approach,attorneys fees are calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent on the case times a reasonable hourly rate.fontaine ebtec.this figure is the basic measure of a reasonable attorney fee under this approach.id.at.after the base lodestar figure is calculated,i n limited circumstances it may be enhanced to compensate for the risk of nonpayment.see also whtr,at.the supreme judicial court has held that no enhancement was appropriate where the case was not complex,raised no novel issues of law,and did not have significance for a wider class of persons beyond the particular plaintiff.fontaine,at.
the second permissible approach is a analysis.under this approach,a court may consider a number of factors,originally outlined in cummings national shawmut bank of boston,to arrive at a determination of reasonable attorneys fees,
including the ability and reputation of the attorney,the demand for his services by others,the amount and importance of the matter involved,the time spent,the prices usually charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same neighborhood,the amount of money or the value of the property affected by the controversy,and the results secured.
id.at quoted in whtr,at see also margolies hopkins,considering these factors where parties agreed to pay counsel fees as part of a settlement citizens bank of travers,holding that these factors govern reasonableness of attorneys fees awarded under a contract.
the district court on remand should determine which method massachusetts would apply here.it is clear that the present award can not stand.
if under massachusetts law the lodestar approach is called for,or if it is highly relevant under the approach,the litigation on remand may be simplified.in this case,the district court calculated a base lodestar figure of encompassing only class counsel,and neither side mounted a real challenge to the figure,as a figure,on appeal.class counsel agreed at oral argument that the base lodestar value would only need to be increased to the extent that it did not include additional work,undertaken after the district court award of fees,and even then would not be an appreciably different number.that claim of increase due to additional work is preserved for remand.the defendants likewise agreed at oral argument that remand for consideration of only the increase for additional work and any lodestar multiplier would be acceptable.
given the absence of any direct challenge to this figure,the base lodestar figure of shall be the base figure used on remand as to class counsel,save for an increase for extra work.the use of this figure is appropriate given the courts interest in avoiding burdensome satellite litigation over attorneys fees.city of burlington dague.because no lodestar calculation was performed as to plaintiffs attorneys who were not class counsel,the district court will need to perform a separate lodestar calculation as to those attorneys.
under both methods used by massachusetts law,a question remaining on remand is the question of the appropriate contingency enhancement,if any.the district court choice of a multiplier figure was not based on massachusetts law nor justified by the record,and it is therefore vacated.we understand the parties to have agreed,at oral argument,that if there were a remand,the issues open on remand would include,inter alia,the further time remaining to be spent by all counsel,not just class counsel the risks undertaken and the value of the settlement.as to this last question,the actual claims data collected by the settlement administrator is relevant to the enhancement question and in determining the appropriate fee.we also urge the parties to attempt to resolve the remaining issues between them.
we reverse the district court decision for legal error and vacate the award of attorneys fees.we remand for calculation of an appropriate fee under massachusetts law,consistent with this opinion 
no costs are awarded.
two additional cases were later transferred and consolidated.two additional cases were later transferred and consolidated.
