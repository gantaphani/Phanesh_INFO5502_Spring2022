this appeal primarily concerns the authority of a district court to issue an injunction under the relitigation exception to the act,to protect the judgment of another district court.the issue arises on an appeal by paul david woosley from an order of the district court for the district of connecticut alvin thompson,district judge,denying his motion to amend a permanent injunction.the injunction barred woosley from relitigating the validity of two texas state court decrees,issued in and,that terminated his parental rights and permitted david and kimberly smith to adopt the child whom woosley fathered.woosley previous efforts to challenge the texas decrees had been rejected in a suit he brought in in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania.
we conclude that the district court in connecticut properly enjoined relitigation of the issues adjudicated by the district court in pennsylvania.we therefore affirm,with a slight modification.
background 
woosley is the biological father of kyle smith kyle,who was born in pennsylvania on july,and then transported to texas.prior to the birth,the biological mother had proposed placing the child for adoption.shortly after the birth,woosley signed an affidavit of waiver of interest in child and the biological mother and her husband who was not woosley executed an affidavit of relinquishment of parental rights.see woosley smith,antonio i.on july,the district court,bexar county,texas,entered a decree terminating the parental rights of woosley and the biological mother,and on july,entered a decree terminating the relationship between kyle and the husband of his biological mother.see id.on march,the bexar county court entered a decree of adoption making the smiths the adoptive parents of kyle.see id.
in july,woosley filed suit in the bexar county court against the smiths and their adoption agency,seeking to set aside that court decrees.the court rejected his claims and upheld both decrees.see id.on april,that decision was upheld on woosley appeal to the texas court of appeals see id.at.woosley subsequent appeal to the same court was rejected on grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel,see woosley adoption alliance ii,wl antonio june,and the supreme court denied certiorari,see woosley adoption alliance,d.the texas appellate court also upheld the imposition of sanctions against woosley for a frivolous pleading.see ii,wl,at.
in december,woosley filed suit in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania,seeking a declaration that his parental rights had not been validly terminated and an order setting aside the adoption decree entered by the texas court.he alleged fraud and violation of his federally protected civil rights in an unreported decision dated september,the pennsylvania district court dismissed the suit as,ruling that the limitations period for both claims was two years.see.urrutia harrisburg county police department,cir.the third circuit affirmed,woosley smith,cir table,and the supreme court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari,woosley smith,d.
in july,woosley attempted to kidnap kyle,then age,by placing him into a car in front of the smiths home.the attempt was foiled by kyle brother who opened the rear door of the car to free him.a called the police.in may,pursuant to a plea agreement,woosley was convicted in the connecticut superior court of various offenses,including custodial interference in the first degree.as a condition of his plea agreement,woosley is precluded from having any contact with kyle.
two weeks prior to his conviction,woosley filed a suit in the connecticut superior court,seeking visitation rights and apparently contending that the texas decrees were void.the superior court dismissed the suit,ruling that woosley parental rights had been terminated by the texas court and that a requirement for visitation rights is a relationship.woosley smith,s,wl,at.
in january,the smiths filed the pending suit in the connecticut district court,seeking damages for vexatious litigation and intentional infliction of emotional distress,and an injunction barring woosley from further attempts to challenge the texas decrees.in february,the district court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting woosley from litigating the questions of whether his parental rights were validly terminated by the texas court and whether the adoption decree should be set aside.the district court acted on the basis of the relitigation exception to,ruling that an injunction was necessary and appropriate to protect the collateral estoppel effect of the judgment of the pennsylvania district court.the injunction was entered march.on march,woosley filed a motion to amend the injunction.the motion was denied by an order entered september.on october,woosley filed a notice of appeal,identifying the september denial of the motion to amend as the subject of the appeal.
discussion 
at the outset,we consider our appellate jurisdiction.this is an interlocutory appeal,as the smiths damage claims remain pending in the district court.woosley notice of appeal identifies the order denying his motion to amend the permanent injunction as the subject of the appeal,and a denial of a motion to amend an injunction is subject to an interlocutory appeal,see a.however,it is apparent from woosley papers that he is also challenging the injunction itself.we will construe the pro se notice of appeal as comprehending a challenge to the injunction,in view of the fact that had woosley filed a timely notice of appeal from the injunction,his motion to amend,filed within ten days of entry of the injunction,would have postponed the effectiveness of such a notice until the motion to amend was denied on september,see fed.a a iv,and his timely notice of appeal was filed within days of that date.
authority of the connecticut district court 
the principal issue is whether the connecticut district court may enjoin woosley in order to protect the judgment of the pennsylvania district court.the act provides 
a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.
it is well settled that the act applies to injunctions that prohibit a person from litigating in a state court,as well as injunctions that directly stay proceedings in a state court.see atlantic coast line brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d ungar mandell,cir.
the authority of a united states court to issue an injunction to protect its judgments from further litigation in state courts is known as the relitigation exception to the broad prohibition of the act.see chick kam choo exxon,d note,federal power to enjoin state court proceedings,harv.this exception was enacted in in response to the supreme court decision in toucey new york life insurance,which had limited to in rem actions the previously exercised authority of federal courts to prevent relitigation in state courts of matters adjudicated in a federal court,see,princess lida of thurn and taxis thompson.congress evidently was persuaded that federal courts should be authorized to protect their judgments against relitigation in state courts,rather than leave successful federal court litigants to the assertion of collateral estoppel defenses in subsequent state court actions.if such defenses were unjustifiably rejected,the only federal recourse in suits would be the uncertain prospect of certiorari review by the united states supreme court.
the text of the relitigation exception suggests that a federal court may protect only a judgment that the court issuing the injunction has previously entered.the referent of its in the phrase protect its judgments is naturally read to mean the same court that is authorized to issue an injunction.moreover,if a federal court may protect another federal court judgment,then section reference to a court of the united states would mean both the court issuing the injunction and the different court whose judgment is being protected.although the latter reading is a somewhat strained way to parse the statute,i
