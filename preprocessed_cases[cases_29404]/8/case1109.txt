background 
on june,following his conviction in the united states district court for the district of oregon on multiple counts of arson,attempted arson,and conspiracy to commit arson,mcgowan was sentenced principally to eighty four months incarceration.on december,he was transferred to brooklyn house residential reentry center rrc to serve the remainder of his sentence.mcgowan alleges that,at brooklyn house rrc,he received daily work passes,which allowed him to maintain full time employment as a receptionist,and enjoyed privileges such as weekend home visits,unrestricted use of the internet,a shopping pass,and the opportunity to apply to attend social events.
on april,mcgowan published an article on the huffington post website under his own byline.see daniel mcgowan,court documents prove i was sent to a communications management unit cmu for my political speech,huffington post,am.in the article,mcgowan asserted that,while serving his federal sentence,he had been placed in a highly restrictive communication management unit in retaliation for publishing political opinion pieces.id.
mcgowan alleges that,shortly after his article appeared online,defendant tracy rivers,the residential reentry manager at the new york residential reentry management office of the bureau of prisons bop,determined that he should be issued an incident report and remanded to a federal detention center.the incident report stated that mcgowan had violated bop program statement dated september,page,section d,which provided that an inmate currently confined in an institution may not be employed or act as a reporter or publish under a byline the byline regulation.
however,unbeknownst to rivers,by the time these events occurred,the byline regulation had been rescinded.specifically,in august,a district court in colorado held that the byline regulation was unconstitutional under the first amendment.see jordan pugh,supp.on november,the bop issued mandatory guidance to its staff instructing them not to enforce it.on april,the bop published an interim rule rescinding the byline regulation,and finalized that rule on may.
mcgowan alleges that on april,he was taken from brooklyn house rrc to the metropolitan detention center and placed in the special housing unit shu.after mcgowan lawyers contacted the bop,kerry kemble,assistant administrator of the residential reentry management branch of the bop,informed rivers that the byline regulation had been rescinded.kemble and rivers agreed to expunge the incident report and return mcgowan to brooklyn house rrc.mcgowan returned to brooklyn house rrc on april,having spent approximately twenty two hours in the shu.
mcgowan commenced this action on august,and filed his amended complaint on november.as relevant here,he asserted claims for violation of his first amendment rights against tracy rivers under bivens six unknown named agents,false imprisonment against the united states under the ftca and negligence against the united states under the ftca.mcgowan also brought state law claims against core services group,community first services,the private operator of brooklyn house rrc those claims are not at issue in this appeal

discussion 
bivens claim 
in bivens,the supreme court recognized an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen constitutional rights.corr.servs.malesko,citing bivens six unknown named agents.we have established a two step process for determining whether a bivens remedy is available for an alleged constitutional injury.first,the court must determine whether the underlying claims extend bivens into a new context.turkmen hasty,cir.quoting arar ashcroft,cir.if the plaintiff claims arise in a new context,the court then asks a whether there is an alternative remedial scheme available to the plaintiff,and,even if there is not,b whether special factors counsel hesitation in creating a bivens remedy.id.quoting arar,at.
mcgowan argues that his claim does not require us to extend bivens to a new context,and,even if it did,that there is no adequate alternative remedial scheme and no special factor counsel ing hesitation.id.accordingly,he argues,the district court erred in refusing to recognize a bivens remedy.we need not decide this difficult issue,however,because we conclude that mcgowan bivens claim fails for the independent reason that defendant rivers is entitled to qualified immunity.
although we generally decline to consider arguments that were not passed on by the district court,this principle is prudential,not jurisdictional.see fabrikant french,cir.we retain discretion to consider such arguments based on factors such as the interests of judicial economy and whether the unaddressed issues present pure questions of law.bacolitsas owner,llc,cir.both of these factors are present here.the issue of qualified immunity was presented in the district court,has been fully briefed on appeal,and turns on the purely legal question of whether mcgowan alleged a violation of a clearly established right.see fabrikant,at the matter of whether a right was clearly established at the pertinent time is a question of law.quoting dean blumenthal,cir.it is therefore appropriate for us to consider the defense of qualified immunity on appeal.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.wood moss,quoting ashcroft al kidd.for a right to be clearly established,the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton.in making this determination,we consider supreme court and second circuit precedent as it existed at the time of the challenged conduct.see garcia does,cir.nonetheless,the absence of a decision by this court or the supreme court directly addressing the right at issue will not preclude a finding that the law was clearly established so long as preexisting law clearly foreshadow s a particular ruling on the issue.id.quoting tellier fields,cir.a court may grant qualified immunity on the ground that a purported right was not clearly established by prior case law,without resolving the often more difficult question whether the purported right exists at all.reichle howards.
we conclude that,at the time the alleged violation occur
