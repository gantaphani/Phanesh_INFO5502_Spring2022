background 
we recite only those facts necessary to this appeal.a full recitation of the facts may be found in the district court and bankruptcy court opinions.see in re charter commc ns,in re charter commc ns.
in,charter,the nation cable television company and a leading provider of cable and a broadband service,was operationally sound but carried almost billion in debt at various levels of its corporate structure in re charter commc ns,at.after the september collapse of lehman brothers and the financial crisis that ensued,charter could no longer service its debt due to the tightening credit markets,charter excessive leverage,and lower valuations of companies in the cable sector.id.at.charter began negotiating with paul allen,a major investor whose ownership stake gave him control of the company,and a group of junior bondholders referred to as the crossover committee.id.the negotiations culminated in a settlement the allen settlement that contemplated charter prenegotiated reorganization in bankruptcy.id.charter then filed for chapter bankruptcy,using the allen settlement as the cornerstone of its prenegotiated plan.at.left out of the negotiations,however,were ldt,the trustee for million in aggregate principal of convertible notes issued by cci r,a cci shareholder and morgan chase jpmorgan,the holder of charter senior debt.these entities had no input into the allen settlement or the prepackaged plan.id.at at.
to fully appreciate the key role paul allen played in charter reorganization requires delving a bit into the weeds of the negotiations underlying the allen settlement.charter reorganization strategy was driven by the goal of reinstating its senior credit facility with jpmorgan that is,curing any breaches in its contracts with jpmorgan so that jpmorgan would be classified as an unimpaired creditor.see.charter wanted to avoid renegotiating its senior debt during the financial turmoil of late and early because it believed such renegotiation would at best lead to a higher interest rate and at worst result in charter being closed off to new financing altogether.in re charter commc ns,at.charter thus needed to structure its reorganization in a way that would avoid triggering a default under the credit agreement with jpmorgan.one condition charter had consented to in the credit agreement was that allen would retain percent of the ordinary voting power of charter communications operating,llc cco,the obligor under the senior credit agreements.id.at.for the reorganization plan to succeed,charter thus needed to induce allen to retain these voting rights,even though most of his investment in charter would be wiped out.id.at.in addition,for charter to preserve roughly billion of net operating losses,a valuable tax attribute,it needed allen to forgo exercising contractual exchange rights and to maintain a one percent ownership interest in charter communications holding company,llc holdco.id.at.because charter main goals in restructuring,namely reinstating its senior debt and obtaining tax savings though preserving net operating losses,required allen cooperation,allen alone was in a position to provide uniquely personal benefits to charter.id.at.
following a spirited negotiation in which sophisticated adversaries and their expert advisors bargained with each other aggressively and in good faith,id.at,charter,the crossover committee,and allen agreed to the allen settlement.as part of the settlement,allen agreed to retain a percent voting interest in cco and a one percent ownership interest in holdco,and to refrain from exercising his contractual exchange rights.id.at.in return for these concessions,allen would receive million,of which million was classified as pure settlement consideration.id.at.the allen settlement further provided for a billion rights offering,a tax basis in a significant portion of charter assets,and the purchase of allen preferred shares in cc viii,llc,a charter subsidiary.id.at.allen also successfully negotiated for a liability release other third parties,including the management of charter,were released as well.id.at.under the reorganization plan that resulted from the allen settlement,the cci noteholders,represented by ldt,would receive approximately percent of their claims,id.at,and r and other equity holders of cci would receive nothing,see debtor disclosure statement at.
on november,after a hearing,the bankruptcy court overruled all objections and confirmed the plan as submitted by charter.at.the following week,the bankruptcy court denied r and ldt motions for an emergency stay of the confirmation order.the district court sidney stein,judge,sitting in part i denied a stay pending appeal to that court,and the confirmation order and the plan took effect on november.see in re charter commc ns,at.charter immediately took actions under the plan,including cancelling the equity issued by the prepetition charter,issuing shares in the reorganized charter,converting notes issued by the prepetition charter entities into new notes,and issuing warrants to charter prepetition noteholders.id.at nn.
r and ldt have objected to the plan at every stage of these proceedings.before the district court,they raised several overlapping challenges to the plan confirmation.their objections,viewed broadly,related to the allen settlement,the bankruptcy court valuation of charter,and compliance with the bankruptcy code cramdown provisions for approving a plan over the objections of creditors.see id.at.charter,allen,and the committee of unsecured creditors argued that,whatever the merit of r and ldt legal claims,the relief they sought could not be granted without upsetting the plan and that the doctrine of equitable mootness barred the appeals.id.at.the district court agreed and dismissed the appeals as equitably moot.r and ldt filed separate appeals from that dismissal,which were argued in tandem.
discussion 
legal standard for equitable mootness 
this appeal concerns equitable mootness,a prudential doctrine under which the district court may dismiss a bankruptcy appeal when,even though effective relief could conceivably be fashioned,implementation of that relief would be inequitable.official comm.of unsecured creditors of ltv aerospace def.official comm.of unsecured creditors of ltv steel in re chateaugay corp,cir chateaugay i.unlike constitutional mootness,which turns on the threshold question of whether a justiciable case or controversy exists,equitable mootness in the context presented here is concerned with whether a particular remedy can be granted without unjustly upsetting a debtor plan of reorganization.see deutsche bank ag metromedia fiber network,in re metromedia fiber network,cir see also in re unr,cir there is a big difference between inability to alter the outcome real mootness and unwillingness to alter the outcome equitable mootness.equitable mootness in the bankruptcy setting thus requires the district court to carefully balance the importance of finality in bankruptcy proceedings against the appellant right to review and relief.see chateaugay i,at bank of trust,na official unsecured creditors comm.in re pac.lumber,cir noting that equitable mootness is a judicial anomaly because it creates an exception to courts virtually unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction internal quotation marks omitted.e quitable mootness applies to specific claims,not entire appeals and must be applied with a scalpel rather than an axe.in re pac.lumber,at.
in this circuit,an appeal is presumed equitably moot where the debtor plan of reorganization has been substantially consummated.aetna cas.sur.ltv steel in re chateaugay,cir chateaugay iii frito lay,ltv steel in re chateaugay,cir chateaugay ii.substantial consummation is defined in the bankruptcy code to require that all or substantially all of the proposed transfers in a plan are consummated that the successor company has assumed the business or management of the property dealt with by the plan and that the distributions called for by the plan have commenced.see.
the presumption of equitable mootness can be overcome,however,if all five of the chateaugay factors are met 
the court can still order some effective relief 
such relief will not affect the of the debtor as a revitalized corporate entity 
such relief will not unravel intricate transactions so as to knock the props out from under the authorization for every transaction that has taken place and create an unmanageable,uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court 
the parties who would be adversely affected by the modification have notice of the appeal and an opportunity to participate in the proceedings and 
the appellant pursued with diligence all available remedies to obtain a stay of execution of the objectionable order if the failure to do so creates a situation rendering it inequitable to reverse the orders appealed from.
chateaugay ii,at internal citations,quotations,and alterations omitted.substantial consummation thus does not necessarily make it impossible or inequitable for an appellate court to grant effective relief.id.at.nor is a claim automatically equitably moot if the relief requested would require that a confirmed plan be altered.in this regard,we disagree with the district court overly broad statement that invalidating a plan and remanding for renegotiation renders a request per se equitably moot.in re charter commc ns,at.the chateaugay factors ensure that there is no per se equitable mootness by requiring a court to examine the actual effects of the requested relief.finally,in examining a debtor contention that a claim is equitably moot,we can not rely solely on the debtor conclusory predictions or opinions that the requested relief would doom the reorganized company.instead,chateaugay ii requires an analytical inquiry into the likely effects of the relief an appellant seeks and must be based on facts.only if all five chateaugay factors are met,and if the appellant prevails on the merits of its legal claims,will relief be granted.
ii.standard of review 
we turn first to the standard of review in appeals of equitable mootness determinations generally in bankruptcy appeals,the district court reviews the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.fed.on appeal to this court,we ordinarily review the district court decision de novo.in re metromedia,at.equitable mootness appeals arise in a somewhat different procedural posture in an equitable mootness dismissal,the district court is not reviewing the bankruptcy court at all,but exercising its own discretion in the first instance.in so doing,the district court may rely on the bankruptcy court factual findings,unless clearly erroneous,and if necessary receive additional evidence.perhaps because of the unusual nature of equitable mootness dismissals,the courts of appeals are split over whether a de novo or abuse of discretion standard of review should be applied by a court of appeals.compare curreys of,united producers,in re united producers,cir reviewing determination of equitable mootness de novo,liquidity solutions,winn dixie stores,in re winn dixie store,app x,cir same,and united states wireless,in re gwi pcs,cir same,with search mkt.direct,jubber in re paige,cir reviewing determination of equitable mootness for abuse of discretion,and nordhoff,zenith elecs,cir same.
we join those circuits that apply an standard,finding it significant that we are reviewing the district court own exercise of discretion as to whether it is practicable to grant relief.a somewhat analogous situation arises when article iii mootness turns on the defendant voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct.there,the voluntary cessation bear s on whether the court should,in the exercise of its discretion,dismiss the case as moot.harrison burrowes ridge constructors,cuomo,cir.in such a case,because dismissal lies within the sound discretion of the district court,we review for abuse of discretion.granite state outdoor,zoning bd.of stamford,app x,cir in re paige,at reviewing equitable mootness for abuse of discretion in part because of its similarities to prudential mootness,reviewed in the tenth circuit for abuse of discretion.more generally,equitable mootness determinations involve a discretionary balancing of equitable and prudential factors,the type of determination we usually review for abuse of discretion.in re cont l airlines,cir en banc.accordingly,we will review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.
iii.objections to the allen settlement and third party releases are equitably moot 
r and ldt both challenge the compensation paul allen received under the allen settlement as contravening the absolute priority rule and delaware entire fairness standard.they further argue that the releases,which originated in the allen settlement and were incorporated into the confirmed plan,do not comply with sec drexel burnham lambert group,in re drexel burnham lambert group,cir,limiting releases to unique circumstances.appellants claim that these legal errors can be redressed through a prospective monetary award,without undoing the allen settlement or reopening the bankruptcy proceedings.ldt suggests that allen be required to disgorge some or all of his million in settlement consideration,or that charter pay a similar amount directly to ldt.r presents a different alternative that the bankruptcy court determine the lowest payout allen would have been willing to accept,and order him to disgorge the excess.and r maintains that the releases can be surgically excised from the allen settlement and the plan.
we begin by noting that ldt and r have met their burden with respect to several of the chateaugay factors.first,it is not impossible to grant ldt and r relief,in the sense that the appeals are not constitutionally moot factor.see dean blumenthal,cir claims for monetary relief automatically avoid constitutional mootness.next,ldt and r were diligent in seeking a stay of the confirmation order factor that ldt and r were not granted a stay does not affect the analysis under chateaugay ii,which looks only to diligence in seeking a stay.chateaugay ii,at in re metromedia,at.
next,ldt and r are correct that the relief they seek would not adversely affect parties without an opportunity to participate in the appeal factor.see chateaugay ii,at.even assuming that the relief requested would send charter back into bankruptcy,the parties most affected would be charter itself,allen,and charter creditors,all of whom are either parties to this appeal or participated actively in the bankruptcy proceedings.kenton cnty.bondholders comm.delta air lines,in re delta air lines,finding appeal of a settlement equitably moot in part because distributions under the settlement had been made to innocent third parties that were not participating in the appeal.in any event,if the allen settlement were unlawful,it would not be inequitable to require the parties to that agreement to disgorge their gains,participation in the appeal or not.see motor vehicle cas.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir t he question is not whether no third party interests are affected but whether any effects on third parties would be inequitable.likewise,striking the releases from the plan would affect only those third parties that benefited f
