plaintiff elizabeth jacobson appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,vernon broderick,judge,dismissing pursuant to fed.civ.b her qui tam complaint asserting two claims under the new york false claims act or nyfca,state fin.law et mckinney supp,on behalf of the state of new york state and the city of new york city collectively new york against defendants wells fargo national bank,and wells fargo asset securities corporation collectively wells fargo for fraudulent avoidance of new york tax obligations.the action was originally filed in state supreme court and was removed by defendants to federal court.the complaint alleged that wells fargo,having created trusts to pool residential mortgages for the purpose of issuing securities,filed false real estate mortgage investment conduit remic income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs to claim federal income tax exemptions for those trusts,see it alleged that because new york law exempts a trust from state and city taxation if it is treated as a remic for federal income tax purposes,the false federal filings meant that defendants also fraudulently avoided paying new york taxes.the district court denied a motion by jacobson to remand the action to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,ruling that although the complaint asserted claims only under the new york false claims act,it was based on issues that justified jurisdiction,see,gunn minton,grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing.the court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,ruling that the alleged fraudulent conduct was insufficient,in light of the relevant provisions of the internal revenue code or code and the regulations thereunder,to deprive the trusts of remic status for federal income tax purposes.the complaint thus failed to allege plausibly that the trusts were not entitled to the new york tax exemptions and,accordingly,it failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted under the nyfca.jacobson challenges both rulings,contending that the district court erred in evaluating the importance of the federal tax issue and in interpreting the federal tax laws.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the rulings of the district court and affirm the judgment.
background 
the present action concerns wells fargo securitization of residential mortgages by pooling them and placing them in trusts,ownership interests in which can be sold to investors.see complaint.see generally blackrock financial management segregated account of ambac assurance,cir.in the securitization process,a mortgage lender sells pools of mortgages into trusts created to receive the stream of interest and principal payments from the mortgage borrowers.the right to receive trust income is parceled into certificates and sold to investors,called certificateholders.if such a trust is a remic and files an irs form each year,its income is taxable only to the certificateholders the remic itself is exempt from federal income taxation see complaint.see a,b.
a remic is exempt from federal income taxation only as long as the mortgages deposited in the remic are qualified mortgages under federal tax law and regulation complaint see a.a qualified mortgage is defined in the internal revenue code,in pertinent part,as any obligation including any participation or certificate of beneficial ownership therein which is principally secured by an interest in real property.id.a.
under new york law,a n entity that is treated for federal income tax purposes as a real estate mortgage investment conduit,hereinafter referred to as a remic,as such term is defined in section of the internal revenue code,is also exempt from all new york taxation.tax law mckinney admin.code.
a.the present qui tam complaint 
the complaint alleged that in,wells fargo securitized over billion of subprime and other mortgages into remics and that it sold substantially more than billion of other such mortgages to other institutions for securitization into remics.complaint see also id.each wells fargo trust annually filed a form with the irs in order to claim remic tax exemptions.see id.
however,the complaint alleged,m any,if not most,of the mortgages in the remics contained false information fabricated by wells fargo id.the allegedly fraudulent practices included fabricat ing borrowers income and employment information inflating borrowers stated assets to levels sufficient to correspond to the amounts of principal,interest,taxes,and insurance that would be due on their loans,without determining the borrowers actual assets and the f orging of and credit reports.see,id.the complaint alleged that because of these fraudulent practices the wells fargo mortgages were not qualified mortgages for remic purposes because they were defective obligation s within the meaning of federal tax law id.
federal regulations define defective obligation to include a mortgage that is in default or as to which a default is reasonably foreseeable or a mortgage that was not in fact principally secured by an interest in real property or a mortgage that does not conform to a customary representation or warranty given by the sponsor or prior owner of the mortgage regarding the characteristics of the mortgage,f i,iii,and iv.see complaint.the complaint alleged that given the wells fargo falsifications and inflations as to the income and assets of borrowers who could not afford the mortgages,d efault on mortgages fraudulently originated as described above was eminently foreseeable.id.it also alleged that since it is a federal crime to provide false information on a loan application to an bank,wells fargo conduct did not conform to the required customary representation s that,inter alia,the loans in the remic complied in all material respects with applicable federal,state,and local laws.id.see also id.the complaint alleged that a s a result,the trusts created to securitize wells fargo subprime mortgages did not and do not qualify as remics under federal law.since the trusts tax exemption under new york state and new york city law depends on their qualification as remics under federal law,the trusts are liable to sic new york state and new york city tax id.on the net interest they received on the mortgages see id.
having claimed the federal tax exemption as remics,the trusts did not pay new york taxes but,the complaint alleged,their annual filings of irs form in order to claim the remic tax exemption were false because the trusts did not qualify as remics id.it alleged that wells fargo thus violated the nyfca because it knowingly ma de,use d,or cause d to be made or used,a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property,business franchise and corporate taxes,to the state and city of new york id.quoting state fin.law g see id,and conspired to commit a violation of g id,see state fin.law c.the complaint estimated very rough ly complaint that the wells fargo trusts unpaid new york tax obligations total billion.see id.it sought,inter alia,treble damages.
proceedings in the district court 
jacobson commenced this qui tam action in state court in.although the nyfca permits the state attorney general to,inter alia,intervene in the action or authorize a local government to do so,he has declined to do either.
wells fargo timely removed the action to federal court pursuant to and,on the premise that although the complaint asserted causes of action only under new york law,the claims necessarily implicated substantial issues of federal tax law and therefore arose under federal law within the meaning of and.jacobson moved to remand the action to state court,arguing that the operation of the new york false claims act is purely a matter of state law and that the federal questions involved in the case did not suffice to bring the case within federal jurisdiction.
the district court denied jacobson motion to remand,citing principally grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing,grable empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh empire,and franchise tax board construction laborers vacation trust for southern california,franchise tax board.in a memorandum and order dated june.ord,the court explained 
although plaintiff does not raise a federal cause of action,her claims necessarily raise a disputed,substantial federal issue because the parties dispute hinges on whether the loans are qualified mortgages as defined by the federal tax code,and thus should be treated for federal income tax purposes as remics in accordance with federal law.
ord.at emphases added see,id.jacobson essentially concedes in her complaint that it is the interpretation of the federal tax code and regulations that govern s whether a remic will be exempt from state and local taxes.the court acknowledged the state and city interests,but it noted that the state had neither brought suit nor elected to intervene in the present action,which diminished concerns about comity and the balance.see id.at.
wells fargo then moved to dismiss the complaint for,inter alia,failure to state a claim,arguing that even assuming the truth of jacobson factual allegations,those facts did not deprive the trusts of their status as remics because the alleged frauds would not mean that the trusts mortgages were not qualified mortgages within the meaning of the federal tax laws and regulations.accordingly,wells fargo argued,the form filed by the trusts did not misrepresent the trusts status or entitlement to file those forms,and the forms did not contain or represent false statements.
in opposition,jacobson argued principally that the mortgages held by the wells fargo trusts were defective obligations within the meaning of the remic regulations in the two respects alleged in the complaint,that defaults on those mortgages were reasonably foreseeable because wells fargo falsified the financial conditions of unqualified borrowers who could not actually afford the loans,and that the mortgages did not conform to the customary representations or warranties given with regard to the mortgages characteristics.jacobson also argued that it would be inequitable to allow wells fargo to profit by escaping taxation as a result of its fraudulent conduct in connection with the mortgage origination process.
in a memorandum and order dated march.ord.or order the district court granted the wells fargo motion to dismiss,concluding that under federal tax law,alleged frauds with respect to the origination and underwriting of mortgages do not affect the mortgages status as qualified mortgages.ord.at,and hence do not deprive a trust holding those mortgages of remic status,see id.at.the court noted that 
u nder the internal revenue code,a remic is defined,in pertinent part,as any entity substantially all of the assets of which consist of qualified mortgages and permitted investments.a.the statute further defines a qualified mortgage,in pertinent part,as any obligation including any participation or certificate of beneficial ownership therein which is principally secured by an interest in real property.id.a a.
ord.at emphases ours.the court reasoned that the defective obligation concept relied on by jacobson a term not defined in the code but defined in the regulations principally concerns issues other than the nature of the property securing the loan.in defining defective obligations and outlining their effects cures,the pertinent regulation did not purport to modify the code definition of qualified mortgages.rather,the definition of a defective obligation applies,by its terms,
only f or purposes of a b ii and a,which are sections of the statute that discuss the substitution or repurchase of defective obligations.the definition of a defective obligation does not refer to the portion of the statute that defines a qualified mortgage,a a n othing in the regulation alters or evinces any intent to alter the statutory definition of a qualified mortgage.
ord.at emphasis added.moreover,
t he text of the regulation makes clear that only some defects render a mortgage not qualified.if a remic discovers a defect that,had it been discovered before the startup day,would have prevented the obligation from being a qualified mortgage,then,unless the remic either causes the defect to be cured or disposes of the defective obligation within days of discovering the defect,the obligation ceases to be a qualified mortgage at the end of that day period.f by contrast,if a remic discovers a defect that does not affect the status of an obligation as a qualified mortgage,then the obligation is always a qualified mortgage regardless of whether the defect is or can be cured.id.
ord.at first emphasis in.op second emphasis ours.
as the complaint did not allege that the wells fargo loans were in fact not principally secured by interests in real property,the court concluded that it failed to allege that the wells fargo trust assets did not meet the statutory definition of qualified mortgage,and hence failed to allege that the trusts themselves were not entities substantially all of the assets of which consist of qualified mortgages and permitted investments the relevant feature of a remic,a.since new york law exempts trusts from paying new york income tax if they are treated as remics under federal law,the court concluded that the complaint failed to allege that defendants made or used a false statement or record to avoid paying new york taxes and,accordingly,failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted under the new york false claims act.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,jacobson contends principally that the district court erred in denying her motion to remand the action to state court for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the federal issue here is not substantial and that the exercise of federal jurisdiction would upset the balance and that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint because it misinterpreted the federal tax provisions governing remics.reviewing both rulings de novo,see,blockbuster,galeno,cir.subject matter jurisdiction gibbons malone,cir.failure to state a claim,we disagree.
federal question jurisdiction 
the federal district courts have original jurisdiction of civil actions arising under federal law,and unless otherwise provided by congress,they have removal jurisdiction over any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,id.a.this provision for jurisdiction is invoked by and large by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law grable,at.in addition,
t here is another longstanding,if less frequently encountered,variety of federal arising under jurisdiction,th e supreme court having recognized for nearly years that in certain cases jurisdiction will lie over claims that implicate significant federal issues,hopkins walker.the doctrine captures the commonsense notion that a federal court ought to be able to hear claims recognized under state law that nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law,and thus justify resort to the experience,solicitude,and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on federal issues,see ali,study of the division of jurisdiction between state and federal courts.
grable,at emphasis added.this doctrine is applied in only a special and small category of cases.gunn minton,quoting empire,at see also nasdaq omx group,ubs securities,llc,cir.nasdaq t he supreme court has been sparing in recognizing state law claims fitting this criterion.
in grable,the court framed the proper inquiry as whether a claim necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities,at,leading the court in gunn to state the following test 
f ederal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is necessarily raised,actually disputed,substantial,and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the balance approved by congress,
gunn,at.where all four of these requirements are met,jurisdiction is proper because there is a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,which can be vindicated without disrupting congress intended division of labor between state and federal courts.id.quoting grable,at.
the first two elements of the test are relatively straightforward.a claim necessarily raises federal questions where the claim is affirmatively premised on a violation of federal law.grable,at.in contrast,this first element is not present where all of the plaintiff claims s eek relief under state law and none necessarily raise s a federal issue.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith manning,wl,at may.as to the second element,although there could be a case in which the court would need to fathom whether a purported dispute is genuine,there can be no doubt that the actually disputed factor of the test is satisfied when the federal issue is the only or the central point in dispute.grable,at the only gunn,at the central.
third,in order to satisfy the substantial federal issue requirement,to present a legal issue that implicates a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,grable,at,
it is not enough that the federal issue be significant to the particular parties in the immediate suit that will always be true when the state claim necessarily raise s a disputed federal issue,as grable separately requires.the substantiality inquiry under grable looks instead to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole,
gunn,at emphasis omitted.
the fourth requirement,that the exercise of jurisdiction over a state law claim not disturb any congressionally approved balance of state and federal judicial responsibilities,focuses principally on the nature of the claim,the traditional forum for such a claim,and the volume of cases that would be affected.absent a special state interest in a category of litigation,or an express congressional preference to avoid federal adjudication,federal questions that implicate substantial federal interests will often be appropriately resolved in federal rather than state court.in smith kansas city title trust,described in grable as a classic example of a case in which federal jurisdiction is appropriate,grable,at the exercise of federal jurisdiction was warranted despite the fact that missouri law provided the cause of action,as the central question in smith was whether the issuance of certain bonds by the federal government was unconstitutional.in grable itself,the exercise of federal jurisdiction was found warranted for a action based on an irs seizure and sale of property after giving actual notice but without strict compliance with the notice provision set out in the internal revenue code.the court noted that the meaning of that provision was an important issue of federal law that sensibly belongs in a federal court that it is the rare state title case that raises a contested matter of federal law and that federal jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend only a microscopic effect on the division of labor.grable,at.
in other cases,the scales have been found to tip in the other direction.see,merrell dow pharmaceuticals thompson,jurisdiction not warranted for tort claims asserting the defendant violation of a federal misbranding statute for which congress had provided no private right of action,given the potentially enormous shift of traditionally state cases to the federal courts empire,at jurisdiction not warranted for federally contracted insurer suit seeking,as reimbursement for its payment of the insured medical expenses,part of the settlement received by the insured in a action against a third party franchise tax board,at jurisdiction not warranted for state agency suit for a judgment declaring that the employee retirement income security act erisa did not bar its attempt to collect unpaid state income taxes by levying on funds held for the taxpayer in an benefit plan,because erisa authorization for declaratory judgment actions did not extend to suits by such an agency,and hence the question did not arise under erisa gunn,at jurisdiction not warranted for malpractice claims arising out of patent litigation because the determination of hypothetical patent law issues insufficiently implicated a federal interest,especially in light of state courts role as the traditional forum for malpractice cases.
this court has found federal issues to be sufficiently substantial and consistent with the judicial balance to warrant jurisdiction over claims involving federal laws requiring cable television operators,with certain exceptions,to provide uniform rates over certain geographic areas,see broder cablevision systems,cir,and claims premised on the singular duty of a national securities exchange to operate a fair and orderly market under the securities exchange act,nasdaq,at.
in the present case,there is no disagreement as to the satisfaction of the first two elements of the test,that a federal issue be necessarily raised and actually disputed.see,jacobson brief on appeal at wells fargo brief on appeal at.nor could there be.as described in part above,the complaint predicated liability on the assertion that irs form filings were false because and only because the wells fargo trusts did not qualify for the remic status they obtained under federal law.see complaint.thus,in order to establish a false statement or record within the meaning of the nyfca,jacobson must prove at least that the trusts did not qualify under federal law.further,this issue is obviously disputed,as the central premise of wells fargo motion to dismiss was that the trusts did qualify under federal law,properly interpreted.
the issue is also substantial within the meaning of the test.a remic is a creature of federal law that accords favorable tax treatment to investments in securities by allowing entities to issue multiple classes of securities without being taxed both at the entity level and at the investor level.see conf,at,reprinted in,the conferees intend that remics are to be the exclusive means of issuing multiple class real estate securities without the imposition of two levels of taxation.an important purpose of the remic legislation was to provide clear rules clarify ing the tax treatment of securities,according to its sponsor,was intended to facilitate investments in mortgages and thereby reduce mortgage interest costs for home buyers.review of tax treatment of securities and environmental zone legislation hearing on,and before the subcomm.on taxation and debt management of the comm.on finance,cong.statement of chafee see also,at senate committee on finance noting that the remic provisions should be flexible enough to accommodate most legitimate business concerns while preserving the desired certainty of income tax treatment.the statute,the implementing regulations,and the additional regulatory guidance,see,proc,declaring that irs will not challenge status of remics on the basis of mortgage modifications under certain conditions priv.ltr.rul,ruling on effect of litigation settlement on remic taxation,are necessarily complex,and they govern what is now a national market in securities.many major financial institutions have presumably using the remic structure issued securities and potentially have stakes similar to that of wells fargo in the meaning of the remic regulations.see,federal housing finance agency nomura holding america,d,noting consolidation of sixteen actions against various defendants arising out of issuance of securities.here,jacobson claims raise a threshold question of law relating to securities generally,whether all defects described in f deprive an instrument of its status under a a.see grable,at the meaning of the federal tax provision is an important issue of federal law that sensibly belongs in a federal court.fracasse people united bank,cir.a pure question of law is more likely to be a substantial federal question.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,minimizing uncertainty over the tax treatment of securities,as congress intended,fully justif ies resort to the experience,solicitude,and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on federal issues,grable,at.
finally,exercising federal jurisdiction
