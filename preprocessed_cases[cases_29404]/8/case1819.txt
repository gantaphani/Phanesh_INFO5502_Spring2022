edwin fernandez fernandez appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,dismissing his complaint against michael chertoff,as secretary of the department of homeland security department,for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.fernandez,who is of puerto rican ethnicity,commenced this action pro se under title vii of the civil rights act of,et.title vii,alleging employment discrimination on account of his race,sex,and national origin after the department denied his request to be reinstated to his former position as a canine enforcement officer ceo following a medical leave of absence.in his complaint,fernandez alleged that his labor union,the national treasury employees union nteu,initially challenged the department decision denying his reinstatement by invoking arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement but later withdrew his grievance from arbitration when he rejected a proposed settlement.
the department moved to dismiss the complaint,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,contending that fernandez had not appealed to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc following the nteu withdrawal from arbitration and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the civil service reform act of before filing his title vii lawsuit.following a hearing,the district court determined that fernandez had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not appealing his grievance to the eeoc,and the court further declined to apply equitable principles to excuse this failure.the court then granted the department motion and dismissed the complaint.because we conclude that the district court,in declining to apply equitable principles to excuse fernandez failure,erred in failing to consider all of the unique circumstances of this case,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
fernandez medical leave of absence and return to work 
fernandez was injured on august,when he slipped and fell down a stairway while working as a ceo at newark airport for the united states customs service now customs and border protection.as a result of his fall,fernandez sustained injuries to his neck,right shoulder,and lower back and underwent rehabilitation that caused him to miss work from september to august,when he returned to active duty.in the intervening time period,fernandez was examined by several doctors who evaluated his ability to return to work.
on july,fernandez was examined by michael carciente,who opined that fernandez did not suffer from any neurological injury that would prevent him from returning to work as a ceo.on july,fernandez was examined by andrew weiss,who also concluded that fernandez was capable of returning to active duty employment without any restrictions.on september,however,fernandez was examined by igor stiler,who diagnosed him with a herniated disc in the lumbar region and with injuries to the thoracic and cervical spines.stiler opined that fernandez was considered to have a partial disability and approved his return to work on restricted duty only.the restrictions prevented fernandez from lifting more than twenty pounds,sitting or standing in the same position for more than twenty minutes,and squatting,bending,or reaching above his head.
fernandez forwarded stiler opinion letter to his supervisors on september,and requested to return to work in a light duty capacity.he was advised,however,that no light duty existed for the canine unit and that he was required to provide the department with a physician note indicating that he was able to return to full duty.on november,the department sent fernandez a letter setting forth his various options for returning to work or going on disability.on november,in response to an inquiry from the department,stiler confirmed that fernandez was unable to return to employment due to his disc herniation and that his work restrictions should be considered permanent.on december,fernandez again requested to return to work in a light duty capacity,but he received no response.
subsequently,fernandez was examined by andrew feldman,who opined that he would be able to return to work on full duty and without any restrictions on february.on march,fernandez was examined by areta podhorodecki,who performed a functional capacity evaluation,concluded that he met the skill level requirements for a ceo,and also recommended that he return to full duty.
in light of the conflicting medical opinions,the office of workers compensation programs referred fernandez to sanford wert.following an examination on april,wert opined that there was no objective evidence of any disability and concluded that fernandez could continue working in his occupation in a normal capacity.fernandez thereafter wrote a letter to customs service area director kathleen haage on may,advising that he had not heard from the department about his return to work and that he was fit,able and willing to return to work full duty.in addition,fernandez alleged that he had been persecuted,discriminated and retaliated against because of previous grievances filed against a canine officer supervisor.
on july,fernandez again notified the department that he was prepared to return to work.because his leave of absence had exceeded one year,however,the department determined that it was not obligated to return him to his former ceo position and instead reassigned him to the position of a customs entry program specialist in the world trade center,to commence august.
ii.the nteu grievance process and fernandez eeo complaint 
on september,larry tanacredi,president of the local chapter of the nteu representing employees in the customs service,filed a grievance on behalf of fernandez challenging the department decision to deny reinstatement and requesting a meeting to discuss dispute resolution.the collective bargaining agreement between the department and the nteu in place at that time permitted allegations of discrimination to be raised through the negotiated grievance process.following delays in convening the meeting due to the events of september,the nteu reiterated its demand for a dispute resolution meeting to address fernandez claim.
on october,an equal employment opportunity eeo counselor in the department was notified by nteu that a grievance had been filed on fernandez behalf.two days later,fernandez was advised that he could not seek relief from the equal employment opportunity eeo counselor because he had elected to resolve his complaint through the grievance process the filing of the nteu grievance indicates that fernandez has elected to pursue this matter via process,and t he same issue can not be pursued through the eeo process.he was also advised that if he were dissatisfied with the result of the grievance proceeding,he could contact an eeo counselor within days of completion of gr ie vance process final action.despite this notice,on october,fernandez contacted an eeo counselor and filed an informal complaint alleging retaliation in connection with the department refusal to reinstate him.fernandez then filed a formal eeo complaint on november.the formal complaint was dismissed by letter on december.the letter advised fernandez that his complaint of discrimination was being dismissed because the matter was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits allegations of discrimination.significantly,the letter also indicated that t he final decision on the grievance may be appealed to the eeoc.
on august,the nteu,pursuing the dispute resolution process,invoked arbitration of fernandez grievance.on january,fernandez authorized the appointment of nteu assistant counsel ralph talarico as his representative.in december,the department offered to settle fernandez grievance by,among other things,placing him in a ceo position at john kennedy international airport,along with a promotion to.the nteu,through talarico,advised fernandez to accept the offer or it would withdraw the grievance from arbitration.dissatisfied with the terms of the proposed settlement,however,fernandez refused to sign the agreement,which he believed to be a trap door to termination by the department.on march,the nteu withdrew the grievance from arbitration.fernandez contends that he was not permitted to participate in the arbitration process.
shortly thereafter,fernandez contacted the eeoc to seek a letter,but his efforts were unsuccessful.fernandez filed the instant complaint on may.the form complaint provided to fernandez indicated that t his action is brought for discrimination in employment pursuant to title vii and noted that i n order to bring a suit in federal district court under title vii,you must first obtain a right to sue letter from the equal employment opportunity commission.in a letter to the district court accompanying the complaint,fernandez advised that he returned to the eeoc in new york to request an updated right to su e letter,as i was told by the pro se office,but the eeoc said that i did not need it.
iii.proceedings before the district court 
the department moved to dismiss fernandez complaint on the grounds that his title vii claim was barred under the civil service reform act of by his initial decision to pursue relief under the nteu negotiated grievance procedure his title vii claim was untimely and he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in the eeoc after the nteu withdrew from arbitration.in support of its motion,the department argued that fernandez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he still was required to appeal to the eeoc before filing the present lawsuit if he was dissatisfied either with the department offer,with the nteu decision to withdraw the arbitration,or with any other aspect of the grievance process.the department further indicated that fernandez did not appeal to the eeoc,or take any other steps to pursue his grievance within the standard period for appeals to the eeoc,a,a,and that there was no basis for invoking principles of waiver,estoppel,or equitable tolling because t he department informed fernandez in december that his eeo claim was barred by his prior decision to file a union grievance and i t also informed him that he could appeal the outcome of the grievance to the eeoc.
following a hearing,the district court granted the department motion and dismissed the complaint.the court first determined that fernandez election to proceed under a negotiated grievance procedure required him to exhaust that remedy before filing his title vii lawsuit and that his failure to appeal the result of the grievance process to the eeoc precluded him from seeking relief in federal court.the court then declined to apply equitable doctrines to excuse fernandez failure to exhaust eeoc remedies,finding that he had received notice of his right to appeal the final decision of the grievance process to the eeoc but had failed to exercise reasonable diligence in doing so.fernandez ridge,wl,at.moreover,the court determined that fernandez had not shown any extraordinary circumstances that prevented him from appealing to the eeoc.finally,the court held that fernandez was statutorily barred from seeking any relief because he was required to raise his grievance under either a negotiated procedure or a statutory procedure,but not both,and he already had pursued the same matter through the nteu negotiated procedure without having appealed to the eeoc.this timely pro se appeal by fernandez ensued

ii.statutory framework 
election of remedies 
the civil service reform act of,stat,csra,comprehensively overhauled the civil service system,replacing a patchwork of rules and regulations with a new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against federal employees.dotson griesa,cir quoting lindahl office of pers,d alteration in dotson.the csra requires unions and federal employers to include procedures for settling grievances in their collective bargaining agreements.the term grievance is defined to include any complaint by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee.a a.with limited exception,the csra provides that the grievance procedure in any collective bargaining agreement shall be the exclusive administrative procedure for resolving grievances which fall within the agreement coverage.id.a.where the employee is aggrieved by discrimination,however,he may elect to seek relief under an alternative procedure,designated as the statutory procedure.id.d.to further balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration,the csra prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies applicable to adverse personnel action s,including the availability of administrative and judicial review.fausto,d.
under the csra,an employee of the united states customs and border protection who is aggrieved by discriminatory personnel practices may,in the first instance,pursue his grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure or the statutory complaint procedure,but not both.see d johnson peterson.said differently,an employee who alleges a discriminatory personnel practice must elect to pursue his claim under either a statutory procedure or a grievance procedure he can not pursue both avenues,and his election is irrevocable.vinieratos dep t of the air force,cir emphasis added.by invoking the negotiated procedure,the employee commits to resolving his grievance in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the collective bargaining agreement between his union and his employing agency.specifically,the csra 
establishes a system for federal agencies and their employees,under the administration of the federal labor relations authority.the act recognizes the right of federal employees to form and join unions,and imposes upon management officials and employee unions the duty to negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement.a.a agreement must provide procedures for the settlement of grievances,a,which are defined as complaint s concerning any claimed violation,misinterpretation,or misapplication of any law,rule,or regulation affecting conditions of employment,a c ii and the agreement must provide that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration which may be invoked by either party.b c presently b c iii.
dep t of treasury,fed.labor relations,d.
on the other hand,by invoking the statutory procedure,an employee pursues his grievance under the statutory and regulatory framework created to resolve original complaints of employment discrimination under title vii and related statutes.under the statutory procedure,the csra distinguishes between pure discrimination cases and mixed discrimination cases.a pure discrimination case,johnson,at,involves claims of discrimination only.see b prohibiting discrimination based on race,color,religion,sex,national origin,age,disability,marital status or political affiliation.for example,an employee may claim that his termination was prompted by discrimination without challenging the employer stated reasons for his termination.or,the employee may claim that the penalty imposed,although authorized,was applied only to members of his or her race.these scenarios are examples of pure discrimination cases.an aggrieved employee may pursue a pure discrimination case in the first instance by filing a complaint with the eeo office of his employing agency.see.
by contrast,a mixed case involves both a claim of discrimination and a challenge to other types of prohibited personnel actions taken by the agency that are ultimately appealable to the merit systems protection board mspb.am.fed of gov t employees,local reno.the mspb has jurisdiction to review personnel actions that include removal,reduction in grade or pay,and denial of reinstatement,among others.see,a.an aggrieved employee in a mixed case may file a mixed case complaint with the eeo office of his employing agency,see a defining a mixed case complaint as a complaint of employment discrimination filed with a federal agency based on race,color,religion,sex,national origin,age or handicap related to or stemming from an action that can be appealed to the mspb.alternatively,an employee in a mixed case may file a mixed case appeal directly to the mspb,see a defining a mixed case appeal as an appeal filed with the mspb that alleges that an appealable agency action was effected,in whole or in part,because of discrimination on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,national origin,handicap or age see also johnson,at a a n injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch may appeal to the mspb an agency failure to restore,improper restoration,or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence,a economou caldera,cir sloan west,cir.see generally b an aggrieved person may initially file a mixed case complaint with an agency pursuant to this part or an appeal on the same matter with the mspb pursuant to cfr,but not both.
the foregoing illustrates that an employee aggrieved by discrimination may elect either the negotiated or statutory procedure to resolve his grievance in the first instance and that the statutory procedure available to him depends upon the nature of his claim.
b.the right to appeal 
as relevant to this appeal,once an employee elects to pursue the negotiated grievance procedure and that process is carried out to completion,administrative review becomes available.before bringing a title vii action in the district court,an aggrieved employee is required to exhaust his administrative remedies.see downey runyon,cir.under d 
an aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section b of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure,but not both.an employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing,in accordance with the provisions of the parties negotiated procedure,whichever event occurs first.selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the merit systems protection board to review the final decision pursuant to section of this title in the case of an personnel action that could have been appealed to the board,or,where applicable,to request the equal employment opportunity commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the equal employment opportunity commission.
emphasis added.
because d encompasses b,claims of discrimination based on race,color,religion,sex,national origin,age,disability,marital status,or political applies to pure discrimination cases.because d also alludes to establishes a special statutory procedure for mixed applies to mixed cases,as well.with respect to pure discrimination cases,
section d requires a federal employee with a pure discrimination complaint to choose between the statutory and the negotiated grievance procedures.the employee who chooses the negotiated procedure may appeal the arbitrator decision to the eeoc.only after the eeoc has rendered a decision or failed to do so within days may the employee initiate suit in district court.
johnson,at.accordingly,in a pure discrimination case,an employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure must appeal the arbitrator award to the eeoc before bringing suit.in such a case,an appeal of a final grievance decision on a grievance which raises an employment discrimination claim,must be filed at the eeoc within days of complainant receipt of the final decision by the arbitrator,wl,citing eeoc management directive,chapter,section ii a november,see,wl.
with respect to mixed cases,
a careful analysis of the language and the structure of the csra reveals that an employee who chooses to pursue a mixed case through the negotiated grievance procedure,must first appeal the arbitrator decision to the mspb before seeking judicial review mixed cases are covered by subsection d of.subsection d allows an employee in a mixed case to seek mspb review of an arbitrator decision thus,the csra provides a path by which the employee can obtain judicial review.

iii.fernandez grievance 
a.the nature of fernandez claim 
the department the first time on fernandez pursued a mixed discrimination case because his claim involves a prohibited personnel action over which the merit systems protection board has jurisdiction.the significance of the department argument is that,in a mixed case,fernandez would have been required to appeal to the mspb under d before commencing this action in the district court,which he clearly did not do.based upon our review of the record,however,we conclude that fernandez raised a pure discrimination claim and,therefore,that he was required to pursue his administrative remedies in the eeoc.
first,fernandez was advised by letter dated december,that his eeo complaint was being dismissed because the matter was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits allegations of discrimination.that letter characterized fernandez claim as a formal complaint of discrimination that raise d an allegation of retaliation identical to the one raised in the negotiated grievance procedure.significantly,the letter specifically notified fernandez that,while any allegations of discrimination must be raised in the grievance process because he elected to pursue his grievance in that forum,t he final decision on the grievance may be appealed to the eeoc.emphasis added.the letter mentioned nothing of a mixed claim,a claim involving a prohibited personnel action under the exclusive jurisdiction of the mspb,or a right to appeal to the mspb if the result of arbitration was not favorable.as far as fernandez knew,he had raised a pure discrimination claim and could appeal the final decision of the arbitrator to the eeoc.
second,the department own motion to dismiss recognized that fernandez had raised a pure discrimination claim that could be exhausted only in the eeoc.in support of the motion,the department asserted that e ven if the decision to withdraw the arbitration was made by the union and not fernandez,fernandez was still required to appeal to the eeoc before filing the present lawsuit if he was dissatisfied either with the department offer,with the nteu decision to withdraw the arbitration,or with any other aspect of the grievance process.the department further stated that fernandez did not appeal to the eeoc,or take any other steps to pursue his grievance and c onsequently,he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the union grievance process,thereby precluding him from bringing suit in court.finally,the department recognized that it had informed fernandez in december that his eeo claim was barred by his prior decision to file a
