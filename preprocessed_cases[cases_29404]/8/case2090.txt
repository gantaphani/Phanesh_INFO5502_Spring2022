we are presented in this appeal with an dispute concerning the validity of the last will and testament of isidore sisko also referred to herein as the decedent,a late resident of jackson heights,new york.in that testamentary was admitted to probate in by the new york state surrogate court for queens county the surrogate court isidore sisko bequeathed the entirety of his estate to his sister,anne sisko pollin pollin,but gave nothing to his daughter and only child,rochelle moser moser.attributing her total disinheritance to foul play by pollin and the other three defendants,moser has turned concurrently to two courts for relief.
first,in march,moser petitioned the surrogate court to vacate its prior decree admitting the decedent will to probate.the basis for the vacatur petition were allegations by moser that the decedent will is a forgery and that the defendants engaged in testamentary fraud.a trial remains forthcoming in that matter.second,in april,moser filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york a diversity action asserting various claims against the defendants,namely fraudulent concealment and constructive fraud in connection with the probate of the decedent will.
the appeal now before us arises directly out of moser latter lawsuit.specifically,moser appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york frederic block,judge staying the defendants motions to dismiss the complaint pending resolution of the concurrent vacatur proceeding before the surrogate court.moser contends that the district court abused its discretion in issuing the stay and thus moser federal diversity action against the defendants should never have been held in abeyance.we decline to address the merits of the stay because we vacate the district court order on jurisdictional grounds.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction bars the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over moser complaint.
factual background 
when isidore sisko died on may,his gross estate was valued at approximately.surviving the decedent were a number of relatives,including moser,pollin,irvin pollin husband of pollin,and hyman sisko the decedent brother.all are parties to this federal diversity suit.
the decedent last will and testament the will,dated just two days before his death,named pollin the executrix and sole beneficiary of his estate.the attesting witnesses to the will were hyman sisko and laura monserrat,the daughter of the decedent domestic companion.were it not for the existence and operation of the will,new york laws of intestacy would have caused the decedent entire estate to be distributed to moser rather than pollin.see.powers trusts law a.
on june,pollin petitioned the surrogate court to admit the will to probate.pollin retained the services of george cerrone cerrone,a new york attorney and the remaining defendant in this case.pursuant to a consent and waiver to probate executed by moser,as well as affidavits of attestation submitted by hyman sisko and laura monserrat,the surrogate court issued a decree admitting the will to probate on august,the probate decree.
the above events would have put to rest,so to speak,the decedent worldly affairs had not moser subsequently become 
aware of facts indicating that the signature contained on the decedent will is not the signature of the decedent and constitutes a forgery that the will contained a false attestation clause that the decedent was dead when the subscribing witnesses signed the will that the defendant irvin pollin had typed the will that one of the subscribing witnesses laura monserrat had signed her name as a witness to the decedent will,without having spoken with the decedent,without having seen the decedent conscious,without having heard the decedent declare the instrument to be his will and without having seen the decedent sign the will that both of the subscribing witnesses had executed false witness affidavits and that the defendant anne sisko pollin had submitted a false probate petition and false witness affidavits to the surrogate court.
compl.this newly discovered evidence prompted moser to pursue concurrent legal action in two courts concerning the validity of the will the surrogate court and the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.
procedural history 
i.the surrogate court proceeding 
on march,moser petitioned the surrogate court,inter alia,to withdraw her waiver and consent to probate,to probate proceedings so as to vacate the probate decree,and for an award of compensatory and punitive damages the vacatur petition.following discovery and several depositions,in a decree dated january,the surrogate court entered summary judgment on the vacatur petition against moser.
the supreme court of new york,appellate division,second department reversed on the grounds that moser had raised issues of fact with regard to the procurement of her waiver and consent,as well as sufficient evidence pointing to the invalidity of the will,to open probate.in re sisko,dep t.a trial on the vacatur petition was directed to proceed.
on august,the surrogate court granted moser leave to amend the vacatur petition in order to augment factual assertions and to request that a constructive trust be imposed on all of the decedent assets presently held by pollin the amended vacatur petition.moser further inserted into the amended vacatur petition two causes of action under new york concealment and constructive of which were alleged to have been committed by all of the defendants named in this appeal.
at oral argument,we were informed by counsel for both parties that the surrogate court had not yet set a date for trial on the amended vacatur petition and likely would not do so in the near future.
ii.the federal diversity action 
the complaint in the instant diversity action the complaint was filed by moser on april,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.its factual allegations are identical to those contained in the amended vacatur petition,though the complaint purports to set forth a total of seven causes of action under new york law against the defendants.counts one through four allege fraud and concealment by the defendants count five alleges constructive fraud by the defendants count six is not a distinct cause of action but seeks to impose a constructive trust on all of the decedent assets presently held by pollin and count seven alleges that cerrone committed perjury in violation of new york judiciary law.besides compensatory damages totaling million,moser seeks punitive damages against all the defendants and an additional million in treble damages against cerrone under count seven.
on october,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,the defendants collectively moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,failure to state a claim,and res judicata.the defendants also moved in the alternative to stay moser federal action pending resolution of the amended vacatur petition before the surrogate court.on an individual basis,irvin pollin further moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of personal jurisdiction.on october,cerrone moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity as required by federal rule of civil procedure b.
oral argument on the motions was held on august.in a ruling delivered from the bench that day and later summarized in a written order,the district court found that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction over moser claims,but that nonetheless the rule motions should be stayed pending the outcome of the proceeding currently before the surrogate court,queens county.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
questions of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed de novo.see sol,cir.a plaintiff must prove the existence of subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.see makarova united states,cir.when subject matter jurisdiction is challenged,we are free to consider materials extrinsic to the complaint.see phifer city of,cir.
i.the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction 
this action formally satisfies the statutory requisites of federal diversity jurisdiction there is complete diversity between the parties and an amount in controversy exceeding.see a.nevertheless,the supreme court has held that probate matters are excepted from the scope of federal diversity jurisdiction,the reason being that the equity jurisdiction conferred by the judiciary act of which is that of the english court of chancery in,did not extend to probate matters.markham allen.we have described the jurisdictional exception recognized in markham as too well established a feature of our federal system to be lightly discarded.ashton josephine bay michael paul,cir quoting dragan miller,cir.
a inquiry is used to determine whether a particular lawsuit implicates probate matters such that the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction applies.an affirmative answer to either prong requires that the case be dismissed from federal court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.first,is the federal district court sitting in diversity being asked to directly probate a will or administer an estate these functions are purely probate in character and are considered to be categorically outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.see markham,at.ashton,at.of course,since few practitioners would be so misdirected as to seek,for example,letters testamentary or letters of administration from a federal judge,the first prong of the probate exception is rarely,if ever,violated.
on the other hand,it would not at all be surprising for a diversity action filed in federal district court to be indirectly related to the probate of a will or the administration of an estate.the instant appeal,as we determine infra,presents just such a factual circumstance.in respect of lawsuits that are rather than purely probate in character,the supreme court has found that some but not all such suits fall categorically within the probate exception.markham,at.thus,the second prong of the probate exception asks whether entertaining the action would cause the federal district court to interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of property in the custody of the state court.id.only in those three enumerated situations must a case be dismissed from federal court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see dulce dulce,cir ashton,at.this interference prong is in practice the workhorse of the probate exception.
ii.analysis 
to begin,we believe this lawsuit could accurately be categorized as purely probate in character were it not for the labels used by moser in her complaint.moore graybeal,cir dragan,at.rather than claim outright that the will is invalid and thus the decedent estate should pass to her by intestacy,moser avers that the defendants have committed various torts against her in connection with the will probate and have thereby wrongfully deprived her of her inheritance.whether or not this diversity action is technically one for fraudulent concealment and constructive fraud,it is in substance nothing more than a thinly veiled will contest.see graybeal,at regardless of how the plaintiff characterizes her claim,she is seeking in substance to invalidate the will.had the complaint remained identical in all respects except that the federal court was asked to set aside the will and formally declare an intestacy,we have little doubt but that the first prong of the probate exception would require dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
we need not decide the relevance of labels in the probate exception context,however,to resolve this particular case.instead,we assume that moser lawsuit is rather than purely probate in character.doing so requires us to apply only the interference prong of the probate exception.an impermissible interference for purposes of the probate exception might arise in one of three ways if,by adjudicating the complaint,the federal district court interferes with the probate proceedings assumes general jurisdiction of the probate or asserts control of property in the custody of the state court.markham,at.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.
we may immediately eliminate from consideration the third category of interference as there are presently no assets of the decedent within the custody of the surrogate court.we may also eliminate from consideration the second category of general jurisdiction of the probate.this arises when the federal district court sitting in diversity entertains a cause of action that under state law would be cognizable only by the probate court.lamberg callahan,cir in new york,the surrogate courts share concurrent subject matter jurisdiction with the state court of general jurisdiction,the supreme court.see const.art.vi,pollicina misericordia hosp.med,in re estate of malloy,see also dulce,at recognizing holding of in re estate of malloy.there thus exists no probate jurisdiction belonging exclusively to the surrogate court for the district court improperly to usurp 
all that remains,then,is to decide whether moser federal diversity suit against the defendants would interfere with the probate proceedings concerning the amended vacatur petition concurrently pending before the surrogate court.should the federal lawsuit reach final judgment first and moser successfully litigate all aspects of her case therein,the district court will have concluded that the defendants committed fraudulent concealment and constructive fraud.such a conclusion would be supported by findings of fact that accord with the core allegations contained in the complaint that the signature of the decedent on the will is a forgery that at least one of the attesting witnesses did not actually witness the will execution that the will was typed by one of the defendants that all of the defendants knew of the will infirmities prior to its admission to probate in and that nonetheless the defendants concealed their knowledge from moser and the surrogate court.
by operation of collateral estoppel and res judicata,each of these final determinations by the district court would be binding on the proceeding still pending before the surrogate court.see ryan,to be sure,it is a fundamental principle that a judgment rendered jurisdictionally and unimpeached for fraud shall be conclusive,as to the questions litigated and decided,upon the parties thereto and their privies,whom the judgment,when used as evidence,relieves from the burden of otherwise proving,and bars from disproving,the facts therein determined.quoting fulton county gas hudson river.what is truly significant for purposes of the probate exception interference in our view ultimately the totality with which the district court judgment will predetermine the result to be reached by the surrogate court in respect of the amended vacatur petition pending before it.
in that petition,moser seeks to withdraw her waiver and consent to probate and thereby vacate the probate decree.new york law provides that a party seeking to set aside a probate decree entered upon his consent must show that such consent was obtained by fraud or overreaching,or was the product of misrepresentation or misconduct,or that evidence,clerical error or other sufficient cause justifies the reopening of the decree.in re hall,dep t internal citations omitted.if the district court finds that the defendants committed fraudulent concealment and constructive fraud in connection with the will and its probate,the basis for vacating the probate decree will already have been conclusively established.in short,the result of moser federal diversity suit wholly dictates the result of the amended vacatur petition before the surrogate court.
we find this to be a clear instance of an impermissible interference for purposes of the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction.any other conclusion would render meaningless the supreme court admonition that federal courts sitting in diversity may not interfere with the probate proceedings concurrently pend
