for years,the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc or the commission has endeavored to promote the utilization and protection of the fisheries of the atlantic seaboard.the commission is the product of a congressionally approved interstate compact authorized by article i,clause of the united states constitution.this interlocutory appeal requires us to determine whether the,united boatmen of new york,new york fishing tackle trade association,and the fishermen conservation association collectively or united boatmen,may assert a claim under section of the administrative procedure act,the apa,to seek judicial review of the commission decisions.
in essence,the premise of united boatmen complaint in intervention is a simple one maintain that the commission is more than a congressionally authorized state cooperative agreement.in the view of the,asmfc is a federal agency,or at least acts so much like one that we should treat it as one for purposes of the apa.
we hold that the asmfc is not a federal agency within the meaning of the apa it is not an authority of the g overnment of the united states.b.we further hold that,in this case,the agency doctrine should not be used to expand the statutory definition of an agency under the apa.thus,united boatmen are not entitled,pursuant to,to seek judicial review of the actions of the commission.we therefore reverse and remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of this court.
background 
this case arises from disputes over the management of the summer flounder fishery off of the atlantic coast.in response to a decrease in the stock of summer flounder,also known as fluke,regulatory efforts have been made to conserve and restore the population.connecticut dep t of commerce,cir.the atlantic seaboard states retain primary authority over the conservation and management of fisheries within the territorial sea waters within three miles of shore,as well as in rivers and estuaries.the federal government is responsible for regulation of the exclusive economic zone waters from three to miles from shore.see b,a,see also sea hawk seafoods,locke,cir united boatmen gutierrez,d.
the facts and procedural history of this controversy are set out in detail in the opinions of the district court.see new york gutierrez,civ.cps rlm,wl,at e,see also new york locke,civ.cps rlm,wl,at,new york locke,civ.cps rlm,wl,at,new york gutierrez,d.a brief review of the facts and history of this case is all that is needed to provide context for our decision.
this suit was commenced by the state of new york,the commissioner of the new york state department of environmental conservation,and the new york state department of environmental conservation collectively new york state plaintiffs,against the secretary of the united states department of commerce,the united states department of commerce,the under secretary of commerce and administrator for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration,the national oceanic and atmospheric administration,and the acting assistant administrator for the national marine fisheries service collectively federal defendants the new york state plaintiffs contend that the final management rule for the recreational summer flounder fishery violates the fishery conservation and management act,as amended in by the sustainable fisheries act,et the msa,and the apa,a 
in this action are private groups who maintain that the new york state plaintiffs failed to adequately represent their interests in defining the scope of their suit.united boatmen of new york,is a professional trade organization that represents the fishing vessel industry in new york.members of united boatmen derive a substantial portion of their revenue from sport fishing for summer flounder.the new york fishing tackle trade association,is a professional trade organization that represents the wholesale and retail bait and tackle dealer industry in new york.the fishermen conservation association is a organization whose members are individual recreational anglers who target,among other species,summer flounder in state and federal waters contiguous to new york state.
in,the asmfc was created by a congressionally approved interstate compact asmfc compact.see,stat,as amended by,stat.see also const.art.i,cl.the purpose of the compact is to promote the better utilization of the fisheries of the atlantic seaboard through a joint program for the promotion and protection of such fisheries.asmfc compact,art.i.the compact specifically provides that it shall not be construed to limit the powers of any signatory state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries.asmfc compact,art.ix.
each member state appoints three representatives to the commission asmfc compact,art.iii.the compact requires that these representatives be the state director of marine fisheries,a state legislator,and a citizen with knowledge relevant to the regulation of marine fisheries.id.the signatories to the asmfc exercise joint regulatory oversight of their fisheries through the development of interstate fishery management plans.fishermen alliance,dep t of envtl,cir accord medeiros vincent,cir.from the inception of the asmfc until,participation in the interstate fishery management plans adopted by the commission was voluntary.medeiros,at.consequently,compliance was spotty.id.
in,congress adopted the atlantic coastal fisheries cooperative management act,the acfcma,in order to give the asmfc some teeth.fishermen alliance,at.congress sought to accomplish this goal by mandating state participation in the interstate fishery management plans promulgated by the commission.a.pursuant to the acfcma,a plan must specify the requirements necessary for s tates to be in compliance,and the asmfc must identify each s tate that is required to implement and enforce that plan.id.the commission is obligated to review member states implementation and enforcement of coastal fishery management plans and report the results of the reviews to the secretary of commerce.id.c.
under the acfcma,the secretary of commerce is empowered to make an independent finding regarding whether a state has failed to implement management measures and,if so,whether the measures that the s tate has failed to implement and enforce are necessary for the conservation of the fishery in question.id.a.if the secretary makes a determination of noncompliance with respect to necessary measures,he or she shall declare a moratorium on fishing in the fishery in question within the waters of the noncomplying s tate.id.c.
the congressional findings accompanying the acfcma note that b ecause no single governmental entity has exclusive management authority for atlantic coastal fishery resources,harvesting of such resources is frequently subject to disparate,inconsistent,and intermittent s tate and f ederal regulation that has been detrimental to the conservation and sustainable use of such resources.id.a.the acfcma explicitly affirms,however,that the responsibility for managing atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the s tates,which carry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management through the atlantic states marine fisheries commission.id.a.
on july,united boatmen moved to intervene in the action commenced by the new york state plaintiffs and to join the commission as a defendant.see wl,at.the court granted united boatmen motion and decline d to limit the scope of united boatmen intervention to the parties and issues asserted in the new york plaintiffs complaint.id.at.the court concluded that the new york state plaintiffs failure to join asmfc as a defendant constituted nonfeasance,sufficient to rebut the presumption of adequate representation present when a state brings suit in its capacity as parens patriae,see,united states hooker chem.plastics,cir see also united states city of,cir.following the district court decision,filed their complaint in intervention on december.
asmfc brought a motion to dismiss united boatmen complaint in intervention for failure to state a claim.d at see also.b.in support of its motion to dismiss,asmfc pointed out that neither its governing nor any federal statute provide a private right of action to seek judicial review of its regulatory decisions more importantly for purposes of this litigation,the commission maintained that the provisions of the apa,which provide a right of action against federal agencies,b,do not apply to action by an interstate compact entity 
the district court denied asmfc motion to dismiss.d at.the court concluded that could maintain a claim against the commission under section of the apa based on the theory that the commission is a agency.id.at.in so holding,the district court concluded that allowing asmfc actions essentially to escape judicial review would be inappropriate.id.at.the district court then granted the commission request for certification of its order for interlocutory appeal.b.a panel of this court granted leave to appeal the interlocutory order of the district court.
on appeal,the commission advances largely the same arguments that it did before the district court.essentially,asmfc argues that complaint should be dismissed as it pertains to the commission because it is not a federal agency therefore,may not seek review of the commission fishery management decisions under the apa.by contrast,urge us to affirm the district court determination that the commission is a agency subject to suit under the apa.also suggest that this court take an even stronger position than the one adopted by the district court and find that the commission is actually a federal agency for the purpose of regulating coastal fishing activities.we hold that the commission is not subject to suit by united boatmen under the apa.
ii.discussion 
the coverage of the apa,including its judicial review provisions,is governed by the statutory definition of the term agency.thus,we must first look to the text,see sec.exch.comm dorozhko,cir,of section b,which provides a definition of this term.see bailey united states,d.other authorities have characteriz ed the apa definition as not very satisfactory.lee constr,fed.reserve bank,quoting davis,administrative law treatise,at see also soucie david,stating the apa statutory definition of agency is not entirely clear.we agree that we can not say that the meaning of agency as defined by the apa is so plain on its face as to end our inquiry,barscz,office of workers comp.programs boat,cir.while this may not be a case where our inquiry should end with the text,but see united states ron pair,d,the text of the apa does provide significant guidance.
examination of the definition of a federal agency,as provided by the apa,reveals that the asmfc compact does not fall within the scope of the statute.in reaching this conclusion,w e consider not only the bare meaning of the word agency,bailey,at,but also the purpose of the apa and the structure and function of the commission.we further hold that,assuming the validity of the agency doctrine,even on its own terms,it does not apply to the commission.
a.the statutory definition of agency does not encompass the commission 
the provisions of the apa provide the statutory structure upon which federal administrative law is built.seifert,cir internal quotation marks omitted and alteration in original.the apa states that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action is entitled to judicial review thereof.under the apa the term agency is defined as an authority of the g overnment of the united states.b see also old town trolley tours of.metro.area transit comm n.despite this express definition,courts that have wrestled with its application have declared that the law on the simple question of what is an agency is quite complex.mckinney caldera,d,quoting lee constr.at.these courts have emphasized the need to examine the structure,function,and mandate of the entity in question in determining whether it falls within the definition set out in the apa.id.at see also.research project,dep t of health,educ.welfare.
the apa definition expressly excludes certain entities,such as congress and the federal courts.b a b see also id.b c h.although an interstate compact entity is not specifically exempted from the definition,this textual silence,when read against the backdrop of the canons of construction applicable to statutes that implicate the separation of powers,points,armstrong bush,to the conclusion that the asmfc is not a federal agency within the meaning of the apa.it is axiomatic that the statutory definition of the term excludes unstated meanings of that term.meese keene,d see also day shalala,cir concluding that a state entity administering a federal program was not subject to the requirements of the apa because the apa applies only to federal agencies.in any event,the statutory exclusions from the coverage of the apa applies only to bodies that would otherwise be authorit ies of the g overnment of the united states.b.we find that the commission is not such an authority.
the wording of section b indicates that we should not give the definition of agency a more expansive reading.see united states angelilli,cir.the text of the apa tells us what the term agency means.b.we have previously interpreted the word means as a more restrictive statutory term than another term that could have been selected by congress in defining surrounding statutory language.angelilli,at.we read it that way here.for example,the definitional language of the apa would have a different meaning if it told us that an agency includes various governmental authorities.see id.
the fact that the asmfc was created by an interstate compact and approved by congress does not alter this analysis.we find that the apa definition of a federal agency does not fit the commission.the asmfc compact states that the commission shall be a body corporate,with the powers and duties set forth in the compact.asmfc compact,art.iii.although the commission acts in parallel with the federal government in managing the stock of summer flounder off of the atlantic coast,it exists outside the federal administrative law framework.and,it would upset the balance,armstrong,at,to subject its actions to accountability measures devised to restrain the actions of federal authorities.fed.commc ns comm fox television stations,d.
the regulation of the territorial sea is a matter traditionally left to the states.see in re air crash off long island,new york,on july,cir.fishery management in the exclusive economic zone,however,is governed by federal authorities pursuant to the msa with one enumerated exception,see b,the msa states that it shall not be construed as extending or diminishing the jurisdiction or authority of any s tate within its boundaries,id.a.of course,summer flounder move freely between state and federal waters.city of charleston v.a fisherman best,cir recognizing that the habitat for swordfish spans both federal and state waters.thus,coordinated regulatory activities make good sense in this context.however,the fact that federal and state entities act toward a common goal does not convert the into a federal one.
although interstate compacts are contemplated by the constitution,const.art.i,cl,and subject to congressional approval,we can not escape the fact that the entity itself is an aggregation of states.while an interstate compact or agreement becomes federal law if it is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact within the meaning of the compact clause of the constitution,vacation holiday fund waterfront comm n,cir,it does not follow that the commission is a federal agency.to hold otherwise would have the effect of treating every congressionally authorized interstate compact entity,regardless of the body structure and function,into a federal agency for purposes of the apa.for reasons explained below,we do not think this result was intended by congress.
the authority exercised by asmfc under the compact is not federal in nature.the signatory states have agreed to coordinate their regulatory activity in order to promote the better utilization of the fisheries.asmf
