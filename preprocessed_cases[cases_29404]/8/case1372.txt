the pesticide dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate ddvp or dichlorvos is used to kill many types of insects.depending on the level of one exposure to dichlorvos,the pesticide also may disrupt proper functioning of the human nervous system.to determine safe levels of exposure to dichlorvos for certain exposure scenarios,the environmental protection agency epa relied heavily on a single study in which six people were paid to ingest a dose of the pesticide every day for three weeks.after the study detected an adverse effect,epa used the study to attempt to estimate,to a reasonable certainty,an aggregate level of exposure to dichlorvos at which no harm would result.epa then set tolerances regarding the maximum level of dichlorvos residue on food products.epa also registered numerous dichlorvos products for sale and distribution in the united states.
in june,nrdc petitioned epa to revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for dichlorvos.epa denied the petition and in response nrdc filed objections and requests for a public evidentiary hearing.epa denied those requests in a july,final order.nrdc now seeks review of that epa order,arguing in part that epa failed to explain why,when assessing the safety of dichlorvos for certain exposure scenarios,epa did not apply an additional tenfold children safety factor,to account for potential pre and toxicity and completeness of data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants and children.because such an explanation is required under the food quality protection act of fqpa,see b c ii,we grant nrdc petition for review in part,vacate epa june,order in part,and remand for further proceedings.
nrdc also appeals epa decision not to apply the tenfold children safety factor for certain risk assessments in which epa did not rely on the human study.in this regard,nrdc argues only that epa can not reduce or waive the tenfold children safety factor unless and until it completes the endocrine disruptor screening program.we reject this argument.fqpa allows epa to reduce or waive the tenfold margin of safety if reliable data indicate that a lower margin of safety will be safe for infants and children.fqpa does not require the reliable data to come from the endocrine disruptor screening program.accordingly,we deny in part nrdc petition for review.
lastly,having vacated the portions of epa june,order assessing the risk of dichlorvos based on the human study,we need not decide whether nrdc is entitled to a public evidentiary hearing regarding that study alleged statistical invalidity and failure to obtain informed consent.
i.the statutory authority for the epa regulation of pesticides 
epa oversees a comprehensive scheme of pesticide regulation under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,and the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra.
fdca regulates pesticide residues in the food supply and requires epa to establish tolerance levels or exemptions for the maximum permissible level of pesticide residue on food products.a c.before any agricultural commodity containing pesticide residue can be sold or distributed,a tolerance or exemption meeting certain safety standards must be promulgated by the epa.natural res.def.council johnson,cir.under fdca,a safe tolerance for a pesticide is determined by considering aggregate exposure to the pesticide,including all anticipated dietary exposures.b a ii.
fifra has a slightly different focus,but is linked with fdca in an important regard.fifra establishes a pesticide registration system and requires epa to set the conditions under which pesticides may be sold or distributed in the united states.c see also id.regulating labeling,packaging,composition,and disposal.in determining whether to register a pesticide under fifra,epa must consider whether the pesticide is safe under fdca.id.c c.in particular,epa may not register or reregister a pesticide if it determines that the pesticide would cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,which includes an unreasonable risk to man or a human dietary risk from residues that result from a use of a pesticide in or on any food inconsistent with the standard under,id.bb.in addition,if epa determines that a registered pesticide causes unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,it may cancel the registration.id.b.
in,congress asked the national academy of sciences nas to appoint a committee to study the vulnerability of infants and children to pesticide residues.five years later,the nas national research council released a report on the issue,concluding that t raditional approaches to toxicological risk assessment may not always adequately protect infants and children and recommending various reforms.national research council,pesticides in the diets of infants and children at,available at http hereinafter,research council,pesticides report.see also id.at.
in,in response to the national research council report,and aiming to better coordinate the safety standards in fifra and fdca,congress passed the food quality protection act fqpa,stat.three changes are most relevant here.first,fqpa established a new safety standard for pesticide tolerances.under fqpa,a pesticide tolerance is safe when there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue,including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.b a ii.in making this determination,congress required epa to consider,among other things,the validity,completeness,and reliability of the available data from studies,the anticipated and actual residue levels of the pesticide in or on foods,the dietary consumption patterns of consumers,the percent of food actually treated with the pesticide,and international standards.see id.b d f,b.further,congress required epa to consider 
safety factors which in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of food additives are generally recognized as appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data.
id.at b d ix.in this regard,the house report noted that it expect ed,based on discussions with epa,that epa would apply a fold safety factor to the scientifically determined no observable effect level when data are extrapolated from animal studies,at limiting this requirement to threshold effects,in which epa is able to identify a level at which the pesticide chemical residue will not cause or contribute to any known or anticipated harm to human health.
second,congress required epa to assess the risk of pesticide residue to infants and children when establishing,modifying,leaving in effect,or revoking a tolerance or exemption.b c.in assessing the risk,congress required epa to consider available information about 
i consumption patterns among infants and children that are likely to result in disproportionately high consumption of foods containing or bearing such residue among infants and children in comparison to the general population 
ii the special susceptibility of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residues,including neurological differences between infants and children and adults,and effects of in utero exposure to pesticide chemicals and 
iii the cumulative effects on infants and children of such residues and other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.
for each pesticide tolerance,congress required epa to ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue.id.b c ii i.to make this determination,congress required epa to use an additional tenfold margin of safety to take into account potential toxicity and completeness of the data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants and children.id.b c ii limiting this requirement to threshold effects.epa may use a different margin of safety for the pesticide chemical residue only if,on the basis of reliable data,such margin will be safe for infants and children.id.emphasis added.
lastly,given fqpa substantial changes to the method of determining pesticide safety,fqpa required that the epa reassess the safety of all tolerances.johnson,at.for this review,congress required epa to determine whether each tolerance is safe or exempt from the tolerance requirement.q.if a tolerance is neither safe nor exempt,epa must modify or revoke the tolerance.id.because this tolerance reassessment program runs concurrent to fifra reevaluation of pesticide registrations,see,and because both programs rely on the same underlying risk assessments for pesticides,see id.bb,c c,epa frequently has used interim reregistration eligibility decisions ireds to announce decisions on both tolerance reassessment and pesticide reregistration.johnson,at.
to challenge an existing tolerance,a ny person may file with epa a petition proposing that epa modify or revok e a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food.d a.epa requires such a petitioner to furnish reasonable grounds for the action sought,such as an assertion of facts supported by data if available showing that experience with the application of the tolerance or exemption from tolerance may justify its modification or revocation.b.
if epa denies the petition,it must issue a regulation or order explaining its reasons.d a.within sixty days after such regulation or order is issued,any person not just the petitioner may file objections thereto with epa.id.g a.the objections must specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation or order deemed objectionable and stat e reasonable grounds therefor.id.
in addition,a party objections may include a request for a public evidentiary hearing upon the objection.id.g b.the party is entitled to a public evidentiary hearing if and to the extent epa determines that such a public hearing is necessary to receive factual evidence relevant to material issues of fact raised by the objections.id.epa implementing regulations provide that a request for a hearing will be granted when the requesting party shows that 
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution at a hearing.an evidentiary hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.
there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would,if established,resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary 
resolution of the factual issue s in the manner sought by the person requesting the hearing would be adequate to justify the action requested 
after considering the objections and requests for a hearing,epa must issue a final order stating the action taken on each objection and request for a hearing.g c.any person who will be adversely affected by such order may obtain judicial review by filing an appeal in the appropriate circuit court of appeals.id.h.where such a person also challenge s the registration of pesticides under fifra,but does so only through a challenge to the tolerances set under the fdca,such a challenge represent s an issue as to which review is obtainable under section h in the appropriate circuit court of appeals.johnson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.nrdc petition to revoke the dichlorvos tolerances 
this appeal concerns nrdc petition requesting that epa revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for dichlorvos.dichlorvos is a synthetic pesticide used to kill many insects,including flies,mosquitos,gnats,cockroaches,and fleas.dichlorvos belongs to a family of pesticides known as organophosphates,developed from nerve warfare agents after world war ii.like other organophosphates,dichlorvos can disrupt proper functioning of the nervous system by inhibiting an important enzyme,cholinesterase,in red blood cells and the brain.currently,only amvac chemical corporation is registered to manufacture dichlorvos in the united states.
since,epa has expressed varying degrees of concern about dichlorvos safety.after studying the issue,epa proposed in to require a cancer warning on dichlorvos products.in,epa concluded that dichlorvos is a potential human carcinogen and issued a notice of special review,stating that dichlorvos may pose a risk of inducing in humans an oncogenic,heritable genetic,or chronic or delayed toxic effect.notice of initiation of special review for dichlorvos,alterations,internal quotation marks,and ellipses omitted.in,epa issued a preliminary determination of the special review process.epa concluded that the risks outweigh the benefits for most uses of dichlorvos and proposed to cancel most uses of dichlorvos,including all residential uses.notice of preliminary determination to cancel certain dichlorvos registrations.
before epa issued a final determination of the special review process,congress passed fqpa.thereafter,epa began to reevaluate dichlorvos under the new fqpa safety standards.in,epa released a preliminary risk assessment for dichlorvos,see dichlorvos preliminary risk assessment,and did not implement its earlier proposed cancellations.on may,epa announced that the sole dichlorvos registrant,amvac,proposed to add new restrictions to its product labels,in an attempt to ensure the products safe use.the labels included restrictions that larger pest strips can not be used in homes except in garages,attics,crawl spaces,and sheds that are occupied for less than four hours per day and that use of smaller pest strips in the home be limited to closets,wardrobes,and cupboards.further,amvac proposed to voluntarily delet e other uses of dichlorvos including mushroom house,greenhouse,and warehouse handheld fogger uses total release fogger,as well as lawn,and uses.
less than three weeks later,nrdc petitioned epa to find that dichlorvos causes unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and to revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for dichlorvos.
in its petition,nrdc requested that epa revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for dichlorvos.nrdc argued,inter alia,that epa relied on inadequate data in its preliminary risk assessment,inadequately performed that risk assessment,and failed to apply required safety factors.despite the numerous issues raised in its petition,we focus here on only the two issues relevant to nrdc appeal epa reliance on a intentional human dosing study by gledhill and epa failure to provide a legally adequate rationale for applying a children safety factor lower than the fqpa presumptive factor.
in its petition,nrdc argued that epa must reject the gledhill study,in which human subjects were paid to ingest dichlorvos,for two reasons.first,nrdc argued that the gledhill study included only treated subjects and controls and with such a small sample size,the results of the study are statistically meaningless and could never be used to establish safety.nrdc highlighted other alleged defects with the study,including the delay in sampling the subjects cholinesterase levels,the failure to test for plasma cholinesterase,and the lack of controlled environmental conditions.
second,nrdc argued that the gledhill study did not comply with epa ethical research rule.that rule forbids epa from relying on data from research initiated before april,if there is clear and convincing evidence that the research was either 
fundamentally unethical,the research was intended to seriously harm participants or failed to obtain informed consent,or 
significantly deficient relative to the ethical standards prevailing at the time the research was conducted.
nrdc asserted that the gledhill study was both fundamentally unethical and significantly deficient relative to prevailing ethical standards at the time.nrdc argued that the gledhill study a failed to obtain fully informed and voluntary consent from the subjects,in part because the consent form characterized dichlorvos as a drug instead of a pesticide b failed to provide the subjects free power of choice c was designed only to enrich the registrant by weakening safety standards,not to yield fruitful results for the good of society d caused avoidable harm and e incurred a degree of risk that exceeded any humanitarian importance.
nrdc also argued that epa must apply fqpa presumptive children safety factor when assessing the risk posed by dichlorvos.nrdc noted that epa had applied a fqpa children safety factor of in its preliminary risk assessment,and nrdc suspected that epa intended in its forthcoming ired to remove the fqpa safety factor entirely,as a result of a deal negotiated privately with amvac.either way,nrdc argued that i n the absence of reliable data and a legally adequate rationale for a lower safety factor,epa was required to apply fqpa presumptive children safety factor to determine tolerances for dichlorvos products.
first,nrdc argued that reliable data did not show that a children safety factor less than would be safe for infants and children.this safety factor,as nrdc noted,is designed to take into account potential pre and toxicity and completeness of the data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants and children.see b c ii.specifically,nrdc argued that the potential for pre and toxicity from exposure to dichlorvos,as cited by epa in its preliminary human health risk assessment,combined with incomplete data regarding toxicity and exposure to infants and children,compel epa to retain the default fqpa tenfold safety factor for dichlorvos.nrdc alleged various examples of critical missing data,including that a the results of adult testing are not a useful measure of children toxicity b epa did not implement an endocrine disruptor screening program with respect to dichlorvos,as required by fqpa and c evidence of pre and toxicity in animals constitute evidence of possible increased sensitivity in children and infants,requiring epa to demonstrate that a safety factor less than will be safe for children and infants.
second,nrdc argued that epa provided no explanation why an fqpa safety factor less than is adequate to protect against the uncertainties in the database including the risk of increased sensitivity of children and infants.nrdc further asserted that epa lacked a scientific explanation because of political interference in the safety factor decision,citing epa alleged decision to withdraw the determination from staff scientists.
a year and a half after nrdc filed its petition to revoke all dichlorvos tolerances and registrations,epa published an order denying the petition.order denying nrdc petition to revoke all tolerances.as an initial matter,after nrdc filed its petition,epa released the interim reregistration eligibility decision ired for ddvp.see epa,office of pesticide programs,interim reregistration eligibility decision for dichlorvos ddvp,available at.hereinafter,epa,dichlorvos ired.as epa later explained,the ired addressed ddvp eligibility for reregistration under fifra and assessed whether ddvp tolerances met the new safety standard enacted by the fqpa.at.in the ired,epa approved the use of dichlorvos products in many residential areas,such as homes,closets,garages,and cupboards commercial areas,such as picnic areas,ice cream stands,restaurants,and theaters and agricultural areas,such as diary barns,poultry houses,and feed lots.epa,dichlorvos ired at.epa noted that nrdc submitted comments on the ired and stated that it would consider those comments as well,to the extent they bore on issues in nrdc petition.at.
in its response,as relevant here,epa first provided an overview of its general method of risk assessment.epa then addressed and rejected nrdc arguments regarding the gledhill study and the fqpa children safety factor.
in describing its general approach to determining the safety of pesticide residue to humans under fqpa,epa stated that it applies a risk assessment process that combines information on pesticide toxicity with information regarding the route,magnitude,and duration of exposure to the pesticide.at.epa evaluates both,acute and,chronic adverse effects from pesticide exposure.id.for pesticides like dichlorvos in which epa determines that the pesticide adverse effect or effects have a threshold that is,a level below which exposure has no appreciable chance of causing the adverse effect epa attempts to calculate a safe level of exposure.id.
for the approach most relevant here,epa evaluates an array of toxicological studies on the pesticide and i n each of these studies,epa attempts to identify the lowest observed adverse effect level loael and the next lower dose at which there are no observed adverse affect levels noael.id.generally,epa will use the lowest noael from the available studies as a starting point in estimating the level of concern for humans.id.
once epa identifies the noael for an exposure scenario,epa then determines the margin of exposure moe that is necessary to be sure that exposure to the pesticide is safe.id.at.a safe moe is generally considered to be a margin at least as high as the product of all applicable safety factors for the pesticide.id.this approach is similar to an engineer who estimates that a bridge must hold x weight,and then designs the bridge in a way that she believes will hold weight,to create a margin of safety based on prior engineering practice.
as epa acknowledges,the use of safety factors plays a critical role in the process it uses to assess risk.id.at.generally,epa applies at least two separate safety factors,resulting in a safe margin of exposure of at least.id.the traditional safety factors account for differences between animals and humans when relying on studies in animals safety factor and differences among humans safety factor.id.this approach is consistent with the house report accompanying fqpa,which stated that it expect ed,based on discussions with epa,that epa would apply a fold safety factor to the scientifically determined no observable effect level when data are extrapolated from animal studies.at noting that epa could change its approach if such approach was adopted by regulation,scientifically based,and at least equally protective of public health.
in addition to the traditional safety factors,fqpa established a presumptive and additional tenfold children safety factor.see b c ii.as congress described,this safety factor was designed to take into account potential pre and toxicity and completeness of the data with respect to infants and children.b c ii.
further,epa noted that a dditional safety factors may be added to address data deficiencies or concerns raised by the existing data.at.for example,in some cases epa is unable to identify a noael in any of the relevant studies and must estimate a noael by extrapolating from a loael in a study that did not find a noael.see order denying nrdc objections and requests for hearing,july.in some cases,epa also chooses to estimate a noael from a loael despite the existence of a noael in another study.id.in either case,there may be considerable uncertainty about the true value of the noael.see order denying objections to issuance of tolerances,requiring sufficient toxicological evidence regarding a loael to estimate with confidence a projected noael that is unlikely to be higher than the actual noael incorporated into epa response to nrdc,see.at.to estimate a noael from a loael,epa typically divid es the loael by a safety factor.id.the size of the loael to noael safety factor depends on the severity and consistency of the effect at the loael as well as the effect severity and consistency at higher doses.at.
once epa has identified a safe margin of exposure,epa calculates the actual moe for a number of exposure scenarios.the actual moe is designed to measure how much of a pesticide a person would be exposed to under a given exposure scenario.to compare this actual amount to the safe moe,epa divides the no observable adverse effect level noael by the actual exposure,where both are expressed in common units of exposure per day.id.at.t he higher the actual moe,the safer the pesticide.id.accordingly,if the safe moe for a pesticide is,actual moes exceeding would generally not be of concern.id.in contrast,an actual moe less than the safe moe would be of concern.
for example,suppose epa relies on a study by gledhill in which an adverse effect is found when kilogram white men ingest grams of dichlorvos per day for three weeks.per kilogram of body weight,the effect is present at.because of the study less than ideal design,it identifies only a loael,not a noael.epa performs a loael to noael estimation,determining that a uncertainty factor is appropriate for this estimation.in addition,epa finds applicable the two traditional safety factors for inter and uncertainty,as well as fqpa children safety factor.thus,the safe moe is.epa then calculates the actual moe for an exposure scenario,such as dermal skin exposure in a greenhouse two hours after a smoke generator spreads dichlorvos.epa calculates dermal exposure in such a scenario to be and then divides that number into the noael of,resulting in an actual moe of.given the safe moe of based on the application of numerous safety factors the actual margin of exposure of is less than the safe margin of exposure,indicating that exposure to dichlorvos in such a scenario is not safe.
this example comes directly from epa ired for dichlorvos.see epa,dichlorvos ired at.moreover,it comes unchanged with one exception.in the ired,epa calculated the safe margin of exposure to be and thus found that the actual moe of for occupational dermal exposure to dichlorvos was not of concern.id.at.unlike above,epa applied neither the safety factor,nor the children safety factor.id.at.at this point,we note the different choices only to highlight that safety factors are very important under epa margin of exposure approach to determining the safety of pesticide residue to humans.indeed,the safety factors often are the difference between the withdrawal of a pesticide from the market and its continued use,id.at calculating that actual moes for residential exposure to resin pest strips,even in limited uses,are below and that the actual moe for residential exposure to pet flea collars is.
after the risk assessment overview,epa responded to the arguments raised in nrdc petition.first,epa considered nrdc argument that the gledhill study results are statistically meaningless and could never be used to establish safety.epa acknowledged that the gledhill study used only subjects of whom received a placebo and that as a general matter more subjects would provide greater statistical power.at.however,epa argued that in this case the use of to subjects with the appropriate statistical methodology is acceptable to epa because a positive response was seen.id.
epa stated that the gledhill study was consistent with nrdc argument that dichlorvos inhibited cholinesterase activity.in the study,all of the dosed subjects exhibited statistically significant with respect to their levels red blood cell cholinesterase depression on one or more days.id.epa also stated that it found a statistically significant difference between the cholinesterase group means of the dosed subjects and those of the placebo subjects on five of the eight measured dosing days.at.epa concluded that t he statistics of the study clearly show the ability to demonstrate a statistically significant response.at.because the gledhill study found an effect when the kg subjects ingested mg of dichlorvos per day,epa calculated that the effect occurred at a level of.
epa characterized this effect as a loael for two reasons.first,the gledhill study did identify an effect above background,and second,the effect appeared to be not large.id.that is,epa reasoned that the study showed some adverse effect,and that effect was sufficiently low to act as the loael the lowest observed adverse effect level.epa stated that it then adjusted that value with a safety factor of to approximate the value of a noael.id.at.with respect to the magnitude of the adverse effect in the gledhill study,epa stated that it appeared not large because the cholinesterase inhibition in dosed individuals varied from baseline within a range from to percent at the end of the study.id.however,epa did not explain whether the gledhill study,with dosed subjects and placebo subjects,had sufficient statistical power to determine with any level of precision the magnitude of the cholinesterase inhibition.
in addition to finding the gledhill study statistically valid for a limited purpose,epa rejected nrdc argument that the study violated epa ethical research rule.epa acknowledged that the study consent forms referred to dichlorvos as a drug,but its independent experts found that the forms clearly advised subjects that this was a study involving consuming an insecticide.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.further,epa acknowledged that there were deficiencies in the monitoring of subjects both during and after the conclusion of the study,but found that prior studies by this researcher involving higher doses had only invoked minimal responses.id.therefore,epa concluded that there was no clear and convincing evidence that the gledhill study was fundamentally unethical or significantly deficient relative to the ethical standards prevailing at the time the research was conducted.id.at quoting.
in sum,after finding the gledhill study statistically valid for a limited purpose and not in violation of epa ethical research rule,epa concluded that it could rely on the study.in fact,epa reported that it did rely on the gledhill study in assessing the risk posed by ddvp and did so for several exposure scenarios.id.at.
lastly,epa rejected nrdc argument that epa has no basis upon which to apply anything lower than a fqpa children safety factor in the ddvp risk assessment.id.at.epa stated that it has reliable data showing it is safe for infants and children to remove the additional safety factor for all risk assessments other than various residential assessment s.id.epa acknowledged that fqpa requires it to take into account potential pre and toxicity and completeness of data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants and children.id.with respect to risk assessments that did not rely on the gledhill study,epa concluded that t he toxicity database is complete t here are no residual concerns for toxicity resulting from exposure to dichlorvos,given certain rat and rabbit developmental studies,in which no developmental effects were observed and its residential and dietary exposure estimates will not underestimate exposure given epa conservative assumptions.id.
in contrast,for the residential risk assessments based on the gledhill study,epa stated that it retained a fqpa safety factor of.id.at.epa clarified that this safety factor was not based on its evaluation of any risk to infants or children.rather,t his additional safety factor is due to the various residential assessments reliance on a loael rather than a noael because the gledhill study did not find a noael.id.that is,to estimate a noael from a loael,epa determined that a safety factor would be more than adequate to identify a noael based upon the slight adverse effect marginal red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition in the gledhill human study observed at the loael in the gledhill study.id.as with the other assessments,epa declined to apply a safety factor based on a risk to infants in children.id.
epa decision not to apply a children safety factor in its risk assessments affected epa determination of the safe margins of exposure for dichlorvos as follows.epa relied on the gledhill human study for the following residential and occupational exposure scenarios short,intermediate,and dermal and short and inhalation of vapors or during application.epa,dichlorvos ired at.epa also relied on the gledhill study for residential incidental oral exposure.id.at.for each of these scenarios,epa used a safety factor to account for intraspecies variability and applied a factor for lack of a noael in the gledhill study,for a total moe of.id.at.since the gledhill study was conducted in human subjects,epa found there was no need to account for interspecies extrapolation and thus declined to apply an safety factor for risk assessments based on the gledhill study.id.at.in addition,for such risk assessments epa did not apply a safety factor based on risk to children or infants.see id.
for acute and inhalation of dichlorvos vapors in residential and occupational settings,epa did not rely on the gledhill study to calculate margins of exposure.id.at.for each of these scenarios,epa applied a safety factor.id.at.in addition,epa stated that s ince the noael is expressed in concentration units rfc methodology for the acute and exposure scenarios,the interspecies extrapolation factor is.id.at.lastly,epa stated that t he fqpa safety factor has been reduced to,since epa analysis of studies with pup and adult cholinesterase depression results did not demonstrate any substantial numerical differences in lowest observable adverse effect values all values were approximately.id.at.the resulting margin of exposure was.id.at.
finally,for dietary,acute dermal,and acute incidental oral exposure scenarios,epa applied the traditional inter and safety factors but found the children safety factor unnecessary.see id.at.because epa did not express the noael in concentration units for these exposure scenarios,epa did not reduce the safety factor to.id.at.for these exposure scenarios,the resulting moe was.id.
in sum,epa applied a margin of exposure of for all but the dietary,acute dermal,and acute incidental oral exposure scenarios.as a result,although numerous uses of dichlorvos had a low actual moe,epa found that such uses were safe,id.at calculating actual moes for exposure to resin pest strip,small closet strip,cupboard strip id.at calculating actual moes for occupational exposure in mushroom houses,greenhouses,railcars,and trucks see also.at revising pest strip exposure data,but concluding that the pest strips do not pose a risk of concern.
within days after epa issued an order denying nrdc petition,nrdc submitted its objections to epa.in addition,nrdc exercised its right under fqpa to request a public evidentiary hearing upon the objection s.see g b.
again,nrdc argued that epa could not legally rely on the gledhill human study because the study is unethical,unscientific,and statistically invalid.with respect to the study scientific validity,nrdc first argued that the study did not measure the true magnitude of adverse effects.because the gledhill study tested for cholinesterase inhibition in red blood cells hours after ingestion and just before the next dose is administered,nrdc argued that this testing regime was apparently designed to detect cholinesterase effects at the lowest ebb each day,and not to measure true adverse effects.in addition,nrdc argued that the day delay in taking the last red blood cell sample appears obviously intended to allow cholinesterase values to return closer to normal than would have been the case if the last sample had been taken promptly.further,nrdc argued that the gledhill study failure to measure plasma levels is also a serious flaw in the study,because plasma levels could be a more sensitive indicator of cholinesterase effects than red blood cell measurements.
nrdc also objected to the gledhill study use of only dosed subjects.nrdc argued that six test subjects is far too small a number to provide a sound basis for extrapolating noaels or dose response curves to the general human population.the lack of statistical power of the gledhill study,nrdc argued,is exacerbated by the fact that the toxic endpoint cholinesterase inhibition in red blood cells is quite variable,not only between humans,but also in individuals measured over time.given the large range of variability,nrdc argued that t he inadequate number of test subjects employed renders the study far too insensitive to establish either noaels or dose response curves for any cholinesterase effects.
with respect to whether the study violated epa ethical research rule,nrdc argued that epa was well aware of the numerous alleged ethical deficiencies of the gledhill study indeed,epa wrote a memorandum on the subject but that epa wrongly concluded that the study did not violate the ethical research rule.further,nrdc argued that epa did not explain why the failure to take proper steps to protect the health of the test subjects and the failure to obtain informed consent do not render the study fundamentally unethical.lastly,nrdc relie d on and incorporate d into its objections two commentaries and two letters,published in scientific journals,that specifically critiqued the scientific validity and ethics of the gledhill study.
nrdc also continued to object to epa failure to apply the fqpa children safety factor,arguing that epa lacks reliable data to reduce the default tenfold safety factor.nrdc argued that because there was evidence of potential pre and toxicity and there was incomplete data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants and children,epa was compelled to apply the full children safety factor.
nrdc provided a number of examples of allegedly incomplete data.with respect to endocrine disruption,nrdc argued that epa had not implemented an endocrine disruptor screening program,and t he studies relied on by epa were not designed to detect endocrine disruption.further,nrdc argued that a rat reproduction study relied on by epa was defectively designed because as epa acknowledged it did not include certain evaluations that epa endocrine guidelines recommended.at.in the absence of adequate data about endocrine disruption effects,nrdc argued,epa lacks reliable data to waive the fqpa safety factor,especially in light of epa mandatory duty to investigate the potential of ddvp to cause endocrine disruption.
with respect to dietary exposure,nrdc alleged various weaknesses in the data regarding infant consumption,on which epa relied in its preliminary risk assessment for dichlorvos.acknowledging that epa claims to now have more infant consumption data,nrdc argued that epa does not assert that these data represent a statistically adequate or representative sample.absent reliable data about infant consumption,nrdc argued that epa may not depart from the fqpa safety factor.
lastly,nrdc specified the disputed issues on which it would be necessary to receive factual evidence at a public evidentiary hearing.see g b.in light of its above objections,nrdc requested a hearing to determine 
whether reliable data support epa reduction of the fqpa tenfold safety factor 
whether the ddvp human study relied on by epa is ethical,scientifically valid,or statistically meaningful.
nrdc discussed the disputed issues in greater detail when it specified its objections and concluded that e ach of the disputed factual issues is sufficient either standing alone or in the aggregate to compel revocation of all ddvp tolerances.
five months later,epa denied nrdc objections regarding the gledhill study and the fqpa children safety factor.order denying nrdc objections and requests for hearing,july.epa also denied nrdc requests for a hearing.id.
in its denial order,epa rejected nrdc statistical power arguments,stating that the gledhill study showed an adverse effect and could be used to estimate a noael from the study loael.at.epa argued that the study was sufficiently robust to estimate a noael because the study extensively tested subjects before their first dose of dichlorvos used a repeated dosing and measurement approach and showed a statistically significant effect on cholinesterase inhibition that was at or near the lowest level that could be distinguished from baseline values.id.at.
further,epa conclude d that it was reasonable to use the gledhill study despite th e fact that it only examined adult males because the animal toxicology data on ddvp cholinesterase effects consistently showed no differences between males and females and adults and the young.id.at.
epa also rejected nrdc argument that reliance on the gledhill study violated epa ethical research rule,for substantially the same reasons it rejected nrdc petition.id.at concluding that the consent forms clearly advised subjects that the study involved consuming an insecticide and deficiencies in monitoring subjects did not violate the ethical research rule.
epa also rejected nrdc children safety factor objections.epa stated that f or some ddvp risk assessments epa chose to remove the children safety factor entirely,and for others epa reduced the safety factor to.at.epa explained that the factor was not based on any risk to children or infants,but accounted for epa failure to identify a noael in the gledhill study.id.epa argued that a safety factor was more than adequate because of the slight adverse effect marginal red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition in the gledhill study observed at the loael.see also id.at the effects seen in the gledhill study were only marginally adverse at best.
in addition,epa argued that even without completing the endocrine disruptor screening program,it had sufficient data bearing on endocrine effects to waive or reduce the children safety factor.id.at.although nrdc argued that further testing of ddvp might reveal endocrine effects at levels below those at which cholinesterase inhibition has been measured,epa rejected this argument as speculation.id.at.epa concluded that nrdc argument does not convince epa that there is not a reliable basis for removing the children safety factor as regards endocrine effects.id.
further,epa rejected the argument that it lacked adequate consumption data for infants and children,concluding that it had taken care to insure that its surveys of food consumption constitute a statistically valid and representative sample of infants and children.id.at.
lastly,epa denied nrdc requests for a hearing.epa stated that many of nrdc claims do not present genuine and substantial questions of fact are immaterial to the relief requested.at.moreover,epa stated that many of the issues present purely legal or policy questions or questions involving the application of legal standards to undisputed facts,which do not require a public evidentiary hearing under fqpa.id.at.epa concluded that nrdc has failed to proffer evidence on its hearing requests which would,if established,resolve one or more issues in its favor.id.at.
on july,nrdc appealed to this court.on appeal,nrdc principally challenges epa decisions to waive or reduce fqpa children safety factor when determining the safety of dichlorvos,and deny nrdc requests for an evidentiary hearing.

in addition,agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.state farm,at.although we may uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned,w e may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
pursuant to fqpa,before establishing,modifying,leaving in effect,or revoking a pesticide tolerance or exemption,epa must ensure that the pesticide is safe for infants and children that is,epa must ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide.b c ii i.
to make this determination,congress required epa to assess the risk of the pesticide based on available information about consumption patterns of infants and children,who may eat more of certain foods with the pesticide residue the special susceptibility of infants and children to the pesticide,including neurological differences and the effects of in utero exposure and the cumulative effects of infants and children exposure to the pesticide and other common substances.id.b c i.unless any amount of the pesticide would cause harm,congress required epa to apply an additional tenfold margin of safety for infants and children.id.b c ii.this tenfold margin of safety,congress stated,was designed to take into account potential pre and toxicity and completeness of the data with respect to infants and children.id.epa may use a different margin of safety only if,on the basis of reliable data,such margin will be safe for infants and children.id.
lastly,in establishing,modifying,leaving in effect,or revoking a pesticide tolerance or exemption,epa must publish a specific determination regarding the safety of the pesticide chemical residue for infants and children.id.b c ii ii.
here,nrdc argues that epa removed the tenfold children safety factor without any rational explanation for doing so,and thus its decision was arbitrary and capricious.appellant br.for dichlorvos risk assessments that relied on the gledhill study,epa stated that it used a fqpa safety factor of.at.nrdc argues that this decision is based upon generic assertions that unlawfully fail to take into account any information for infants and children.appellant br.
as an initial matter,although epa stated that it applied a fqpa safety factor of for dichlorvos risk assessments that relied on the gledhill study,epa clarified that this factor was not based on any evaluation of risk to infants or children.instead,epa stated that t his additional safety factor is due to these assessments reliance on a loael rather than a noael in the gledhill study.see also epa,dichlorvos ired at.as epa explained in a published final order incorporated into its denial of nrdc petition.at,t ypically,when a loael but not a noael has been identified by a study,epa will,when the data support it,project a noael for that study by dividing the loael by a safety factor,emphasis added.for the risk assessments that relied on the gledhill study,epa determined that was an appropriate safety factor to use to make the loael to noael conversion.at.
in epa ired and two published orders,epa consistently reiterated this position and declined to claim that the factor was based on any evaluation of risk to infants or children.see epa,dichlorvos ired at epa applied safety factor for lack of a noael.at epa applied a safety factor of to the loael to approximate the value of a noael.at t o address the uncertainty raised by the failure of the gledhill human study to identify a noael,epa chose a safety factor.because epa was required to explain why a children safety factor less than was designed to take into account potential pre and toxicity and completeness of the data with respect to infants and children,b c ii,its failure to provide such an explanation for the gledhill risk assessments was arbitrary and capricious.see state farm,at stating that an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency does not provide a reasoned basis for its action pub.citizen,mineta,cir same natural res.def.council epa,in order to ensure that an agency decision has not been arbitrary,we require the agency to have identified and explained the reasoned basis for its decision.internal quotation marks omitted.
we note that for most of the other risk assessments those that were not based on the gledhill human study epa stated that it applied a children safety factor because,inter alia,i n both rat and rabbit developmental studies,epa found no evidence for increased susceptibility of the rat and rabbit offspring to prenatal or postnatal exposure to dichlorvos.at see also.at same.however,epa did not rely on this explanation to use a lower children safety factor for the risk assessments based on the gledhill study.nor can we assume that epa meant to rely on the rat and rabbit studies for the gledhill risk assessments.when epa did rely on the animal studies for the risk assessments epa said so and properly applied a safety factor of for interspecies differences.epa,dichlorvos ired at.epa did neither for the risk assessments based on the gledhill study.absent any indication by epa t
