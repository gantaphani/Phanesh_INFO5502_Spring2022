this is a companion case to angiodynamics biolitec ag.in this appeal,defendants argue that the district court exceeded the bounds of its authority when it issued civil contempt sanctions after defendants violated the court preliminary injunction order.defendants also aver that the district court should have vacated the underlying preliminary injunction.we affirm.
facts background 
this court previously set out the basic factual contours of this case in angiodynamics,biolitec ag,cir per curiam.plaintiff angiodynamics,adi obtained a million judgment in new york against defendant biolitec,bi,a new jersey corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts,based on an indemnification clause in the supply and distribution agreement governing bi sale of medical equipment to adi.plaintiff sought to secure payment on that judgment by bringing suit in the district of massachusetts against bi president and ceo,wolfgang neuberger,and its corporate parents,biomed technology holdings biomed and biolitec ag bag collectively,defendants alleging that defendants had looted bi of over million in assets in order to render it.
we will recount only the portions of the procedural background of this case pertinent to the issues raised in this appeal.in august,adi learned that bag planned to merge with an austrian subsidiary.since american judgments are unenforceable in austria,the merger would place bag assets out of adi reach.the district court issued a temporary restraining order later converted into a preliminary injunction barring the merger.defendants unsuccessfully filed a motion to vacate the injunction in the district court,then appealed.in march,while that appeal was still pending,defendants effected the merger anyway,moving bag corporate domicile from germany to austria.this court affirmed the preliminary injunction on april,the same day as that panel heard oral argument.angiodynamics,at.
adi filed an emergency motion for contempt shortly after learning that bag had merged with its austrian affiliate.on april,the district court issued a contempt decision authorizing coercive fines against defendants and a warrant for neuberger arrest.angiodynamics,biolitec ag,d.the monthly fines escalate in amount each month that the merger remains in place.id.at.the district court contempt order made clear that it would lift the fines and arrest warrant once defendants undo the merger and restore the status quo ante.id.at.four months later,defendants filed another round of motions to revoke the contempt order and vacate the underlying injunction the district court denied the motions yet again.angiodynamics,biolitec ag,d.these appeals followed.
ii.analysis 
denial of rule b motion to vacate preliminary injunction 
we begin with defendants challenge to the district court denial of their motion to vacate the preliminary injunction pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b defendants presented two sets of declarations in support of their motion to refute the district court finding at the preliminary injunction stage that relocating bag to austria would make it more difficult or impossible for adi to enforce its judgment against the company.
rule b permits a party to move for relief from an order on grounds that it is void.we review the denial of a rule b motion de novo,as the validity of a judgment is not a discretionary question.fafel dipaola,cir.rule b,by contrast,is a provision warranting excusal from an order or judgment for any other reason that justifies relief the denial of such a request is reviewed for abuse of discretion.ungar palestine liberation,cir.
under either standard,defendants can not use their rule b motion to collaterally attack the preliminary injunction,which this court already has considered and affirmed.angiodynamics,at.a rule b motion must satisfy a special set of criteria it is not enough merely to cast doubt on the soundness of the underlying judgment.nansamba shore med,cir.the moving party must demonstrate in a timely motion that exceptional circumstances exist,favoring extraordinary relief that if the judgment is set aside,he has the right stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or defense and that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing parties should the motion be granted.id.quoting fisher kadant,cir.
defendants motion does little to even cast doubt on the underlying injunction.first,they offer two declarations from one of their experts on german law an expert who previously offered multiple declarations in opposition to adi original preliminary injunction motion to refute the district court finding that adi can not enforce its judgment in austria,but might be able to enforce it in germany.essentially,defendants assert that the downstream merger with the austrian subsidiary will have no practical impact on adi ability to collect,and thus adi will suffer no harm from defendants violation of the court preliminary injunction.the expert opined that adi would face the same burden enforcing its judgment in germany as in austria,virtually the same opinion defendants experts had offered and the district court and this court have already rejected.
second,defendants offer neuberger own declaration in support of their assertion that a german court will not recognize the district court jurisdiction over bag and thus will not enforce adi judgment because adi is unable to present affirmative evidence that bag stock certificates were located in the united states at the time adi commenced this action.in affirming the preliminary injunction,this court noted that defendants had failed to offer information concerning the location of bag stock certificates,despite their assertion that adi ability to enforce the judgment in germany would turn on whether the stock certificates were located in the united states.angiodynamics,at.defendants attempt to remedy this deficiency with neuberger statement that he personally recall s seeing bag stock certificates in germany both in and on some indeterminate date after,although he do es not recall the precise year or the circumstances.while neuberger declaration provides some new evidence that the stock certificates were located outside the united states when adi filed suit,which could preclude adi from enforcing its judgment in germany,neuberger vague memories hardly provide conclusive proof that the stock certificates were not in this country when this suit began.further,neuberger statement is undermined by evidence in the record that bi counsel kept the stock certificates showing bag ownership of bi in the company east longmeadow,massachusetts,office from before and at least until the date of his deposition in.
for all their repeated assertions,defendants submissions in support of their rule b motion fail to demonstrate that the preliminary injunction,already affirmed by this court,warrants extraordinary relief under rule b or is void under rule b.
civil contempt sanctions 
next,we turn to the district court imposition of civil contempt sanctions and its denial of defendants rule b motion for relief from the same.
a district court may issue a civil contempt order if the moving party establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged contemnor violated the order despite clear and umambiguous notice of the order and the ability to comply with it.hawkins dep t of health human servs.for,comm r,cir.defendants do not dispute the district court contempt finding,but argue that the scope and gravity of the penalties rise to the level of a criminal sanction,thus exceeding the bounds of the district court authority.mindful that the district court enjoys wide latitude in its choice of sanctions,our review is limited to abuse of discretion.goya foods,wallack mgmt,cir.under that deferential standard,we conclude that no abuse of discretion occurred here.
a district court authority to issue a contempt order derives from its inherent power to sanction litigation abuses which threaten to impugn the district court integrity or disrupt its efficient management of case proceedings.united states kouri perez,cir.since the civil contemnor may absolve herself of the sanction by complying with
