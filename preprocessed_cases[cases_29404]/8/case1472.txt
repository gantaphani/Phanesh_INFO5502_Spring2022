call center technologies,call center appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut squatrito,entered on february,that,inter alia,granted summary judgment in favor of interline travel tour,interline on the issue of successor liability,and a memorandum of decision and order dated november,that,inter alia,denied call center motion to vacate this grant of summary judgment.as set forth below,we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of interline on the mere continuation theory of successor liability under connecticut law,but we affirm in all other respects.
background 
call center is a delaware corporation with a principal place of business in brookfield,connecticut,that is in the business of selling refurbished telecommunications equipment.grand adventures tour travel publishing corporation gatt,which is now defunct,was at one point a publicly traded company with a principal place of business in austin,texas,that provided travel services and published travel magazines.on june,call center entered into an agreement with gatt the customer agreement for the sale and purchase of a telephone system called an aspect call center,with a purchase price of plus the cost of installation call center shipped the telephone system to gatt offices in texas and hired subcontractors to install the system,but asserts that apart from a deposit check from gatt ceo in the amount of,it received no payment for this equipment.
by april,gatt was experiencing financial difficulties.it retained duane boyd and lawrence fleischman as unpaid consultants to assist with addressing its financial problems the record contains a number of documents evincing that boyd and fleischman extended to gatt a series of lines of credit and loans in exchange for a security interest in gatt assets.
following the september,terrorist attacks and the resulting decline in air travel,gatt financial troubles worsened.many gatt employees were laid off,and boyd and fleischman resigned as unpaid consultants.on october,counsel for boyd and fleischman notified gatt that it was in default on the lines of credit and loans,and gave gatt until october,to pay the full amounts due,which totaled.meanwhile,on october,boyd incorporated interline by filing papers with the texas secretary of state.interline is a privately held corporation,and its initial board of directors consisted of boyd,who serves as the company president,and fleischman,who is the chairman and ceo.on october,boyd and fleischman transferred to interline all rights arising under their lines of credit and loans to gatt,and that same day,counsel for interline notified gatt creditors of interline intent to conduct a public sale to dispose of gatt collateral in order to satisfy gatt indebtedness to interline.between october and october,interline published a paid notice in an austin newspaper of a foreclosure sale planned for october,at 
on october,the foreclosure sale was held at the travis county courthouse.interline,the sole bidder at the sale,purchased gatt assets for.the same day,wells fargo bank texas,na wells fargo,which held a first lien on gatt assets,transferred its secured debt and liens to boyd.wells fargo ultimately received in exchange for its liens.
in august,call center sued gatt in connecticut state court,asserting that gatt breached the customer agreement by failing to pay the balance due for its purchase of the telephone system.a default was entered against gatt after gatt failed to appear.in march,call center moved to amend its complaint to add interline,which it alleged is the successor in interest to gatt,as a defendant.that motion was granted,and in june,following the filing of call center amended complaint,interline removed the action to the united states district court for the district of connecticut on the basis of diversity of citizenship.thereafter,call center twice amended its complaint,and in the operative third amended complaint,it asserts one count of breach of contract against gatt and one count of successor liability against interline.
in november,call center filed a motion for default judgment against gatt,and interline moved for summary judgment dismissing the successor liability claim.by memorandum of decision and order dated february,the district court granted both motions,directed the clerk to enter a default judgment against gatt,and dismissed all claims against interline.call center timely appealed.while the appeal was pending,call center moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to.b on the ground that the district court never had subject matter jurisdiction because,contrary to what was represented in the parties previous pleadings and motions,gatt was in fact a citizen of delaware,and complete diversity was therefore lacking from the outset.in a november,memorandum of decision and order the november order,the district court vacated the default judgment against gatt,dismissed gatt from the case pursuant to,remanded call center claim against gatt to state court,and reaffirmed the entry of final judgment in interline favor.
discussion 
we turn first to the november order.we see no error in the district court decision to cure the jurisdictional defect by dropping gatt from the case.federal rule of civil procedure allows a court to drop a nondiverse party at any time to preserve diversity jurisdiction,provided the nondiverse party is not indispensable under rule b.cp solutions pte,cir per curiam citation omitted.we review a district court decision as to whether a party is indispensable for abuse of discretion.id.at.it is well settled that rule authorizes courts to drop a dispensable nondiverse party at any time,even after judgment has been rendered,as long as doing so would not prejudice any of the remaining parties,id.at.call center has neither offered any persuasive argument why gatt,a defunct corporation,was an indispensable party,nor has it explained how gatt dismissal would cause it any prejudice.see,cp solutions,at see also caterpillar lewis,once a diversity case has been tried in federal court,considerations of finality,efficiency,and economy become overwhelming.for these reasons,we affirm the november order insofar as it vacated the default judgment,dismissed gatt,and remanded call center breach of contract claim.
next,we consider the district court entry of summary judgment in interline favor on the issue of successor liability.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all inferences in favor of,the.sheppard beerman,cir.summary judgment should be granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.allianz ins.lerner,cir.
when the burden of proof at trial would fall on the nonmoving party,it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a lack of evidence to go to the trier of fact on an essential element of the nonmovant claim.in that event,the nonmoving party must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial in order to avoid summary judgment.

while connecticut appellate courts have only rarely had occasion to consider questions of successor liability,certain basic principles of successor liability under connecticut law are not in dispute.in particular,courts have recognized that connecticut follows the general common law rule against successor corporate liability,and that
