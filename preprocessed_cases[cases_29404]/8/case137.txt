plaintiffs appellants rosana león claudio,luis carrasquillo rivera carrasquillo,and the conjugal partnership carrasquillo claudio collectively,appellants appeal the dismissal of claudio title vii pregnancy and sex discrimination claim and appellants supplemental state law claims due to a forum selection clause contained in the employment contracts between claudio and the university of the east of the ana méndez university system suagm by its spanish acronym which precludes adjudication in federal court.on appeal,appellants argue that the forum selection clause was not triggered because suagm failed to participate in mandatory constructive negotiations conducted in good faith between the parties waived enforcement of the forum selection clause due to their delay in raising the issue before the district court and even if the district court was correct in enforcing the forum selection clause,the dismissal should have been without prejudice.though we disagree with appellants and find the forum selection clause applicable and enforceable,we agree that the district court should have dismissed the case without prejudice.we therefore affirm the district court but modify the judgment to expressly permit in the appropriate forum.
background 
on february,claudio was hired by the suagm school of continuing education.the employment contract,which was for a fixed term,was extended on four separate occasions,each for approximately six months.the final two extensions covering august through december,and january through july,respectively contained the following provision 
thirteenth any dispute which arises between the parties and which can not be resolved or surmounted by constructive negotiations conducted in good faith between the parties shall be submitted to the jurisdiction and competence of the court of first instance of the commonwealth of puerto rico,san juan part,for adjudication and resolution.
according to claudio,beginning in august she experienced a series of continuous actions that reveal a hostile environment of moral harassment in the employment and of marriage and pregnancy discrimination by ayala,her supervisor.this all stemmed,claudio claims,from her relationship with,marriage to,and impregnation by carrasquillo,the school marketing officer.concerned with this hostile environment,claudio met with several suagm administrators ayala on december,príncipe,the associate dean of the continuing education school,on january,maría socorro díaz de burgos díaz de burgos,the executive assistant to the chancellor,on january,and mildred rivera cordero rivera,the system vice president of the continuing education school and the professional studies school,around april in all of these meetings,claudio was told to limit herself to her duties and to always greet ayala to teach her how professionals worked and to not assume the same attitude.on june,príncipe informed claudio that her contract would not be renewed because ayala did not want her there and because of claudio low productivity.
the next day,june,claudio filed a complaint before the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging pregnancy and sex discrimination.on july,appellants filed suit in the court of first instance of the commonwealth of puerto rico,ponce part.on october,the eeoc issued claudio a notice of right to sue.appellants subsequently filed the instant action against suagm and numerous individuals in the district court on january,alleging marriage discrimination,pregnancy and gender discrimination,and retaliation under title vii,and various state law claims.
on april,appellees filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that title vii does not provide for individual liability and that appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.on november,the district court agreed in part,dismissing all claims except claudio title vii pregnancy and sex discrimination claim against suagm and appellants supplemental state law claims against all appellees.approximately two weeks later,on december,appellees filed a second motion to d ismiss the verified complaint without prejudice,seeking,for the first time,to enforce the forum selection clause in the employment contracts.the district court granted this motion on may,but was silent as to whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.
the district court denied appellants motion for reconsideration on december,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in this circuit,we treat a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause as a motion alleging the failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b.rivera centro médico de turabo,cir see also,silva encyclopedia brittanica,cir.we thus review the district court decision de novo.rivera,at.in conducting this review,we,like the district court,may consider documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties,documents central to plaintiffs claim,and documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint.id.quoting alt.energy,paul fire marine ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also beddall state bank trust,cir when a complaint factual allegations are expressly linked to and admittedly dependent upon a document the authenticity of which is not challenged,that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b.the employment contracts containing the forum selection clause at issue fall under each of these categories.
a.the forum selection clause is applicable and enforceable 
under federal law,the threshold question in interpreting a forum selection clause is whether the clause at issue is permissive or mandatory.rivera,at.permissive forum selection clauses authorize jurisdiction and venue in a designated forum,but do not prohibit litigation elsewhere in contrast,mandatory forum selection clauses contain clear language indicating that jurisdiction and venue are appropriate exclusively in the designated forum.id.second alteration in original quoting charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed internal quotation marks omitted.
here,there is no doubt that the forum selection clause contained within the employment contracts is mandatory.the clause states that disputes shall be submitted to the jurisdiction and competence of the court of first instance of the commonwealth of puerto rico,san juan part,and it is axiomatic that the word shall has a mandatory connotation.see,jama immigration customs enforcement,d contrasting the discretionary word may with the mandatory word shall rivera,at including shall in a list of typical mandatory terms black law dictionary ed defining shall to mean h as a duty to more broadly,is required to and explaining that it is used to express the mandatory sense that drafters typically intend.
the next step in evaluating the applicability of a forum selection clause is ascertaining its scope.rafael rodríguez barril,conbraco,cir.this is a analysis,so it is the language of the forum selection clause itself that determines which claims fall within its scope.rivera,at.the clause at issue here covers a ny dispute which arises between the parties and which can not be resolved or surmounted by constructive negotiations conducted in good faith between the parties.notwithstanding appellants acknowledgment of the broad reach of the term any dispute,they argue that the phrase which can not be resolved or surmounted by constructive negotiations conducted in good faith limits the reach of the clause by creating a condition precedent.according to appellants,because the parties never engaged in constructive negotiations in good faith prior to appellants filing suit,the mandatory forum selection clause was never triggered,and thus appellants were free to file wherever they wanted.
we reject this reading because such an interpretation leads to absurd results.in normal cases,plaintiffs initiate lawsuits and thus ordinarily have their choice of venue.see atl.marine.at because plaintiffs are ordinarily allowed to select whatever forum they consider most advantageous consistent with jurisdictional and venue limitations,we have termed their selection the plaintiff venue privilege.quoting van dusen barrack,d.the purpose of a forum selection clause,therefore,is,at least in part,to protect defendants and give them a voice as to where a dispute will be heard and resolved.see,huffington,llc,cir pappas gallo winery.if appellants interpretation were accepted,the forum selection clause would effectively be rendered meaningless if a plaintiff wanted to litigate his or her claim in the forum agreed to,he or she could file the lawsuit there in the first instance if he or she did not want to be in that forum,he or she could file the lawsuit somewhere else as soon as a dispute arose,without giving the defendant a chance to constructive ly negotiat e in good faith,and then argue,as appellants do here,that the clause was never triggered due to the failure to conduct negotiations such an outcome would defeat the entire purpose of including a forum selection clause to begin with,and thus can not have been the intent of the parties when they entered the contract.we see no reason to deviate from the accepted practice of avoiding interpretations that either give a clause no effect or go against the intent of the parties.see laws ann.tit,if any stipulation of a contract should admit of different meanings,it should be understood in the sense most suitable to give it effect.irizarry garcía,p.offic.trans,wl,w hen construing a contract,one must presuppose fairness,correction and good faith in its wording and construe it in such a manner that leads to results consonant with the contractual relationship as required by ethical standards.in other words,one can not seek to obfuscate or distort the interpretation of contracts to reach absurd or unfair results.restatement second of contracts a in the interpretation of a promise or agreement or a term thereof,the following standards of preference are generally applicable a an interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect.
moreover,even if we did accept appellants interpretation,they would still be subject to the forum selection clause.first,it is not clear to us that the condition precedent was not met.appellants complaint states that claudio met with ayala,príncipe,díaz de burgos,and rivera between december,and april to discuss her alleged hostile environment.in each case,claudio was allegedly given advice as to how to handle the situation and improve it.nothing in the complaint suggests that these conversations between the parties could not be considered constructive and good faith negotiations to alleviate claudio concerns.that the meetings did not fix the problem and claudio was eventually terminated is irrelevant.the burden is on appellants to establish that a forum selection clause should not be enforced in this case by showing that constructive negotiations in good faith never occurred and they have not done so.see bremen zapata off shore,d explaining that the party arguing that a forum selection clause is inapplicable bear s a heavy burden of proof in re mercurio,cir recognizing the heavy burden of proof to overcome a forum selection clause on inconvenience grounds quoting carnival cruise lines,shute,d.
and,even if they were not negotiations as envisioned by the contract,appellants make no claim that they attempted to constructively negotiate but that appellees refused to participate or did so in bad faith.by failing to do so,instead opting to bypass the condition precedent and immediately file a claim first with the eeoc,then with the commonwealth court,and finally before the district court appellants would be estopped from relying on appellees failure to comply with the same requirement to justify litigation outside of the forum.
having established that the forum selection clause is mandatory and its scope covers appellants claims,the final step in evaluating the clause involves asking whether there is some reason the presumption of enforceability should not apply.rafael rodríguez barril,at.a forum selection clause is prima facie valid and,absent a strong showing by the resisting party that the clause is unreasonable under the circumstances,it should not be set aside.bremen,at.there are four grounds for finding such a clause unreasonable,and thus unenforceable 
the clause was the product of fraud or overreaching 
enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust 
proceedings in the contractual forum will be so gravely difficult and inconvenient that the party challenging the clause will for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court or 
enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought,whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.
rafael rodríguez barril,at alteration in original quoting bremen,at,internal citations omitted.appellants make no argument that the clause was obtained through fraud or overreaching,that enforcement will deprive appellants of their day in court,or that any public policy counters against enforcement of the clause.
appellants waiver argument,however,implicates the second category.appellants contend that by waiting eleven months after filing suit a if one counts the dismissed lawsuit in the ponce court to invoke the forum selection clause,appellees consented to adjudicating the dispute before the district court and any argument to the contrary was waived.they argue that because discovery was well under way,significant resources had already been expended,and substantive and dispositive motions were filed,appellees essentially test ed the waters of federal court before invoking their rights under the forum selection clause.it would be completely unreasonable and unjust,appellants assert,to grant the rule b motion and require them to start over in state court.
this contention is easily dispensed with.a motion to dismiss based on a clause may be raised at any time in the proceedings before disposition on the merits.silva,at.claudio pregnancy and sex discrimination claim and appellants supplemental claims under puerto rico law were never disposed of on the merits.thus,the rule b motion was properly made and no waiver occurred.while we acknowledge that waiting so long to enforce the clause does,at first blush,appear unfair to appellants,there is nothing in the record to suggest that any potential unfairness rises to the level of being unjust or unreasonable.indeed,if appellants wanted to avoid any seeming unfairness,they should have filed their suit in the proper forum to begin with.
finding no reason to overcome the presumption of enforceability,we agree with the district court that the forum selection clause requiring appellants to bring their claims before the court of first instance of the commonwealth of puerto rico,san juan part is valid and applicable.appellees rule b motion was,therefore,properly granted.
dismissal should have been without prejudice 
when the district court granted appellees motion to dismiss,it was silent on the issue of prejudice.generally,we presume that such a dismissal was with prejudice.see united states ex rel.karvelas melrose wakefield,cir i n the absence of a clear statement to the contrary,a dismissal pursuant to.b is presumed to be with prejudice,abrogated on other grounds by united states ex rel.gagne city of worcester,cir.still,it is our practice for dismissals due to forum selection clauses to be dismissed without prejudice so the case may be in the appropriate forum.see,huffington,at,affirming the district court dismissal of plaintiff claims without prejudice.b,concluding that the forum selection clause encompassed his claims rafael rodríguez barril,at,affirming the district court dismissal without prejudice under rule b due to a valid forum selection clause odishelidze aetna life cas,cir the district court also ordered the complaint dismissed for failure to plead a cognizable claim under federal jurisdiction and noted that the dismissal was without prejudice of plaintiff filing another action in the proper local forum.
