this suit arises out of a dispute over a cable franchise for the town of houlton,maine town.in early,the town decided not to renew the franchise held by nepsk,houlton cable houlton cable.instead,it sought competitive proposals for a new cable franchise,and eventually awarded the franchise to houlton cable competitor,pine tree cablevision associates pine tree.houlton cable then commenced this suit against the town,alleging multiple violations of the cable communications policy act of,as amended by the cable television consumer protection and competition act of and the telecommunications act of codified in pertinent part at the act.the district court granted the town motion for judgment on the pleadings as to two counts of the complaint,based on houlton cable failure to respond to the motion as required by district of maine local rule b.several months later,the court entered summary judgment for the town on the remaining count of the complaint.houlton cable challenges both decisions.we affirm.
on april,the town entered into a cable franchise agreement with houlton cable predecessor,houlton catv,the franchise ran for a period of years,and was set to expire in april of.under federal law,a g,houlton cable was entitled to initiate formal renewal procedures by submitting a written request to the town between april and october.if neither houlton cable nor the town took action within that window,the renewal process would be governed by the informal procedures set out in h.
houlton cable submitted a renewal proposal in november,well after the expiration of the period for initiation of formal procedures.for several months,the town took no action on the proposal.then,in april of,the town council voted to invite new applications for the houlton cable franchise.consistent with the informal renewal procedures prescribed by h,the town scheduled a public hearing to address the cable franchise issue.following that hearing,in february of,the town council decided not to renew houlton cable franchise and to solicit bids from other providers.minutes from the public hearing and the town council subsequent meeting indicate that houlton cable refusal to provide internet access to its subscribers was a major factor in the town decision to reject the renewal proposal.
on march,the town issued a request for proposals rfp soliciting proposals for a new,cable franchise.as the rfp made clear,the town did not believe it could support more than one franchise.although it had not undertaken any detailed analysis of the issue,the town was aware that no municipality in those much larger than served by more than one cable company.accordingly,the town explained in the rfp that it planned to award only one franchise 
the town of houlton recognizes that it can not award an exclusive cable television franchise to any applicant.nevertheless,the town also recognizes that the town of houlton can only feasibly support one cable television franchise at one time.accordingly,the town intends to award only one cable television franchise during the next ten year period,which will be the franchise as a result of this rfp process.
the town received proposals from two parties,houlton cable and pine tree.after considering both proposals,the town determined that pine tree most closely met the needs of the town as determined by public surveys and the earlier public hearing.at a meeting in may,the town council voted to reject houlton cable proposal,and to pursue negotiations with pine tree.
houlton cable then initiated this suit against the town.count i of its complaint alleged that the town violated the act by failing to comply with the formal renewal procedures set forth in a g.count ii alleged that the town had conditioned the renewal of houlton cable franchise on houlton cable willingness to provide high speed internet service to its subscribers.such a demand,houlton cable maintained,violated b d,which prohibits franchising authorities from requiring cable operators to provide certain telecommunication service s as a condition of a franchise award,and e,which states that n o state or franchising authority may prohibit,condition,or restrict a cable system use of any type of transmission technology.finally,count iii alleged that the town unreasonably refused to award houlton cable a second franchise,in violation of a.
after answering the complaint,the town moved under.c for judgment on the pleadings as to counts i and ii.with respect to count i,the town argued that,since neither houlton cable nor the town had initiated formal renewal procedures during the window,the renewal process properly was governed by the informal procedures authorized by h.in response to count ii,the town contended that the act did not apply retroactively to invalidate the terms of the franchise agreement,which provided that the decision as to renewal was committed to the town discretion,and would be based in part on the development of cable services.in the alternative,the town argued that internet access is neither a telecommunication service nor a transmission technology,and therefore is not governed by b d a and e of the act.
pursuant to local rule b of the district of maine,houlton cable was obligated to respond to the town motion within ten days houlton cable did not so respond,and,accordingly,was deemed to have consented to the motion.thus,on december,day after the period had district court entered judgment for the town on counts i and ii per local rule b.
houlton cable filed a motion under.e,asking the court to reconsider and vacate its december judgment.it argued that the district court could not enter judgment on the pleadings without first satisfying itself that the town was in fact entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the court granted the motion for reconsideration,but reaffirmed its initial judgment.rule c,the court noted,does not prescribe any particular standard of decision therefore,it does not prohibit the entry of judgment on the basis of noncompliance with a local waiver rule,without consideration of the merits of the motion.given the absence of a direct conflict between federal rule c and local rule b,the court concluded that it was entitled to enforce its local rule strictly.
the town then moved for summary judgment on count iii of houlton cable complaint,arguing that the provisions of a governing applications for a second,competitive franchise did not apply to the town choice to award an initial franchise to one provider rather than another.the court agreed,and entered judgment for the town on count iii.houlton cable filed a timely notice of appeal,challenging the district court december grant of judgment on the pleadings as to counts i and ii,its refusal to rescind that judgment under rule e,and its grant of summary judgment on count iii.
we turn,first,to the district court decisions with respect to counts i and ii.in granting the town motion for judgment on the pleadings,the court relied on district of maine local rule b,which then provided 
unless within ten days after the filing of a motion the opposing party files written objection thereto,incorporating a memorandum of law,the opposing party shall be deemed to have waived objection.
houlton cable conceded that it did not comply with that rule,and that its failure to file a timely response did not constitute excusable neglect,permitting reconsideration under.b.thus,houlton cable sought relief under.e on the ground that the district court judgment was based on an error of law.see hernandez,cir explaining that rule e is the proper vehicle for a party seeking to overturn a judgment on the basis of alleged legal errors.maintaining that rule c requires a decision on the merits,it argued that the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted the town motion for judgment on the pleadings solely on the basis of a local deemed waiver rule like rule b.
houlton cable renews that argument on appeal.we review the district court initial application of its local rule for abuse of discretion.cmm cable rep,ocean coast,cir.we apply the same standard to the district court denial of a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment.see williams poulos,cir.however,the court interpretation of rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure presents a legal question,which we review de novo.see sec.exch.comm sargent,cir.
local rule b and its predecessor,district of maine local rule c,have been in existence for almost years courts in the district of maine routinely apply such rules in situations where the opposing party fails to file an objection to a motion,regardless of whether the motion is dispositive.see,cardente fleet bank.rule b motion to dismiss united transp.union me.cent,motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue gideon adm r,united states small bus,motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction see also desjardins van buren cmty,cir affirming,against first amendment challenge,district court order requiring defendant to make a public apology,on ground that district court properly relied on local rule c to find that defendant waived objection to plaintiff motion to compel apology.other districts throughout the country have adopted similar rules to ensure the orderly,efficient,and expeditious management of the extensive motion practice of the district courts.mcdermott lehman.
we have recognized that d istrict courts enjoy broad latitude in adopting and administering such local rules.air line pilots ass precision valley aviation,cir see also,ramsdell bowles,cir acknowledging the district court great leeway in the application and enforcement of its local rules.in exercising that discretion,district courts may,where appropriate,demand adherence to specific mandates contained in the rules.air line pilots ass n,at.for example,in corey mast road grain.materials,cir per curiam,the defendants moved for dismissal under.b for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court granted the motion on the basis of the plaintiff failure to file a timely response,as required by local rule of the district of massachusetts.it later denied the plaintiff rule b motion for relief from the judgment.we affirmed,stating that t he district court was entitled to insist upon compliance with its local rule in these circumstances.id.at citing in re harbour house operating,cir strictly applying rule b of the first circuit rules governing bankruptcy appeals.given plaintiff failure to establish that her tardiness was caused by excusable neglect,we concluded that the court could properly decline to excuse plaintiff noncompliance with the local rule.accord stanciel gramley,cir affirming district court grant of motion to dismiss on the basis of noncompliance with local rule requiring response within days tobel city of hammond,cir plaintiffs lawyers admit that they were not aware of the local rule.this is the end of the matter because the district court clearly has authority to enforce strictly its local rules,even if a default results.ghazali moran,cir failure to follow a district court local rules is a proper ground for dismissal.
we reached a similar result in united states proceeds of sale of pounds of atlantic sea scallops,cir.there,the government had filed a forfeiture action in rhode island district court,hoping to obtain title to the value of certain sea scallops it had seized.roughly one month later,the defendant filed a combined answer and claim,which the government moved to strike as untimely.the district court granted the motion to strike,based on the defendant failure to respond within ten days as required by local rule a.the government then moved for a default judgment on the ground that the defendant claim and answer had been stricken.the district court granted that motion as well,reaffirming its decision on the defendant rule b motion for reconsideration.
again,we affirmed.as in corey,we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant favorable reconsideration under rule b in the absence of a showing of excusable neglect.see id.at finding that defendant alleged reliance on erroneous advice from local counsel did not excuse untimely filings.we continued we also agree with the district court that a default judgment may stand even where there has been no showing of substantial prejudice to the party benefitting from the default.a district court simply may insist upon compliance with its local rules.id.
as our holdings in corey and sea scallops make clear,it is within the district court discretion to dismiss an action based on a party unexcused failure to respond to a dispositive motion when such response is required by local rule,at least when the result does not clearly offend equity see pinto universidad de puerto rico,cir we do not agree with defendant that a court may,without notice,take a failure to respond to a motion to dismiss as a default,warranting dismissal irrespective of substantive merit to be distinguished is where a court had ordered a memorandum,and,of course,cases where a response was required by rule.citing sea scallops and corey.it is equally clear,however,that a district court can not enforce its local rules in a way that conflicts with the federal rules of civil procedure.see.a jaroma massey,cir local district court rules can not be construed in such a way as to render them inconsistent with applicable provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure.
as houlton cable points out,we have identified such a conflict in the context of motions for summary judgment filed under.rule e specifies that,if such a motion is unopposed,the district court may grant summary judgment if appropriate.under this provision it is clear that w here the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue,summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.jaroma,at quoting stepanischen merchants despatch transp,cir.thus,a district court may not automatically grant a motion for summary judgment simply because the opposing party failed to comply with a local rule requiring a response within a certain number of days.rather,the court must determine whether summary judgment is appropriate,which means that it must assure itself that the moving party submission shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also advisory committee note to rule where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue,summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.
given the potential tension between rule e and local rules such as the district of maine rule b,we have recognized the need to interpret local waiver rules so as to preserve their scope and validity without running afoul of the requirements of rule.jaroma,at.to that end,in the summary judgment context we read the deemed waiver provision of the local rules to extend only to waiver of objection to the moving party factual assertions.by failing to file the required response within the time prescribed by the applicable local rule,the party 
waives the right to controvert the facts asserted by the moving party in the motion for summary judgment and the supporting materials accompanying it.the court will accept as true all material facts set forth by the moving party with appropriate record support.if those facts entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law,summary judgment will be granted.

houlton cable argues that the district court obligation to address the merits of a motion for summary judgment should extend as well to rule c motions for judgment on the pleadings.it emphasizes that a party seeking judgment on the pleadings under rule c will make precisely the same arguments as a party seeking summary judgment under rule namely,that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure,at ed lefebvre comm r,cir per curiam describing standard for rule c.the only difference is that a rule c motion must be filed at the close of pleadings,and must be based solely on the factual allegations
