in october of massachusetts mutual insurance company,seeking to improve its financial stability,attempted to reduce its work force by offering a voluntary termination program vtp.the program,open to all employees,offered a generous severance package.some who took the program did so by retiring.although the program did not offer enhanced retirement benefits,it did,of course,through the larger severance package,increase the benefits of retiring by offering the vtp benefits in addition to regular retirement benefits.
as is inevitable in such a situation,there were those who had retired in the months before the vtp was announced,and felt they should have received the severance package available under the vtp.this suit involves three of those employees stanley rodowicz,margaret stevens,and james lemon.initially,the suit involved nine retiring employees,but a prior opinion of this court winnowed the viable claims down to these three.rodowicz.mut.life ins.rodowicz i,modified,reh g denied,cir 
this court prior opinion reversed the entry of summary judgment against these three employees and held their massachusetts state law misrepresentation claims actionable on the summary judgment record.id.at.it characterized massachusetts law as being more generous to employees under a plan than the parallel federal law would be if the severance program was an erisa plan which the vtp was not id.at.erisa would require a plan to be under serious consideration by senior management in order to have an actionable claim for breach of the fiduciary duty to disclose that a change in benefits might be forthcoming,vartanian monsanto,cir.in contrast,massachusetts law requires only a false statement of material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act,together with reasonable reliance on the false statement to the plaintiff detriment in order to show an actionable misrepresentation.rodowicz i,at citing zimmerman kent.
rodowicz i also stated that it did not mean to suggest that plaintiffs will or should necessarily prevail.id.at.the summary judgment record,as understood by the rodowicz i court,permitted the jury,but did not require it,to reach the conclusion at trial that the alleged misrepresentations were made at a time when several proposals urging such changes in benefits were on the table but,as yet,senior management with the authority to implement a change ha d not yet chosen a specific plan for implementation in such a case,the existence of the proposals and the attendant discussion might reasonably be expected to influence a decision with respect to retirement.id.at.if so,the statements would be material,and plaintiffs could rest a misrepresentation claim on them,assuming the other elements of misrepresentation were met.id.
at trial after remand,a jury found for the plaintiffs and awarded a total of.both parties appeal.the plaintiffs challenge the trial court ruling that they could not receive emotional distress damages for a misrepresentation claim.the company says that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there was no plan under consideration at the time of the purported misrepresentations,that there was instructional error,that certain evidence was erroneously admitted,that plaintiffs surprised and prejudiced the company by changing their testimony on when the supposed misrepresentations were made,and that the three plaintiffs claims should have been severed.
we reach only massmutual arguments that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,that there was instructional error,and that it was prejudiced by surprise testimony.we vacate the judgment,and we direct entry of judgment for massmutual.
for purposes of the sufficiency of the evidence challenge,we present the facts most favorably to the verdict for plaintiffs.for purpose of the evidentiary challenges,we also describe the facts as the defendant alleged them.
in the early,the insurance industry was in some turmoil.several of massmutual competitors were forced to close their doors.massmutual itself was downgraded by two ratings agencies,in july and again in the fall of.on three separate occasions between and april of,massmutual human resources division looked at potential ways to downsize staff,either through reducing hiring or by implementing some sort of retirement benefits enhancement package.these studies were all closed down without any such plan being implemented or even referred to the board of directors for consideration.the evidence concerning these plans is discussed in more depth below,in the section dealing with massmutual sufficiency of the evidence claim.
the plaintiffs,for their part,were all considering retirement in late spring and early summer of.plaintiff rodowicz,who had been an associate director in the investment department,submitted a notice of retirement on july.he retired on october with over sixty unused vacation days,for which he was compensated in the form of a lump sum payment.rodowicz based his claim of misrepresentation on a conversation that occurred,according to his testimony,in late august or early september,after his notice of retirement was given he testified that he asked laura cowles,a human resources employee,if there was any truth to the rumor that there was a package coming.he testified that she said no,that the board of directors had met and considered a retirement package and decided that they decided that there would be no enhancement or improvement in any retirement package.cowles testified that,although she did not remember the specifics of the conversation,she did not recall making that statement and she did not believe she had said anything about the board,nor would she have,because she would not know what the board had or had not approved.
plaintiff lemon,who had been a senior systems analyst,submitted his notice of retirement on may.he retired on october,the same date as rodowicz,although lemon took his accrued vacation prior to retirement and therefore his last day worked was july.lemon claim is based on a statement which he testified was made at a massmutual retirement seminar that occurred in march,april,or perhaps may he testified that someone else at the seminar asked is there going to be any change in benefits he further testified t he answer was wilson a human resources employee said there will be no change in benefits.he did say there might be some change in the group life medical,you know,benefits,but there would be no change in benefits i understood that to be when i terminated,there would be no additional when i retired.wilson had no memory of lemon or the question,but testified,that not something i would say i probably would know if there was something coming until it happened pretty much i say,i do know.
plaintiff stevens,also a senior systems analyst at massmutual,submitted her notice of retirement on may.she retired on september,a month before rodowicz and lemon,but her last day worked was july.stevens testified that she had repeated meetings with retirement counselor lois degray in and,and that degray had avoided answering questions about any future changes to benefits.at her husband urging,stevens had finally asked degray very specifically was there any reason for her to stay on over,you know,any particular date that would be a benefit to her,was there any package maybe coming along.and degray told her no.stevens did not remember the exact date of the conversation,but testified that it was before she sent a letter to her manager on may,as the conversation was sort of the deciding factor.degray did not recall stevens ever asking her whether there would be any enhanced benefits or severance,and denied ever telling her there would be no changes.
on september,well after the alleged misrepresentations claimed by the plaintiffs,tom wheeler,the ceo of massmutual,instructed john pajak,the executive vice president for operations and chief operating officer of massmutual,to dust off the reduction in force project and evaluate options for a possible plan.there is no evidence that any work was done on any form of an enhanced benefits plan retirement or severance from the time the numbers were looked at,and the idea abandoned,in late march or early april until this request by wheeler on september.nor is there any evidence that any ideas concerning such benefits were discussed by management during that period.after the september wheeler request,susan alfano,the vice president for human resources,assembled a team and worked virtually around the clock to prepare something.an employee who worked on both the march analysis and the september project testified that the two plans were significantly different,particularly because the march analysis focused exclusively on employees aged fifty or older.pajak presented initial results to wheeler on september.wheeler then presented the idea to a management group known as the president cabinet on september and october.a proposal was then put before the board of directors at the october board meeting,and wheeler was given the authority to implement the plan at his discretion.wheeler authorized the plan on october and it was announced to the company on october.
the company appeals from the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,arguing,among other things,that the evidence does not support the verdict and that the trial judge erred in its jury instructions.the standard of review for a district court denial of a rule motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is de novo.walton nalco chem,cir.our review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict w e must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.id.at quoting negron caleb brett,cir quoting coastal fuels of,caribbean petroleum,cir.t he giving of a jury instruction is reversible error only if it was misleading,unduly complicating,or incorrect as a matter of law,and adversely affected the objecting party substantial rights.faigin kelly,cir.
plaintiffs pled in the alternative that the misrepresentations were either negligent or intentional.because the degree of culpability a plaintiff must show to establish liability for negligent misrepresentation is less than for intentional misrepresentation,we use the elements for negligent misrepresentation.cummings hpg int l,cir.under massachusetts law,
to sustain a claim of misrepresentation,a plaintiff must show a false statement of a material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act,together with reliance on the false statement by the plaintiff to the plaintiff detriment the speaker need not know that the statement is false if the truth is reasonably susceptible of actual knowledge,or otherwise expressed,if,through a modicum of diligence,accurate facts are available to the speaker.
zimmerman kent,quoting acushnet fed.credit union roderick,as we have noted previously,in general,massachusetts courts treat negligent misrepresentation claims more as negligence actions than deceit actions,focusing on the degree of care exercised by the speaker in making the statement.cummings,at.
sufficiency of evidence 
the company says it was entitled to judgment because the plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence to show that,at the time the alleged disclosures were made,the vtp severance plan was on the table,or that any proposals were in existence,or that there were any attendant discussions by the employee senior management about either the vtp or any other plan.
the company argues that the human resources personnel said to have made the statements could not have discovered,or disclosed,any facts about the severance option which later would become the vtp in october of,because the evidence was uncontroverted that the discussions which led to the vtp severance option did not begin until september,and that the vtp was not recommended to senior management until september,after the communications with each of the three employees.
using the terminology of rodowicz i,at,the company at times characterizes this argument as one going to the materiality of the statements.however,in light of the evidence at trial,we think it is better thought of as going to another element of the misrepresentation the statements were in fact false at the time they were made.under rodowicz i,we assume the speakers are the company,speaking through its authorized human resources representatives.id.at 
at trial,plaintiff stevens testified that degray made the statement at issue here in,before stevens submitted her retirement notice.plaintiff lemon testified that wilson made his statement sometime between march and may,before lemon submitted his retirement notice on may.rodowicz testified that cowles made her statement about the board of directors in late august or early september,after he had submitted his july,retirement notice to the company.
the evidence as to the company discussions of alterations in its benefits plans was as follows.in,massmutual human resources division had worked up a possible erisa early retirement plan which was targeted at senior employees and would have provided enhanced pension and retirement benefits.this plan was referred to as the voluntary incentive program or vip plan.the vip proposal was abandoned without ever being implemented or even referred to the board of directors for consideration.john pajak,the executive vice president for operations and chief operating officer,testified that the vip proposal was aborted in midstream,although the documents were kept for future use.
in april,massmutual did alter the retirement benefits to decrease the age at which one could retire with full retirement benefits from to.this was done as the result of an annual internal competitiveness survey,in order to keep current with the benefits offered by massmutual competitors.the board of directors voted on this change and approved it at the board april meeting.this was the only potential change to the retirement system or severance benefits considered by the board until it ultimately approved the vtp in the fall of.
in the summer of,as troubles mounted in the new england insurance industry and a rating downgrade seemed imminent,pajak asked alfano,then vice president for human resources,to look into possibilities for a reduction in force.alfano compiled a memo for pajak listing three involving enhanced retirement benefits which,like the vip proposal,would have fallen under erisa,and two involving reduced hiring through eliminating all open exempt positions or selected exempt positions.later in,on her own initiative,alfano retained outside consultants to look into the mechanics of doing an involuntary layoff.this study took place over a few months time,ending sometime in the fall of.no such layoffs were ever done,and pajak had no memory of even being told about this consultancy.alfano testified that the purpose of it was merely to educate the human resources management about the options,b ecause there was always the possibility the company would have to resort to layoffs.
in march of,pajak asked alfano to crunch the numbers again on possibilities for an early or enhanced retirement benefits package.alfano testified that the focus of this project,like the vip project,was exclusively on people retirement eligible.the options being considered included an enhancement to age,an enhancement to years of service,a severance component for workers.the effort was apparently an attempt to evaluate the feasibility of what would have been an plan.the options being worked up were not single payment general severance plans,as the vtp eventually would be.this project was terminated in march or early april because alfano concluded that it would cause excessive attrition in experienced and necessary positions.consequently,the results were never presented to the board or even compiled into a written report.thus,as of early april,the company had considered but rejected ideas of offering enhanced retirement benefits.
on the evidence at trial,at the time of rodowicz question about whether there was any truth to the rumor that a package was coming,the answer no was an accurate reflection of the company position at that time.in discussing retirement with her retirement counselor,stevens asked whether there was any package coming along.at that time,the company had no intent to offer any package.therefore,this case is factually distinguishable from cases in which a company is in the process of considering a plan and either violates a duty to disclose or misrepresents the state of things.because no benefits plans were being considered or discussed at the time the questions were posed,the statements were literally true when made.thus,the plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to meet a basic element of negligent misrepresentation,that there be false information for the guidance of others.cummings,at 
the statement that lemon heard at the retirement seminar is a bit more problematic,due to the muddled time frame offered by lemon for the statement.he testified that he attended the seminar in march,april,or perhaps may.this was a change from his deposition testimony,when he testified that the seminar took place in the summer of.if the testimony as to march were credited,there is some chance that he heard the statement that there would be no package at the same time that alfano and her team were analyzing the viability of a package in march of.however,we are doubtful that this is sufficient evidence of the ambiguity of his testimony failed to carry his burden,because massmutual duty to disclose consideration of an plan was limited by the vartanian serious consideration test,and because any march statement would not be false because the march analysis never developed into a plan.if the issue turned on his ambiguous testimony that the statement was made in march,then that testimony,coming by surprise,should not have been admitted as evidence and its admission was reversible error lemon offered no substantial justification for his change of testimony in this case.the trial judge requested that the parties verify the accuracy of their discovery evidence prior to trial,and lemon should have realized the problem,at the latest,when his coplaintiff stevens changed her testimony,two days prior to his testifying.massmutual had no opportunity to investigate or introduce evidence concerning which retirement seminar lemon attended and it made a timely objection to the introduction of this evidence at trial.
plaintiffs are not assisted by characterizing the statements as oriented to the future and proven untrue by future events.in order for a representation about a future occurrence to be actionable negligent misrepresentation,there must be evidence that the statement was false at the time made,and that the defendant could have learned of the falsity with reasonable care.a simple change of mind by a defendant does not render an earlier statement false.mcevoy travel bureau,norton.without evidence of the contrary intent,the statement is not considered false at the time it is made.id.
plaintiffs argue that the jury could have inferred that defendants had a contrary intent,rendering the statements false when made.however,under massachusetts law,a jury can not infer contrary intent at the time of the representation from the mere fact that the company took contrary action at a later date.zhang.inst.of,see also carroll barberry homes,wl,at,order on motion for summary judgment fact that defendant followed a different course months later does not support a finding of earlier intent to misrepresent connolly rochester shoe tree,wl,where change of circumstance led defendant to abandon alleged promise,no basis to infer intent to misrepresent.in order to show that the representations about whether massmutual would offer a package were false,the plaintiffs needed to offer evidence that,at the time of the representations,massmutual had some present intention to offer such a package in the future.using the massachusetts law standard for determining the falsity of an assertion concerning a future event,we hold that none of the statements that there would be no package was false at the time it was made.
the record contains no evidence that in the period from march or early april until there were any proposals urging such changes in benefits on the table,to use the language of rodowicz at.the vtp was not even a glimmer in management eye until september,when the ceo ordered pajak to develop a proposal for a reduction in force.indeed,pajak,the chief operating officer,testified that there was nothing on my agenda that indicated in june of that there was going to be any changes whatsoever,packages or anything.similarly,cowles undisputed testimony is that she had no information about the vtp in the spring and summer of and dawn scaporatti,a financial consultant at massmutual who worked on both the march analysis and then on developing the vtp program,testified that she did not work on any such project in the months between march and september.moreover,following the september directive,alfano and her team had to work virtually around the clock in order to have something ready to present first to wheeler on september,and then to the board on october they did not simply pull out an older plan for presentation to the board.in addition to this uncontroverted evidence that no one at massmutual was developing a plan from april to september,there was no evidence to support the plaintiffs suggestion that,throughout this period,management considered a plan of some sort to be inevitable and certainly no evidence that management considered a plan to be inevitable.
this leaves only the portion of the statement that rodowicz claims laura cowles made to him in late august or early september,that the board of directors had considered a retirement enhancement package and rejected it.any statement that the board had considered and rejected a package,if made,was false.the only change to the retirement benefits program that the board had considered was the change of retirement age to,which the board approved in.the board had not been presented with any reduction in force options,because the massmutual top management had rejected such an option.in fact,pajak was rather emphatic in his trial testimony about his disfavor for retirement enhancement packages.nonetheless,rodowicz did not present his case as relying on any distinction between the board and upper management and testified that if cowles told me that there was a package,i would withdrawn my notice of retirement.at the time of rodowicz question,cowles could not have truthfully stated that there would be a package or that a package was being considered.a statement that senior management had considered and emphatically rejected a retirement package would have been entirely accurate.such a statement could be considered an even stronger representation that nothing was forthcoming,because no plan could even be put before the board unless senior management approved it.the distinction between the board rejection and senior management rejection is therefore not material.it was simply rodowicz ill fortune that within weeks of his retirement,management made a different decision as to whether to consider offering any extra severance benefits.
jury instructions 
given this lack of evidence,how then to explain the jury verdict we think it arose from the peculiar litigation history of this case and from a theory advanced by plaintiffs which has no support in the law,but which appears,in combination with rodowicz i,to have influenced the jury instructions and led to error.
over massmutual objection,the court admitted evidence of the company consideration and rejection in and of possible early retirement and reduction in force programs.the evidence was admitted as background useful to the jury.massmutual appellate argument that the evidence was inadmissible is of no present concern to us we are,however,concerned by how plaintiffs counsel used that evidence.
the plaintiffs advanced a theory,over objection,that the misrepresentation claim could be proven because the vtp was simply the culmination of a process that began in and continued through the consideration of the various other plans and options that massmutual had considered and rejected.the theory was that the company considered a reduction in force more than a year earlier in,and perhaps even earlier,and so the vtp could be seen as the ultimate solu
