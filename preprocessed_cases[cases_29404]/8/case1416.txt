plaintiff appellant loretta vincent appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york victor bianchini,magistrate judge that reduced by the attorney fee award she requested for successfully appealing from the administrative denial of her application for disability benefits.the district court,attributing gaps in the administrative record to vincent counsel,concluded that this alleged deficiency constituted special circumstances justifying a reduction in the attorney fees awarded under the equal access to justice act.we hold that the failure of a claimant attorney to develop the administrative record on issues collateral to the disability determination does not constitute a special circumstance warranting a reduction in attorney fees.we also hold that the district court abused its discretion in reducing the fee award based on its sua sponte critique of counsel billing records and its conclusion that the time billed was excessive because no novel issues were raised.
background 
attorney mark schneider represented vincent in her successful appeal from the administrative denial of her claim for disability benefits.his efforts at getting paid for those services have been less successful.after ruling in vincent favor on the merits,the district court chided schneider for apparent deficiencies in his representation and awarded only of the amount requested in vincent motion for attorney fees.vincent now appeals from that order.
vincent applied to the social security administration for disability insurance benefits on november.after an initial denial,vincent requested a hearing and appeared before administrative law judge alj lawson brown,who rejected the application on december.on august,the social security appeals council appeals council denied vincent request for review,making the alj decision a final order of the commissioner of social security commissioner.on september,vincent filed a complaint in the district court challenging the commissioner final order.schneider represented vincent at every step of this process.
vincent based her benefits application on a claim that a back injury had rendered her unable to work as of august.to determine whether or not vincent was disabled as defined by the social security act,the alj engaged in the sequential analysis prescribed by regulations.see.in finding her not to be disabled,the alj put significant weight on his negative assessment of vincent credibility.while acknowledging that vincent medically determinable impairment could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms,the alj found that her statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible.vincent disability report listed ten years of factory employment from to,but her earnings records reflected less than three years of work in that period.vincent statements to the social security administration therefore suggested,according to the alj,that she tends to exaggerate.the alj review of vincent medical records,including a doctor recommendation,unheeded by vincent,that she attend physical therapy or a back school program,further call ed into question vincent credibility.the alj also observed that vincent assertion of having been enrolled in special education through tenth grade was not corroborated by the records of the school district,which was unable to locate any special education records in vincent name.having discounted vincent own account of her impairment based on these credibility concerns,the alj concluded that she had the residual functional capacity to perform light work and was not disabled.the appeals council denied review.
on march,the district court reversed and remanded because the alj failed to develop the record as to several issues.first,the alj could not rely on vincent alleged noncompliance with prescribed treatment as a basis for denying benefits,or even for an adverse credibility finding,without allowing her to explain why she did not follow any such treatment.the alj also erred by relying,without further inquiry,on the apparent exaggeration in vincent work history which could have resulted from a data entry error and on the absence of corroboration for vincent special education history which may have been attributable to the use of vincent married name in the records request.finally,the district court found that the alj should have considered the effect of vincent obesity in assessing whether she was disabled.in light of these gaps in the record,the district court remanded for further administrative proceedings.
the district court did not limit its criticisms to the alj,however.it also blamed schneider,who represented vincent at the administrative hearing the underdeveloped issues clearly could have,and should have,been addressed by vincent counsel at the administrative stage as part of his ethical obligation to act with reasonable diligence.once the alj had denied vincent applications,schneider again faltered in the district court view by waiving the filing of a brief when he requested appeals council review.questioning whether schneider alleged lapses constituted a strategic and deliberate choice,the district court anticipated examining his conduct further when schneider applied for attorney fees.
on april,vincent moved the district court for an award of in attorney fees.vincent sought fees for hours of schneider time hours spent working on the appeal to the district court hours on the fee petition and brief and hours on the reply brief and affidavit for the fee petition.in a may,order,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part,reducing the requested fee award by based on a number of purported deficiencies.the district court held that schneider failure to develop the record constituted special circumstances that,under the equal access to justice act,would render a full award unjust.see d.in addition,the district court viewed the length of time schneider billed for preparing the fee application as clearly excessive and unreasonable.the district court also expressed concern that schneider billing records provided only conclusory explanations for several lengthy increments of time and improperly intermingled legal and clerical tasks.to account for these flaws,the district court awarded only in attorney fees,of the amount requested.vincent now appeals from this order.
discussion 
the equal access to justice act eaja provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.it is undisputed that vincent prevailed before the district court and that the position of the united states was not substantially justified.in assessing vincent entitlement to fees,however,the district court concluded that the deficiencies referred to above were special circumstances justifying a substantial reduction in the fees awarded.our review of that decision is narrow we will only reverse if we find the court abused its discretion.united states acres of land,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its decision though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.in re holocaust victim assets,cir quoting zervos verizon,cir.
vincent argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying the full amount of fees requested in her motion.she contends that schneider representation was not deficient and therefore can not constitute special circumstances rendering a full award unjust.she further argues that the time billed on the fee application was appropriate because a novel issue was raised,and that the district court,by evaluating the billing entries sua sponte,improperly denied schneider the opportunity to respond to its concerns.the commissioner responds that the district court acted within its discretion and asks us to affirm.
the eaja special circumstances exception is a safety valve that gives the court discretion to deny awards where equitable considerations dictate an award should not be made.scarborough principi,quoting,at.the contours of that safety valve are indistinct.the second circuit has spoken only twice in published opinions to the question of what constitutes special circumstances that make an award unjust,and in neither case did it address whether or to what extent deficiencies in counsel performance may justify a denial or reduction in eaja fees.see oguachuba ins,cir united states acres of land,cir.with those decisions as our baseline,we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion in applying the special circumstances exception in this case.
in oguachuba,we affirmed the district court denial of attorney fees under the eaja where the petitioner own conceded history of repeated and flagrant misconduct caused the improper incarceration that he successfully challenged.john oguachuba,a nigerian citizen,was granted a writ of habeas corpus based on a violation by the immigration and naturalization service ins of a statutory limit on the detention of any alien under final order of deportation.oguachuba,at.oguachuba then sought attorney fees under the eaja as the prevailing party in that action.id.at.oguachuba history of misconduct was little short of extraordinary after overstaying a student visa,oguachuba repeatedly flouted a deportation order by lying to ins officials,fleeing ins custody,delaying the procurement of travel documents from the nigerian consulate,and flying back to new york immediately after having been deported to nigeria.id.at.oguachuba incarceration exceeded the limit only because the recalcitrance of nigerian officials prevented ins officials from obtaining the travel documents necessary to him.id.at.we held that oguachuba extraordinary persistence in evading the lawful efforts of the ins to deport him to nigeria,his flagrant contempt for united states law and the fact that his own decision not to acquiesce in deportation caused his incarceration constitute the special circumstances which make it inequitable to award him attorneys fees under the eaja.id.at.
we have also affirmed the denial of attorney fees under the eaja for a party who played an only marginal role in the litigation.the attorney fees requested in acres of land related to a discrete early phase of the litigation in which the claimant achieved nothing but its own intervention.at.the claimant efforts in the later,productive phase of the litigation were marginal,duplicative and unnecessary because of the laboring oar taken by parties whose fees are not recoverable under eaja.id.because the claim of the prevailing parties rest ed largely on a result to which the claimant made no contribution,we held that g eneral equitable principles support the district court finding that an award of fees would have been unjust.id.at.
a prevailing party can therefore be denied attorney fees under the eaja for special circumstances when his own misconduct created the circumstances that led to the litigation,see oguachaba,at,and when that party contributions to the litigation success were marginal,duplicative and unnecessary,see acres,at.these two examples of special circumstances,while illustrative,do not define the exception.indeed,if the special circumstances exception is to function as an equitable safety valve,its contours can emerge only on a basis.
when the exception is invoked in the context of the adequacy of counsel representation,however,we think greater clarity is needed if only because counsel must know the parameters of their responsibilities.the eaja provision is meant to reduce the economic deterrents to contesting governmental action and the disparity between the resources and expertise of individuals and their government,at,reprinted in.the eaja provides access to justice by encouraging access to counsel,which not only ensures the thoughtful presentation and consideration of opposing views,but also assists the government in refining and formulating public policy.id.at,reprinted in u.at.that goal is not advanced if an indeterminate standard is applied to reduce or deny a fee award based on alleged deficiencies in representation.i t is common sense that increasing the risk that an attorney will not receive a fee award will inevitably decrease the willingness of attorneys to undertake representation in these kinds of cases.astrue ratliff,sotomayor,concurring.
clarity is of heightened importance in the context of social security appeals,which predominate among the cases in which eaja awards are made.social security adjudications represent a unique variant from the traditional model of adversarial litigation.social security disability determinations are investigatory,or inquisitorial,rather than adversarial.moran astrue,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the duty of the alj,unlike that of a judge at trial,is to investigate and develop the facts and develop the arguments both for and against the granting of benefits.butts barnhart,cir quoting seavey barnhart,cir,reh g granted in part and denied in part,cir.still,counsel is not relieved of the duty to provide competent representation,including the obligation to assist the claimant in bringing to the alj attention everything that shows that the claimant is disabled.see b.because of the alj duty to investigate,if counsel entitlement to fees is questioned due to an undeveloped record,it must be clear that counsel bore primary responsibility for those deficiencies before the fee recovery is reduced.that was the case in bryant apfel,d,in which eaja fees were denied to a prevailing plaintiff whose attorney failure to seek or produce critical medical records from the period of plaintiff claimed disability made it impossible to determine whether plaintiff was,in fact,entitled to disability benefits.
those are not,however,the facts in this case.the district court purports to follow bryant,but in reality goes beyond it.unlike counsel in bryant,schneider fulfilled his obligation to present evidence establishing vincent disability.the denial of benefits at the administrative level was based not on the absence of such evidence,but upon the alj refusal to credit it.the deficiencies in the record that the district court cited all relate to the alj negative assessment of vincent credibility.in the circumstances of this case,in which the alj gave vincent no notice of his credibility concerns,it was the alj responsibility to develop the facts related to this collateral issue.for example,the alj cited vincent noncompliance with treatment recommendations without having raised the issue at the hearing or otherwise allowing vincent to address it.the alj also relied on the discrepancy between vincent earnings record which showed less than three years of employment and a form she submitted listing ten years factory employment as evidence of her tendency to exaggerate.again,however,the alj never questioned vincent about the inconsistency or flagged it as a potential credibility concern.
the district court erred in concluding that schneider shared responsibility with the alj for these omissions.in the district court view,schneider should have identified the discrepancy in vincent work history and preemptively addressed it,and also should have developed the record to explain vincent noncompliance with treatment recommendations.the district court demanded too much of counsel.if we endorsed the district court position,counsel would have to anticipate and refute all conceivable credibility issues to be assured recovery of attorney fees after prevailing on appeal.this is not,nor should it be,the bar against which representation in social security matters is assessed for purposes of awarding eaja fees.although refuting potential credibility questions before they arise and without notice as to their potential significance may be an effective strateg
