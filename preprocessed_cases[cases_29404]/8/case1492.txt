background 
in march,adelphia,a large cable television provider,disclosed that it had incurred billion in previously undisclosed,sheet debt arising from widespread by various members of the rigas family,who were adelphia founders and controlling shareholders.adelphia disclosures precipitated numerous lawsuits and,beginning in april,more than thirty individual and class action law suits were filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against adelphia and its officers,directors,auditors,underwriters,and lenders.
in june,c t filed a lawsuit in the eastern district of pennsylvania styled victor adelphia communications,victor i,on behalf of investors who purchased certain adelphia notes between january and may.that same month,c t filed another complaint,huhn rigas,victor ii,on behalf of investors who purchased the same notes between march and june.together,the victor complaints alleged that solomon smith barney ssb and bank of america securities bas,adelphia lead underwriters,violated and a of the securities act by making untrue statements or omissions of material fact in a registration statement underlying the notes offerings.on june,the same day that c t filed victor i,a law firm not party to this appeal filed huff asset management,llc deloitte touche,llp,huff,in the western district of new york,also alleging,among other things,that bas and ssb violated and of the securities act.
in july,the panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the various suits against adelphia to the southern district of new york,where they were consolidated.huff was also transferred to the southern district of new york but was not consolidated.in december,the district court entered an order appointing group and eminence capital,llc lead plaintiffs and the abbey and kirby law firms lead counsel.lead plaintiffs then filed a consolidated complaint on behalf of a class whose members bought adelphia debt and securities between august and june.the consolidated complaint incorporated the victor complaints and claims against ssb and bas.the complaint also added certain new b,and claims against ssb,bas,and other underwriters and lenders not previously named in any of the adelphia actions.additionally,the complaint asserted claims arising under the exchange act,the trust indenture act of,and state common law.
under the securities act,claims are unless they are brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,and within three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public.similarly,under the exchange act,claims are unless they are brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued.c.
in march,the bank defendants to the consolidated complaint moved to dismiss most of the complaint as.notably,the bank defendants did not challenge the timeliness of the and claims in the victor complaints.the district court granted the bank defendants motion.see in re adelphia commc ns,md,wl,at may.however,the district court ruled that under,the consolidated complaint claims related back to the claims originally asserted against ssb and bas in the victor complaints to the extent that existing plaintiffs were asserting the claims.id.at thus,the only securities claims to survive dismissal were the victor complaints and claims against bas and ssb and the new claims against bas and ssb that related back to the victor complaints.
in june,lead counsel and the bank defendants entered into a million cash settlement,which provided that lead counsel would have the discretion to allocate attorneys fees among the other class counsel.after the district court preliminarily approved the settlement,c t petitioned the court for attorneys fees of,or of the aggregate fees award attributable to the bank settlement,arguing that the victor complaints were solely responsible for the entire recovery from the bank defendants because the complaints preserved the only viable securities claims asserted against ssb and bas.
in november,the district court denied c t petition,approved the settlement,and awarded lead counsel million in attorneys fees or of the settlement,representing a lodestar hours times ordinary rates multiplier of.the district court also directed lead counsel to allocate fees to c t,subject to later review by the court.accordingly,lead counsel allocated c t or of the total attorneys fees awarded,corresponding to c t lodestar with no multiplier,for the work c t performed prior to the appointment of lead counsel.the district court approved this allocation,finding that it was reasonable under the factors outlined in goldberger integrated resources,cir this appeal followed.we review a district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion,asking whether the court made a mistake of law or clearly erroneous factual finding.id.at.this deferential standard takes on special significance when reviewing fee decisions.id.
discussion 
the district court determined that in order to receive compensation for its work prior to the appointment of lead plaintiffs,c t must have conferred a substantial benefit on the class.in re adelphia commc ns.sec.derivatives,mdl,wl,at,citing in re cendant.sec,cir cendant ii.the district court observed that the consolidated complaint inclusion of the and claims benefitted the class and noted that abbey and kirby had provided c t with some compensation in view of that fact.however,the district court declined to disturb lead counsel fees allocation and found that an award representing c t lodestar was adequate.id.at.
on appeal,c t contends that the district court erred by approving lead counsel allocation and,in so doing,grossly undercompensated it.specifically,c t contends that the district court misapplied the goldberger factors and maintains that without the and claims raised in the victor complaint,there would have been no settlement.although abbey and kirby were no doubt on the stingy side when it came to compensating their brethren,we have not been convinced that the district court abused its discretion in approving class counsel allocation.
it is well established that the common fund doctrine permits attorneys whose work created a common fund for the benefit of a group of plaintiffs to receive reasonable attorneys fees from the fund.in re zyprexa prods.liab,cir per curiam goldberger,at.class action lawsuits are the prototypical example of instances where the common fund doctrine can apply.
we have not had occasion to decide the proper framework for awarding attorneys fees to counsel under the private securities litigation reform act pslra for work completed prior to the appointment of lead plaintiff.securities litigation is often an entrepreneurial exercise in which multiple attorneys file complaints in the hopes of ultimately being appointed lead counsel.see cendant ii,
