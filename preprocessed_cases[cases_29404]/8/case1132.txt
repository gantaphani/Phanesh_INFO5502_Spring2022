rather than disclose the terms of their settlement,the parties instead asked the district court to stay further proceedings and to certify,pursuant to b,the question of whether flsa actions are an exception to rule a a ii general rule that parties may stipulate to the dismissal of an action without the involvement of the court.on february,the district court entered an order staying the case and certifying the question for interlocutory appeal.our court granted the motion.cheeks freeport pancake house,cv cir.may,ecf.our court heard oral argument on november.as both parties advocated in favor of reversal,following oral argument we solicited the views of the dol on the issues raised in this matter.the dol submitted a letter brief on march,taking the position that the flsa falls within the applicable federal statute exception to rule a a,such that the parties may not stipulate to the dismissal of flsa claims with prejudice without the involvement of a court or the dol.cheeks submitted supplemental briefing in response to the dol submission on april,and we find no need for additional oral argument.
discussion 
the current appeal raises the issue of determining whether parties may settle flsa claims with prejudice,without court approval or dol,under federal rule of civil procedure a a ii.the question of whether judicial approval of,and public access to,flsa settlements is required is an open one in our circuit we review this question of law de novo.see cmty.health care ass of shah,cir.
rule a a provides in relevant part that 
subject to rules e,c,and and any applicable federal statute,the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing 
i a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment or 
ii a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.
the flsa is silent as to rule.we must determine,then,if the flsa is an applicable federal statute within the meaning of the rule.if it is not,then cheeks case was dismissed by operation of rule a a ii,and the parties did not need approval from the district court for the dismissal to be effective.hester indus,tyson foods,cir the judge signature on the stipulation did not change the nature of the dismissal.because the dismissal was effectuated by stipulation of the parties,the court lacked the authority to condition the dismissal collecting cases.
we start with a relatively blank slate,as neither the supreme court nor our sister circuits have addressed the precise issue before us.district courts in our circuit,however,have grappled with the issue to differing results.those requiring court approval of private flsa settlements regularly base their analysis on a pair of supreme court cases brooklyn savings bank,and schulte,gangi.
brooklyn savings involved a night watchman who worked at brooklyn savings bank for two years.at.the watchman was entitled to overtime pay for his work,but was not compensated for his overtime while he worked for the bank.id.at.the watchman left the bank employ,and two years later the bank computed the statutory overtime it owed him and offered the watchman a check for in exchange for a release of all his flsa rights.id.the watchman signed the release,took the check,and then sued the bank for liquidated damages pursuant to the flsa,which were admittedly not included in the settlement.id.
the supreme court held that in the absence of a genuine dispute as to whether employees are entitled to damages,employees could not waive their rights to such damages in a private flsa settlement.id.at.because the only issue before the court was the issue of liquidated damages,which were a matter of statutory calculation,the court concluded that there was no bona fide dispute between the parties as to the amount in dispute.id.at.the court noted that the flsa legislative history shows an intent on the part of congress to protect certain groups of the population from substandard wages and excessive hours which endangered the national health and and the free flow of goods in interstate commerce.id.at.in addition,the flsa was a recognition of the fact that due to the unequal bargaining power as between employer and employee,certain segments of the population required federal compulsory legislation to prevent private contracts on their part which endangered national health and efficiency and as a result the free movement of goods in interstate commerce.id.at.concluding that the flsa statutory language indicated that congress did not intend that an employee should be allowed to waive his right to liquidated damages,the court refused to enforce the release and allowed the watchman to proceed on his claim for liquidated damages.id.at.however,the court left unaddressed the issue of whether parties could privately settle flsa claims if such settlements resolved a bona fide dispute between the parties.id.at.
a year later,in schulte,the supreme court answered that question in part,barring enforcement of private settlements of bona fide disputes where the dispute centered on whether or not the employer is covered by the flsa.at.again,the supreme court looked to the purpose of the flsa,which was to secure for the lowest paid segment of the nation workers a subsistence wage,and determined that neither wages nor the damages for withholding them are capable of reduction by compromise of controversies over coverage.id.at.however,the supreme court again specifically declined to opine as to the possibility of compromises in other situations which may arise,such as a dispute over the number of hours worked or the regular rate of employment.id.at.
brooklyn savings and gangi establish that employees may no
