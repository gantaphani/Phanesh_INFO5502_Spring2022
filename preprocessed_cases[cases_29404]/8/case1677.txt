the are persons who incurred losses in the september,terrorist attacks those who suffered personal injuries,the families and representatives of those who died,insurers and property owners.they have brought tort claims against hundreds of parties foreign governments,charitable entities,and individuals alleged to have provided financial and logistical support to al qaeda in the runup to the attacks.plaintiffs take this appeal from a partial final judgment entered on january,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york casey,dismissing their claims against twelve of the numerous defendants.they have appealed that judgment with respect to seven of the dismissed defendants the kingdom of saudi arabia the kingdom,four saudi princes four princes,a saudi banker mohamed,and the saudi high commission for relief to bosnia and herzegovina shc.we have jurisdiction over their appeals pursuant to.
the chief issue on appeal is the scope of foreign sovereign immunity.the foreign sovereign immunities act of,fsia,grants foreign sovereigns immunity from suit in the united states subject to enumerated exceptions.we conclude that the fsia protects the obviously,the kingdom itself.first,we hold that the fsia applies to individual officials of foreign governments in their official capacities,and therefore to the four princes.second,we affirm the district court conclusion that the shc is an agency or instrumentality of the kingdom,to which the fsia likewise applies.
further,we conclude that none of the fsia exceptions applies.the plaintiffs claims do not come within the statutory exception for terrorist acts,terrorism exception,because the kingdom has not been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the united states.as to the exception for personal injury or death caused by a foreign sovereign tortious act,id.a torts exception,we decline to characterize plaintiffs predicated on a terrorist sounding in tort.nor do the plaintiffs claims come within the statutory exception for a foreign sovereign commercial activity,id.a commercial activities exception,because the defendants specific alleged muslim charities that promote and underwrite not conduct in trade,traffic or commerce.
accordingly,we agree with the district court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against the kingdom,the four princes in their official capacities,and the shc.we likewise affirm the district court dismissal of the claims against the four princes in their personal capacities and mohamed for want of personal jurisdiction,and the denial of the plaintiffs motions for jurisdictional discovery.
background 
the complaints vary somewhat in their details,but they share a core allegation the defendants played a critical role in the september attacks by funding muslim charities that,in turn,funded al qaeda.since there would not be a trigger to pull or a bomb to blow up without the resources to acquire such tools of terrorism and to bankroll the persons who actually commit the violence,boim quranic literacy,cir,plaintiffs argue that the defendants should be held liable for the consequences of their material support for al qaeda.the complaints,which we accept as true at the pleading stage,garb republic of poland,cir,allege the facts set forth below.
the shc was formed in by decree of king fahd who was then president of the council of ministers,the kingdom highest governing body,apparently to support bosnian muslims displaced by civil war.the shc acted as a fully integrated component of al qa e da logistical and financial support infrastructure.in the early,al qaeda fighters began infiltrating bosnia disguised as shc relief workers.the shc has funneled millions of dollars to al qaeda,evidenced by investigators inability to account for nearly million in shc donations.in an october raid of the shc sarajevo offices,government officials found computer hard drives containing photos of the world trade center,the embassies in kenya and tanzania,and the cole all targets of terrorist attacks documents about pesticides and crop dusters photos and maps of washington,with prominent government buildings marked and instructions for fabricating state department badges.after the raid,the bosnian financial police reported that peacekeeping forces confiscated some documentation for which it can be claimed with certainty that it does not belong in the scope of work of a humanitarian organization.
similar allegations have been lodged against numerous other muslim charities.although those claims are not raised in this appeal,the allegations about the charities provide the necessary background for the issues here.the summary allegation is as follows 
ostensible charitable organizations,and in particular,islamic charities under the control of the kingdom of saudi arabia,have played a singularly important role in al qa e da development and pursuit of its perverse ambitions.these charities have served as the primary vehicle for raising,laundering and distributing funds on behalf of al qa e da from its inception.in addition,these charities have provided arms,false travel documentation,physical assets and logistical support to al qa e da.
these allegations include a wealth of detail conscientiously cited to published and unpublished sources that,if true,reflect close working arrangements between ostensible charities and terrorist networks,including al qaeda.the united states government has listed several of the charities or their branch offices as specifically designated global terrorists,and has taken steps to shut down their operations.
the kingdom of saudi arabia 
the kingdom contributed to the charities described above and closely monitored their relief efforts abroad,with the express knowledge that those charities were funneling the kingdom funds to al qaeda.according to the federal insurance plaintiffs,the kingdom exercises complete oversight and control over the charities,making the charities and agents whose deeds can be imputed to the kingdom.
the four princes 
the four princes are his royal highness prince salman bin abdulaziz prince salman,his royal highness crown prince sultan bin abdulaziz prince sultan,his royal highness prince naif bin abdulaziz prince naif,and his royal highness prince turki alfaisal bin abdulaziz prince turki.broadly stated,it is alleged that they caused money to be given to the muslim charities from the kingdom as well as their own accounts,with the knowledge that the charities would transfer the funds to al qaeda.
princes naif,sultan and turki sit on the kingdom supreme council of islamic affairs,which monitors and approves islamic charitable giving both within and outside the kingdom.the kingdom generally requires saudis to obtain government approval for private charitable giving abroad.
prince salman is president of the shc and governor of riyadh province.he intended that the shc would be a conduit for funding and supporting the bosnian islamic movement,including al qaeda.prince salman was put on notice of shc connection with al qaeda by a letter he received in from a group called the mothers of srebrenica complaining that the shc money was not being used for humanitarian aid in bosnia.
prince sultan is chairman of the supreme council and first deputy president of the council of ministers.he has been designated as the successor to king abdullah.sultan received at least three warnings that the muslim charities were al qaeda fronts prince sultan also made personal contributions to the charities.according to a report in a muslim newspaper,he donated one million saudi dollars to one of the charities pursuant to an annual pledge.sultan also made a sizable contribution to the saudi joint relief committee of kosovar refugees sjrc,which oversees several other muslim charities.
prince naif is saudi minister of the interior,in which capacity he monitors and controls the charities that operate in saudi arabia.at one time,naif served as the general supervisor of the sjrc.prince naif was present with prince sultan when he was warned that saudi charities serve as fronts for terrorist groups.naif has personally contributed more than two million saudi dollars to the sjrc,and has helped the sjrc raise money from other wealthy saudis.
prince turki was the director of the kingdom department of general intelligence dgi until august.in the,turki met osama bin laden at the saudi embassy in islamabad,pakistan he later met with bin laden at least five times in the and.in,turki agreed with the taliban and al qaeda that the kingdom would not attempt to extradite bin laden or his followers,in return for bin laden agreement not to target the kingdom or its royal family.during turki tenure,there existed near identity between dgi and the taliban.the federal plaintiffs allege in addition that turki donated to the charities in his personal capacity.
prince mohamed 
the plaintiffs claims against mohamed,his royal highness prince mohamed al faisal al saud,focus on his role in islamic banking osama bin laden and other terrorists held accounts at banks and subsidiaries of banks managed by mohamed those banks are governed by islamic law,or sharia,which prohibits interest instead,the banks and their depositors manage the funds jointly.it is alleged that mohamed knowingly provided material sponsorship to international terrorism.
procedural history 
the burnett plaintiffs filed suit against princes sultan and turki and other defendants not present in this appeal in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the district court robertson,dismissed the claims brought against princes sultan and turki in their official capacities for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the claims against prince sultan in his personal capacity for lack of personal jurisdiction.burnett al baraka inv.dev,d.
on december,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred burnett to the united states district court for the southern district of new york as mdl to be consolidated for pretrial purposes with other similar cases.the consolidated proceeding was assigned to the late judge richard conway casey.
on january,judge casey dismissed the consolidated claims against the kingdom,princes sultan and turki,and mohamed.in re terrorist attacks on,d in re terrorist attacks i.citing the majority view among the circuits,judge casey concluded that the fsia shields princes sultan and turki in their official capacities.the plaintiffs do not dispute that the fsia protects the kingdom as a foreign sovereign.judge casey further held that no exception to the fsia defeated the defendants sovereign immunity.
judge casey likewise dismissed the claims against princes sultan and turki in their personal capacities and against mohamed for lack of personal jurisdiction.judge casey reasoned that the plaintiffs had failed to offer any facts to lend support to their allegation that prince sultan purposefully directed his activities at this forum by donating to charities that he knew at the time supported international terrorism.in re terrorist attacks i,d at.similarly,the federal plaintiffs failed to present any specific facts from which this court could infer prince turki primary and personal involvement in,or support of,international terrorism and al qaeda.conclusory allegations that he donated money to charities,without specific factual allegations that he knew they were funneling money to terrorists,do not suffice.id.at.finally,there was no allegation that prince mohamed had any knowledge or involvement in any al qaeda accounts at any of the banks he chaired and his connection to the sudanese bank which purportedly knowingly opened accounts for al qaeda operatives,including osama bin laden,is too remote in time and proximity to implicate him.id.at.
on may,the district court entered an order dismissing the claims against the kingdom,princes sultan and turki,and mohamed in the remaining consolidated cases.the plaintiffs conceded that the allegations and evidence in the other consolidated cases against those four defendants did not materially differ from the allegations in the cases already dismissed.
in an opinion and order issued on september,the district court dismissed the ashton,burnett and federal plaintiffs claims against princes salman and naif and the shc on substantially the same grounds.the court concluded that the shc is an agency of the kingdom entitled to immunity under the fsia,and that subject matter jurisdiction was therefore lacking over the claims against the shc and princes salman and naif in their official capacities.the claims against princes salman and naif in their personal capacity were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.in re terrorist attacks on,d in re terrorist attacks ii.
on december,the district court certified as final the orders of january,and september,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,with respect to the kingdom princes sultan,turki,salman and naif mohamed and the shc by virtue of the december,certification,this court has jurisdiction over the appeal under.

the seventh circuit is an outlier.it has construed the fsia grant of immunity narrowly,to exclude individual government officials,reasoning that i f congress meant to include individuals acting in the official capacity in the scope of the fsia,it would have done so in clear and unmistakable terms.enahoro abubakar,cir.
f oreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity on the part of the united states,and not a restriction imposed by the constitution.verlinden,at.until the,the judiciary consistently deferred to the decisions of the political particular,those of the executive whether to take jurisdiction over actions against foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities.id.in,the state department issued the tate letter,which announced the adoption of the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity.under this theory,immunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign public acts,and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state strictly commercial acts.id.at.the ninth circuit described the scheme of the tate letter as follows 
typically,a foreign state or instrumentality faced with a suit in a court in our country would apply to the state department for a finding of immunity.the state department would make a determination,considering the common law principles expressed in the restatement,and would convey the finding to the relevant court by filing a suggestion.in fact,however,the courts treated such suggestions as binding determinations,and would invoke or deny immunity based upon the decision of the state department.
chuidian,at.but by the,some in congress had grown concerned that the tate letter system was leaving immunity decisions subject to diplomatic pressures rather than to the rule of law.id.
the fsia,enacted in,largely codif ied the existing common law of sovereign immunity,with the notable exception that it remove d the role of the state department in determining immunity.see also,at,reprinted in,house report t he bill would codify the restrictive principle of sovereign immunity,as presently recognized in international law.under this principle,the immunity of a foreign state is restricted to suits involving a foreign state public acts jure imperii and does not extend to suits based on its commercial or private acts jure gestionis.
recognizing the potential sensitivity of actions against foreign states,the fsia aimed to facilitate and depoliticize litigation against foreign states and to minimize irritations in foreign relations arising out of such litigation.cargill,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the fsia defines foreign state as follows 
a foreign state includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection b.
b an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state means any entity 
which is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise,and 
which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,and 
which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title,nor created under the laws of any third country.
several plaintiffs read state,as used in the fsia,as a term of art meaning an entity that has a defined territory and a permanent population,under the control of its own government,and that engages in,or has the capacity to engage in,formal relations with other such entities.restatement third of foreign relations law.this definition necessarily excludes individual government officials.nor,argue these plaintiffs,can an official be considered an agency or instrumentality of a state,because the entities listed in the subclauses of b are defined in terms not usually used to describe natural persons.tachiona,at.writing as amicus curiae in another fsia lawsuit,the department of justice has opined that the fsia,with its exclusions and obscurities,stops short of shielding government officials,who instead enjoy an expansive common law immunity because we decide this case on the ground that the fsia protects individual government representatives in their official capacities,we need not consider any continuing vitality of sovereign immunity under the common law.
the ninth circuit opinion in chuidian is the most detailed statement of the majority view that an individual official is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government.as chuidian observes,the terms agency,instrumentality,organ,entity,and legal person,while perhaps more readily connoting an organization or collective,do not in their typical legal usage necessarily exclude individuals.chuidian,at.moreover,the fsia legislative history does not even hint of an intent to exclude individual officials,but does contain numerous statements suggesting that congress intended the act to codify the existing common law principles of sovereign immunity.id.prior to the fsia passage,those principles expressly extended immunity to individual officials acting in their official capacity.see also restatement second of foreign relations law f the immunity of a foreign state extends to any other public minister,official,or agent of the state with respect to acts performed in his official capacity if the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law against the state.as a consequence,if the fsia did not extend to individuals,it would represent a substantial unannounced departure from prior common law.chuidian,at.this is so because,after the fsia passage,the restatement third of foreign relations law delete d in its entirety the discussion of the united states common law of sovereign immunity,and substitute d a section analyzing issues exclusively under the fsia.id.at.insofar as this revision marks the recognition that we now look to the fsia where we once sought guidance from the common law,we would expect a departure from the prior rule to be made explicitly,not sub silentio.
the ninth circuit rejected the view,advanced by the department of justice,that the foreign state is protected by the fsia while its officials are otherwise protected by common law immunity.under that approach,presumably courts would once again be required to give conclusive weight to the state department determination of whether an individual activities fall within the traditional exceptions to sovereign immunity,which would run counter to congress stated intent of removing the discretionary role of the state department.id.at.
we join the majority of circuits in holding that the fsia grants immunity to individual officials of a foreign government for their acts,and we subscribe to the reasoning of chuidian.
that analysis,largely based on legislative history,is grounded in the statutory wording.the term agency has a more abstract common meaning than a governmental bureau or office an agency is any thing or person through which action is accomplished.we need not decide how broadly to construe this word in other contexts however,it is easily open enough to include senior members of a foreign state government and secretariat.
this reading of agency is consistent with the evident principle that the state can not act except through individuals.thus,the doctrine precludes our courts from sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory,including acts committed by individual officials of foreign governments.bigio,cir quoting underhill hernandez.this is so because the acts of the official representatives of the state are those of the state itself,when exercised within the scope of their delegated powers.underhill hernandez,cir,aff.see also oetjen cent.leather.concluding that the action of a duly commissioned military commander of the mexican government p lainly was the action,in mexico,of the legitimate mexican government when dealing with a mexican citizen.similarly,suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.monell dep t of soc,d.in other words,a claim against an agency of state power,including a state officer acting in his official capacity,can be in effect a claim against the state.in other contexts as well,the law recognizes that the immunity of a principal does not amount to much without the extension of that immunity to its agents.see,gravel united states,d treating as one a senator and his aides for purpose of legislative immunity if they are not so recognized,the central role of the speech or debate prevent intimidation of legislators by the executive and accountability before a possibly hostile inevitably be diminished and frustrated internal citation omitted oliva heller,cir reasoning that because law clerks are simply extensions of the judges at whose pleasure they serve for purposes of absolute judicial immunity,judges and their law clerks are as one internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
this conclusion finds reinforcement in the new iteration of the terrorism exception,which makes specific reference to the legal status of an official,employee or agent of the foreign state.see a lifting immunity in connection with,inter alia,the provision of material support or resources by an official,employee,or agent of a foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency id.at c creating private right of action against a foreign state that is or was a state sponsor of terrorism,and any official,employee,or agent of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency.these provisions evince congressional recognition that claims against individual officials of a foreign government must be brought within the confines of the fsia.individuals and government officers,as entities,can not be designated state sponsor s of terrorism.so that such individuals would nevertheless fall within the scope of the terrorism exception to fsia immunity,congress enacted specific provisions that defined the exception to reach these individuals.if these individuals were not otherwise immune from suit pursuant to the fsia,these provisions would be entirely superfluous.we can thus infer that congress considered individuals and government officers to be within the scope of the fsia.although the views of a subsequent congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one,the terrorism exception suggests that congress has long contemplated the fsia application to individuals.united states philadelphia bank,d.in light of those considerations,we hold that the fsia treats individual agents of the foreign state,when they undertake their official duties,as the foreign state for the purposes of.
the burnett plaintiffs challenge the district court conclusion that the shc is an agency or instrumentality of the kingdom and therefore entitled to immunity under the fsia.a.
to recap,an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state is any entity 
which is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise,and 
which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,and 
which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title,nor created under the laws of any third country.
the question is whether the shc is an organ of the kingdom.b.there is no definition of that word in the fsia however,criteria can be found 
whether the foreign state created the entity for a national purpose whether the foreign state actively supervises the entity whether the foreign state requires the hiring of public employees and pays their salaries whether the entity holds exclusive rights to some right in the foreign country and how the entity is treated under foreign state law.

to support its status as an organ of the kingdom,the shc submitted declarations from saud bin mohammad,director of the executive office of shc,and mutlib bin abdullah,a member of the council of ministers authorized to speak on the shc behalf.
explains that,during and after the civil war in bosnia,
there was much interest within the kingdom of saudi arabia,both among citizens and the government,in supporting charitable projects in.the kingdom of saudi arabia desired to speak with one voice as a nation the shc was therefore formed to centralize all charitable giving from the kingdom to.when formed,the shc was vested with the sole authority to collect and distribute charitable funds in bosnia.
states that many shc employees are seconded from the kingdom ministries or agencies,which continues paying their salaries.other employees are on contract with the shc,and are paid by the shc.
explains that the council of ministers created the shc in,pursuant to its authority under council law to order the formation of a governmental entity.the same order appointed prince salman as shc president.avers that a government commission,such as the shc,always is chaired or presided over by a governmental official and conducts its affairs in accordance with the domestic or foreign policy objectives of the kingdom,and can be sued for its administrative acts in the board of grievances,the administrative court of saudi arabia.
based on this undisputed record,the filler factors indicate that the shc is an organ of the kingdom.the shc was created for a national purpose channeling humanitarian aid to bosnian muslims the kingdom actively supervises it many shc workers are kingdom employees who remain on the kingdom payroll the shc holds the sole authority to collect and distribute charity to bosnia and it can be sued in administrative court in the kingdom.
the burnett plaintiffs note the paucity of information about the shc ownership structure a factor identified by the third circuit in usx corp,and argue that the district court gave this insufficient weight.we do not see the relevance of this factor here the shc is a governmental entity that,like numerous agencies within our own government,has no owners or shareholders.
nor are we persuaded that the shc waived its immunity by identifying itself as nongovernmental on a registration document filed with bosnian authorities.we and other courts have observed that the implied waiver provision of section a must be construed narrowly.smith socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir quoting shapiro republic of bolivia,cir see also cabiri,at declining to find waiver where defendant had taken no action that can be understood to demonstrate either an objective or a subjective intent to waive immunity with respect to plaintiffs claims frolova union of soviet socialist republics,cir explaining that waiver would not be found absent a conscious decision to take part in the litigation and a failure to raise sovereign immunity despite the opportunity to do so.registering as a humanitarian organization in bosnia does not reflect a conscious decision by the shc to waive its sovereign immunity in american courts.the shc outside legal counsel in bosnia avers that the term nongovernmental on the registration documents refers to whether the humanitarian organization is part of the government of bosnia,and that t here is no prohibition against humanitarian organizations that are part of foreign governments operating in.
we next consider the plaintiffs arguments about the applicability of two exceptions to the fsia the torts exception and the commercial activities exception 
the fsia lifts immunity for certain torts committed by foreign sovereigns 
a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
not otherwise encompassed in paragraph above,in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death,or damage to or loss of property,occurring in the united states and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment except this paragraph shall not apply to 
a any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused,or 
b any claim arising out of malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights.
congress enacted the torts exception to eliminate a foreign state immunity for traffic accidents and other torts committed in the united states,for which liability is imposed under domestic tort law.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d see also macarthur area citizens ass republic of peru,a lthough cast in general terms,the tortious act exception was designed primarily to remove immunity for cases arising from traffic accidents.this is scarcely to say that the exception applies only to traffic accidents rather,the point is that the legislative history counsels that the exception should be narrowly construed so as not to encompass the farthest reaches of common law.internal citations omitted asociacion de reclamantes united mexican states,scalia,the primary purpose of the tortious act or omission exception of a was to enable officials and employees of foreign sovereigns to be held liable for the traffic accidents which they cause in this country,whether or not in the scope of their official business.
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants tortious conduct took the form of providing material support to terrorists.a different statutory terrorism precisely those activities.the terrorism exception with some ellipses is set out in the margin 
congress enacted the first iteration of the terrorism exception in in order to give american citizens an important economic and financial weapon against outlaw states that sponsor terrorism by providing safe havens,funding,training,supplying weaponry,medical assistance,false travel documentation,and the like,at.an fsia exception for terrorist acts had long been sought by victims groups,but it had been consistently resisted by the executive branch,which feared that such an amendment to the fsia might cause other nations to respond in kind,thus potentially subjecting the american government to suits in foreign countries for actions taken in the united states.price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya.the resulting provision,a repealed bore notable features which reveal the delicate legislative compromise out of which it was born,the primary one being that it applied only to designated state sponsors of terrorism.id.when congress amended the terrorism exception in,that limitation was preserved.a a i i requiring that the foreign state have been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the state department.
the state department has never designated the kingdom a state sponsor of terrorism.as a consequence,the terrorism exception is inapplicable here.no plaintiff argues otherwise.but to apply the torts exception where the conduct alleged amounts to terrorism within the meaning of the terrorism exception would evade and frustrate that key limitation on the terrorism exception.
by definition,the acts listed in the terrorism exception are torts.if the torts exception covered terrorist acts and thus encompassed the conduct set forth in the terrorism exception,there would be no need for plaintiffs ever to rely on the terrorism exception when filing suit.an important procedural the foreign state be designated a state sponsor of in effect be vitiated.we decline to read the statute in a way that would deprive the terrorism exception or its limitations of meaning.williams taylor,d it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.to assure that the fsia serves its purpose,its exceptions must be separately administered.

plaintiffs textual argument focuses on the feature of the torts exception that reinstates foreign sovereign immunity for a particular class of torts malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit and interference with contract rights.a b.the plaintiffs contend that if congress intended to do the same for torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources,it could have done so explicitly.russello united states,d.but the terrorism exception applies in any case not otherwise covered by this chapter.a.in other words,the terrorism exception stands alone.if acts of terrorism are considered torts for the purposes of the torts exception,then any claim that could be brought under the terrorism exception could also be brought under the torts exception.if this were so,the terrorism exception would be drained of all force because every potential case would be otherwise covered by this chapter namely,the torts exception.so,claims based on terrorism must be brought under the terrorism exception,and not under any other fsia exception.
the plaintiffs predict that several untoward consequences will flow from reading the torts exception not to cover their claims.some of these concerns have been remedied by the amended version of the terrorism exception,as explained in the margin the remainder overlook what is at stake here civil liability.that a foreign sovereign is immune to civil claims brought by the victims of its alleged wrongdoing does not mean it has unfettered discretion to commit atrocities against united states nationals.deterrence or punishment does not begin and end with civil litigation brought by individual plaintiffs.our government has other means at its,trade embargos,diplomacy,military achieve its foreign policy goals and to deter or punish foreign sovereigns.although the fsia did open an avenue of redress for certain individual victims of terrorism,it did not delegate to the victims,their counsel and the courts the responsibility of the executive branch to make america foreign policy response to acts of terrorism committed by a foreign state,including whether federal courts may entertain a victim claim for damages.
we therefore hold that the torts exception does not apply here 
the federal plaintiffs characterize the defendants charitable contributions as a form of money laundering,argue that money laundering is commercial in nature,and ask us to conclude that the commercial activities exception defeats the defendants immunity for harm caused by their charitable contributions.the same analysis that renders inapplicable the torts exception likewise defeats this argument.see part iv.moreover,existing authorities make clear that the commercial activities exception does not apply here.
the fsia commercial activities exception defeats foreign sovereign immunity in cases 
in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
a.commercial activity is defined as a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.d.the next sentence advises that the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.id.the supreme court has criticized the circularity of this definition,which 
leaves the critical term commercial largely undefined the first sentence simply establishes that the commercial nature of an activity does not depend upon whether it is a single act or a regular course of conduct and the second sentence merely specifies what element of the conduct determines commerciality,nature rather than purpose,but still without saying what commercial means.

happily,the fsia was not written on a clean slate.weltover,at.rather,it codified the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity used by the state department between and the passage of the fsia in.in a case decided in that era,the supreme court explained without disagreement from the dissenters that i n their commercial capacities,foreign governments do not exercise powers peculiar to sovereigns.instead,they exercise only those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens.alfred dunhill of london,republic of cuba,d.the supreme court adhered to this standard in construing the fsia w hen a foreign government acts,not as regulator of a market,but in the manner of a private player within it,the foreign sovereign actions are commercial within the meaning of the fsia.weltover,at.see also letelier republic of chile,cir letelier ii inquiring into whether the activity is of the type an individual would customarily carry on for profit,or that of a merchant in the marketplace.the fsia asks 
not whether the foreign government is acting with a profit motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely sovereign objectives.rather,the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs whatever the motive behind them are the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.
weltover,at.citing black law dictionary ed.so,regulation of foreign currency exchange is a sovereign activity whereas a contract to buy army boots or even bullets is a commercial activity,because private companies can similarly use sales contracts to acquire goods.id.at.in the same way,a foreign state exercise of the power of its police has long been understood for purposes of the restrictive theory as peculiarly sovereign in nature,because e xercise of the powers of police and penal officers is not the sort of action by which private parties can engage in commerce.nelson,at.
with this distinction in mind,our first task is to identify what particular conduct in this case is relevant.texas trading milling fed.republic of nigeria,cir see also nelson,at.we begin our analysis by identifying the particular conduct on which the plaintiffs action is based for purposes of the act.the federal plaintiffs focus on what they term the sovereign defendants money laundering activities on behalf of al qa e da,and argue that the law draws no bright line between commercial activities that are legitimate and those that are criminal.we understand the federal plaintiffs argument to be as follows the defendants donated money to charities with the intent that it be funneled to terrorist organizations which,in turn,would use that money to purchase the plane tickets,communications devices and weapons necessary to orchestrate the september attacks.
this argument fails because it goes to purpose,the very fact the act renders irrelevant to the question of an activity commercial character.nelson,at.it does not matter that the defendants made and oversaw donations to charities with a specific intent as to where those donations would end up.the alleged conduct away not a commercial activity.granted,donating to charities is among those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens,alfred dunhill,at.say participation in a foreign assistance program administered by the agency for international development whose essential nature is public or governmental,house report at.but inquiry under the commercial activities exception is not just whether the act was public jure imperii or private jure gestionis it also matters whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs whatever the motive behind them are the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.weltover,at.in this context,the four princes donations to charity are not part of the trade and commerce engaged in by a merchant in the marketplace.letelier ii,at.consequently,the commercial activities exception does not apply 
the remaining issue is the district court personal jurisdiction over the four princes in their personal capacities,and over prince mohamed who is sued in no other capacity.the plaintiffs have the burden of showing that these individuals have certain minimum contacts with the united states such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.internal quotation marks omitted see bank brussels lambert fiddler gonzalez rodriguez,cir where the defendants have moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant metro.life ins,cir same.in determining whether a plaintiff has met this burden,we will not draw argumentative inferences in the plaintiff favor.robinson overseas military sales,cir quoting atl.mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l,cir.moreover,we are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.jazini nissan motor,cir quoting papasan allain,d.

the plaintiffs rely on five opinions from other circuits for the idea that the four princes alleged involvement in a terrorist attack on a citizen of the united states constitutes purposeful direction at this forum,such that they should reasonably anticipate being haled into court here.burger king,at.but those cases all addressed defendants who were primary participants in terrorist acts.in mwani bin laden,the court exercised personal jurisdiction over al qaeda and osama bin laden for injuries arising out of the bombing of our embassies in kenya and tanzania,reasoning that their decision to purposefully direct their terror at the united states,and the fact that the plaintiffs injuries arose out of one of those terrorist activities,should suffice to cause the defendants to reasonably anticipate being haled into an american court.id.at quoting burger king,at.similarly,the defendant in morris khadr,d,was an al qaeda member who actively participated in and helped plan al qaeda terrorist much so,in fact,that he convinced his son to risk his life and attack american soldiers in afghanistan,killing the plaintiffs relatives in the course of engagement.id.at.two other cases dealt with civil claims against libya a designated state sponsor of terrorism and its intelligence service for the bombing of commercial airplanes.pugh socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,d,t he individual defendants conspired to sabotage and succeeded in destroying a civilian commercial aircraft filled to capacity on an international flight and expected to stop in several nations before reaching its final destination,and so the individual defendants could and should have reasonably postulated that passengers of many nationalities would be on board,from which they could also expect they might be haled into the courts of those nations whose citizens would die.rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,this case concerns the destruction by libya and its agents of a united states flag aircraft,which was manufactured and ow n ed by united states corporations,while en route to the united states on a regularly scheduled flight with united states nationals on board.finally,in daliberti republic of iraq,d,the court exercised jurisdiction over iraq then designated a state sponsor of terrorism for conduct within the terrorism exception.the court reasoned that the abuse of the american plaintiffs had a direct effect in the united states and was consciously designed to affect united states policy.under the circumstances,iraq can not now claim surprise at the assertion of jurisdiction by this court over claims brought in response to its actions.id.at.
the plaintiffs do not allege that the four princes directed the september attacks or commanded an agent or authorized al qaeda to commit them.calder,at.affirming that court could exercise personal jurisdiction over primary participants in an alleged wrongdoing intentionally directed at a california resident emphasis added.rather,the plaintiffs rely on a causal chain to argue a concerted action theory of liability the princes supported muslim charities knowing that their money would be diverted to al qaeda,which then used the money to finance the september attacks.halberstam welch,distinguishing between civil conspiracy and liability under the common law of torts boim quranic literacy,cir defining extent to which charities alleged provision of material support to hamas constituted an act of international terrorism such that charities could be civilly liable for injuries caused by hamas.
even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent,or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states,that would be insufficient to ground the exercise of personal jurisdiction.see burger king,at.although it has been argued that foreseeability of causing injury in another state should be sufficient to establish such contacts there when policy considerations so require,the court has consistently held that this kind of foreseeability is not a sufficient benchmark for exercising personal jurisdiction.internal footnote omitted.rather,the plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the four princes engaged in intentional,and allegedly tortious,actions expressly aimed at residents of the united states.calder,at.
that burden is not satisfied by the allegation that the four princes intended to fund al qaeda through their donations to muslim charities.even assuming that the four princes were aware of osama bin laden public announcements of jihad against the united states and al qaeda attacks on the african embassies and cole,their contacts with the united states would remain far too attenuated to establish personal jurisdiction in american courts.it may be the case that acts of violence committed against residents of the united states were a foreseeable consequence of the princes alleged indirect funding of al qaeda,but foreseeability is not the standard for recognizing personal jurisdiction.rather,the plaintiffs must establish that the four princes expressly aimed intentional tortious acts at residents of the united states.calder,at.providing indirect funding to an organization that was openly hostile to the united states does not constitute this type of intentional conduct.in the absence of such a showing,american courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the four princes.
it is alleged that in his capacity as an executive of various private banks,prince mohamed knowingly and intentionally provided material support to terrorists who,in turn,planned to attack the united states.the allegations are as follows.
until,mohamed served as the chairman and ceo of dmi,a bank headquartered in switzerland with operations throughout the world.dmi has actively sponsored and supported the al qa e da movement through several of its subsidiaries,including but not limited to the islamic investment company of the gulf,the faisal islamic bank of bahrain,faisal finance,tadamon islamic bank,and al shamal islamic bank.dmi and its subsidiaries conform to sharia,the principle under islamic law that prohibits the earning or payment of interest.the plaintiffs ask the court to draw a reasonable inference that because of sharia,there exists an active,not passive,relationship among an islamic bank,its owners,and its large depositors.in other words,the owners of dmi and its subsidiaries are close business partners with bank customers in a partnership or collaboration to manage and invest customers capital in a mutually beneficial way.osama bin laden,his bodyguard,and other al qaeda operatives had deposits with dmi and its subsidiaries.also,bin laden himself invested million in one of dmi subsidiaries.therefore,argue the plaintiffs,the september attacks were a direct result of the material support that prince mohamed provided al qaeda.
mohamed disputes this characterization of sharia banking but even assuming its accuracy,it does not reflect that mohamed engaged in intentional conduct expressly aimed at the united states.calder,at.it may be that,but for access to financial institutions,al qaeda could not have funded its terrorist atta
