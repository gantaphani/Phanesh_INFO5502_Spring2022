the questions presented are whether the district court erred in exercising jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims,pursuant to u.b and whether the district court properly declined to abstain from exercising that jurisdiction,pursuant to c.this appeal is taken from judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,and challenges rulings made by that court and by the united states district court for the northern district of illinois castillo.the contested rulings include two orders dated february,and february,finding federal jurisdiction in the present cases and declining to abstain from exercising that jurisdiction.we conclude that jurisdiction was proper,but remand to allow the district to consider,in light of this opinion,whether abstention is mandatory.
background 
these cases arise from the financial collapse of parmalat finanziaria,and many of its subsidiaries.corporations are now in the midst of bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings in italy.italy minister of finance appointed enrico bondi,here the,to serve as extraordinary commissioner of these bankruptcy proceedings in a role analogous to a chapter trustee.parmalat capital finance limited pcfl,a parmalat subsidiary headquartered in the grand caymans,is likewise insolvent and currently in liquidation proceedings.these liquidation proceedings are ongoing in the grand caymans and are overseen by joint official liquidators appointed by the grand court of the cayman islands.
in january and june respectively,pcfl and bondi commenced separate proceedings pursuant to former in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.section permitted pcfl and bondi,as representatives of the foreign bankruptcy estates,to commence bankruptcy cases in the united states in order to enjoin litigation against pcfl and parmalat in united states courts section also empowered pcfl and bondi to seek orders from the bankruptcy court regarding turnover of property in the united states belonging to the respective bankruptcy estates.
meanwhile,purchasers of parmalat debt and equity securities filed class action lawsuits against parmalat and others for securities fraud.those cases were consolidated before judge kaplan in the united states district court.
in august,bondi filed suit in illinois state court against grant thornton international and grant thornton llp collectively,grant thornton.bondi alleges claims against grant thornton arising under illinois state law for professional malpractice,fraud,aiding and abetting fraud and constructive fraud,negligent misrepresentation,aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,theft and diversion of corporate assets,conversion,unjust enrichment,aiding and abetting fraudulent transfer,deepening insolvency,and unlawful civil conspiracy.on september,grant thornton removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on the basis of b and.in its notice of removal,grant thornton argued,among other things,that removal was proper because the illinois state law case was related to bondi proceedings in the southern district of new york.the next day,bondi filed a motion to remand to state court.bondi argued therein that there was no federal jurisdiction over the case and,in any event,the court should abstain pursuant to c.
on december,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred bondi action against grant thornton to judge kaplan in the southern district of new york.on february,judge kaplan denied bondi motion to remand to state court.the district court found that it had jurisdiction pursuant to b and that abstention was not mandatory the district court reasoned that bondi failed to file a motion for abstention and,in the alternative,bondi failed to demonstrate that his claims could be timely adjudicated in illinois state court.c.
in december,pcfl likewise filed suit against grant thornton in illinois state court alleging similar claims to those asserted by bondi.on january,grant thornton removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on the basis of b and.in its notice of removal,grant thornton argued,as in the bondi case,that removal was appropriate because the state law claims were related to pcfl proceeding.on january,pcfl filed a motion titled parmalat capital finance limited motion to abstain and remand.like bondi,pcfl argued that there was no federal jurisdiction over its case and that abstention was mandatory pursuant to c by short order on february,the northern district of illinois denied pcfl motion,noting that it fully adopt ed the reasoning of the southern district of new york february,order denying bondi remand motion.the case was then transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york for consolidation with bondi case.
following discovery,the district court entertained a series of motions to dismiss the complaints or to grant judgment in favor of defendants.ultimately,the court resolved the cases in final judgments for defendants,dismissing the matters on grounds not relevant here.see in re parmalat sec,d.
appellants filed this timely appeal.this opinion focuses on the february,and february,orders to determine whether the district courts correctly determined that those courts had jurisdiction and were not required to abstain pursuant to c.although appellants also raise other challenges relating to the summary judgment proceedings in the district court,we need not reach those claims.
ii.discussion 
bondi and pcfl challenge the lower federal courts exercise of jurisdiction on two grounds.first,bondi and pcfl contend that removal from illinois state court was improper because the illinois actions are based solely on state law claims and are not related to any bankruptcy cases in federal court.see b.second,bondi and pcfl contend that,even if removal was proper,the district courts were required to abstain pursuant to c,which provides that a district court shall abstain from hearing an applicable claim if an action is commenced,and can be timely adjudicated,in a state forum of appropriate jurisdiction.
we conclude that the cases were properly removed.as to the abstention question,the meaning of timely adjudicated is a matter of first impression in this circuit.our task here then is to set forth a standard for determining timely adjudication for the purposes of c.we hold that the district court employed the wrong standard.we therefore vacate the judgment on the abstention issue and remand to allow the district court to consider,in light of this decision,whether abstention is mandatory.
removal jurisdiction 
b provides that the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.b emphasis added.grant thornton removed the present actions from illinois state court as actions related to the proceedings in the southern district of new york pcfl and bondi press a novel argument they contend that removal was improper because proceedings are not cases within the meaning of the removal statute.in the alternative,they argue that the state law claims are not related to the proceedings.we disagree on both counts.
a section proceeding is a case 
one need not look far to find substantial support for grant thornton contention that a proceeding is a case within the context of the bankruptcy statute.the bankruptcy code repeatedly refers to proceedings as cases and section itself is titled cases ancillary to foreign proceedings.emphasis added.the bankruptcy code also defines petition as a petition filed under section,or of this title,as the case may be,commencing a case under this title.emphasis added.the statutory language is clear a proceeding is a case for the purposes of subject matter jurisdiction under b.
state law claims may be related to a section proceeding 
for the purposes of removal jurisdiction,a civil proceeding is related to a title case if the action outcome might have any conceivable effect on the bankrupt estate.in re cuyahoga equip,cir.in the illinois state law actions at issue here,bo
