appeal from a july,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge granting michael brown motion to certify a new york plaintiff class the city plaintiff class for damages pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,consisting of persons who have been or will be arrested,summonsed,or prosecuted under new york penal law,a new york state statute previously declared unconstitutional by this court to certify a statewide plaintiff class the state plaintiff class for injunctive relief pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,also consisting of individuals against whom this statute has been or will be enforced and to certify a statewide defendant class the state defendant class pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,consisting of all new york state political subdivisions and law enforcement and prosecutorial officials with authority to arrest,charge or prosecute under this statute.the defendants argue both that certification of defendant classes is not ordinarily permitted under rule b and,particularly,that none of the certified classes in this action meet the requirements of rule.
we decline to revisit our holding in marcera chinlund,cir,vacated on other grounds sub nom.lombard marcera,that rule b permits certification of a defendant class where a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief against a class of local public officials,at,even though,the judgment having been vacated,the decision in marcera is not binding on us.with respect to whether class certification was appropriate under rule,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in certifying the state plaintiff and defendant classes under rule b,but we affirm the district court certification of the city plaintiff class pursuant to rule b.accordingly,we vacate the portion of the district court order certifying the rule b state plaintiff and defendant classes and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
allegations 
plaintiff michael brown brings this putative class action against new york city police commissioner raymond kelly,the city of new york,the bronx county district attorney,individual new york city police officers and supervisors,and individual district attorney office personnel in new york city the city defendants,and a putative defendant class of statewide political subdivisions and law enforcement and prosecutorial state defendant that the defendants have unlawfully continued to arrest,summons,and prosecute individuals such as brown pursuant to new york penal law,a statute that was declared unconstitutional by this court in.see loper city police dep t,cir 
new york penal law addresses loitering for the purpose of begging,and provides that a person is guilty of loitering when he l oiters,remains or wanders about in a public place for the purpose of begging.penal law.in loper,we held that section violates the first amendment and therefore affirmed a district court order permanently enjoining the city of new york from enforcing the statute.see at.brown alleges that he was nonetheless arrested and prosecuted under section in and that section has continued to be enforced both within new york city and elsewhere throughout new york state after,and despite,this court decision in loper.he therefore asserts claims of false arrest,false imprisonment,and malicious prosecution in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments inhibition of class members free speech activities in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments violation of class members due process rights under the fourteenth amendment and violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the complaint seeks injunctive relief against the state defendant class,including an order directing the members of the state defendant class to cease enforcement of the statute and an order mandating various remedial measures including training,the establishment of an arrest tracking system,disgorgement of fines,expungement of convictions,vacating of warrants,and the issuance of new policies.it also seeks a declaratory judgment that the state defendant class has committed the violations of law alleged in this action.finally,the complaint seeks damages against the named city defendants on behalf of the city plaintiff class.
litigation history 
on june,former plaintiff eddie wise instituted this action by obtaining an order to show cause and temporary restraining order against the new york city and state defendants for unlawfully enforcing section.on multiple occasions from through june,uniformed police officers allegedly wrongfully arrested wise for begging peacefully on the streets of the bronx.wise was charged with loitering in violation of section and prosecuted for this offense by the bronx county district attorney office.
soon thereafter,the city defendants entered into a stipulation in which they agreed to take steps aimed at preventing future enforcement of the statute.the district court so ordered that stipulation on june.pursuant to the order,the city defendants were to notify various city officials and employees that section had been declared unconstitutional,which they did.the order further provided that the city and its employees shall cease enforcement of section.
in january,wise settled his claims with the new york state defendants,including the office of court administration oca the city defendants were left as the only remaining defendants in that action.
on november,wise accepted the city defendants offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,subsequent to which a judgment was entered dismissing all of his claims.prior to this dismissal,wise had requested and received leave to amend his complaint to add brown as a plaintiff and plaintiff class representative.accordingly,although wise was dismissed from the litigation as a plaintiff,the class action was permitted to continue with brown as the lead plaintiff and class representative.
in march,brown,now the class representative,moved to hold the city defendants in contempt for their alleged failure to comply with the district court june order to cease enforcement of section.in an order dated may,the district court denied the motion,citing improvements in the city compliance subsequent to december and concluding that holding the city in contempt would not have the desired effect of halting the issuance of further summonses by patrolling officers.brown kelly,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at may.the district court found,however,that notwithstanding an order of this court dated june,which directed defendants once and for all to cease enforcing the statute,enforcement continues to this day,wl,at,dist.lexis,at 
earlier,on february,brown had moved for class certification and for leave to amend the complaint.he sought to have the following classes certified a rule b plaintiff class consisting of all persons who have been or will be arrested,charged or prosecuted for violating section in the state of new york from october,onward a rule b plaintiff subclass of all persons who have been or will be arrested,charged or prosecuted by employees,agents or representatives of new york city for violating section from october,onward and a rule b defendant class of all political and all law officials in the state of new york with authority to arrest,charge or prosecute a person with a violation under new york penal law.the corresponding proposed amended complaint sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against all defendant class members,compensatory damages against all the named city defendants,and punitive damages against all named city defendants except the city of new york.
the state and city plaintiff classes were to be represented by brown and six other plaintiffs who were added to the proposed amended complaint.these class representatives were all either issued summons or arrested and charged under section in the bronx or manhattan.the state defendant class was to be represented by the city of new york,new york city police commissioner raymond kelly,and bronx county district attorney robert johnson the defendant class representatives.in support of certification,brown pointed to uncontested evidence that from january,through march,members of the new york city police department issued section summonses at an average rate of one every other day.brown also cited oca data reflecting the fact that since there had been at least criminal prosecutions by district attorney offices charging violations of section in rockland,suffolk,erie,and nassau counties.
on july,the district court granted brown motion in its entirety.brown kelly.the court found,inter alia,that the state and city plaintiff classes met the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a because their injuries all derive from a unitary course of conduct by a single system an arrest and prosecution policy throughout new york state pursuant to section,which chilled their speech and facilitated the unlawful enforcement of an unconstitutional statute.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also found that the plaintiffs easily satisfy the numerosity requirement of rule a,id.at,and that the adequacy requirement was met because the named plaintiffs motives for pursuing this litigation are commensurate with those of all proposed class members,id.at.
the district court concluded that certification of the state plaintiff class was warranted pursuant to rule b because law enforcement agencies throughout new york state,including new york city,continued charging individuals with violating section after it was declared unconstitutional and the class action device is the most efficient and appropriate method for vindicating the rights of individuals throughout new york who were subject to an unlawful section charge.id.at.it also approved certification of the city plaintiff class pursuant to rule b,concluding that the common liability issues were so pronounced and pervasive that they overwhelmingly outweigh the more narrow inquiries that may be required to resolve a subset of claims.id.at.the court concluded that in light of the demographics of the proposed subclass,the class action device was not only superior to alternative methods of adjudication,but was the only method of adjudication.id.internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis in original.the court noted that certification would permit many class members who did not possess the resources to bring individual actions to vindicate their rights in unison and would avoid the burden and expense of duplicative lawsuits.id.at.
with respect to the proposed state defendant class,the district court concluded,inter alia,that in light of the fact that section has been held to be unconstitutional,the simple fact that it remains on the books and subject to statewide enforcement provides the requisite commonality.id.at.the court found typicality and adequacy based on the fact that all of the members of the state defendant class are officials of a single state and are charged with enforcing or uniformly acting in accordance with a state statute,or common rule or practice of application,which is alleged to be unconstitutional.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.the court decided that certification under rule b was appropriate because,inter alia,incidents of unlawful enforcement have occurred statewide,rendering injunctive relief appropriate.id.at.
on august,the city defendants filed a timely petition pursuant to rule f for leave to appeal to this court the district court order granting the motion for class certification.by order dated november,we granted the petition.
discussion 
standard of review 
a district court certification of a class under rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion,provided that,as here,the court applied the proper legal standards.in re initial pub.offering sec,cir in re ipo.this standard applies both to the district court ultimate decision on class certification and to its rulings as to the individual rule requirements.id.to the extent that the district court ruling on an individual rule requirement is supported by a finding of fact,that finding is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.id.at.to the extent such a ruling involves an issue of law,we review it de novo.id.at.
ii.standards for class certification 
class certification is governed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.to be certified,a putative class must first meet all four prerequisites set forth in rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy.teamsters local freight div.pension fund bombardier,cir teamsters.the numerosity requirement provides that the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a.the commonality requirement is met if there is a common question of law or fact shared by the class.a see also marisol giuliani,cir.typicality requires that the claims or defenses of the class representatives be typical of the claims or defenses of the class members.see.a.this requirement is satisfied when each class member claim arises from the same course of events,and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant liability.marisol,at internal quotation marks omitted.the commonality and typicality requirements often tend to merge into one another,so that similar considerations animate analysis of both.id.the adequacy requirement is that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.
not only must each of the requirements set forth in rule a be met,but certification of the class must also be deemed appropriate under one of the three subdivisions of rule b.the district court granted certification to the state plaintiff and defendant classes under rule b,and to the city plaintiff class under rule b.
under rule b,class certification is appropriate if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b.
under rule b,class certification is appropriate if the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and a class litigation is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.as a general matter,the rule b predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.in re nassau county strip search cases,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the matters pertinent to these findings include 
a the class members interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions 
b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members 
c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum and 
d the likely difficulties in managing a class action.
in evaluating a motion for class certification,the district court is required to make a definitive assessment of rule requirements,notwithstanding their overlap with merits issues,and must resolve material factual disputes relevant to each rule requirement.in re ipo,at.the rule requirements must be established by at least a preponderance of the evidence.teamsters,at.
iii.applicability of rule b to a defendant class 
the city defendants argue at the threshold that the district court erred in certifying a statewide defendant class because rule b does not authorize defendant classes.a panel of this court resolved that question in marcera chinlund,cir,vacated on other grounds sub nom.lombard marcera.relying on lee washington,per curiam,we concluded that rule b is an appropriate vehicle for injunctive relief against a class of local public officials.marcera,at.the city defendants conceded during oral argument before us that a panel of this court should not revisit marcera holding.we agree.
because the supreme court vacated our decision in marcera,it is not technically binding on us.see donaldson,of necessity our decision vacating the judgment of the court of appeals deprives that court opinion of precedential effect,leaving this court opinion and judgment as the sole law of the case.russman bd.of educ.of the enlarged city sch.dist.of the city of watervliet,cir noting in dicta that w hen imposed by the supreme court,vacatur eliminates an appellate precedent that would otherwise control decision on a contested question throughout the circuit durning citibank,cir a decision may be reversed on other grounds,but a decision that has been vacated has no precedential authority whatsoever.emphasis in original.we nonetheless treat marcera as persuasive authority.
marcera addressed a difficult question of statutory interpretation.under rule b,a class action may be maintained if rule a is satisfied and if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b emphasis added the circuits are divided as to whether and under what circumstances this provision permits the certification of a defendant class the supreme court has not offered guidance on the matter.
the question whether defendant classes can be certified under rule b,and if so under what circumstances,does not admit of an easy answer.on the one hand,there is a strong textual argument that rule b does not countenance defendant classes because in a defendant class action,the party opposing the not be the party who has allegedly acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class.this argument is buttressed by the fact that the illustrative examples of rule b actions in the advisory committee notes to rule include no cases involving defendant classes.see.comm.of decisions.
on the other hand,as a commentator has pointed out,rule b can be read consistently with the certification of a bilateral plaintiff and defendant class permitting certification when the party defendant or defendant class opposing the plaintiff class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the plaintiff class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.newberg on class actions ed.this interpretation follows from rule general authorization of defendant classes,see.a stating that o ne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members emphasis added,and from rule b use of the phrase,the party opposing the class,rather than language explicitly limiting this provision to plaintiff classes.it also gains support from cases interpreting rule prior to the amendments that created rule b in its current form 
in lee,moreover,which we relied upon in marcera,the supreme court affirmed a district court certification of a bilateral class under the rule,see at,which,if considered for certification today,would most easily fit under rule b t he party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b.as described in the district court opinion in lee,the defendant class consisted of all county sheriffs and city and town wardens and jailers in the state of alabama,and the action sought to enjoin the state policy of segregating prisoners by race.washington lee.because the advisory committee notes to the amendments do not indicate an intention for the rule to limit the types of classes that were held permissible under the rule,lee provides support for interpreting rule b to permit the certification of defendant classes,at least in a bilateral class action seeking injunctive relief against a class of local public officials 
thus,we perceive strong arguments on both sides of the issue,particularly in the context of a bilateral class action challenging a governmental practice or policy.marcera resolved the question by concluding that although a literal reading of rule b might indicate otherwise,it is now settled that b is an appropriate vehicle for injunctive relief against a class of local public officials.at citing,inter alia,lee.although marcera analysis was limited,we conclude that it reflects a reasonable interpretation of rule b.marcera has been relied upon by lower courts in this circuit for some thirty years.see,mental disability law clinic hogan,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,monaco stone,deallaume.perales,see also marcera.chinlund,certifying a defendant class on remand after the supreme court vacated this court judgment in marcera consol.rail town of hyde park,cir citing marcera for the proposition that the rule a requirements apply equally to plaintiff and defendant classes.
we have no need to revisit,or to ask the court to revisit en banc,marcera holding here.inasmuch as we ultimately conclude that the state defendant class was,in any event,improperly certified here,we need not decide the vitality of marcera in order to resolve this appeal.we have offered these observations nonetheless because,were we of a contrary view as to the governing law regarding defendant class certification,we might well have decided this appeal on that basis,in light of the vigor with which the issue of marcera continued viability was contested before us,and because it may be of some assistance to district courts that continue to rely upon its holding.
iv.abuse of discretion in certifying rule b defendant class 
turning now to the merits of the district court decision to certify a rule b state defendant class in the instant case,we conclude that certification was inappropriate because the defendant class representatives do not meet the adequacy requirement of rule a and there is insufficient evidence that they meet the typicality requirement.
in order for a class representative to meet the adequacy requirement of rule a,the class members must not have interests that are antagonistic to one another.in re joint dist.asbestos,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant class representatives inadequately fill the role of class representatives because the action involves a host of legal and factual issues unique to them that are likely to distract from their representation of the class,and they possess weaker incentives to defend against the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs than do the remaining members of the state defendant class.
first,unlike the remainder of the state defendant class,the defendant class of whom are affiliated with new york city and among the named city subject to claims for damages,including in some cases punitive damages,as well as injunctive relief.such claims raise many issues that may well be central to their defense strategy,including whether new york city is liable for damages under monell dep t of social services,based on its alleged custom,policy and practice of unlawful enforcement of section whether any city officials have qualified or absolute immunity or face possible liability for punitive damages and whether new york city is collaterally estopped from contesting liability in light of its admissions as to instances of wrongful enforcement of section in prior proceedings.these issues,in which the remainder of the state defendant class do not share an interest,risk dominating the class representatives attention during litigation such that it will not be the case that by defend ing their own interests they will also be protecting the interests of the class.consol.rail,at baffa donaldson,lufkin jenrette sec,cir while it is settled that the mere existence of individualized factual questions with respect to the class representative claim will not bar class certification,class certification is inappropriate where a putative class representative is subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation.quoting gary plastic packaging merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
second,because new york city is already subject to existing court orders with respect to its continued enforcement of section,and has indeed recently been judged to be in contempt of court for violating them it would have little incentive to oppose or defend against injunctive relief that went no further than the injunctions presently in place.its interests are thus in tension with those of the remaining class members,against whom there are,to the best of our knowledge,no existing court orders.we therefore conclude that the defendant class representatives are not adequate representatives of the state defendant class.
typicality 
we also conclude that there is insufficient evidence that the defendant class representatives defenses are typical of those at the disposal of other members of the state defendant class.see in re ipo,at t he district judge must receive enough evidence,by affidavits,documents,or testimony,to be satisfied that each rule requirement has been met.the district court found that the typicality requirement was satisfied because the members of the state defendant class are all charged with enforcing or uniformly acting in accordance with a state statute,or common rule or practice of application,which is alleged to be unconstitutional.brown kelly,at internal quotation marks omitted.in the circumstances of this case,where we declared the statute at issue unconstitutional many years ago and where the plaintiffs seek relief that would require positive action by the state defendant class,the facts before the district court were insufficient to support a finding of typicality.
prosecutors and law enforcement agencies throughout new york state have discretion over whether to enforce applicable statutes.see people zimmer,describing the scope of prosecutorial discretion.here,it is uncontested that arrests and prosecutions under section continued in new york city after loper,persisting even after the district court order directing the city defendants to cease and desist enforcement.see brown kelly,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see also casale kelly,d,civ,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.by contrast,there was no evidence before the district court of which we are aware that the other state defendant class members had enforced the statute in substantial numbers or in any consistent manner.the only evidence relied upon by the district court in this regard was oca data that since there had been at least criminal prosecutions by district attorney offices charging violations of section in rockland,suffolk,erie,and nassau counties.this data did not set forth violations by county,however,nor did it address the practices in the more than fifty other counties included in the state defendant class.we therefore conclude that the district court was not free to decide,based on the limited information before it,that enforcement or the risk of enforcement of this unconstitutional statute was a statewide phenomenon 
the lack of a statewide practice of enforcement would be fatal to a finding of typicality under the circumstances of this case.the central issues facing the state defendant class are whether enforcement has persisted and what the scope of injunctive relief,if any,should be because it is uncontested that new york city continued regular enforcement of section even in the face of court orders,its possible defenses to the injunctive relief sought by brown are more limited than the defenses that other defendants might have.indeed,the scope of injunctive relief appropriate against state class defendants who have not enforced the statute,or who have done so only rarely,would likely be different from the scope of appropriate injunctive relief that could reasonably be imposed against the city defendants.under these circumstances,the defendant class representatives defenses are not typical 
the district court responded to these typicality concerns by requiring that state agencies be put on notice of the class action,and stating that if any wished to oppose a permanent injunction on individualized grounds,they may do so.see brown kelly,at.we think this to be inadequate.the state defendant class lacks typicality with respect to the central issues before the district court.the matter before us is therefore unlike instances in which we have permitted class certification with notice when the presumption of class cohesion falters in only a portion of the proceedings.robinson commuter,cir.to allow notice to class members to overcome the absence of a rule a prerequisite in this case would be to undermine rule deliberate balance between facilitating class actions and protecting the interests of absent class members.
for the reasons set forth above with respect to the adequacy and typicality requirements of rule a,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in certifying the state defendant class.we therefore vacate that portion of the district court order 
abuse of discretion in certifying rule b statewide plaintiff class 
turning to the district court certification of a state plaintiff class,we conclude that because brown sought certification of such a class only as part of a bilateral action seeking equitable relief against a statewide class of defendants,our rejection of the state defendant class is fatal to the certification of the counterpart state plaintiff class.
having rejected the certification of a state defendant class,we can certify a state plaintiff class only if the named defendants,all of whom are associated with new york city,have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the state plaintiff class,rendering injunctive relief appropriate with respect to that class as a whole.see.b.because the state plaintiff class is defined as plaintiffs who have been or will be arrested,charged,or prosecuted anywhere in new york state,this proposed class seems clearly to include members who are not at risk of injury by the city defendants.accordingly,injunctive relief against the city defendants is not appropriate with respect to the statewide class as a whole,and certification under rule b is improper.indeed,both brown and the district court recognized that the equitable relief sought in this action was possible only with the certification of both a statewide plaintiff and defendant class.see brown kelly,at certifying a plaintiff class under rule b because b ringing parties into this litigation via bilateral b class certification is the only way to achieve uniformity of equitable relief for past enforcement,and to effectively prevent any future enforcement across the state.
in light of our ruling that the state defendant class is an inappropriate defendant class,we conclude that certification of the state plaintiff class under rule b is also inappropriate.
vi.certification of rule b city plaintiff class 
the city defendants also challenge the district court certification of a city plaintiff class pursuant to rule b.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the city plaintiff class 
the city defendants argue that the city plaintiff class does not meet rule b requirement that the questions of law or fact common to the class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.we have said that t he predominance requirement is met if the plaintiff can establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof,and thus applicable to the class as a whole,predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.cordes.fin,edwards sons,cir internal quotation marks omitted,ellipsis in original.rule b encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.b comm.to amend.although a defense may arise and may affect different class members differently,this does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.in re visa antitrust,cir internal quotation marks omitted,overruled on other grounds by in re ipo,cir,and superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in attenborough const.and.laborers local.as long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together,variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically foreclose class certification under rule b.id.internal quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated.
the city defendants argue that rule b certification is inappropriate because the claims at issue in this case require individualized inquiries to establish liability.we acknowledge that the district court will be required to make individualized inquiries with respect to some of the plaintiffs and some of the claims.we conclude,however,that it was within the district court discretion to find that common issues predominated.
first,there are several common questions of law and fact that are shared by all of the plaintiffs and are central to the damages action against the city defendants.they are likely to include whether new york city has a policy of enforcing section,or whether the city failed to train officers and prosecutors that this statute was unconstitutional whether the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity whether defendant kelly had knowledge of the unlawful acts of his subordinates whether the individual defendants are liable for punitive damages whether the city defendants are estopped from arguing that they did not violate a plaintiff first amendment rights when they arrested,summonsed,or prosecuted him under section because the plaintiff was not actually engaged in begging and whether plaintiffs who were not engaged in begging but who were nonetheless arrested,summonsed,or prosecuted under section have a colorable claim under the first amendment because the enforcement of section deterred their speech.because these issues are likely to be central to all of the plaintiffs cases and could be dispositive to the resolution of some claims,the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the city plaintiff class.see in re agent orange prod.liab.litig.mdl,cir concluding that class certification of a plaintiff class in a mass tort action was justified under rule b because of the centrality of the defendants military contractor defense,despite few,if any,other common questions of law and the need for highly individualistic inquiries into causation.
second,the city plaintiff class members claims all arise from the same core allegation that the city defendants have continued to enforce section despite our holding that doing so violates the first amendment.as we have noted,where plaintiffs were allegedly aggrieved by a single policy of the defendants,and there is strong commonality of the violation and the harm,this is precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited.in re visa check,at see also in re nassau county strip search cases,at noting that because the predominance analysis tests whether the class is a sufficiently cohesive unit,all factual or legal issues that are common to the class inform the analysis internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the city defendants argue that the claims in the those for false individualized factual inquiries.with respect to false arrest,they point out that probable cause is an absolute defense,and that it is determined by the existence of probable cause for any crime at the time of the arrest.see jaegly couch,cir.the city defendants could thus defend an individual plaintiff false arrest claim by arguing that there was a legitimate reason for it beyond the loitering charge.
although we recognize that the city defendants may raise a probable cause defense outside the loitering charge to some of the plaintiffs claims,the fact that some defendants may have a probable cause defense in some cases does not render certification inappropriate in light of the common central issues in this action rule b requires that common questions predominate,not that the action include only common questions.
nor do we agree with the city defendants that the district court misapplied in re nassau county strip search cases.there,we decided that a district court had erred in concluding that common issues did not predominate in a case challenging a blanket policy.although some plaintiffs may have been searched based on reasonable suspicion,thereby creating a defense to liability with respect to those plaintiffs,we concluded that i n light of the pervasive character of the common liability issues and the admittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability issues,the district court erred by holding that individual liability issues predominated over common ones.id.at.
the city defendants argue that the district court erroneously relied upon in re nassau county strip search cases despite the fact that the individualized inquiries that will be required in this case are not de minimis.but we do not read the district court opinion to suggest that the city defendants probable cause defense affected only a de minimis portion of the plaintiffs.the court analysis centered instead on its view that despite the existence of individual issues in this action,the common issues were so pronounced and pervasive that they overwhelmingly outweigh the more narrow inquiries that may be required to resolve a subset of certain fourth amendment claims.brown kelly,at.this was not an abuse of discretion.
we think that the city defendants also overstate the scope of in re nassau county strip search cases.it does not stand for the proposition that any individualized liability issues must be de minimis in order for rule b class certification to be permissible.rather,we concluded that the district court acted outside of its discretion in denying class certification,in light of the fact that individualized liability issues were de minimis.because we are noticeably less deferential when the district court has denied class status than when it has certified a class,in re nassau county strip search cases,at internal quotation marks omitted,the decision does not establish the outer boundaries of the circumstances under which a district court may find that common issues predominate.indeed,the decision itself proffers a much broader standard for finding predominance a lthough a defense may arise and may affect different class members differently,this does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.id.quoting in re visa check,at.
with respect to the remaining claims in this action,the amount of individualized inquiry required varies significantly.for example,the complaint asserts a substantive due process claim based on the city defendants enforcement of an unconstitutional statute against the plaintiffs.although the city defendants argue that an individualized inquiry as to whether the actions against each plaintiff shock the conscience,see pena deprisco,cir,will be required,the same enforcement of a void statute in contravention of court orders shocks the judicial at issue for each plaintiff.other claims could also potentially require individualized inquiries,but only if the district court agrees with the defendants on common threshold legal questions.
the plaintiffs malicious prosecution claim is illustrative.the parties dispute whether the plaintiffs who were prosecuted under section must establish that the proceedings against them were terminated in their traditional element of a malicious prosecution light of the fact that the statute had already been declared void at the time of prosecution.singleton city of,cir holding that proceedings are terminated in favor of the accused for the purpose of a malicious prosecution claim only if their final disposition is such as to indicate the accused is not guilty internal quotation marks omitted.if the district court agrees with the plaintiffs that prosecution under section was necessarily malicious because the statute had already been declared void,and therefore that each plaintiff need not demonstrate that the proceedings were terminated in his or her favor,then every plaintiff who was prosecuted under section would have essentially the same malicious prosecution claim.even if the district court ultimately agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs must still establish termination in their favor,however,this threshold legal question is itself a common preliminary issue.
similarly,although the defendants argue that the district court must determine whether the plaintiffs were actually engaged in begging before finding that the enforcement of section
