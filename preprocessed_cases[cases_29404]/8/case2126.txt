marketspan corporation,now keyspan corporation keyspan,appeals from judge weinstein decision finding that it breached a class settlement agreement and awarding damages.see county of suffolk lilco,d county of suffolk lilco,corrected final order and judgment county of suffolk lilco,final order and amended judgment.
the district court ruled that keyspan predecessor for all purposes relevant to this appeal,the long island lighting company lilco,had violated a stipulation of partial settlement settlement of a rico class action and false claims suit.the settlement required that lilco pay million in the form of rate reductions to a class of electricity ratepayers.in the present proceeding,the class claimed that lilco violated the terms of the settlement because it paid million less in new york state utility taxes as a result of the reduction in the ratepayers electric bills pursuant to the settlement.in the class view,a rate reduction means a decrease in revenue to lilco net of utility taxes.the class therefore argued that the million in reduced taxes should have been added to the million in the form of further rate reductions.the district court agreed.we reverse.
background 
the history of this litigation has been extensively detailed in previous opinions of the district court and this court,familiarity with which is assumed.see,county of suffolk stone webster eng g,cir stone webster county of suffolk lilco,cir lilco,d at county of suffolk lilco,d county of suffolk lilco,wl,county of suffolk lilco,county of suffolk lilco,county of suffolk lilco.we therefore summarize only the facts relevant to the present appeal.
the underlying dispute arises from events that occurred as long ago as,when lilco announced plans to build a nuclear power plant at shoreham,long island.in,the county of suffolk,a group of individual ratepayers,and a business corporation filed a class action suit alleging that,beginning in,lilco falsely portrayed the status of construction at shoreham to the new york state public service commission psc,the agency with authority to approve applications for rate increases.the gravamen of the complaint,which asserted claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et.rico,and new york common law,was that lilco false representations caused the psc to grant the company unwarranted and excessive rate increases.see lilco,at.a class was certified in february,see stone webster,at,and later that month,the parties entered into the settlement,see lilco.at.
the settlement is a detailed,complex document.given the district court decision,we must quote much of that detail at length.paragraph a of the settlement provides 
lilco shall pay to the ratepayer class as hereinafter set forth in paragraphs,and,the sum of three hundred ninety million dollars in the form of i rate reductions,and ii payments to former ratepayers 
id.at.paragraph,which is titled the rate reduction plan,reads,in pertinent part 
subject to the provisions of paragraphs and of this stipulation,lilco shall pay rate reductions provided for in this stipulation as follows

e the rate reduction plan shall reduce rates to lilco ratepayers in proportion to the electric rate payments that would otherwise have been made by each ratepayer.the rate reduction plan shall be an adjustment to individual twelve monthly electric bills.lilco shall not seek any rate revenue which recovers any portion of the rate reduction plan.lilco will not attempt to obtain the sums listed above from its ratepayers.
f it is contemplated that each monthly bill will be reduced by a percentage calculated as the ratio of i the total dollar amount of the reduction to ratepayers for that year,divided by ii lilco anticipated revenue for that year as established in lilco rates filed before the psc 
g to assure compliance with this paragraph,lilco shall file appropriate tariffs with the psc showing the method of adjusting individual bills as described above.lilco also shall certify to the psc in each rate application filed within the settlement period,and to the district court and to class counsel and the government counsel in each a monitoring report filed hereunder,that lilco has not sought nor been provided with any rate revenue which recovers any portion of the rate reductions called for by this paragraph and that the rates lilco seeks do not attempt to obtain the sums of the reductions from lilco ratepayers 
h the above revenue reductions are the total amount that lilco shall guarantee payment for all purposes covered by this stipulation except attorneys fees,expenses and costs 
id.at.paragraph states,in relevant part 
class counsel and lilco agree that it is in the best interests of lilco ratepayers for lilco to return to financial health at the least cost to ratepayers.the district court will retain continuing jurisdiction over this settlement throughout the implementation of this stipulation and rate reduction plan to further the purposes to be served by this settlement.
the district court shall not enter any order which reduces or has the effect of reducing the total million dollar amount of rate reductions agreed to.
id.at.finally,paragraph provides 
in the event of any dispute or disagreement with respect to the meaning,effect,or interpretation of the stipulation or in the event of a claimed breach of the stipulation,the parties hereto agree that such dispute will be adjudicated only in the district court.the district court shall retain jurisdiction for the purposes,among other things,of administering this settlement and resolving any dispute hereunder and awarding plaintiffs counsel attorneys fees and reimbursing their expenses.
after the parties proposed the settlement,the district court ordered hearings to determine whether its terms were fair and reasonable,pursuant to fed civ.e notice of the hearings was provided to nearly one million lilco customers.four hearings were held,two in brooklyn,one in nassau county,and one in suffolk county.hundreds of people attended,and the court offered additional time for briefing.see lilco.at.in addition,an expert representing the class testified at the hearings that,based on his own studies and the studies performed by experts at the psc,the settlement was fair and reasonable.see id.at.experts also testified against the settlement.all of the expert testimony was subject to full.
the district court thereafter issued a lengthy opinion approving the settlement.see id.the district court determined that the amount lilco was required to pay under the million in rate reductions to the class plus approximately million to be paid toward a legal fee reasonable.see id.at.the court approved the million figure largely because it had been suggested by the psc,following the court request for advice from the psc as to the maximum payment that lilco could sustain without threatening investor confidence in lilco financial health.see id.we affirmed the district court approval of the settlement.see lilco,at.
over the course of the next eleven years,lilco,and keyspan as its successor,caused an aggregate reduction in the ratepayers monthly utility bills of slightly more than million,in accordance with the schedule set out in settlement d and the formula established in settlement f.see lilco,d at.however,reductions in lilco gross receipts from the reduced utility bills resulted in roughly million of tax savings to lilco in metropolitan transit authority and gross receipts taxes collectively grt.
the grt is imposed on utilities under new york law and is essentially based on the utilities gross earnings.see tax repealed tax amended tax repealed tax.the law establishing the grt states that it shall constitute a part of the operating costs of such utility.tax law.the psc must allow utilities to pass through reasonable operating expenses,like the grt assessment,in the rates charged to consumers.see,niagara mohawk power psc.utilities generally do this by imposing a revenue tax surcharge on consumers.see brooklyn union gas comm r of taxation,dep t.however,at all pertinent times new york law prohibited utilities from listing as a separate element on utility bills the portion representing the tax surcharge.see tax version the tax imposed by this section shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating costs of such utility.thus,ratepayers,before and after the settlement,received bills for electricity with totals that included,without mention,the grt.
of course,because the settlement required that lilco reduce its monthly bills,its gross earnings and revenue were also reduced,causing a reduction in the amount of grt owed by lilco and of any other tax based on income.in each of the years in which rate reductions took place,lilco,as required by settlement g,filed tariff amendments with the psc showing the calculation of the rate reduction according to the formula set out in settlement f.in the first two years,the grt was specifically included as a separate item in that calculation.
the settlement also established a citizens advisory panel cap to advise lilco and the public on relevant issues,including the mitigation of rate increases.see settlement.in,while reviewing the budget of the long island power authority lipa,which had taken over lilco,the cap discovered that reduced rates also reduced the grt surcharge on electric bills.appellees then moved in the district court for an order that lilco pay the class the amount it had saved in grt as a result of the settlement.
the district court granted the motion,holding that the settlement contained an express obligation that lilco alone was to assume the cost of the rate reductions.lilco,d at.the court concluded that the term rate reductions in the settlement was to be accorded its ordinary and common meaning,rather than the specialized industry meaning,id.at.in the court view,the ordinary meaning of rate reductions is a rate decrease exclusive of the grt,whereas the specialized meaning is a decrease inclusive of the grt.the district court further held that lilco failure to challenge the court stated understanding of the settlement in the cost of the settlement to lilco is approximately million dollars,id.at quoting lilco.at emphasis and brackets omitted rendered the court interpretation the law of the case.finally,the court granted the plaintiffs interest on the portion of the million that was deemed owed to the class earlier as well as in attorneys fees and for costs and disbursements,see settlement reasonable attorneys fees and litigation expenses to class counsel and all costs of notice,publication and administration of the settlement shall be allocated by the district court.see lilco,d at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
a language of the settlement 
each party claims that the plain language of the settlement dictates a disposition in its favor keyspan contends that the settlement expressly stated that the rate reductions were to be calculated in accordance with standard psc practice,which allows utilities to incorporate the grt into rates.appellees concede that the grt is paid by the utility and included in rates in the tariff meaning of that term.appellees brief at,county of suffolk lilco cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,they argue that the settlement imposed an obligation on lilco to bear a cost of million.they further argue that the ordinary meanings of rates and rate reductions support their view.the district court agreed.
although few persons are in a better position to understand the meaning of a consent decree than the district judge who oversaw and approved it,we review the district court interpretation of the settlement de novo.sec salomon,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted bouzo citibank,cir under new york law,whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law that we review de novo.however,we review a district court finding regarding the meaning of ambiguous terms for clear error,bearing in mind that where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.squibb sons,lloyd,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see lilco,at settlement,authorizing district court to resolve all disputes with regard to settlement meaning.
the parties do not dispute that new york law governs our interpretation of the settlement.see settlement.under new york law if a contract is unambiguous on its face,the parties rights under such a contract should be determined solely by the terms expressed in the instrument itself rather than from extrinsic evidence as to terms that were not expressed or judicial views as to what terms might be preferable.care travel pan am.world airways,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when one examines the document,appellees reliance on the supposedly ordinary meanings of rates and rate reductions seems beside the point because the very detailed terms of the settlement reveal the intended meaning beyond question.importantly,appellees do not dispute that new york law requires the psc to allow utilities to pass through the grt to consumers or that the psc established practice has always been to include the grt as an explicit element of an approved rate.given that practice,the meaning of the settlement is clear.
rates is not defined in the settlement but is given meaning in the definition of rate reductions.the settlement defines the rate reduction plan as lilco rate reductions and payments to former ratepayers provided for by paragraphs and of this stipulation.settlement jj.paragraphs and state,in relevant part,that lilco shall pay the ratepayer class a total of million in the form of rate reductions,id.a,and that the rate reduction plan shall reduce rates to lilco ratepayers in proportion to the electric rate payments that would otherwise have been made by each ratepayer,id.e.the settlement then goes on to provide a formula to calculate the rate reduction it is contemplated that each monthly bill will be reduced by a percentage calculated as the ratio of i the total dollar amount of the reduction to ratepayers for that year,divided by ii lilco anticipated revenue for that year as established in lilco rates filed before the psc.id.f.
with regard to this ratio,d specifies the exact total reduction to be implemented each year,beginning with million in the early years and ballooning to million by.the numerator of the ratio determining the monthly rate reduction is thus fixed by the settlement.the denominator is to be determined based on lilco anticipated revenue for that year as established in lilco rates filed before the psc.id.f.as noted,it is agreed that the rates filed by lilco and approved by the psc expressly include the grt,as they must under new york law.therefore,the settlement clearly defines rate reductions as the total amount reducing ratepayers monthly bills determined by a ratio with a numerator fixed by the settlement and a denominator to be calculated by filings with the psc that specifically include the grt as part of the rate.in short,to adopt the position taken by appellees and the district court would require us to hold that the calculation of rate reductions by the formula specified in settlement f actually violates the settlement.
the district court concluded otherwise based on settlement a statement that lilco shall pay the ratepayer class a total of million in the form of rate reductions.see lilco,d at.it viewed this language as a plain statement barring lilco from enjoying the tax savings resulting from that obligation.however,no such meaning can be attributed to that language.
first,the words in the form of rate reductions plainly incorporate the settlement detailed description of how rate reductions are to be calculated,and that calculation includ
