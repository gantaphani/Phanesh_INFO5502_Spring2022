the primary issue on the first of these two appeals,which were heard in tandem,is the narrow question of whether,in the circumstances of this case,an arbitration panel composed of three rabbis can proceed to make an award after one member has resigned from the panel.the second appeal concerns the validity of a court order enforcing a judgment that confirmed the panel earlier awards requiring accountings.these matters arise on an appeal in from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sandra townes,district judge vacating the panel arbitration awards and confirming eight accounting awards previously made by the full panel and an appeal in,from an order enforcing the district court judgment with respect to the accounting awards.we conclude that the arbitration panel was entitled to continue after one member resignation,that the accounting awards were properly confirmed,and that the enforcement order was properly entered.in,we reverse the district court judgment in part,affirm in part,and remand,and in,we affirm.
background 
facts.a somewhat detailed account of the facts is required.mayer zeiler zeiler and joseph deitsch,mordecai deitsch,jacob pinson,and rachel sandman collectively deitsch all belong to the deitsch family.zeiler resides in israel,and deitsch resides in the united states.they have jointly owned various assets in both the united states and israel.flocktex industries,industries,and achim deitsch textile industries are three israeli corporations that were jointly owned by zeiler and deitsch israeli companies.deitsch plastic,deitsch plastic partners,deitsch international sales,and annash,are corporations that were also owned jointly by zeiler and deitsch.defendants shalvah partnership,olde pointe associated limited partnership,atc partnership,esdee realty,orange investment,willowbrook venture,annash,and greendeer are real estate entities located in various states in the united states,which are owned jointly by zeiler and deitsch real estate.
in the late,zeiler and deitsch decided to sever much of their business relations by dividing the jointly owned assets between them.due to the complexity of the issues and the various disputes involved in making the division,the parties decided to submit their dispute to arbitration.they agreed that arbitration would occur before a beth din,which is a jewish religious tribunal comprising three rabbis.
the parties agreed to appoint the members of the beth din according to the method known in jewish law as zabla,in which each party elects one arbitrator,and the two appointed arbitrators then pick a third neutral arbitrator as the presiding member of the panel zeiler appointed rabbi moshe tendler,deitsch appointed rabbi moshe bogomilsky,and rabbis tendler and bogomilsky selected rabbi shmuel gurwitz as the presiding arbitrator.
after the appointment of the panel,the parties signed,on august,a formal arbitration concise,contract in traditional hebrew entitled arbitration deed arbitration agreement the arbitration agreement stated,in pertinent part,the willingness of the parties to seek resolution of all their disputes by a beth din consisting of rabbis tendler,bogomilsky,and gurwitz,who were to arbitrate the case according to jewish law.the arbitrators were authorized to enter interim and final awards and to reach decisions by vote of a majority of the members of the panel.
in september,following several arbitration sessions,the panel entered a framework decision in which it adopted the parties agreement to sever their commercial connections by granting zeiler full ownership of the israeli companies and deitsch full ownership of the companies,while retaining joint ownership of the real estate decision.the decision then set out a general plan according to which the dissolution of the partnership and the division of the assets would take place.the decision also required the parties to jointly shoulder,in relative shares,the tax obligations incurred by the and israeli companies until the end of and that zeiler should receive a full and accurate listing of the jointly owned real estate and additional information regarding his pension and insurance rights in the companies.finally,the beth din ordered that a detailed contract be prepared based on the principles set out in the decision.
from to the parties engaged in extensive negotiations in order to implement the decision.as various disputes arose along the way,the parties returned to the arbitration panel which in turn entered various detailed decisions.six such decisions,handed down between july and april,required,among other things,that deitsch provide zeiler with an accounting regarding the real estate entities,which are jointly owned by the parties but effectively controlled by deitsch the parties disagree as to whether all these orders,along with a similar provision in the decision and a subsequent order in february,regarding zeiler life insurance policies collectively,the accounting orders,were fully complied with as deitsch contends or not as zeiler contends.
in june,a comprehensive agreement entitled shares sales agreement was finally signed by the parties agreement.the agreement implemented the general guidelines of the decision and the subsequent orders of the arbitration panel.it specified the details of both parties obligations,which would lead to splitting the ownership of the israeli and,reciprocal transfers of funds,shares,and documents.among its many provisions,the agreement reiterated zeiler obligation to pay his relative share of tax obligations.the agreement also required deitsch to provide zeiler with documents regarding the real estate and zeiler pension and insurance rights in the companies.lastly,the agreement stated 
t his agreement shall be governed and construed pursuant to the torah law,and the beth din shall have exclusive jurisdiction in connection herewith.
beth din is defined in the agreement as 
a judicial tribunal governed by halachic law,the members of which are the honorable rabbi moshe tendler,rabbi shmuel gurwitz and rabbi moshe bogomilsky,or any other tribunal governed by halachic law upon which the parties mutually agree.
as the agreement was being implemented,another dispute arose between the parties,this time regarding the amount of zeiler share of the taxes paid by deitsch to the.in december deitsch filed with zeiler a reimbursement demand for of the taxes allegedly paid by deitsch,an amount of nearly.in april,zeiler sent a letter to the three arbitrators in which he contested deitsch demand on the basis of lack of credible documentation.five days later,and before the beth din considered this dispute,rabbi tendler,the arbitrator appointed by zeiler,resigned from the beth din.in two letters sent to rabbi gurwitz,rabbi tendler accused rabbi gurwitz of failing to compel deitsch to abide by the accounting orders,and claimed that rabbi bogomilsky the arbitrator appointed by deitsch was biased.
following rabbi tendler resignation,the two remaining arbitrators,rabbis gurwitz and bogomilsky,entered a decision on may,stating that under jewish law and in accordance with the arbitration agreement they retained authority over the arbitration.in a letter sent to an israeli rabbi,rabbis gurwitz and bogomilsky detailed the authorities in jewish law on which they had based their decision to retain jurisdiction.their reasoning was based primarily on the fact that the substantive share in the joint tax already been decided by the three arbitrators in,so the remaining dispute concerned only the amount of money to be paid under that liability.in addition,the arbitrators mentioned the arbitration agreement authorization to decide issues by a majority vote.rabbis gurwitz and bogomilsky then issued a letter to the parties scheduling a session of the arbitration panel to hear argument on the tax dispute.
in response,zeiler declared that because the panel had lost one of its members,the beth din,as previously constituted,no longer exists and it is for the parties to decide henceforth with regards to a newly constituted beth din.zeiler added that he would not appear before the panel.
rabbis gurwitz and bogomilsky denied zeiler objections and conducted the session,at which only deitsch appeared,presenting evidence regarding the amount of money he had paid in taxes and seeking reimbursement of zeiler share.on june,rabbis gurwitz and bogomilsky entered a decision ordering zeiler to pay deitsch share of the taxes that deitsch proved he had paid to the for earnings prior to the end of.the june,decision briefly considered the claims included in zeiler letter contesting the tax liability,but denied them.
the litigation.in august,zeiler and the israeli companies filed a petition in new york supreme court,which deitsch removed to the district court.zeiler asked the court to vacate the panel decisions of may,retaining jurisdiction,and june,imposing the nearly liability.zeiler also asked the court to confirm the eight accounting orders previously entered by the panel between and.in an almost symmetrical,deitsch and the companies sought confirmation of the june,award and vacation of the eight accounting orders.
on march,the district court entered a judgment granting all aspects of zeiler the may,and june,decisions and confirming the eight accounting orders.due to the varying nationalities of the parties and the locations of the assets involved,the court applied the standards for confirmation set by chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,which incorporated the terms of the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,convention.see zeiler deitsch,march.deitsch appeals both aspects of the district court judgment in.
after entry of the march,judgment,zeiler filed a motion with the district court to enforce the judgment that had confirmed the accounting orders.zeiler enforcement motion specifically asked the court to order deitsch to provide zeiler with an accounting for the years to the present within ten days for the real estate.on october,judge townes granted in all respects zeiler motion to enforce the accounting orders.an order to that effect was entered on november.
in december,this court granted deitsch motion for a stay of the district court enforcement order.see zeiler deitsch,cir.deitsch then filed a second notice of appeal,this time appealing the district court enforcement order of november.deitsch claims that the enforcement decision has broadened the scope of his accounting obligations,compared to the language of the eight accounting orders entered by the arbitration panel and previously confirmed by the district court.we consider this second appeal,along with the appeal from the court march,judgment.

the facts of the case support the district court assumption that,even though the arbitration took place in new york,it should be considered a arbitration for the purposes of the faa,and therefore covered by the convention.some of the assets that were the subject of the arbitration are located in israel,and some of the parties reside there.the law chosen to govern the arbitration is based on a foreign system.the commercial transactions decided in the arbitration have a clear international character.see convention,art.i the convention applies to arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the state where their recognition and enforcement are sought.an agreement or award arising out of a commercial relationship which is entirely between citizens of the united states shall be deemed not to fall under the convention unless that relationship involves property located abroad,envisages performance or enforcement abroad,or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.bergesen joseph muller,cir both the convention and section authorize united states courts to enforce under the convention awards entered in the united states yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,toys r us,cir awards become subject to the convention not because made abroad,but because made within the legal framework of another country,pronounced in accordance with foreign law or involving parties domiciled or having their principal place of business outside the enforcing jurisdiction quoting bergesen,at.
judicial confirmation of the arbitration awards in the pending case is therefore initially governed by the provisions of chapter of the faa,and by the convention,as incorporated in the faa.however,since the arbitration took place in the united states,the awards entered by the beth din are at the same time subject to the faa provisions governing domestic arbitration awards.see convention,art.v e yusuf,at sole resort,de allure resorts management,llc,cir jacada,international marketing strategies,cir.it appears that the district court did not consider the import of the faa domestic provisions,instead applying solely the convention grounds of review.however,as will be discussed in more detail below,we conclude that such an additional analysis would have had no practical effect on the matters before us.
the power of a district court to confirm a arbitration award under the convention is stated in 
within three years after an arbitral award falling under the convention is made,any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration.the court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.
article v of the convention stipulates the bases for denying confirmation of an arbitral award.it reads,in relevant part 
recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked,only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought,proof that 
d the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties,or,failing such agreement,was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place or 
e the award has not yet become binding on the parties,or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
applying these provisions,the district court ordered the two decisions entered by rabbis gurwitz and bogomilsky vacated,and confirmed the eight accounting orders entered by all three arbitrators prior to rabbi tendler resignation.we consider each of these decisions separately.
ii.composition of the arbitration panel 
the district court ruled that the agreement explicitly required that the arbitration panel consist of the three named rabbis and that the agreement did not authorize any two of them to continue the arbitration in the absence of the third.the court therefore granted zeiler petition to vacate the two decisions entered by only two members of the panel the court relied on convention,art.v d,which authorizes a court to refuse confirmation of an arbitration award if the award was entered by an arbitral authority whose composition was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties.
deitsch presents two main arguments for the confirmation of the june,award.first,he argues that the convention grants a district court discretion whether to confirm awards even if they fall within the scope of article second,he argues that contrary to the district court view,the arbitration agreements allow two arbitrators,when facing the unique circumstances that existed in this case,to retain jurisdiction over the arbitration and enter the june,award we need not consider the first argument because we agree with the second.
the authority of the two remaining arbitrators after the resignation of the third one is essentially an issue of contract interpretation,grounded in the language of the agreements between the parties.see volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior university,d t he federal policy under the faa is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.because the district court relied for its interpretation of the agreement on the contractual language itself,we review de novo its inference that the agreement could not be understood to foresee the possibility of a disposition in the unique circumstances of this case.see bellefonte reinsurance aetna casualty surety,cir the proper standard for appellate review of a pure textual construction by the district court,whatever the procedural posture of the case,is de novo.on this issue of interpretation we disagree with the district court.
article v d of the convention authorizes courts to deny confirmation of arbitration awards entered by a panel whose composition was not in accord with the parties agreement.applying this article,the district court focused its inspection on the agreement definition of beth din.because that definition specified the three named arbitrators,the court ruled that a panel composed of only two of those originally named was not the panel agreed upon.zeiler also argues that the only alternative under the agreement to the panel was any other tribunal governed by halachic law upon which the parties mutually agree.since the parties did not reach a new agreement as to the panel composition following rabbi tendler resignation,zeiler maintains that the award entered by the two remaining members was not in accordance with the parties agreement.
we conclude that the naming of the three rabbis in the agreement did not have the effect of precluding two members from continuing in the absence of a resigned member.since the agreement was executed after the three panel members had been identified,the more natural reading of the agreement is that the three members were named only to reflect the choices previously made by the parties and their designated members,not to state a limitation on the authority of the panel to continue in the unexpected event that one of the members might resign.doe pataki,cir recitation of terms of statutory provisions in agreement between state and private parties did not prohibit state from amending its statutes.
this conclusion is also consistent with the zabla method that the parties had employed in appointing the three arbitrators.although the parties did not explicitly mention zabla in either the arbitration agreement or the agreement,neither party disputes that this method was the basis for the appointment of the three named arbitrators.a natural implementation of the zabla method when a member designated by a party resigns would be that party appointment of a substitute.trade transport,natural petroleum charterers,cir in domestic arbitration,absent express agreement to that effect,full panel should not be removed due to the death of member replacement arbitrator should be designated.
reading the parties agreement to permit continuation of the panel in the event of a member resignation,with the opportunity of the relevant party to appoint a successor,is especially appropriate in the circumstances of this case.the panel had already decided the substantive issues between the two sides.all that remained was determination of the amount of tax liabilities in light of the prior determination of the allocation of those liabilities.to read the agreement to require the proceeding to be halted upon the resignation of one member at that late stage of the proceedings would enable bad faith manipulation of the arbitration process in an ongoing and complex arbitration,a party receiving unfavorable interim rulings would have an incentive to invite the member he designated to resign to forestall an anticipated ultimate defeat,or even,as in the pending case,after securing favorable rulings that are confirmable,to precipitate an arbitrator resignation in the hope of avoiding confirmation of a later unfavorable award.the agreement should not be read to countenance the waste of resources required to redo a protracted arbitration proceeding in the event that one member of a panel died or otherwise became unable to serve during the proceeding a more sensible reading of the agreement makes continuation of the remaining members of the panel with an opportunity for appointment of a replacement the default position,subject to an explicit agreement of the parties that only a panel with the three originally designated members still serving is authorized to render an award,albeit by a majority vote.
we note the parties agreement that the arbitration is to be governed by jewish law,an intricate set of norms culled from written and oral tradition and custom,as prescribed by widely accepted rabbinic authorities,but absent a singular authoritative code or a firm institutional structure.not surprisingly,we have not been referred to any authoritative precedent under that body of law,and,in view of our interpretation of the parties agreement,we need not rule definitively on what jewish law would say if the parties agreement did not resolve the pending issue.we would be surprised,however,should the issue arise,if jewish law would permit the opportunity for manipulation of the sort we have identified.
we also believe that zeiler reliance on the latter part of the definition of beth din in the agreement lacks merit.the words other tribunal signal that the parties did not intend this provision to apply to an instance such as the one before us,in which the original panel,although lacking one member,remains.rather,the parties power to mutually agree on some other tribunal contemplates the possibility of creating a wholly distinct mechanism of dispute resolution,in case the parties choose to abandon the original beth din.
because we believe the panel was entitled to continue after rabbi tendler resignation,we conclude that the awards were confirmable and therefore reverse.
iii.confirmation of the accounting orders 
the district court confirmed,as a group,eight orders entered by the arbitration panel over the course of about four years,requiring deitsch to provide zeiler with accounting of the joint real estate,beginning in,as well as documents regarding zeiler pension and insurance rights in the companies.deitsch contends that the eight orders could not be confirmed because they were not final awards and because,even as interim awards,they were already satisfied.we disagree with both contentions and therefore affirm the district court confirmation of the accounting orders 
a finality of the orders.deitsch views the eight accounting orders as interim discovery rulings that were all intended to facilitate a subsequent final resolution of the substantive commercial disputes between the parties,and should therefore be regarded as and.zeiler,on the other hand,stresses the independent nature of deitsch accounting obligations and the separate value he attributes to receiving information about assets that are and will remain in joint ownership of both parties.
we agree with zeiler that all of the accounting orders are final orders requiring accounting and transfer of documents.the decisions require specific action and do not serve as a preparation or a basis for further decisions by the arbitrators.they have finally and conclusively disposed of a separate and independent claim and therefore may be confirmed although they do not dispose of all the claims that were submitted to arbitration.metallgesellschaft capitan constante,cir see also sperry international trade,government of israel,aff,cir 
the confirmable nature of the various accounting orders stems from the unique character of this arb
