donna mcgullam appeals pro se from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york hurley,granting summary judgment on federal and state law claims of a sexually hostile work environment,disparate treatment,and retaliation in favor of mcgullam employer,cedar graphics.regarding the title vii hostile work environment claim to which this appeal is limited,we affirm on the ground that the one comment that may fall within the limitations period which was made nearly one year after cedar graphics had transferred mcgullam to another department is insufficiently related to the earlier course of alleged harassment.the governing authority is national railroad passenger corporation morgan.
background 
for reasons explained later in this opinion,mcgullam was required to file a complaint with the appropriate agency within days of the last instance in a course of harassment and if she did,that filing would have allowed her to plead the full prior course of related harassment.
the relevant chronology is that in april,mcgullam was hired by cedar graphics,a printing company,to work in the production department.on september,after she complained of sexual harassment and at her request,she was transferred to a position in the estimating department.she was terminated on september,and she filed her complaint with the relevant agencies on july.
mcgullam alleges that when she was in the production department she was regularly exposed to sexual comments,sexually explicit matters,sexual jokes,hostile and vulgar language,sexual innuendos and gross behaviors,primarily by male coworkers,including management despite c ontinual complaints to management.according to mcgullam unsworn journal submitted by mcgullam in the district court and accepted as true by cedar graphics for purposes of the summary judgment motion,this offensive production department conduct included,but is not limited to,the following 
on the first day of mcgullam employment,april,she was asked to retrieve a file by climbing a ladder and the male holding the ladder told her not to worry,that he was going to look up her skirt.
in winter,mcgullam brought several packages to the shipping department late one evening and a male commented in part that i did think you could even drag your big fat ass back here.
in november,a male in whom mcgullam had confided about a romantic break up,attacked her in front of the entire production department by stating i think you be a lot happier person if you got f d more often.yeah,i think that definitely your problem,you do get f d enough.
in july,a male sitting at his desk with both arms outstretched toward mcgullam and one hand shaped into a gun stated i like to pump a bullet into your head,right behind your ear and blow your brains out.
in summer,mcgullam had to endure overhearing the details of a conversation in which a female told two male that she witnessed an act of doggie style sex in the bathroom of a nightclub the previous weekend.
on an unknown date,a male commented boing,boing,look at through the denim,a reference to the fact that mcgullam hardened nipples were visible even through her denim jumper.
on an unknown date,an unknown person replaced a sign mcgullam had taped to her computer that read a lot goes into being the best,with a similar sign that read a lot goes in to being the bitch.
mcgullam journal explains that she was desperate to remove herself from the production department and therefore requested transfer to an open position in the estimating department,which was on the other side of the far enough away from the hostility,harassment and threats of violence.as mcgullam explained at her deposition,she mov ed because she could not take working in this sexually aggressive and hostile environment where she was eventually physically threatened by a colleague.
mcgullam complains of only a single incident her september,transfer 
while working in the estimating department,i was away from the majority of the harassment,hostility and aggravation.however,all comments of a sexual and derogatory nature did not cease entirely.on the opposite side of my cubic le wall was a salesman who carried on numerous lengthy conversations with male buddies and made frequent comments about women such as referring to them as chickies.he also remarked that i f it was going to be a,she was worth the trip,regarding a woman friend that he was involved with translating to she only worth the trip if i be getting sex.this was a thoroughly demeaning comment regarding women.
the salesman who offended mcgullam by the chickies comments and the comment was not a member of the production department or of the estimating department.
on september,cedar graphics terminated mcgullam employment.on july,mcgullam filed a complaint with the new york state division of human rights the nysdhr and the united states equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc alleging a sexually hostile work environment and retaliatory termination.on february,the nysdhr issued a determination and order after investigation finding no probable cause and dismissing mcgullam complaint.on april,the eeoc adopted the findings of the nysdhr,dismissed mcgullam complaint,and issued a letter,which mcgullam received on april.
on july,mcgullam pro se filed this lawsuit,alleging that she was discriminated against on the basis of sex in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et title vii the relevant text is in the.this appeal considers mcgullam claim of a s exually h ostile e nvironment that was pervasive.the disposition of her other claims is set forth in the margin 
on december,cedar graphics moved for summary judgment,duly attaching a notice to pro se litigant opposing motion for summary judgment.mcgullam failed to file any opposition.on august,the district court granted summary judgment on the title vii hostile work environment claim and entered final judgment in favor of cedar graphics.the district court determined that i the hostile work environment claim was,and ii in the alternative,mcgullam failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the severity or pervasiveness of the conduct.mcgullam cedar graphics,drh akt,wl,at.on september,mcgullam timely filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
we review an award of summary judgment de novo,and will uphold the judgment if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom it is entered,demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the judgment is warranted as a matter of law.global network commc ns,city of new york,cir see also.teddy bear beargram,cir applying the same standard of review to the grant of an unopposed motion for summary judgment.c.following de novo review,we affirm the grant of summary judgment,but do so on a ground different from either of the two alternative grounds relied on by the district court.see,boy scouts of america wyman,cir w e may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground appearing in the record.
relevant to this appeal,title vii administrative exhaustion provision requires that any complaint be filed with the eeoc within days of the alleged discriminatory act.see e providing that where a complainant has initially instituted proceedings with a state or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief,the complainant has days from the occurrence of the alleged unlawful employment practice to file a complaint with the eeoc.
when,as in this case,a plaintiff allegations of discrimination extend beyond the limitations period,the nature of the claim determines what consideration will be given to the earlier conduct.petrosino bell,cir.with respect to claims based on termination,failure to promote,denial of transfer,or refusal to hire,morgan,at,section e precludes recovery for discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation that occur outside the statutory time period,even if other acts of discrimination occurred within the statutory time period,patterson county of oneida,cir quoting morgan,at.
but h ostile work environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts.their very nature involves repeated conduct.the unlawful employment practice therefore can not be said to occur on any particular day.it occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and,in direct contrast to discrete acts,a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own.morgan,u.at internal citation omitted.accordingly,consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim,including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period,is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability,so long as an act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.id.at see also id.at given that the incidents constituting a hostile work environment are part of one unlawful employment practice,the employer may be liable for all acts that are part of this single claim.in order for the charge to be timely,the employee need only file a charge within days of any act that is part of the hostile work environment.morgan illustrated this holding with two scenarios 
acts on days create a hostile work environment.the employee files the charge on day.can the employee recover for that part of the hostile work environment that occurred in the first days acts contribute to a hostile environment on days and on day,but there are no acts between days.can the act occurring on day pull the other acts in for the purposes of liability in truth,all other things being equal,there is little difference between the two scenarios as a hostile environment constitutes one unlawful employment practice and it does not matter whether nothing occurred within the intervening days so long as each act is part of the whole.nor,if sufficient activity occurred by day to make out a claim,does it matter that the employee knows on that day that an actionable claim happened on day all incidents are still part of the same claim.on the other hand,if an act on day had no relation to the acts between days,or for some other reason,such as certain intervening action by the employer,was no longer part of the same hostile environment claim,then the employee can not recover for the previous acts,at least not by reference to the day act.
id.at.accordingly,if any act falls within the statutory time period,we need to determine whether the acts about which an employee complains are part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice.id.at.
we start by asking whether mcgullam alleged any discriminatory act within the limitations period.
mcgullam filed her complaint with the sent the complaint to the eeoc for dual filing july.the limitations period therefore started on september,days prior to july.cedar graphics terminated mcgullam employment on september.accordingly,unless a discriminatory act contributing to her hostile work environment claim fell within the the start of the limitations period on september,and the termination of her employment on september,claim is.
the only conduct complained of after mcgullam september,transfer to the estimating therefore the only alleged discriminatory acts that could fall within the the chickies comments and the comment.as alleged,the chickies comments are too trivial to contribute to a title vii hostile work environment claim.they were not obscene or lewd,or even sexually suggestive.even if the chickies comments could be deemed unrefined or uncivil,title vii simply does not set forth a general civility code for the american workplace.burlington santa fe ry.white,internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore focus exclusively on the timing of the comment.
mcgullam nowhere dates that single incident.then again,the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,and the defendant has not tried to find out whether mcgullam can date the incident.mcgullam submissions arguably allege that the comment was made within the window see terry ashcroft,cir in determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact,we are required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.internal quotation marks omitted.in any event,the district court assumed that the comment occurred within the limitations period,and cedar graphics does not argue to the contrary on appeal.
was the comment sufficiently related to the production department conduct to be part of the same alleged hostile work environment practice 
under morgan,a sexually offensive incident within the limitations period permits consideration of an incident preceding the limitations period only if the incidents are sufficiently related.i t does not matter whether nothing occurred within the intervening days so long as each act is part of the whole.morgan,at.
the district court relatedness test was to consider whether the period incident satisfied the severe or pervasive standard of a hostile work environment claim.see harris forklift,determining that to establish a title vii hostile work environment claim,a plaintiff must show that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment internal quotation marks and citation omitted.cedar graphics urges us to use the same test.however,this approach finds no support in morgan,which emphasized that the repeated conduct giving rise to a hostile work environment claim occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and that a component act need not be actionable on its own.morgan,at.we instead affirm using a different analysis.
morgan requires courts to make an individualized assessment of whether incidents and episodes are related.morgan discussion of the scenarios does not limit the relevant criteria,or set out factors or prongs.see morgan,at i f an act on day had no relation to the acts between days,or for some other reason,such as certain intervening action by the employer,was no longer part of the same hostile environment claim,then the employee can not recover for the previous acts,at least not by reference to the day act.
this flexibility is useful in a context as and sensitive as employment discrimination and as amorphous as hostile work environment.morgan determined that a lthough many of the acts upon which the plaintiff claim depends occurred outside the day filing period,we can not say they are not part of the same actionable hostile environment claim based on evidence from a number of employees that managers made racial jokes,performed racially derogatory acts,made negative comments regarding the capacity of blacks to be supervisors,and used various racial epithets.id.at see also rowe hussmann,cir where it was the same harasser committing the same harassing acts,concluding as a matter of law that the acts before and after the limitations period were so similar in nature,frequency,and severity that they must be considered to be part and parcel of the hostile work environment lucas chi.transit,cir finding that an altercation in arising out of a chance meeting between an employee and a former supervisor simply can not be considered part of any hostile work environment where there were no incidents during the intervening years.
in this case,the comment is insufficiently related to the production department conduct chiefly for two reasons.first,cedar graphics transferred mcgullam at her request from the production department,where she experienced harassment,to the estimating department,which was a different environment in material in a different sector of the building.see morgan,at recognizing the importance of an intervening action by the employer.mcgullam testified at her deposition that she had no problem with anyone in the estimating department.
second,the comment had no relation to the production department harassment.id.in the production department mcgullam encountered lewd and teasing comments that were about mcgullam,and that were addressed to her or were made in her presence.the though it may have not lewd,it was not about mcgullam,and it was not addressed to her or made for her to hear it.and the salesman she overheard was a member of neither the production department nor the estimating department.moreover,for the comment to fall within the limitations period,it must have occurred nearly one year after mcgullam transfer.although that interval does not preclude relatedness,it renders less plausible the notion that the comment is of a piece with the production department conduct.given these discontinuities,we have no trouble finding insufficient relatedness.
accordingly,the comment did not contribute to any hostile work environment claim based on the production department conduct and such a claim is therefore 
mcgullam claim nevertheless might survive summary judgment if there were a triable issue as to whether the sole incident occurring within the limitations period was itself of sufficient severity to support a hostile work environment claim albeit a truncated claim premised on that single incident.see,howley town of stratford,cir.
to repeat,a plaintiff seeking to establish a title vii hostile work environment claim must show that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this severe or pervasive standard has objective and subjective elements the misconduct shown must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,and the victim must also subjectively perceive that environment to be abusive.alfano costello,cir quoting harris,at.courts review the totality of the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris,at see also morgan,at explaining that an employee is not barred from using prior acts as background evidence in support of a timely claim fitzgerald henderson,cir a statute of limitations does not operate to bar the introduction of evidence that predates the commencement of the limitations period but that is relevant to events during the period.
mcgullam subjective perception notwithstanding,the comment objectively falls short of the requisite levels of severity or pervasiveness,alfano,overturning a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff because the evidence at conduct far more egregious than the comment in this insufficient as a matter of law to establish a sexually hostile work environment.
accordingly,the comment alone does not present a triable issue regarding mcgullam hostile work environment claim.
conclusion 
we have considered all of mcgullam contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is hereby affirmed.
i join the majority opinion because i agree with the result it reaches in this case and also with its reasoning as far as it goes.specifically,i concur with the majority opinion two principal holdings that the only discriminatory conduct that mcgullam alleges occurred within the limitations period,the comments she overheard by a salesman who referred to women as chickies,and who said of a female friend that she was worth the trip i f it was going to be a is insufficiently related to prior alleged discriminatory conduct to be considered part of the same unlawful employment practice under e and national railroad passenger morgan,and that the comments were neither sufficiently severe nor pervasive enough to establish liability under title vii.
i write separately,however,to explain my views on the relevance,for the purposes of proving a hostile work environment claim,of discriminatory incidents from outside the limitations period.first,in determining whether incidents and episodes are sufficiently related to constitute a single discriminatory employment practice under morgan,i would consider multiple the severity of earlier part of a totality of the circumstances analysis.the majority opinion implicitly identifies certain factors with which i agree,but my approach requires that i address additional issues that the majority does not consider.second,i believe that even where prior incidents are not part of the same discriminatory employment practice,and so are excluded by limitations requirements,they nevertheless may provide relevant background evidence to support a claim based on incidents that are within the limitations period.i discuss each issue in turn.
in morgan,the supreme court explained that hostile work environment claims by t heir very nature involve repeated conduct,where liability often is based on the cumulative effect of individual acts that are not independently actionable.at.in contrast then to discrete acts of discrimination,a hostile work environment is an unlawful employment practice that takes place over time,rather than on any particular day.id.an employer may be liable for all acts that are part of this single claim,provided that at least one act that is part of the hostile work environment took place within the applicable limitations period.id.at.a court task is to determine whether the acts about which an employee complains are part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice,and if so,whether any act falls within the statutory time period.id.at.
what constitutes the same actionable hostile work environment practice is,however,hardly.and the morgan court guidance on this question is limited.see mcginest gte serv,cir morgan itself does not offer precise guidance on how to evaluate whether an act that falls outside the statutory time period can nonetheless be considered for liability purposes.in providing illustrations to explain its the majority has quoted in full,see op.at suggested that later incidents will be considered distinct,if they have no relation to the earlier acts from outside the period,or if for some other reason,such as certain intervening action by the employer,the later acts are no longer part of the same hostile environment claim.at.in addition,morgan appeared to endorse the reasoning of the ninth circuit court of appeals that the pre and incidents were,in that case,part of the same violation because they involve d the same type of employment actions,occurred relatively frequently,and were perpetrated by the same managers.id.at quoting morgan passenger,cir see also vickers powell,indicating that the supreme court in morgan gave some direction for determining whether employee complaints are part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice by approving the lower court method.
from these tea leaves,circuit courts subsequently have attempted to explicitly,sometimes factors that should guide the morgan relatedness inquiry for its part,the majority opinion seeks to avoid setting forth general criteria in the interest of preserving flexibility for a context as and sensitive as employment discrimination and as amorphous as hostile work environment.op.at.even so,by specifying reasons as to why the comment in this case is insufficiently related to prior conduct that occurred while mcgullam worked in the production department at cedar graphics,the majority opinion does identify certain distinctions as material.specifically,in distinguishing between the pre and period incidents,the majority opinion highlights that they were separated by an intervening action by the voluntary so took place while mcgullam was working for different departments in different parts of the building that they were of a different nature,in that many of the period incidents involved lewd comments that were about mcgullam personally and were addressed to her or at least intended for her to hear,whereas the comments were not in the view of the majority opinion lewd and were not directed toward mcgullam and that they were separated by a significant amount of time.
i agree that all of these reasons given by the commonality of the environment in which the incidents took place and whether a change in environment is due to intervening action by the employer,the nature of the incidents,and the temporal discontinuity between the significantly relevant to assessing whether incidents are part of the same hostile environment claim.i also find helpful some factors that other circuits have attempted to glean from morgan.see supra note.it is,however,important to appreciate that these considerations are not exhaustive,and that none of them should be considered independently in deciding whether,in any given case,the connection necessary to establish a single hostile work environment exists.
temporal discontinuity,for instance,clearly does not by itself preclude a finding of relatedness under morgan,at,a point that the majority properly recognizes.see op.at.similarly,mcgullam transfer to a different department in a different sector of the building is not alone fatal to an argument that the conduct she experienced was part of a single hostile work environment.if,for example,a plaintiff provided evidence tending to show that an entire company,including multiple departments,was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,and that management knew of and tolerated this condition,that plaintiff would quite likely be able to establish that the harassment she endured while working in two different departments for that company was part of the same unlawful employment practice.see isaacs hill pet nutrition,cir concluding that the plaintiff had alleged a single hostile work environment claim notwithstanding her change in job resulted in her working under new leaders and in a different part of a packaging that the change in the identity of her harassers was not significant because her title vii claim was against management for failure to respond to her repeated complaints about her work environment,not against her 
i do not read the majority opinion as being to the contrary.and the fact that the majority opinion focuses on certain significantly salient differences,between the timely claims and the earlier incidents,to resolve this case need not be read as expressing a view either on the scope of the universe of possibly relevant factors that go into determining relatedness or on the weight any particular factor should be given.in that regard,the majority opinion approach is much like that of the supreme court in morgan,which,after noting some important similarities between the pre and period incidents,concluded simply that it could not say that the incidents were not part of the same actionable hostile environment claim.at.
it seems to me that what courts are doing without necessarily saying indeed what they should be considering whether,based on the totality of the circumstances,different incidents are part of the same underlying hostile work environment,both from the viewpoint of the plaintiff and from that of a reasonable person in her position.this is,after all,precisely what courts do in deciding the connected question of whether a work environment is,or is not,discriminatorily hostile under title vii.see morgan,at in determining whether an actionable hostile work environment claim exists,we look to all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.internal quotation marks omitted harris forklift,w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.gorzynski jetblue airways,cir indicating that to establish a hostile work environment claim,a plaintiff must show both that she subjectively perceived the environment as abusive and that the environment was objectively abusive,and explaining that a court must analyze these questions by look ing to the record as a whole and assess ing the totality of the circumstances.
these factors routinely are used to determine whether the combined effect of various discriminatory incidents is sufficiently severe or pervasive to cause an employee to believe reasonably that her work conditions have been negatively is,whether a hostile work environment existed.see aulicino city dep t of homeless,cir.but the same factors not only determine whether a person reasonably believes that individual incidents are severe or pervasive enough to amount to discrimination they also affect whether the incidents are properly viewed as an interrelated part of a course of discriminatory conduct,or are just unpleasant but unconnected events.for instance,frequent discriminatory incidents are more likely,a to constitute a single employment a reasonable person will generally consider incidents that are close in time to be b to amount to discrimination that is sufficiently pervasive to state a claim under title vii.unsurprisingly then,frequency has been identified as a significant factor both for determining whether a work environment is unlawfully hostile,see harris,at,and for deciding whether two periods of incidents are part of the same employment practice,see,duncan,at rowe,at.
for the same reasons,i believe that the severity of alleged conduct affects whether that conduct should be considered related under morgan.all other things being equal,incidents that occurred later in time are more likely to be part of the same hostile environment as period incidents when those earlier incidents were more severe.in this respect,consider both the subjective and objective relevance of severity.as to the plaintiff herself,the severity of the earlier statements seems clearly relevant to the question of linkage between incidents.after all,how one reacts subjectively to a later,whether one perceives the statement to constitute part of the same employment practice as prior statements and depends on the nature,including the severity,of the earlier conduct.moreover,an objective observer in the plaintiff position would,i think,consider the relative severity of earlier incidents relevant to her assessment of whether later incidents were related.where,for example,an individual previously experienced severe harassment,whether in the form of humiliating or obscene comments or even physical threats,a reasonable person is more likely to deem later comments and actions,even if milder,to be part of a pattern than if the earlier episodes were comparatively benign.this is especially likely when the same person or group of people is the source of both the earlier and later incidents.but even where the source is not common,earlier occurrences of severe hostility in the workplace may reasonably color one interpretation of later events and hence whether those events are related.
adopting this approach,which bases relatedness on the totality of the circumstances including the severity of alleged conduct,requires me to discuss an issue that the majority does not reach the pervasiveness and severity of the conduct that mcgullam asserted she endured while working in the production department.in my judgment,the conduct that mcgullam alleged during this approximately period would be sufficient,under our cases,to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that mcgullam workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,causing her employment to be altered for the worse because of her gender,gorzynski,at terry ashcroft,cir the majority sets forth most of the comments and actions that were personally directed at mcgullam,and i need not repeat them here.see op at.in addition,mcgullam claims that she witnessed and overheard comments and displays while in the production department that were sexually offensive and demeaning to women generally,including 
a a comment by a male manager to another male manager that an unidentified woman was well endowed and had double d b a conversation between mcgullam and two male about a client account mcgullam had inherited,where one of the referred to the contact for that client as generally a nice lady,except when she on the rag c comments by the male plant manager and other male employees about a female employee at a sister company,w
