gerald broder broder appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,district judge,dismissing his putative class action against cablevision systems corporation and csc holdings,collectively cablevision following removal of that action from state court broder alleged that by extending a reduced winter season rate to certain customers without offering or even disclosing it to others,cablevision had violated the uniform rate requirement of d and the disclosure requirement of section of the new york public service law,and thereby incurred liability pursuant to various causes of action.cablevision removed the action on the ground that broder claims raised a federal question,to wit,whether cablevision had violated d.
on this appeal,broder challenges both the district court determination that it had removal jurisdiction,and its ultimate dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim.exercising jurisdiction under,we conclude that both removal and dismissal were proper,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
cablevision,a provider of cable television services,offers several tiers of service basic cable,family cable,and further levels of premium optimum tv.at the time the complaint in this case was filed,the basic cable rate was per month and the family cable rate was per month.
broder alleges that during and perhaps prior to the period beginning six years before the filing of the complaint in this action the class period,cablevision offered certain customers a discounted rate in the winter season running from november through april of each year.this rate was designed to enable the owners of summer homes to maintain their cable service at a substantially reduced rate during the winter season when customers use their summer residences only sporadically at most.compl.customers receiving the winter season rates were charged only per month for basic cable and per month for family cable.
section d of title,united states code,mandates that a cable operator not subject to effective competition as defined in the statute shall have a rate structure,for the provision of cable service,that is uniform throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided over its cable system.d see l defining effective competition.section of the new york public service law psl requires that a cable television company such as cablevision 
provide to each of its subscribers at the time of the initial subscription and at least thereafter a written description,materially accurate as of the first day of the previous month,of all programming and other services offered on the cable television system and of the rates and charges relating to such programming and other services.
pub.serv.law a consol.cablevision,it is alleged,has never included its winter season rates in the brochure it distributes pursuant to psl.nor has it uniformly notified customers with summer residences of the existence of the winter season rates in any other fashion.instead,cablevision has instructed its employees to advise customers about the existence of the winter season rates for their summer residences only if the customers request that their cable service be turned off completely during the winter season.compl.
broder subscribes to cablevision services at his summer residence in suffolk county,new york.in a number of years during the class period,he alleges,he was required to pay full rather than winter season rates for these services.compl.he was unaware of the existence of the winter season rates until he found out about them from a friend who had received them.
on december,broder filed a class action complaint against cablevision in new york state supreme court,new york county.the members of the putative class were those persons who,during the class period,subscribed to cablevision for cable television services for their summer residences and were charged full rates rather than substantially reduced winter season rates for basic cable or family cable service,due to cablevision allegedly wrongful failure to advise them that the winter season rates were available.compl.on behalf of himself and the class,broder asserted what were styled as four distinct causes of action,all arising out of the provision and nondisclosure of the winter season rates.
broder first listed cause of action,for breach of contract,alleges that cablevision violated the terms of its uniform customer agreement which provides,according to broder,that all of cablevision rates and any changes in those rates will be subject to applicable law.compl.cablevision,the complaint asserts,breached that agreement with broder and the other class members by failing to provide them with the uniform rates required by d and by failing to provide them with the notice of the winter season rates as required under psl.compl.these failures are also said to have breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
broder second listed cause of action asserts violations of section of the new york general business law gbl.specifically,broder alleges that defendants conduct in failing to provide plaintiff and the class with the uniform rates required by d with the notice of the winter season rates as required under psl constitutes materially deceptive acts or practices which occur in new york commerce and affect the public interest so as to fall under gbl.compl.
the third cause of action listed in the complaint is for fraud.it is alleged that 
defendants were obligated under psl,but knowingly and willfully failed,to provide materially accurate information concerning the existence and availability of the winter season rates to plaintiff and the class,and thereby materially misrepresented the rates to which plaintiff and the class were entitled as cablevision subscribers with summer residences.
compl.it is further alleged that plaintiff and the class can be presumed to have reasonably relied on this misrepresentation,and were damaged thereby.
the fourth cause of action listed in the complaint is for unjust enrichment.it states that defendants have been unjustly enriched at the expense of and to the detriment of plaintiff and the class by wrongfully charging and collecting cable programming fees from them in excess of the substantially reduced winter season rates made available to only a relative few of cablevision customers with summer residences,and that defendants retention of the monies received through this conduct violates fundamental principles of justice,equity and good conscience.compl.
in addition to seeking damages,broder requests a declaratory judgment and an injunction.the declaratory judgment sought would declare that 
cablevision actions in connection with its failure and sic to charge uniform winter season rates to plaintiff and the class and to advise them of the existence of the winter season rates violates d and psl and the customer agreements between cablevision and plaintiff and the class and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied thereunder,as well as gbl,and constitutes fraud unjust enrichment.
compl.c.the injunction sought would e njoin defendants permanently from failing to charge winter season rates uniformly to plaintiff and the class and to advise them of the availability of the winter season rates,or otherwise violating cablevision customer agreement and gbl.compl.
following cablevision removal of the action to federal court on february,broder moved pursuant to c to remand the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.in an oral decision on april,the district court denied the motion,holding that federal law was an essential part of the complaint and thus federal jurisdiction was proper.broder then moved for an order pursuant to b certifying the denial of remand for interlocutory appeal.cablevision moved to dismiss the action under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure.by an unpublished memorandum decision filed august,the district court granted the motion to dismiss,finding that no valid claim was stated,and denied broder motion for certification under b as moot.a judgment dismissing the complaint was entered on august.this appeal followed.
discussion

denial of motion to remand 
because a holding that the district court lacked removal jurisdiction would end our inquiry,we first address the district court denial of broder motion to remand the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing,d establishes that the existence of a cause of action created by federal law is not a necessary condition for jurisdiction under or removal jurisdiction under a.instead,the question is,does a claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.id.at.at.to answer this question,we must ascertain which portions of broder complaint comprise distinct claims.a single claim over which jurisdiction exists is sufficient to allow removal.exxon mobil allapattah,d allapattah city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons,d.where a federal issue is present as only one of multiple theories that could support a particular claim,however,this is insufficient to create federal jurisdiction.see christianson colt indus.operating,d interpreting a as establishing an analogous rule,and stating that l inguistic consistency requires identical interpretations of a and.but what a plaintiff presents as one count may be understood to encompass more than one claim.see id.at.petitioners antitrust count can readily be understood to encompass both a monopolization claim under of the sherman act and a group boycott claim under.the question is whether at least one federal aspect of broder complaint is a logically separate claim,rather than merely a separate theory that is part of the same claim as a theory.
at oral argument,broder counsel accurately described the complaint as asserting two separate contract claims and two separate gbl claims.what is styled as a single claim actually has two distinct parts a claim that cablevision breached one provision of applicable law,incorporated by reference into the contract,by failing to provide broder and the class members with the uniform rates required by d,and a claim that cablevision breached another provision of applicable law,also incorporated by reference into the contract,by failing to provide them with the notice of the winter season rates as required under psl.compl.as broder counsel acknowledged at oral argument,we can put the contract claim aside,as if it had been pleaded as a separate count it is logically separable from the contract claim that relies on d.similarly,what is styled as one claim for violation of gbl is actually two a claim that cablevision violated d and thereby violated gbl,and a claim that cablevision violated psl and thereby violated gbl.
any doubt that broder brings distinct claims based on d is dispelled by his request for a declaratory judgment establishing that cablevision actions violated,inter alia,d.one of the key characteristics of a mere theory,as opposed to a distinct claim,is that a plaintiff may obtain the relief he seeks without prevailing on it.see christianson,at.it is clear that broder can not obtain the declaratory judgment he seeks,stating in part that cablevision violated d,without prevailing on the issue of whether cablevision in fact violated d.
the claims that invoke d are thus separate claims for grable purposes,and removal was proper if they necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable,at.at.the first part of the test is clearly met the claims necessarily raise the stated federal issue of whether cablevision violated d as alleged.broder claim that cablevision breached a contract term consisting of d incorporated by reference,and his claim that cablevision violated gbl by failing to provide plaintiff and the class with the uniform rates required by d,compl,both necessarily raise the issue of whether cablevision violated d.this is apparent from the face of the complaint,without reference to any anticipated defense.
the requirement that the federal issue be actually disputed and substantial,grable,at.at,is also met.cablevision maintains that its provision of winter season rates did not violate the d uniform rate requirement.cablevision contests,inter alia,whether broder and the class members subscribed in areas that lacked effective competition,and whether the winter season rates are exempt from the d uniformity requirement as promotional rates.these questions involve aspects of the complex federal regulatory scheme applicable to cable television rates,as to which there is a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,grable,at.at.these federal issues are not clearly insubstantial,and broder does not now contend that their merits would be easily resolved in his favor.
broder argues instead that the federal issues involved in this case must necessarily be insubstantial because his suit was dismissed on grounds.he draws support from christianson statement that jurisdiction does not exist where there are reasons completely unrelated to the potentially issue why plaintiffs may or may not be entitled to the relief they see k.christianson,at.quoting franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d alterations in original.
yet christianson does not stand for the proposition that any claim that could fail for a reason grounded in state law necessarily lies outside jurisdiction.in grable itself,the district court relied on michigan equitable principles as an alternative basis for denying the plaintiff relief.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d,grable i.it would be unusual for a claim that raised a federal issue not to be subject to some conceivable defense,whether based on the statute of limitations,equitable principles such as laches and unclean hands,or some other potential defect analytically prior to the federal issue at the heart of the claim.christianson concerned alternative theories on which a claim could succeed,not alternative ways in which a claim could fail,and its language must be read in this context.
we therefore come to the final grable requirement the claim must be one which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable,at.at.here,broder emphasizes the lack of a private right of action under d had congress intended the federal courts to spend their time adjudicating claimed violations of d,he argues,such a right of action would have been provided.see merrell dow pharm.thompson,d.
the grable court found this last requirement to be satisfied even in the absence of a private right of action because it is the rare state quiet title action that involves contested issues of federal law.at.at.we think it is likely to be the rare new york action or suit under gbl that seeks to assert a private right of action for violation of a federal law otherwise lacking one.such suits are particularly unlikely to recur in light of the district court and our analysis on the merits of broder claims in this case.thus,as in grable,allowing federal jurisdiction here will not materially affect,or threaten to affect,the normal currents of litigation.at.at.
the complaint in this case therefore satisfies all three prongs of the grable test for removal jurisdiction.we hold that the district court correctly denied broder motion to remand the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.
ii.dismissal for failure to state a claim 
on review of a rule b dismissal,we accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.freedom holdings,spitzer,cir.we are not limited solely to the allegations in the complaint,however.where a plaintiff has reli ed on the terms and effect of a document in drafting the complaint,and that document is thus integral to the complaint,we may consider its contents even if it is not formally incorporated by reference.chambers time warner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.insofar as the complaint relies on the terms of cablevision customer agreement,therefore,we need not accept its description of those terms,but may look to the agreement itself.
breach of contract claims 
the contract language relied upon in both of broder claims,as it exists in the actual customer agreement,differs from the language alleged in the complaint.the complaint states that u nder paragraph of the uniform terms of its customer agreement with each cablevision subscriber during the class period,cablevision agreed that all of its rates and any changes in those rates will be subject to applicable law.compl.paragraph of the customer agreement actually provides that r ates for the installation of service or equipment and rates for programming or other services are subject to change in accordance with applicable law.that is,paragraph states not that rates are subject to applicable law,but that rates are subject to change in accordance with applicable law.
this difference is fatal to both of broder claims.whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law,which we review de novo.haber paul guardian ins,cir,the general rule is that ambiguity exists where a contract term could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.world trade ctr,hartford fire ins,cir quoting morgan stanley group,new england ins,cir internal quotations omitted.but ambiguity is detected claim by claim,because a contract may be ambiguous when applied to one set of facts but not another.id.quoting morgan stanley group,at.even if we assume arguendo that,as broder suggests,the district court interpretation of paragraph to protect only cablevision was inappropriate because a symmetric interpretation was more consistent with new york law governing contracts of adhesion,the contract language would still unambiguously foreclose his claims.
read as symmetrically as possible,paragraph of the customer agreement would protect cablevision against the argument that its rates could not change even where change was otherwise permitted by law,and would protect broder against changes in rates that were not permitted by law.that is,paragraph would provide that rates were subject to change in accordance with applicable law and not otherwise 
broder does not complain of a change in rates.rather,broder complains that cablevision did not provide uniform rates and did not disclose the availability of certain rates.so far as appears from the complaint,the winter season rates might already have been in place for some customers when broder and the other members of the putative class signed their customer agreements.the continued existence of the winter season rates may have involved no change in the overall rate structure.even if the actions and omissions of which broder complains violated applicable law,therefore,it is not alleged that they necessarily constituted a change in rates contrary to that law.
moreover,even if we assume that the winter season rates were created while paragraph of the customer agreement was operative,the fact that certain customers received the winter season rates would not have constituted a change in broder rates or the rates of the other class members.as to his own rates,which are the subject of the agreement between him and cablevision,broder complains not of a change but of a lack of change to say that something is subject to change in accordance with certain rules is to say that it may change,not that it definitely will.contract language describing the circumstances under which rates are subject to change does not indicate that change is obligatory.at most,paragraph addresses circumstances under which the customer may be entitled to keep his old rates,not circumstances under which he may be entitled to have his old rates replaced by new ones.
the district court considered this case analogous to grochowski phoenix construction,cir,which held that a suit for breach of a construction contract referencing prevailing wage schedules under the act could not avoid that act lack of a private right of action to enforce those wage schedules.so too here,the district court held as an alternative ground of decision,the lack of a private right of action under d could not be avoided via a breach of contract claim.however narrow or broad the proper interpretation of our holding in grochowski may be,that case stands at least for the proposition that a federal court should not strain to find in a contract a right of action for violation of a federal law under which no private right of action exists.the district court correctly declined to do so here.the contract claim founded on d was thus properly dismissed.
the contract claim founded on psl was also correctly dismissed.psl requires a cable company to distribute a description of its rates that is accurate as of a particular point in time,the first day of the previous month.a contract provision addressing the circumstances under which rates may change can not easily be read to incorporate by reference a statutory requirement that rates at a particular time be accurately disclosed.psl directs cable companies to distribute what could be described as snapshots of their rate schedules it does not address how those rate schedules may change between snapshots.and even if we were to accept arguendo that psl regulates the circumstances under which rates may change by requiring such changes ultimately to be reported,the fact remains that,as discussed above,broder is not complaining of a change in his rates.
broder invocation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not save either of his contract claims.the implied covenant can only impose an obligation consistent with other mutually agreed upon terms in the contract.geren quantum chem,quoting sabetay sterling drug.it does not add to the contract a substantive provision not included by the parties.id.at.it therefore can not transform an obligation to refrain from changing the customer rates except in accordance with applicable law into an affirmative obligation to change his rates.
gbl claims 
in conboy v.at t,cir,we established that a plaintiff can not circumvent the lack of a private right of action for violation of a new york state law by pleading his claim under gbl.with respect to the gbl claim based on violations of d,the remaining question is whether conboy extends to attempts to circumvent the lack of a private right of action for violation of a federal law,or at least the particular federal law at issue here.with respect to the gbl claim based on violations of psl,the remaining question is whether the district court correctly concluded that there was no private right of action under that state law.
were we to hold,despite conboy,that gbl may be used to assert a private right of action for violation of a federal law otherwise lacking one,we would essentially be attributing to the new york legislature an intent to thwart congress intentions on a significant scale and in this case,we would be doing so with respect to a federal law that on its face does not address deceptive or misleading behavior at all whether a rate structure is uniform has no necessary connection to whether customers are aware of what they are paying for.if d may be the basis for a gbl claim asserting a private right of action,so may many other federal regulatory laws not having to do with deceptive or misleading acts.
neither the text of gbl nor any other authority cited by broder suggests that the new york legislature intended to cast its net so broadly.without deciding whether conboy bar on circumvention applies to all federal statutes lacking a private right of action,we hold that it does apply to d.the gbl
