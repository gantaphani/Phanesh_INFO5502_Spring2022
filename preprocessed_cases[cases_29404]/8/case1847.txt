background 
the complaints at issue in this appeal arise out of the poor performance of two mutual funds,the morgan stanley s p index fund the s p fund and the morgan stanley american opportunities fund the ao fund,and,together with the s p fund,the funds.the funds are part of the morgan stanley family of funds and share a common investment advisor,defendant morgan stanley investment advisors,and a common distributor of fund shares,defendant morgan stanley distributors.
in the summer of,plaintiffs chana yampolsky and david yampolsky filed a complaint on behalf of the ao fund the yampolsky complaint,and plaintiff lionel amron filed a complaint on behalf of the s p fund the amron complaint,and,together with the yampolsky complaint,the complaints.both complaints were filed in the southern district of new york both contained fundamentally similar pleadings and both claimed the defendants had violated their fiduciary duties under section b of the act,b.
to violate b an must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm length bargaining.gartenberg merrill lynch asset,cir.as discussed in detail below,courts consider six factors in applying this standard.these are the nature and quality of services provided to fund shareholders the profitability of the fund to the benefits economies of scale comparative fee structures and the independence and conscientiousness of the trustees.krinsk fund asset,cir citing gartenberg,at the gartenberg factors.the complaints attempt to track those factors.
the yampolsky complaint on behalf of the ao fund 
regarding the first factor,the nature and quality of services,the yampolsky complaint alleges that the loss of ao fund class b shares was,while the corresponding drop in the s p index commonly used as a benchmark in order to measure the performance of the overall stock during the same period.over the preceding five years,ao fund class b shares averaged an annual loss of,while the s p index lost only.over the preceding ten years,while the s p index gained,the class b shares gained only.in,plaintiffs allege,the ao fund paid more in fees to its adviser than it earned in investment revenue dividends interest during that same year.yampolsky also asserts that the rule fees paid to the morgan stanley distributor confer no benefit on the fund,which we take to mean that the services thus procured were of no value.
regarding the second factor,the profitability of the fund to the,the yampolsky complaint alleges that because public information is lacking,this issue must await discovery.nevertheless,plaintiff speculates that the sheer enormity of the fees suggests the fund advisors received significant profits.plaintiff makes similar speculations regarding other fees morgan stanley might have earned through sales commissions.
regarding the third factor,benefits the yampolsky complaint again claims that it can not plead any facts because of the absence of public information.
regarding the fourth factor,economies of scale,the yampolsky complaint pleads no new facts specific to the ao fund.it notes,however,that fund fees across the industry have generally been criticized as high and impervious to economies of scale.the only mention of the ao fund is an unilluminating comparison to fees in the t he adviser fees coupled with the rule fees paid to the distributor far exceed the fees found exorbitant during the.the ao fund,consequently,is a paradigm of a example of a lack of economies of scale.
regarding the fifth factor,comparative expense ratios and advisory fees,the yampolsky complaint notes a general industry trend of high fees and alleged that the expense ratio for the class b shares was,compared to the mean industry expense ratio of.it further alleges that even in an industry marked by bloated expense ratios and fee gouging,the ao fund stands out.the complaint further alleges that some fees may remain undisclosed,and that those undisclosed fees may make the actual expense ratio even higher.
finally,regarding the sixth factor,the independence and conscientiousness of the fund trustees,the yampolsky complaint alleges that five of the purportedly independent directors are not actually independent at all.their independence has been compromised,plaintiffs allege,because each serves on the board of at least different morgan stanley funds each receives at least in annual compensation from morgan stanley each is entitled to a retirement package from morgan stanley and each sits on other corporate,civic,and charitable boards.the yampolsky complaint alleges in the alternative that each trustee is the functional equivalent of an employee of morgan stanley and its affiliates.
the amron complaint on behalf of the s p fund 
the amron complaint is largely identical to the yampolsky complaint.as to the first gartenberg factor,the nature and quality of services,the amron complaint alleges that the s p fund annual return between and was,while the return of the s p the s p fund aspired to.the s p fund,plaintiffs allege,was in the bottom of all comparable funds during both the one year and five year periods ended july.
regarding the second factor,profitability of the fund to the,the amron complaint,like the yampolsky complaint,pleads no facts,but speculates that fees are high.
regarding the third factor,benefits,the amron complaint,like the yampolsky complaint,pleads no facts.
regarding the fourth factor,economies of scale,the amron complaint mirrors the yampolsky complaint,containing the same allegations about industry fees and a comparison to the same fee figure from the.
regarding the fifth factor,comparative expense ratios and advisory fees,the amron complaint notes that the expense ratio is for the s p fund,which is simply an index fund tracking the s p index,while the expense fee for a comparable fund at vanguard group is only.
finally,with regard to the sixth factor,trustee independence,the amron complaint and the yampolsky complaint allege identical facts about the five independent trustees on the s p fund board,who are the same trustees that sit on the ao fund.
the district court decision 
the defendants moved to dismiss both complaints under.b,and judge owen granted the motion in an unreported memorandum decision.see yampolsky morgan stanley inv.advisers,wl may.judge owen reasoned 
reviewing the factual allegations in the complaints,the pleadings rely heavily on generalities about deficiencies in the securities industry,and statements made by industry critics and insiders.as for factual allegations specific to this defendant,the yampolsky complaint relies principally on the assertions that the fund underperformed as compared to the s p index,had an unfavorable expense ratio,and that the trustees were poor watchdogs.the amron complaint similarly alleges unfavorable fund performance as the basis for relief.
while both complaints track the gartenberg factors,nowhere does either complaint,in sum or substance,indicate how or why the fees are so disproportionately large that they bear no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm length bargaining.for example,conspicuously absent from either of the complaints are any factual allegations as to the actual fee negotiations or management and distribution services rendered by these defendants.instead,the complaints rely on speculation,inference and generalized observations about the securities industry from public figures such as warren buffet.furthermore,plaintiffs endeavor to avoid this shortf
