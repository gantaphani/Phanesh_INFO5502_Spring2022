this appeal represents yet another installment in the protracted employment dispute between two former colleagues ángel edgardo rodríguez and malik benin benin.here,we must contend with the apparent efforts of benin to avoid paying a judgment entered against his company,coquico,coquico,in favor of rodríguez for.benin evidently sought to avoid the judgment by transferring coquico assets to his mother,acquanetta benin acquanetta,and to a new company,degrees north,llc degrees north.the principal issue on appeal is,in essence,whether the district court erred in using federal rule of civil procedure c to hold coquico,benin,acquanetta,and degrees north collectively,appellants liable for the judgment originally entered against coquico only.benin also challenges the district court order finding him in civil contempt and imposing a sanction.after careful consideration of appellants arguments,we affirm.
i.how we got here 
this case has an unusual,somewhat circuitous history therefore,it is necessary for us to go into some detail in laying out its factual and procedural background.
the saga began in when rodríguez left his position in the puerto rico federal affairs office in philadelphia,pennsylvania,and was subsequently recruited by benin to join benin venture coquico.
coquico manufactures and distributes animals,including a line of toys designed to resemble a small brown tree frog that is adored in puerto rico the coquí.because the company was a,rodríguez,who oversaw the company growth in puerto rico while benin supervised from afar in philadelphia,initially agreed to lend the company money the record does not make clear what these loans were for and to forego salary and incentive payments until the business got on its feet.
a.the relationship sours a tale of two lawsuits 
rodríguez worked for coquico for four years,but became disgruntled when benin continued to withhold compensation and loan repayments from him even as the company began making money.eventually,rodríguez left coquico and filed a collection claim against the company in san juan superior court for money owed and that not all.after filing suit,rodríguez approached coquico suppliers and began to distribute apparently similar coquís himself in puerto rico through his own company,identiko,identiko.in response to this upstart venture,coquico sued identiko and rodríguez in federal court in puerto rico for,among other things,copyright infringement,alleging that rodríguez and identiko had infringed coquico copyrights for the coquí more on this later.for the reader ease,we refer to this as the copyright action from here on out.
after a preliminary injunction hearing in the copyright action,the district court entered an order enjoining rodríguez and identiko from continuing to market the coquís coquico then sought contempt sanctions and damages before the district court.
in turn,rodríguez dismissed,without prejudice,his collection claim,which had still been pending in san juan superior court,and the action in federal court in puerto rico against coquico,benin,and benin wife,phillipa ashby,seeking payment of his promised wages and loan money it is this collection action that is the case at issue here.
both cases moved forward in parallel proceedings before different district judges in the copyright infringement action,the district court found that identiko and rodríguez infringed coquico copyrights and that coquico was therefore entitled to recover damages.coquico,jp,wl,at.but coquico elected to seek statutory damages in lieu of actual damages,and,on august,the district court awarded coquico based on the evidence presented at the bench trial.id.at.
as for the collection action,it went to trial,and,on july,a jury found for rodríguez against coquico only in the amount of coquico did not appeal,and,on september,the district court issued a writ of execution of judgment.
shenanigans 
nearly a year later,on august,rodríguez,who had been unable to recover one dime on his judgment,electronically filed a motion asking the district court to order the sale of coquico assets to satisfy the judgment accordingly,on september,the district court approved the seizure and sale of coquico copyrights and trademarks to satisfy the debt 
in june,coquico received notice from the district court that the sale of its intellectual property had been scheduled for july.on july,three days before the scheduled sale,benin mother,acquanetta,who was not represented by counsel,sought to intervene in the collection action and to stay execution,claiming that she was the record owner of the property set for sale having previously purchased the relevant intellectual property from coquico years before.notably,in support of her motion to intervene,acquanetta filed notarized transfer documents that seemed to show that benin,acting as ceo founder of coquico,had assigned the intellectual property to her in over a year before coquico filed its copyright action against rodríguez and identiko.to complicate matters further,acquanetta filings indicated that the copyright assignment had not been recorded with the united states copyright office until june,more than six years after it was ostensibly assigned to her and,important for our purposes today,a year after rodríguez obtained judgment against coquico in the collection action.
in tandem with his mother filing in the collection action,benin moved pro se to likewise stay the sale of the intellectual property,arguing,for the first time,that acquanetta was an indispensable party to the action because she,not coquico,owned the property in short,despite benin prior,consistent representations,not only in his copyright action but also in the collection action,that coquico not acquanetta was the owner of the copyrights,benin now asserted that his mother had purchased the intellectual property back in.therefore,he claimed that she was a necessary party to the collection action with an interest relating to the subject of the action,fed.civ.a b,who had been improperly excluded.
the district court denied both acquanetta motion to intervene and benin motion to stay by paper order,explaining that it would not allow intervention on a matter concluded by judgment a long time ago,especially when the public auction for the sale of the intellectual property was set for the next day.
at the time it docketed this order,on july,the district court was not aware that just that day coquico,represented by counsel,had filed for bankruptcy under chapter of title of the united states code,et,in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.upon learning of the filing,the district court stayed the case pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceeding.
c.a detour to bankruptcy court 
in its bankruptcy filings,coquico,through benin,claimed to have little to no assets.as for creditors,aside from the judgment owed to rodríguez,the majority of coquico purported creditors were benin own friends and family.and,consistent with benin and acquanetta motions to stay filed in the collection action,coquico professed in its filings to own no intellectual property,claiming instead that all intellectual property was subject to a claim of acquanetta benin.
rodríguez,who appeared in the bankruptcy action as a creditor of coquico,moved to dismiss the bankruptcy petition for lack of good faith pursuant to,arguing that the sole reason for the bankruptcy filing was to prevent the judicial sale of coquico intellectual property.rodríguez noted that the notarized transfer documents which supposedly showed that the intellectual property had been assigned to acquanetta did even appear to be genuine.for example,rodríguez pointed out that,although benin claimed he had assigned the copyright for another of coquico products,the vejigante bear,to his mother on january,the vejigante bear copyright was not registered with the united states copyright office until february.so,benin could not have assigned it to his mother,acquanetta,a month before the copyright even existed in addition,rodríguez argued that coquico had intentionally diverted its business and operations to a new entity to attempt to avoid payment to rodríguez.
responding to rodríguez motion to dismiss,the bankruptcy court held a evidentiary hearing on december,and january.noteworthy here,during the evidentiary hearing,benin explained that he was operating a newly surfaced pennsylvania limited liability company degrees north which he had registered with pennsylvania department of state corporation bureau in march.somewhat remarkably,benin admitted at the evidentiary hearing that degrees north was essentially the same business as coquico,minus rodríguez judgment.and,in fact,the similarities are considerable 
benin is the chief executive officer,president,and principal shareholder of degrees north,as with coquico 
degrees north has the same mailing address as coquico and manufactures and sells the same plush toys as coquico 
acquanetta licensed her intellectual property exclusively to coquico until,and then somehow also licensed it to degrees north,effective august,
degrees north bank account and pennsylvania registration are under the name degrees north,llc,coquico 
degrees north customers overlap with coquico customers and were derived from coquico customer lists 
orders made at coquico website are filled by degrees north,and benin testified that the of coquico website is essentially the brand coquico,but the transactions and the inventory are associated with degrees north 
in a single year coquico transferred approximately to degrees north.
at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court granted rodríguez motion to dismiss benin bankruptcy petition,finding it was filed in bad faith.see in re coquico,bankr.the bankruptcy court determined that coquico bankruptcy schedules contain ed so many material falsehoods,inaccuracies,and omissions that it was shocking.highlighting that coquico bank accounts reflected the commingling of funds,the payment of personal expenses,prepetition defalcations,and postpetition unauthorized transactions,the bankruptcy court found that virtually every bad faith criteria was met without question.see also in re coquico,at noting that t he evidence established that benin looted coquico both prepetition and postpetition,and that he lied in multiple court filings as to coquico assets.
the bankruptcy court further noted that percent of coquico debt was held by benin family members his wife,his father,and,of course,his mother,acquanetta.what more,the bankruptcy court found benin testimony to be extremely evasive,not credible,contrived and,frankly,coached.
finally,the bankruptcy court found the timing of the filing suspicious,especially given benin own striking testimony that the purpose of the bankruptcy filing was to stop the judicial sale.the bankruptcy court concluded that coquico bankruptcy filing was nothing more than an attempt to relitigate the copyright lawsuit and the collection lawsuit,and to spirit away the only valuable asset the copyrights t aking the customers,the products,everything and transitioning them into d egrees n orth simply to attain relief from a judgment creditor.see also in re coquico,at noting that benin own testimony from the dismissal motion hearing made crystal clear that it was his ultimate intention to spirit away the business and assets of coquico in order to leave coquico judgment proof and his plush toy business insulated from the rodr í guez judgment.
another attempt to collect the judgment 
after the bankruptcy case was dismissed,on january,rodríguez filed yet another motion in the district court in puerto rico in the collection action seeking to compel payment of the judgment.the miscellaneous motion titled motion asking this court to order defendant and respondents to pay the judgment in this case on penalty of contempt invoked concepts of successor liability,veil piercing,and fraud and sought to join benin,acquanetta,and degrees north to the action and to hold them jointly and severally liable for the judgment.rodríguez attached coquico bankruptcy schedules,the bankruptcy hearing transcript,and the bankruptcy judge oral decision to the motion.
rodríguez filed the motion electronically and also sent copies of the motion by regular mail to coquico,degrees north,benin,and acquanetta.upon receiving and reviewing rodríguez motion,the district court issued an electronic order setting the motion for hearing on february.the district court also ordered rodríguez to notify all parties in interest of the hearing and that failure to appear would result in sanctions.accordingly,rodríguez engaged a process server,who personally served acquanetta with rodríguez motion and with the district court order.and,although benin avoided personal service,he ultimately acknowledged that he had also received the motion and the district court order.
shortly before the hearing on rodríguez motion,benin filed a letter,as an officer of coquico,informing the district court that he did not have the resources to hire an attorney and that he would not be able to attend the hearing.aside from perfunctorily mentioning that the judgment had been entered against coquico and no other parties,benin did not respond to the substance of rodríguez motion.rodríguez replied to benin letter,informing the district court that benin had,in fact,been able to hire two attorneys to represent him in the bankruptcy case.the district court denied benin motion such as it was and the hearing continued as scheduled.
despite having been noticed and ordered to appear,benin,acquanetta,degrees north,and coquico all failed to attend the district court hearing or to oppose rodríguez motion.but the hearing proceeded,and rodríguez entered into evidence the transcript from the bankruptcy hearing,including benin testimony,and the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law.
on march,the district court entered an order that joined benin,acquanetta,and degrees north to the action pursuant to rule c and held them liable for the judgment.the district court determined that all three were joinable under rule c,specifically concluding that degrees north is a successor corporation and alter ego of coquico and,therefore,is liable for coquico debts,including the judgment,costs,and interest award,and that benin and acquanetta are alter egos of both coquico and degrees north and,consequently,are also liable for the judgment.
the district court also held coquico,benin,acquanetta,and degrees north in civil contempt for failure to appear at the hearing and ordered benin to pay,g iven the magnitude and the variety of the offenses he committed to avoid paying the judgment.the district court did not sanction acquanetta but indicated that if she continued to violate the district court orders it would do so.
benin paid the contempt sanction,and appellants timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,appellants challenge,in essence,the district court use of rule c to join benin,acquanetta,and degrees north to the judgment and the district court order finding benin in civil contempt and imposing a sanction.
notice clearing the underbrush 
the heart of appellants argument on appeal,is that the district court erred in using rule c to hold them liable for the judgment entered in favor of rodríguez but before tackling appellants primary rule c arguments,we must first address a threshold issue.appellants seem seem because their positions are often hard to tease out to argue that,although rodríguez motion sought to join them as parties and hold them liable for the judgment,rodríguez motion was insufficient because it did not cite rule c as the procedural vehicle for doing so.appellants point to federal rule of civil procedure b for the proposition that motions must state the relief sought.fed.civ.b c.the implication being,it seems,that because rodríguez motion did not specifically mention rule c,it did not state with sufficient particularity the relief rodriquez was seeking.thus,appellants argue,the district court essentially grant ed summary judgment on a theory not raised in the motion papers and without advance notice.
but the relevant rule question is whether appellants were prejudiced by a lack of particularity and whether the district court could comprehend the basis for the motion and deal with it fairly.cambridge plating napco,cir.quoting registration control,compusystems,fed.cir.see also wright miller,fed.prac.proc.civ.ed.t he niceties of specifying the relief or order sought by the motion are unimportant in some situations and can be disregarded by the court.
rodríguez motion clearly seeks to join benin,acquanetta,and degrees north as parties to the action and to hold them liable for the judgment entered against coquico.in support of his request,rodríguez motion described,in detail,how benin and acquanetta attempted to shield coquico from rodríguez judgment by fraudulently transferring coquico intellectual property to acquanetta,and ultimately shifted those assets to degrees north in an effort to continue coquico business free from liability.the motion likewise detailed how benin and acquanetta allegedly raided both corporations reserves for their own personal use,rendering their personal assets and the corporate assets indistinguishable.moreover,as described in some detail above,there is no question that appellants received a copy of rodríguez motion along with the text of the district court order setting the hearing.therefore,rodríguez motion unmistakably afforded appellants notice of the grounds and relief sought,if not the procedural mechanism for getting there and so,appellants assertions of error are without merit.
application of rule c 
having disposed of appellants notice arguments,we now turn to the merits of their rule c challenge.construed generously,appellants raise two rule c arguments one more substantive than the other.first,appellants seem to suggest that rule c can only be invoked when a transfer of interest occurs during the pendency of the litigation,not after judgment has been entered.next,they argue that the district court improperly relied on rule c as a vehicle for joining them because the rule c inquiry can not include veil piercing and alter ego theories,which alter the parties substantive rights.any such alteration,they say,must be presented in an independent action.
a clarifying the standard of review 
in his opening salvo,rodríguez argues that appellants waived any and all arguments by failing to raise them below.see cochran quest software,cir.noting that it is a virtually ironclad rule that a party may not advance a new argument for the first time on appeal.we are inclined to agree.as discussed above,coquico,benin,acquanetta,and degrees north had ample notice that the district court was considering joining them to the action and holding them jointly and severally liable to pay the judgment.they likewise had full opportunity to appear in the district court and to contest any aspect of rodríguez motion,yet they filed no written opposition,declined to attend the motion hearing,and raised not a single argument below that the district court should refrain from holding them liable for the judgment entered in favor of rodríguez.as a result,they likely waived,or,at the very least,forfeited,their rule c arguments.see united states eisom,cir.explaining that waiver implies an intention to forgo a known right,whereas forfeiture implies something less deliberate say,oversight,inadvertence,or neglect in asserting a potential right.
in response to rodríguez assertions of waiver,appellants simply rehash their notice argument,contending that they could not have raised a challenge to the district court use of rule c because rodríguez motion below never recited the rule.but,as discussed above,appellants did know that rodríguez motion sought to join them to the action and to hold them liable for the judgment and they made no argument rule c related or otherwise challenging the district court authority to grant their joinder.but even so,say appellants,waiver should not be a straightjacket,and they urge us to relax the rule.ultimately,however,we need not decide whether appellants arguments were waived because even assuming,favorably to appellants,that their rule c challenges were merely forfeited,appellants arguments falter under plain error review.see eisom,at noting that a waived claim is dead and buried,but that a forfeited claim may be resurrected on appeal under plain error review.
b rule c primer 
rule c,which governs the substitution of parties,provides,in relevant part 
rule.substitution of parties 
c transfer of interest.if an interest is transferred,the action may be continued by or against the original party unless the court,on motion,orders the transferee to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.
fed.civ.c.in other words,the rule serves as a procedural mechanism to bring a successor in interest into court when it has come to own the property in issue.santiago,cir.quoting maysonet robles cabrero,cir.for example,as is the case here,the rule may be invoked to substitute a successor in interest who obtained the assets of the corporation against whom judgment had been rendered.id.omission in original quoting explosives of am.garlam enters,cir.be that as it may,t he merits of the case and the disposition of the property are still determined the originally named parties,at quoting.mining eco chem,fed.cir.
c appellants rule c timing argument 
disposing first of appellants suggestion also referenced at oral argument that rule c is not available when the transfer occurs after judgment has been entered,we conclude that there was no error,much less plain error.see united states jimenez,cir.review places a burden on an appellant to show i that an error occurred,ii which was clear and obvious,iii which affected his substantial rights,and iv which seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public perception of the proceeding.
rule c applies to actions that are pending,but this does not preclude substitution during subsequent proceedings brought to enforce a judgment.see,at rule c governs substitution where a party to a lawsuit transfers an interest during the pendency of the lawsuit or after judgment has been rendered.explosives of,at substitution may be ordered after judgment has been rendered in the district court for the purpose of subsequent proceedings to enforce judgment.panther pumps equip.hydrocraft,cir.citing moore federal practice p,at ed.explaining that rule applies in subsequent proceeding to enforce a judgment.a proceeding to enforce a judgment is pending again,and rule applies.panther pumps,at.
it is also worth noting that in this case it is unclear when the relevant transfer of interest even occurred.to hear appellants tell it,the intellectual property was transferred to acquanetta almost four and a half years before rodríguez instituted the collection action query then why coquico was simultaneously pursuing the copyright action,and acquanetta granted degrees north a license to use the intellectual property breaching coquico supposed exclusive license nearly a year before rodríguez filed the collection action.so,it would be disingenuous,to say the least,for appellants to argue now that the district court erred in its application of rule c because the transfer of interest occurred after judgment had been entered.regardless,the district court did not err.
d appellants veil piercing and alter ego arguments 
appellants main argument that the district court improperly relied on rule c to alter the parties substantive rights by invoking the doctrines of veil piercing and alter ego presents a more substantial question.after careful consideration,however,we can not say that the district court application of rule c amounted to an error that was so clear or obvious,united states duarte,cir,that the district court should have act ed even without an objection.bielunas misty dawn,cir.
as a reminder,the district court joined degrees north under rule c as a successor corporation and alter ego of coquico,and joined benin and acquanetta as alter egos of both coquico and degrees north.and appellants do not appear to be challenging degrees north joinder to the extent that it was only joined as a successor corporation of coquico.in fact,in their briefing,appellants concede that a successor theory as opposed to veil piercing or alter ego theories is properly within the ambit of rule c,arguing only that w here there is no successor corporation substitution and liability is not authorized by the rule.emphasis added.instead,appellants seem to argue only that the district court erred when it used rule c to join degrees north,benin,and acquanetta as alter egos of coquico.
the distinction,at least as appellants interpret it,is the scope of their liability.they contend that under a analysis,which they concede is appropriate under rule c,a party joinder should be limited to reaching the interest only.in other words,they argue that under a proper application of rule c the district court may join parties who have come to own or control a corporation assets,the transferred interest,but only up to the value of those transferred assets.here,because the district court also concluded that coquico,degrees north,benin,and acquanetta are all alter egos of each other and therefore legally a single entity the district court did not limit their liability to the value of coquico transferred assets,but found them jointly and severally liable to rodríguez for the entire judgment plus costs and interest.appellants view this as,essentially,a substantive determination that is well beyond the scope of rule c.
although not elegantly briefed,this is a argument.unfortunately for appellants,p lain error is one hard test to meet,particularly in civil litigation,bielunas,at,and appellants cite no cases,in this circuit or otherwise,that expressly limit rule c joinder to the amount of the transferred assets.to the contrary,several other circuits have applied rule c in almost exactly the same manner as the district court did here.see,panther pumps,at allowing the substitution of a corporation president under rule c and holding him personally liable for the full judgment where he had fraudulently attempted to avoid the judgment by transferring the assets to a new corporation explosives of,at allowing substitution of a parent corporation under rule c and holding them liable for the full amount of the judgment as the real party in interest because the parent owned all of the outstanding stock and financed and controlled the litigation.
of particular relevance,perhaps,is minnesota mining manufacturing company.in that case,the plaintiff,minnesota mining and manufacturing,obtained a default judgment against eco chem,eci for patent infringement.at.after the suit against eci was instituted,eci president,stephanie rynne,and her husband,george rynne,who served as eci,set up a new corporation,ecochem limited ecl,and transferred all of eci assets to the new company.id.at.they exchanged their eci shares for ecl shares,converted all of eci assets to ecl,including the formulae,customer lists,trademarks and inventory,deposited eci checks into ecl accounts,and informed their customers that ecl had succeeded eci.id.footnote omitted.then moved to add the rynnes and ecl as parties to their infringement action pursuant to rule c.id.at.after a hearing,the district court granted motion and joined the rynnes and ecl as successors in interest and alter egos of eci and held them liable for the full damages and attorney fees.id.on appeal,the rynnes and ecl challenged their joinder mainly on jurisdictional grounds but the federal circuit affirmed and held that the district court reached the right result in rejecting the rynnes efforts at avoidance or evasion id.at.
what this means for us is when we have never expressly limited rule c joinder to the amount of the transferred assets,and other circuits,especially on such similar facts,have sanctioned the use of rule c to join parties as alter egos and hold them liable for the full judgment,any error can not be plain or obvious.united states diaz,cir.as such,we can not say that the district court plainly erred in its application of the rule.
application aside,appellants do not appear to challenge the district court conclusion that benin,degrees north,and coquico are all alter egos of one another.however,they do seem to argue in a single parenthetical that the district court erred in concluding that acquanetta was the alter ego of a party.regardless,the district court did not err in finding any of the appellants to be alter egos of one another.indeed,degrees north is,by nearly every measure,a mere continuation of coquico see explosives of am.garlam enters,supp,quoting dayton peck,stow wilcox pexto,cir.describing key elements of continuation.it is registered under the name degrees north,llc,coquico.the companies share an address,a bank account,and a website.they have the same inventory and clients due,in part,to acquanetta apparent willingness to grant both companies an exclusive license to use her intellectual property.an order placed with coquico is filled by degrees north and coquico regularly transfers money to cover degrees north financial obligations.benin is the principal shareholder and chief executive of both companies,and,astonishingly,he admitted under oath in the bankruptcy proceeding that degrees north was essentially the same business as coquico,minus rodríguez judgment.consequently,it was no great leap for the district court to conclude that benin employed degrees north as a mechanism to continue coquico business absent the specter of rodríguez judgment.
likewise,the district court did not err in concluding that benin and acquanetta are alter egos of coquico and degrees north.see united states,supp,aff,cir.listing factors courts should consider to determine whether to disregard the corporate form.benin,as the sole shareholder and principal of coquico,exercised total control over coquico and then degrees north and did not maintain coquico corporate form,comingling coquico funds with his own accounts.coquico regularly paid benin and acquanetta personal expenses,despite the fact that acquanetta was not even an employee of the company.and,in myriad other ways,the record demonstrates that benin and his family routinely treated coquico coffers as their own,charging personal expenses and shopping trips to the company.accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding that coquico,degrees north,benin,and acquanetta are all alter egos of each other.
in any event,even if the district court had erred,under plain error review,we need not intervene unless the error seriously impugn ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.bielunas,at quoting united states roy,cir.given appellants conduct,we can not conclude that the district court application of the rule using it to hold appellants jointly and severally liable for rodríguez judgment impugns the fairness of these proceedings.if anything,the opposite may be true as the record supports the district court conclusion that benin and acquanetta engaged in the fraudulent transfer of coquico intellectual property from coquico to acquanetta and from acquanetta to degrees north for the sole purpose of making coquico judgment proof to effectuate this fraudulent transfer,benin and acquanetta altered notarized documents and appear to have submitted fraudulent assignment papers to the copyright office,the district court,and the bankruptcy court.moreover,the transfer of assets from coquico to acquanetta did not end the shenanigans.even as appellants tell it,benin and acquanetta breached coquico exclusive licensing agreement by also licensing degrees north to use acquanetta intellectual property.this breach of coquico licensing agreement also seemed to serve no other purpose than to further effectuate the transfer of coquico corporate assets,including its inventory and customers,to benin other company.nor,we note,does it appear that degrees north paid coquico for the use of its name,website,and customer lists.
under these extraordinary circumstances,we can not say that the district court plainly erred in joining degrees north,benin,and acquanetta to the action and holding them jointly and severally liable for the judgment pursuant to rule c.further,as noted above,even if an error occurred,because it did not seriously impair the fairness,integrity,or public perception of the proceeding,jimenez,at,the district court did not plainly err,see united states,cir.explaining that a holding does not constitute a ruling on the merits.
the remaining jurisdictional argument 
finally,here,appellants argue that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them because they were not parties to the original judgment and have insufficient contacts with the forum.but once personal jurisdiction is established over the original party,it is retained over rule c successors in interest,at,as long as the substituted party had an opportunity to challenge its joinder or substitution.explosives of,at citing.mining,at and wright,miller kane,fed.prac.proc.civ.at ed.were this not so,the owners of the property could merely transfer legal ownership of the assets from one shell corporation to another in a different jurisdiction,putting a party whose initial suit satisfied the jurisdictional requirements to the immense burden of chasing the involved assets from courtroom to courtroom.mining,at.as we explained,appellants here had notice that rodríguez sought to hold them liable for the judgment entered against coquico and an opportunity to challenge their joinder before the district court.accordingly,personal jurisdiction was properly acquired over appellants as rule c successors in interest.
b.the contempt issue 
benin also argues that the district court erred in finding him in civil contempt and imposing a sanction for failure to attend the hearing on rodríguez joinder motion.specifically,benin argues that although the district court categorized the contempt finding as civil,it was actually criminal in nature and,therefore,he was entitled to additional due process protections.mindful that the district court enjoys wide latitude in its choice of sanctions,angiodynamics,biolitec ag,cir,cert.denied,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion here see project kemp,cir.explaining that the district court ultimate finding on contempt is reviewed for abuse of discretion,while the district court fact finding is reviewed for clear error,and legal questions and mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed de novo.
to determine whether the imposition of contempt sanctions is civil or criminal,we must look to the purpose and character of the sanctions imposed,rather than to the label given to the proceeding by the court below.in re kave,cir.the purpose of a criminal contempt proceeding is the vindication of the court authority by punishing for a past violation of a court order,while civil contempt is imposed to coerce present or future compliance with an order of the court.id.emphasis omitted.but t here is no dichotomous split between coercion and punishment and a civil contempt sanction may evidence a punitive flavor.angiodynamics,at.
here,although benin is correct that the contempt order was not reparative and that he was not given the opportunity to bring himself into compliance with the district court order,both of which suggest a punitive purpose,the sanction imposed also seemed intended to coerce his future compliance with the district court orders.to wit,the district court found benin in contempt of its order to appear,but also explained that it was imposing the sanction because of benin continued efforts to avoid the judgment in this case,suggesting that the district court may have sought to coerce benin future compliance with its efforts to enforce the judgment.
indeed,in explaining its decision not to impose a sanction on acquanetta,the district court stated that if acquanetta continued to violate the district court orders that she too could face sanctions in the future.the implication being,of course,that acquanetta and benin would face additional sanctions for continued noncompliance.this suggests that the district court was less concerned with punishment and more concerned with coercing benin and acquanetta future compliance with its orders.see int l union,united mine workers of am.bagwell,a contempt fine is considered civil and remedial if it coerce s the defendant into compliance with the court order citation omitted.after careful consideration of the purpose and character of the sanction imposed in this case,therefore,we are satisfied that the district court acted within its discretion in imposing civil,not criminal,sanctions on benin.
as we read appellants arguments,that ends the matter.they do not seem to challenge the district court contempt finding beyond contesting the nature of the sanctions imposed.however,for the sake of completeness,to the extent that appellants do seek to challenge the merits of the district court civil contempt finding,we will review in brief.
to prove civil contempt,the moving party rodríguez must show by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged contemnor had notice of the order,the order was clear and unambiguous,the alleged contemnor had the ability to comply with the order,and the alleged contemnor violated the order.hawkins dep t of health human servs.for,comm r,cir.quoting united states saccoccia,cir.here,appellants received notice of rodríguez motion to hold them liable for the judgment on penalty of contempt and of the district court order setting the hearing and mandating that f ailure to appear would result in sanctions.the order to appear was clear and unambiguous.appellants argued below that they did not have the means to comply with the order,but the record adequately supports the district court conclusion that appellants had the wherewithal to attend and that their protestations of penury were not credible given their ability to hire an attorney in the bankruptcy proceeding that had taken place only days before.for these reasons,we determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding appellants in civil contempt.
iii.conclusion 
in sum,we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in joining benin,acquanetta,and degrees north under rule c as alter egos of coquico and holding them liable for the judgment entered in favor of rodríguez.we likewise affirm the district court order finding appellants in civil contempt and imposing a sanction on benin.costs to rodríguez.
