this litigation arises from the attacks upon the united states on september,and takes place in the context of ongoing american military and reconstruction activity in iraq.it involves competing claims to the disposition of certain iraqi assets held by the federal reserve bank of new york.on the one hand,plaintiffs,who are relatives of victims who perished in the world trade center catastrophe,seek a declaration that they are entitled to execute against those assets to satisfy a judgment they hold.on the other hand,defendants contend that those assets should return to iraq,where they are desperately needed for military and rebuilding efforts.in a very real sense,this case implicates questions of national security and foreign affairs,as well as immediate experiences of collective loss,fear,and grief.
as a court,our task is limited to interpreting the statutes governing the disposition of those assets in a way that is faithful to congressional meaning.because we conclude that the plain language of the statutes that govern dictates that the funds plaintiffs seek to attach are no longer available for that purpose,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiff raymond anthony smith is the of george eric smith and the executor of his brother estate.george smith,who worked in the world trade center south tower,was killed in the september terrorist attack that caused the collapse of both trade center towers.plaintiff katherine soulas is the wife of timothy soulas and executrix of his estate.soulas,who worked in the north tower,also died in the september attacks.
raymond smith brought an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,on behalf of the estate on november,pursuant to a,which authorizes suits to remedy injuries resulting from international terrorism.smith named the islamic emirate of afghanistan,the taliban,al qaeda,and osama bin laden as defendants.katherine soulas brought a similar action in the southern district of new york,both individually and on behalf of the estate and her minor children,against the same defendants on november.the district court consolidated the two cases by order dated january.on june,smith and soulas plaintiffs amended their complaint to add saddam hussein and the republic of iraq as defendants pursuant to the foreign sovereign immunities act.
none of the defendants appeared.the district court entered a default judgment against all defendants and held an inquest to address various issues,including damages,on february.see smith islamic emirate of afghanistan,d,smith i.in a detailed opinion dated may,as amended,the district court noted,with respect to sovereign defendants such as iraq and hussein,that some quantum of proof as to liability was required to award damages in the event of a default.see id.at citing e.the district court then analyzed the decisions of this court and of the courts in our sister circuits and concluded that the quantum of proof required to sustain damages against a defaulting sovereign is identical to that required to withstand a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure whether sufficient evidence is proffered that a reasonable jury could render a verdict in favor of plaintiff.id.at citing ungar islamic republic of iran,d.amidst the debate about whether iraq was involved in the september attacks,the district court reviewed plaintiffs proffered evidence,which largely consisted of the expert testimony of robert james woolsey,the former director of the central intelligence agency,and of laurie mylroie,an expert on iraq,and concluded that plaintiffs have shown,albeit barely,by evidence satisfactory to the court that iraq provided material support to bin laden and al qaeda.smith i,d at quoting e.the court went on to award plaintiffs total damages of approximately million,with iraq deemed responsible for approximately million of the total.id.at.final judgment was entered on july.the judgment is not at issue in this appeal,and we assume its validity for the present purposes.
plaintiffs brought the present declaratory judgment action against defendants federal reserve bank of new york and the honorable john snow,secretary of the treasury defendants in july,seeking to satisfy their judgment against the republic of iraq by attaching certain iraqi assets that are held by the federal reserve bank of new york the assets.plaintiffs sought this relief pursuant to the authority of section of the terrorism risk insurance act,pub,stat,tria,which states that in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism,the blocked assets of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution in order to satisfy such judgment.tria,stat.at.
defendants opposed the attachment,moving for summary judgment on two grounds.first,they noted that president george bush,acting pursuant to the authority granted him by the international emergency economic powers act,as amended ieepa,had issued an executive order confiscating all frozen iraqi assets held by the government and vesting title to those assets in the united states department of the treasury.see exec.order,fed.reg,the march order.therefore,defendants argued,the funds at issue were no longer blocked funds for purposes of tria when plaintiffs judgment was entered.defendants further pointed out that section of the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of,pub,stat,ewsaa,gave the president the authority to make inapplicable with respect to iraq any law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.ewsaa,stat.at.defendants argued that the president had exercised this authority and made tria inapplicable to iraq,thereby undermining plaintiffs right to execute against the funds.see presidential determination,fed.reg.may,see also message to the congress reporting the declaration of a national emergency with respect to the development fund for iraq,weekly comp.doc,at,wl may,specifically referencing tria as among the laws made inapplicable by the may executive order.
in a thorough opinion,the district court accepted both of defendants arguments and granted summary judgment in defendants favor.see smith fed.reserve bank.hb,wl,dist.lexis,smith ii.by order dated september,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for a stay pending appeal.plaintiffs moved before this court for a stay,and on september,a panel of this court enjoined defendants from disposing of the assets in question until the case was decided on the merits and set an extremely compressed briefing schedule 
the case was argued on september.we affirmed the district court and lifted the stay in an unpublished order issued the same day,with opinion to follow.this is that opinion.
discussion 
the district court based its decision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants on two independent grounds.smith ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we may affirm the decision below on either theory,or on any other basis that we find in the record.prisco v.a d carting,cir.we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.see sherman mamaroneck union free school,cir.
i.the statutory scheme 
we begin by reviewing the web of statutory provisions that governs the disposition of the iraqi assets.these assets are designated as blocked pursuant to sections and of ieepa.ieepa authorizes the president to exercise the powers given to him elsewhere in the act to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat,which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states,to the national security,foreign policy,or economy of the united states.a.in order to exercise these powers,the president must declare a national emergency with respect to that threat.id.the specific powers that the president may exercise are set forth in.only two of these powers are relevant to this appeal.the first is set forth in a b,which states that the president may
