the american civil liberties union of massachusetts aclum,asserting taxpayer standing on behalf of its members,brought suit in alleging that the department of health and human services hhs violated the establishment clause of the first amendment.hhs had received funds appropriated by congress under the trafficking victims protection act tvpa and,in,contracted with the united states conference of catholic bishops usccb to provide services to trafficking victims.at the insistence of usccb,the contract incorporated a restriction under which neither usccb nor any of its subcontractors would use funding to counsel or provide abortions or contraceptive services and prescriptions to trafficking victims.
in march of,the district court awarded relief to aclum issuing a declaratory judgment that hhs had violated the establishment clause insofar as they delegated authority to a religious organization to impose religiously based restrictions on the expenditure of taxpayer funds,and thereby impliedly endorsed the religious beliefs of the usccb and the catholic church.am.civil liberties union of sebelius,d.the contract,along with its extensions,expired in october of.
we vacate on grounds of mootness and remand with instructions to dismiss.
the problem of human trafficking,as all parties recognize is considerable and very serious.human trafficking is a widespread form of slavery,dep t of justice,attorney general annual report to congress and assessment of government activities to combat trafficking in persons fiscal year,at,with an estimated million victims worldwide,see dep t of state,trafficking in persons report.this pandemic disproportionately affects women and girls,who account for of individuals trafficked to perform commercial sex acts and of those trafficked to provide forced labor.id.at see also banks kyckelhahn,dep t of justice,characteristics of suspected trafficking incidents,at.these women and girls are typically subject to a variety of abuses,including rape and other forms of sexual assault,and they may seek abortions,contraceptives,and other medical services.
on october,congress passed the tvpa,stat.codified as amended at et,to combat trafficking in persons,ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers,and protect their victims,a.in its victim services mandate,the tvpa directs the secretary of hhs,subject to the availability of congressional appropriations,to expand the benefits and services offered to human trafficking victims residing in the united states.id.b b.since fiscal year,congress has appropriated to million annually to hhs to carry out that mandate.see,consolidated appropriations fy,stat,consolidated appropriations act,stat.
shortly after congress passed the tvpa,hhs began implementing the victim services mandate through a series of competitively selected grants to direct service providers.see,orr announcement for services to victims of a severe form of trafficking,may.hhs later determined that these grants were inefficient and ineffective,due to geographic and other limitations 
in november of,these problems prompted hhs to alter its approach to the distribution of funds under the victim services mandate.rather than issuing multiple grants to individual service providers,hhs decided to award a single contract to administer the agency tvpa funds nationwide.hhs would then reimburse the organization selected,on a per capita basis,for the benefits and services it provided to trafficking victims 
on november,hhs published a request for proposals rfp for the nationwide contract.the rfp explained that the award recipient would furnish,either directly or through other organizations,case management,benefits coordinating,and counseling services to trafficking victims.the contractor would also expend tvpa funds on certain direct services,including medical care,therapy,and other forms of assistance.the tvpa did not require hhs to ensure that taxpayer funds were made available to provide abortions or contraceptive services to trafficking victims,and the rfp did not preclude organizations which refused to provide these services from submitting a proposal.
hhs received timely proposals from two organizations,both religiously affiliated usccb and the salvation army.based upon its own religious and moral convictions,usccb proposal included a restriction on the services it would fund if awarded the nationwide contract 
a s we are a catholic organization,we need to ensure that our victim services are not used to refer or fund activities that would be contrary to our moral convictions and religious beliefs.therefore,we would explain to potential subcontractors our disclaimer of the parameters within which we can work.specifically,subcontractors could not provide or refer for abortion services or contraceptive materials for our clients pursuant to this contract.
sebelius,d at emphasis omitted.
hhs convened a technical evaluation panel to review the contract proposals.based upon four criteria specified in the rfp organizational profile,approach,staff and position data,and past experience the panel gave usccb proposal a technical score of out of and salvation army proposal a technical score of.two of the panel members raised concerns about usccb services restriction,which they expressed through a series of written questionnaires to usccb.in response,usccb clarified that it would not agree to a do ask,do tell policy on abortion and contraception,and that it would not use,or permit to be used,any tvpa funds for activities covered by the restriction.id.at.
in february of,hhs allowed both organizations to submit revised technical proposals.the panel gave usccb revised proposal a technical score of,noting the restriction as one of its weaknesses.salvation army revised proposal received a technical score of.as to costs,the panel estimated that usccb proposal would require approximately million in total funding as compared to million for salvation army proposal.hhs awarded the nationwide contract to usccb on march,hhs usccb contract.
the hhs usccb contract was signed on april.it had an initial term of one year,with options for four annual renewals thereafter,each of which hhs exercised.throughout this contractual period,usccb did not provide services directly to trafficking victims,but subcontracted with upwards of other organizations that did so.usccb subcontracts specified what costs were and were not reimbursable.costs included,among others,abortion and prescriptions.usccb did not,however,exclude any organization from becoming a subcontractor on the basis of that organization provision of abortion or contraception services,it simply forbade reimbursement for such services.subcontractors were able to furnish these services at their own expense or through funding acquired from other sources.over the first four years of this arrangement,usscb subcontractors served an estimated trafficking victims at around the cost per victim of the earlier grant program.
hhs exercised the fourth and final contract option in april of,which expired on april.before the option expired,hhs approved a extension,called a task order,pursuant to.that task order expired on october.sebelius,d at.thereafter,hhs had no authority to obligate additional funding under the hhs usccb contract,although it could reimburse usccb for services which had been rendered before october.on april,one month after the district court issued its opinion,usccb stated that it had completed all reimbursements under the contract.in sum,hhs awarded usccb approximately million under the contract over the course of five and a half years.
on may,hhs announced that it would return to a model to fulfill the victim services mandate.the funding opportunity announcement foa prepared for the new grants made clear that hhs funds could be expended for an abortion in certain limited and that hhs would give strong preference to applicants willing to offer the full range of legally permissible gynecological and obstetric care.these terms were markedly different from those in the rfp.
on october,hhs awarded grants to three organizations.each grant has an expected term of months,subject to the continued availability of federal funds and satisfactory progress by the grantee.although usccb applied to receive a grant,its proposal was not selected.
on january,almost three years after the hhs usccb contract was adopted,the aclum filed suit in the district of massachusetts against the secretary of hhs and two other federal officials in their official capacities alone the complaint alleged that the federal defendants violated and continue d to violate the establishment clause of the first amendment by permitting usccb to impose a religiously based restriction on the use of taxpayer funds.the aclum sought a declaratory judgment,pursuant to,that the federal defendants violated the establishment clause a permanent injunction ordering the federal defendants to ensure that the tvpa grant is implemented without the imposition of religiously based restrictions and costs,fees,nominal damages,and any other relief the court deemed appropriate.usccb intervened as a defendant in june of.
on march,the district court resolved for summary judgment in favor of the aclum.sebelius,d at.the district court held that the aclum,on behalf of its members,had taxpayer standing to challenge the hhs usccb contract on establishment clause grounds,id.at that the hhs usccb contract expiration had not rendered the aclum challenge moot,id.at and that the federal defendants had violated the establishment clause either by endorsing or appearing to endorse usccb religiously based views,id.at,or by impermissibly delegating authority to usccb to impose those views on others,id.at.
the district court concluded that the aclum challenge was not moot because it fell under the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine.having determined that hhs voluntarily ceased the challenged conduct,to prevail on mootness grounds,the federal defendants had to show that it was absolutely clear they would not resume that conduct.relying on usccb contention that it would continue to seek hhs contracts and grants,and on a long history of partnership between hhs and usccb,the district court determined that the federal defendants could not meet this burden.id.at.independently,the district court noted that the aclum sought a declaratory judgment,and concluded that it was obliged to reach the merits on the basis of this request.id.at.both rulings were in error.the district court went on to find that declaratory relief was appropriate and issued a judgment that the federal defendants had violated the establishment clause.id.at.
on may,this timely appeal ensued.
on appeal,the federal defendants challenge the district court conclusions that the case was not moot,that the aclum had taxpayer standing,and that the hhs usccb contract was in violation of the establishment clause,and seek to vacate or reverse the district court grant of relief.usccb appeals only as to standing and the merits the aclum argues that this court should affirm the district court decision in its entirety,and does not request any alternative form of relief.
we begin and end our analysis on the issue of mootness.mootness is a ground which should ordinarily be decided in advance of any determination on the merits.see arizonans for official english arizona,d.further,we are obligated to follow the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,under which federal courts are not to reach constitutional issues where alternative grounds for resolution are available.see mills rogers,d ashwander.valley.brandeis,concurring.
the hhs usccb contract,and any use of taxpayer funds authorized by it,whether constitutional or not,has now ended,as of either october,when the contract expired,or at the latest on april,when usccb announced that it had no outstanding invoices for services rendered prior to the contract expiration.moreover,hhs has awarded new grants to three different organizations,each for a term of months.the aclum admits these grants do not raise establishment clause concerns.these new grants were made pursuant to hhs new terms,which endorse a strong preference for organizations willing to provide abortion and contraceptive services.the federal defendants argue that these events have mooted the aclum challenge.we agree.
the doctrine of mootness enforces the mandate that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of the review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.mangual rotger sabat,cir quoting steffel thompson,d.the burden of establishing mootness rests with the party invoking the doctrine,conservation law found.evans,cir,in this instance the federal defendants.where,as here,there are no factual findings which bear on the matter,we review the trial court mootness determination de novo.see brown colegio de abogados de,cir adams bowater,cir.
this court,employing the supreme court terminology,has provided various formulations of what makes a case moot.simply stated,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,cir quoting powell mccormack,d internal quotation marks omitted.another way of putting this is that a case is moot when the court can not give any effectual relief to the potentially prevailing party.horizon bank trust massachusetts,cir citing church of scientology of cal.united states,d.and,i f events have transpired to render a court opinion merely advisory,article iii considerations require dismissal of the case.mangual,at libertarian party of gardner,cir,cert.denied,d.under any of these formulations,the aclum challenge to the hhs usccb contract is moot.
it is ordinarily true that a challenge to a contract becomes moot upon that contract expiration.see,columbian rope west,james luterbach constr,adamkus,cir air line pilots ass n,int l ual,cir w e agree that if the expiration clause made the contract expire last year,the case is moot and we are required to vacate the trial court order.this is also the rule in challenges to expired or exhausted government grants,see,maine dep t of labor,cir caldwell caldwell,cir campesinos unidos,dep t of labor,cir,and to government regulatory schemes which have expired or been effectively repealed,see,new eng.reg l council of carpenters kinton,cir.
these challenges are moot for a number of reasons.one is that there is literally no controversy left for the court to decide the case is no longer live.powell,at.once a contract has expired,and the obligations between its signatories have ended,and if no damages are sought,the parties usually do not have a legally cognizable interest in the case outcome 
a second and independent reason for mootness is that a court can not provide meaningful relief to the allegedly aggrieved party.this is clearest in cases where the only relief requested is an injunction.once a contract has expired,there is no ongoing conduct left for the court to enjoin.columbian rope,at campesinos unidos,at.
with limited exceptions,not present here,issuance of a declaratory judgment deeming past conduct illegal is also not permissible as it would be merely advisory.maine,at washburn,cir james luterbach,at.the supreme court has admonished that federal courts are not in the business of pronouncing that past actions which have no demonstrable continuing effect were right or wrong.spencer kemna,d see also united states reid,cir.
while the district court was correct to independently consider the availability of declaratory relief,see super tire eng g mccorkle,d,it failed to apply the appropriate test.for declaratory relief to withstand a mootness challenge,the facts alleged must show that there is a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.preiser newkirk,d quoting.cas.pac.internal quotation mark omitted.the controversy here is at this point neither immediate nor real.the hhs usccb contract has expired and the appropriated tax dollars set aside for it have been spent.
beyond that,hhs has awarded new grants to implement the victim services mandate and these grants do not raise establishment clause concerns.the case has therefore lost its character as a present,live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on ab
