background 
peter tomich was born in near the dalmatian coast in the village of prolog,which was then in.he immigrated to the united states in,enlisted in the army in,and became a citizen in.he was discharged from the army in january,promptly enlisted in the navy,and held the rank of chief water tender aboard the utah on december.he sacrificed his life at pearl harbor to save many shipmates.
on march,franklin roosevelt awarded tomich the medal of honor,with the following citation 
for distinguished conduct in the line of his profession and extraordinary courage and disregard of his own safety during the attack on the fleet in pearl harbor,territory of hawaii,by the japanese forces on december.although realizing that the ship was capsizing,as a result of enemy bombing and torpedoing,he remained at his post in the engineering plant of the utah,until he saw that all boilers were secured and all fireroom personnel had left their stations,and by so doing he lost his own life.
the medal was awarded pursuant to the former,recodified as amended as,which allowed the president to award a posthumous medal of honor if presented to a representative of the hero,as designated by the president,within five years of the act or service justifying the award.id.
following the award of the medal,the navy tried unsuccessfully to find next of kin.the only family history available was in beneficiary slips filled out years earlier for the navy,in which tomich said he was n ot married and listed a c ousin john tonich at an address in los angeles.in march,the secretary of the navy wrote to the cousin in los angeles,deem ing it an honor to transmit the medal,which was forwarded under separate cover.the medal was returned with the postal notation n o such address.
the medal was formally presented on january,to the commander of the destroyer escort tomich.plaintiff and the government agree that this ceremony amounted to a presentation of the medal within the meaning of.internal navy records concerning the presentation state that the medal was to be displayed on board the tomich,in the status of a loan,to be recalled should a next of kin make a claim for same.
when the tomich was decommissioned near the end of world war ii,the medal was returned to the secretary of the navy.in,the navy forwarded the medal to the utah state capital building for display alongside a memorial to the utah.the navy advised the governor,however,that it might require return of the medal in the improbable event that a relative of tomich made a claim for it.
for reasons not in the record,the state of utah returned the medal in.since then,it has been in the custody of the navy.the medal is currently on display in the navy museum in washington.
in,the congressional medal of honor society the society and the new york naval militia the militia asked lunney,a retired rear admiral and member of the militia,to assist in locating tomich next of kin.the society informed lunney that tomich medal was the only one of its kind in the last century that ha d gone unclaimed,and requested lunney assistance in finding someone to receive the award.
lunney studied navy files concerning tomich career,and traveled to prolog,a village of about that had been in when tomich was born there later part of yugoslavia,now in the federation of bosnia and herzegovina,where lunney searched the birth,marriage,baptism,and death records of the local roman catholic church.
lunney satisfied himself that tomich cousin john returned to prolog in the early,and had a son named dragutin herceg tonic,who survives.according to lunney,dragutin herceg tonic has designated his son,screcko herceg tonic,as next of kin for purposes of receiving the medal awarded to tomich.although navy records stated that tomich was n ot married,lunney reports that tomich was married in prolog in a year before he left for america,and that his wife died in without issue.
lunney offered the navy his investigative materials,and urged the navy to present the medal to screcko herceg tonic.in march,the secretary of the navy referred the matter to the navy board of decorations and medals the board,which in turn referred the matter to the office of the judge advocate general of the navy jag.
jag determined that the medal had already been presented,to a navy officer commander of the tomich whom president roosevelt designated as tomich representative.jag opined therefore that the medal was property of the navy appropriately in the navy possession,that the navy could take any action with respect to the medal not prohibited by statute or regulation,and that transfer of the medal was a matter of policy and,subject to applicable restrictions,within the discretion of the secretary of the navy.in addition,jag questioned lunney identification of the next of kin,pointing to discrepancies in the genealogical records.
on april,the secretary of the navy sent an internal memorandum to the board stating that u pon review of all relevant information concerning the medal,the navy shall retain custody of the original medal.the secretary suggested that c ustody of the award shall continue under navy control until such time as definitive evidence is presented to verify a relationship.on december,the secretary informed the militia of the navy decision.lunney subsequent petition to president clinton was unsuccessful.
in may lunney was issued letters of administration of tomich estate by the surrogate court of queens county,new york.as administrator,lunney commenced this federal lawsuit.
the complaint recites that the suit was brought to insure that the only medal of honor that has been awarded in the past century but never presented be so presented,and argues that the medal should be presented to screcko herceg tonic as next of kin at an appropriate ceremony.presentation,according to lunney,would be at no cost to the government,since o nce the medal wa s properly presented the next of kin w ould accept a reproduction or duplicate and allow the navy to retain the original for appropriate display at mutually agreeable museums and other prominent locations.
defendants moved to dismiss for lack of standing,lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and failure to state a claim.they argued inter alia that all decisions as to presentation of the medal of honor were wholly within the discretion of the president.lunney response conceded that,according to the navy records,the medal had already been presented.without abandoning his request for a presentation of the medal,lunney argued,that the relief he sought might be characterized as custody or deliver y of the medal.
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the apa claim on the ground that lunney claim was one for presentation by president clinton,and that president clinton denial of lunney request for that relief was the only final action affecting the custody of the medal.lunney,wl at,dist.lexis,at.lunney appeals from this ruling.
discussion 
we review the district court ruling de novo.see rent stabilization ass of new york dinkins,cir.when as here a jurisdictional challenge under.b is addressed to the complaint,a court accepts as true all the factual allegations in the complaint and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.see hamilton chapter of alpha delta phi,hamilton,cir citing hospital building trustees of rex hospital,d.
a plaintiff has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that subject matter jurisdiction exists.makarova united states,cir malik meissner,cir.sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional bar,and a waiver of sovereign immunity is to be construed strictly and limited to its express terms.see dep t of the army blue fox,d interpreting scope of the federal government waiver of sovereign immunity under the apa up state fed.credit union walker,cir it is well established that in any suit in which the united states is a defendant,a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the claim is a prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction.absent a waiver,sovereign immunity shields the federal government and its agencies from suit.dorking genetics united states,cir quoting fdic meyer,d.
lunney invokes the waiver of federal immunity in the apa,which provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.up state fed.credit union,at.the apa allows individuals to challenge the final actions of the military so long as the authority challenged was not exercised in the field in time of war or in occupied territory.b g see also ornato hoffman,cir stating that the apa applies to the military in peacetime.
the apa authorizes only a challenge to a final action of an agency.a.under the apa,an action is final insofar as it is not a preliminary,procedural,or intermediate agency action or ruling a ruling may be final whether or not it may be subject to appeal or reconsideration unless the agency otherwise requires by rule and provides that the action meanwhile is inoperative.id.the core question for determining finality is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process,and whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.dalton specter,d quoting franklin massachusetts,d.
an agency is defined in the apa as each authority of the government of the united states,whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency b.t he president is not an agency within the meaning of the apa,dalton,at.citing franklin,at.so the apa does not allow courts to review the president actions.
according to the district court,the secretary of the navy as a deputy of the president had discretion to choose a representative to receive the medal and could decide whether to accept lunney claim that the medal should be presented or transferred to screcko herceg tonic,but t he secretary of the navy decision serve d more like a tentative recommendation than a final and binding determination.lunney united states,wl at,civ.lmm,dist.lexis,at,quoting dalton,at.relying on the allegation in the complaint that president clinton denied a request to have the medal presented to screcko herceg tonic,the district court concluded that president clinton took the only final action as to lunney claim.in short,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction because,although the navy is an agency,its actions were not final,and although the actions of president clinton were final,the president is not an agency.see id.wl at,dist.lexis,at president clinton denial of plaintiff petition to have the medal presented to screcko herceg tonic is not subject to review by this court under the apa.
we agree with the district court that congress has expressly delegated authority over the medal to the president,and that the president is not an agency.but although we arrive at the same conclusion as the district court in regard to subject matter jurisdiction,we deviate from the district court analysis.
the district court relied on dalton specter,d,which held that certain actions of the president,which in that case concerned the closing of naval bases,were unreviewable under the apa.dalton,however,is insufficient to dispose of the present case.the statutory scheme at issue in dalton gave the president the power to accept or reject,whole,a report prepared by the secretary of defense and endorsed by an independent commission that listed bases to be closed.id.at.the parties in dalton disputed whether the president had made the final decision,or whether the president role in effect was to intercede or acquiesce in a final decision that congress delegated to an agency.the court ruled that congress had expressly granted the final power to the president,to be exercised upon the president receipt of an agency report in the nature of a recommendation.id.at.the court acknowledged that the president can not pick and choose among bases,and must accept or reject the entire package offered by the commission,but concluded that this fact was immaterial w hat is crucial is the fact that t he president,not the commission,takes the final action that affects the military installations.id.quoting franklin massachusetts,d alterations in original.the relevant inquiry is into the intent of congress.see id.at.
dalton is of limited utility in deciding the present case because there is no evidence that congress intended to give the president continuing and unreviewable power over a medal of honor awarded and presented decades earlier by another president.the statutory scheme governing the medal of honor limits the president discretion to a five year period following the act or service justifying the award.so even assuming that president clinton himself directed the navy to deny lunney claim,that act of that president would not standing alone insulate the navy actions from judicial scrutiny.lunney decision to unsuccessfully lobby the president to intercede does not serve to make the president decision the only final action affecting lunney claim 
dalton might in any event have controlled this case if lunney were seeking only the ceremonial presentation of the medal congress expressly conferred that power on president roosevelt,who exercised it.the district court understood lunney to seek nothing else,which is understandable because plaintiff submissions are muddled on this point while lunney suggests that the relief he seeks would be at no cost to the government,since the next of kin w ould accept a reproduction or duplicate and allow the navy to retain the original for appropriate display at mutually agreeable museums and other prominent locations,the record also reflects a request for relief that includes custody and deliver y.thus,although the next of kin might forgo possession of the original medal and accept a replica of some kind that presumably would be uniquely cast,he would evidently assert a possessory right to control display of the original.viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff as we must,we construe this claim to seek possession of the medal,in the alternative to presentation.and to the extent that lunney seeks possession,the district court opinion and dalton are insufficient to support the dismissal of this case.
the defendants argue that lunney complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding any claim for possession.according to defendants,even if the navy decision to retain possession of the medal was a final agency action under the apa,the district court would nevertheless lack jurisdiction because lunney has no standing to bring this claim,and the decision challenged by lunney is one committed to agency discretion by law and is therefore unreviewab
