absolute prosecutorial immunity 
prosecutors are generally immune from liability under for conduct in furtherance of prosecutorial functions that are intimately associated with initiating or presenting the state case.imbler pachtman.section immunity is grounded in the prosecutor common law tort immunity.that immunity arises from the concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor energies from his public duties,and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.id.at.i f the prosecutor could be made to answer in court each time an aggrieved defendant charged him with wrongdoing,his energy and attention would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law.id.at.immunity protects the proper functioning of the prosecutor office by insulating the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.kalina fletcher.
yet absolute prosecutorial immunity is not without its costs.in imbler,the supreme court explained 
to be sure,this immunity does leave the genuinely wronged defendant without civil redress against a prosecutor whose malicious or dishonest action deprives him of liberty.but the alternative of qualifying a prosecutor immunity would disserve the broader public interest.it would prevent the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.

false statements made in support of a material witness order.
flagler contends that by making sworn factual statements in support of the order,trainor was acting as a complaining witness rather than as an advocate.in kalina fletcher,the supreme court held that a prosecutor was not absolutely immune from liability for making false statements in support of an arrest warrant.there,the prosecutor provided a certification for determination of probable cause that summarized the evidence supporting the arrest warrant.at.rather than attaching to the motion an affidavit from a witness with personal knowledge of facts,the prosecutor personally vouched for the truth of the facts set forth in the certification.id.
