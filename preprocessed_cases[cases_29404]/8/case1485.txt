respondent national labor relations board nlrb moves to transfer this case to the district of columbia circuit.it argues that,because it did not receive a petition for review stamped by the court with the date of filing,a,from either party seeking review of its decision,the case should be heard where proceedings were first instituted,in the circuit,pursuant to a.we conclude that,where a party files a petition for review in the second circuit and then serves the agency with the petition accompanied by the email,bearing the date and time of filing,by which the petition was filed,the party has satisfied the requirements of a.we therefore deny the motion.
background 
on august,the nlrb issued a decision and order requiring rochester gas electric corporation rochester gas to bargain with local union,international brotherhood of electrical workers,local union,regarding the effects of rochester gas decision to discontinue the practice of allowing company employees to take their service vehicles home at the end of their shifts.on august,rochester gas filed a petition for review of the nlrb order in the district of columbia circuit.rochester gas also served a copy of the petition,via federal express,upon the nlrb.the circuit court rochester gas petition for review as filed on august,but the copy of the petition sent to the nlrb was not.on august,local union electronically filed a petition for review of the nlrb order in this court,and emailed a copy of the petition,accompanied by a copy of the electronic filing message sent to this court,to the nlrb.the emailed copy of the petition was not directly by the court with the date of filing,but the copy of the electronic filing message forwarded along with the petition did contain the date and time the petition for review was filed.
the nlrb now moves to transfer this case to the circuit pursuant to.separately,rochester gas moves to intervene as of right pursuant to fed.d.it does not address the nlrb motion to transfer venue.
discussion 
pursuant to a,if,within ten days after the issuance of an order,the nlrb receives only one petition for review filed in a court of appeals,then it must file the relevant record in that court of appeals,notwithstanding the institution in any other court of appeals of proceedings for review of that order.id.if,however,the nlrb receives,within ten days,two petitions for review filed in separate courts of appeals,then it must notify the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation,which shall,by means of random selection,designate one court of appeals in which petitions for review have been filed and received within the period and shall issue an order consolidating the petitions for review in that court of appeals.id.a.in any other case,where proceedings respecting the same order were instituted in two or more courts of appeals,but no petition for review is filed within ten days of the order,the board shall file the record in the court in which proceedings with respect to the order were first instituted.id.a.all courts where proceedings have been instituted regarding the same order must transfer the proceedings to the court where the record is properly filed.id.a.
at issue in the instant motion is what constitutes a petition for review for purposes of section a,which in this case turns on the meaning of the seemingly straightforward phrase stamped with the date of filing.the statute states that a copy of the petition or other pleading which institutes proceedings in a court of appeals and which is stamped by the court with the date of filing shall constitute the petition for review.id.a emphasis added.
the nlrb acknowledges that it received two copies of petitions instituting proceedings within ten days of its order and that,if it receives two qualifying petitions for review filed in two different courts of appeals within ten days of an order,then the court of appeals that will hear the case is determined randomly.id.a.however,it argues that,because neither of the copies of the petitions it received were stamped by the court with the date of filing,id.a,they did not constitute petition s for review for purposes of the statute,and,therefore,it received no petitions for review within ten days of the order.accordingly,the nlrb contends that the case should be transferred to the circuit where proceedings with respect to the order were first instituted.id.a.
in opposition to the nlrb motion,local union argues that the statute did not contemplate mandatory electronic as is required in the second therefore its service upon the nlrb of the petition accompanied by a copy of the email in which it was contained the date and time when the petition was the stamped by the court with the date of filing requirement set forth in section a.thus,according to local union,the nlrb received from local union a proper petition for review filed in this court from local union within ten days of the agency order,and,because rochester gas failed to serve a proper petition for review on the nlrb within ten days of the order,the case should remain in this court.see id.a.
we have not previously addressed whether service upon an agency of a copy of a petition initiating proceedings in this court,accompanied by proof of the date of the electronic filing of that petition,but lacking a placed directly by the court,can satisfy the petition for review definition set forth in a.prior to our court shift to electronic filing,parties would file petitions for review,which would be physically stamped with the date of filing by the court.thus,compliance with section a was straightforward.however,under our new procedures,which require such petitions to be filed electronically,there is no direct replacement for the physical stamping.as we explain below,given the shift in our court procedures,we conclude that service upon an agency of a petition initiating proceedings in this court,accompanied by the filing email containing the date on which the petition was filed,suffices to constitute a petition for review for purposes of section a.
under the local rules of the second circuit,an initiating document,such as a petition for review of an agency proceeding,is filed by emailing an electronic version of the document to a second circuit email address,newcases.second circuit local rule c.such an initiating document is considered filed as of the date and time indicated on the email submission,id.d,and is to be served on other parties by email,id.h.after a petition for review is received by this court,a docket is created in our electronic case management system.however,there is no automatic court response to receipt of the petition that would be analogous to having the petition physically stamped upon receipt of a document at the courthouse 
this does not,however,leave the opposing party without the ability to verify when the petition was filed.a copy of the email that filed the petition can be forwarded to the opposing party,and,if a party desires further confirmation of the date the petition was filed,it may check the docket it is will indicate when the petition was filed.however,as is true in the instant case,the date of filing may differ from the date on which the petition is later docketed by the court.
under the rules of this court,then,local union only method of ensuring that it satisfied the requirements of section was to serve upon the nlrb a copy of the petition accompanied by the email in which the petition was filed indicating the time and date on which it was filed.we conclude that,because,pursuant to this court procedures,there is no direct analogue to a date stamp placed on the petition directly by the court,and because,under court rules,the petition for review was filed as of the date and time indicated on the email submission,second circuit local rule d,the copy of the petition,accompanied by the forwarded email containing the date and time,was effectively stamped by the court with the date of filing,for purposes of section a.accordingly,under the technological conditions and filing practices of the present day,the forwarded email accompanying the copy of the petition for review served as a stamp by the court wi
