on july,the rhode island superior court entered a judgment in favor of john clauson,awarding him in damages against his former attorney,sanford kirshenbaum,for professional malpractice in representing clauson in his divorce.though kirshenbaum had a malpractice liability insurance policy with a limit through new england insurance company neic,neic paid clauson only on the judgment,the amount of a settlement offer from clauson that kirshenbaum had rejected against neic recommendations.in response,clauson filed the present diversity action against neic pursuant to laws,authorizing direct actions against insurers by injured parties who have obtained a judgment against the insured.clauson sought payment on his judgment up to the stated policy limits as well as interest above those limits pursuant to rhode island rejected settlement statute,laws.the district court entered judgment for clauson on his claim for payment above the rejected settlement amount,but for neic on the issue of interest above the policy limits.neic appeals and clauson.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm as to neic appeal and as to clauson to the extent it relates to clauson first,settlement offer.we remand for further consideration by the district court of whether clauson has properly preserved his argument for interest based upon his second,settlement offer and,if the district court finds that argument to have been preserved,for resolution of it.
the procedural history of this case is lengthy.in order to address the legal issues,we must recount much of that history.
a.the divorce proceedings 
in,clauson and his wife divorced,and the divorce court entered a judgment granting each a interest in the marital property.a fishing trawler that clauson used for his business was one of the most significant marital assets.after clauson failed to exercise an option to purchase this trawler,his wife moved to have the trawler sold.clauson,who previously had been acting pro se,retained attorney kirshenbaum to represent his interests during the sale.though the trawler was listed for sale at its appraised value,the only viable offer for the vessel was approximately below the listed price.the divorce court scheduled a hearing to determine whether to accept this offer,setting a date that created a conflict for kirshenbaum.kirshenbaum complained of this conflict,but the court refused to release him from the date,instead ordering him to be present or to ensure that clauson was represented by another attorney.despite the divorce court explicit instructions,kirshenbaum refused to attend the hearing or to find another attorney to take his place.
clauson tried unsuccessfully to find another attorney before the hearing.at the hearing,the divorce court approved the sale of the trawler.following the sale,clauson discharged kirshenbaum,filed a disciplinary complaint against him and engaged a new attorney.although clauson was unhappy about the sale of the trawler,his new attorney advised against taking an appeal from the order authorizing the sale.clauson followed this advice.
b.the malpractice action 
approximately a year later,clauson filed a malpractice suit against kirshenbaum in the rhode island superior court.kirshenbaum held a professional malpractice insurance policy through neic during the time he represented clauson.the policy limited neic liability to per claim,an amount that would also be reduced by all claims expenses,including reasonable attorney fees.kirshenbaum informed neic of the malpractice suit and filed a counterclaim for unpaid attorney fees.neic undertook kirshenbaum defense under a reservation of rights.kirshenbaum focused his defense upon the issue of causation,claiming that clauson was not harmed by his failure to attend the hearing on the sale of the trawler.nonetheless,michael stone,the attorney assigned by neic to defend kirshenbaum,opined from the outset of the suit that despite this weakness in clauson case,there was a significant danger of an adverse judgment.
the case went to arbitration,and the arbitrator found in clauson favor in july of,awarding him.though neic and attorney stone recommended that he accept the arbitration award,kirshenbaum rejected the award pursuant to the rhode island superior court rules governing arbitration in civil actions.neic wrote to kirshenbaum and complained that his refusal to consent to settlement of the case after a decision by an unbiased arbitrator was unreasonable.consequently,neic said it was invoking the clause in its policy that limited its exposure to the amount of the rejected settlement.nonetheless,neic continued to defend kirshenbaum and the case was scheduled for de novo trial.
continuing to express his concern that a trial could result in an even greater judgment for clauson,attorney stone met with clauson attorney to discuss the possibility of a settlement.though both attorneys agreed that the arbitrator award,plus interest,would be a reasonable basis for settlement,kirshenbaum again refused to consent to a settlement.approximately three months later,clauson reiterated in writing the offer to settle for the arbitrator award plus interest,for a total of.again attorney stone recommended that kirshenbaum agree to the settlement and again kirshenbaum refused to give his consent.neic then wrote to kirshenbaum requesting that he accept the settlement offer.neic indicated that this settlement would be beneficial to kirshenbaum,that his refusal was unreasonable,and that if kirshenbaum again refused to consent,neic liability would be limited to the amount of the rejected settlement.kirshenbaum remained recalcitrant and the case was scheduled for trial in september of.on the morning of trial,clauson renewed his offer to settle,attorney stone recommended the settlement,and kirshenbaum refused to consent.
after a trial,the superior court found for clauson,both on his claim of malpractice and on kirshenbaum counterclaim for unpaid attorneys fees.the court found that kirshenbaum failure to appear at the hearing on the sale of the trawler was a clear breach of duty that caused in damages to clauson.the court based this damages calculation on kirshenbaum failure to advise clauson to submit his own offer to purchase the vessel.clauson,however,did not provide any evidentiary support for a finding that the failure to advise of the purchase option as opposed to the failure to appear at the hearing was a breach of duty,and kirshenbaum moved for a new trial on this basis.
while the motion for a new trial was pending,kirshenbaum and neic exchanged further correspondence.kirshenbaum repeated his refusal to allow a settlement of the claim.neic responded that it was relinquishing control over his defense.furthermore,it denied responsibility for any costs or expenses associated with kirshenbaum defense accruing after the date of the adverse judgment and again asserted that its liability on the judgment was capped at the amount of the proposed but rejected settlement.kirshenbaum discharged attorney stone and reiterated that the carrier is directed not to make any payments on my judgment in favor of clauson against me.
the motion for a new trial was granted,the prior judgment on clauson claim was vacated,and the case was returned to the trial calendar clauson again contacted attorney stone for the purpose of settling the case.stone referred him to neic,which indicated that it was no longer conducting the defense and that clauson should discuss any settlement directly with kirshenbaum.clauson nonetheless sent a written offer of settlement to both neic and kirshenbaum,revoking the earlier settlement offer and offering to settle instead for the policy limit of.neic never responded to this offer.shortly thereafter,the superior court allowed attorney stone to withdraw.
the case again went to trial with kirshenbaum continuing pro se.clauson introduced evidence to eliminate the deficiencies the court noted in granting a new trial.once again,the court entered judgment for clauson in the amount of.kirshenbaum did not appeal from this judgment.once the judgment became final,neic paid clauson approximately,the amount it considered the limit of its liability for the judgment under the policy clauson accepted this payment without prejudice to his right to proceed against neic for the balance.
c.the present action 
within weeks of that partial payment,clauson initiated the present diversity action against neic.clauson sought recovery,subject to the liability policy limits,for the outstanding balance on the judgment,as well as recovery pursuant to rhode island rejected settlement statute,section,for pre and interest in excess of those limits.the case went to the district court on a joint stipulation of facts.the court concluded that neic policy limited liability to the amount of a rejected settlement offer only when the rejection by the insured was unreasonable.because the court concluded that kirshenbaum had been reasonable when he refused to consent to settlement,it entered judgment for clauson on his claim for damages.the resulting award of represented the policy limits less the that neic paid at the conclusion of the malpractice suit.the court,however,rejected clauson claim for interest beyond the policy limits.
after the entry of judgment,neic filed a motion to amend,arguing that the stated policy limits were subject to reduction by the amount of neic reasonable expenses in defending the claim,with such expenses,including reasonable attorneys fees,totaling.the court granted the motion and amended the judgment to award clauson in damages.neic now appeals from the judgment awarding damages while clauson from the denial of his claim for interest we address these issues in turn.
this is a derivative action pursuant to laws against neic for a judgment rendered against its insured.section allows an injured party after having obtained judgment against the insured alone to proceed on that judgment in a separate action against the insurer.id.in doing so,however,the statute does not enlarge the liability of the insurer beyond the limits stated in the policy,which is dependent upon the existence of liability of the insurer to the insured under the contract of insurance.ogunsuada accident ins,internal citations and quotations omitted.thus,clauson stands in the shoes of the defendant insured kirshenbaum and is subject to any defenses that the insurer would have against its insured.id.at.
the dispute in this case involves the following two paragraphs in kirshenbaum professional malpractice policy 
the company shall have the right to make any investigation it deems necessary and with the written consent of the insured,said consent not to be unreasonably withheld,any settlement of any claim covered by the terms of this policy.
if the insured shall refuse to consent to any settlement or compromise recommended by the company and acceptable to the claimant,and elects to contest the claim,suit or proceeding,then the company liability shall not exceed the amount for which the company would have been liable for damages if the claim or suit or proceeding had been so settled or compromised,when so recommended.the company shall have no liability for claims expenses accruing thereafter and the company shall have the right to withdraw from the further defense thereof by tendering control of said defense to the insured.
neic contends that the first paragraph gives a reasonable insured the ability to frustrate settlement,while the second paragraph,with its reference to any settlement,limits neic liability to the amount of a rejected settlement offer that it recommends and is acceptable to the claimant,whether the rejection by the insured is reasonable or not.clauson therefore received all he was due under the policy when neic paid him after the entry of a final judgment against kirshenbaum.in response,clauson contends that these paragraphs must be read together to limit neic liability only when its insured refusal to settle is unreasonable.because the district court found that kirshenbaum had been reasonable when he rejected clauson settlement offers,a finding that neic does not challenge on appeal,neic obligations extend to the full policy limits.
in its thoughtful decision finding for clauson on the policy limit issue,the district court first noted that,under the settled rhode island rules of construction of insurance contracts,the policy must be examined in its entirety,giving each word its plain,ordinary,and usual meaning.moreover,the policy should be construed in a manner that harmonizes and gives effect to all of its material terms and avoids rendering any of its provisions meaningless.internal citations and quotations omitted.with these principles in mind,the court turned to the two paragraphs at issue and concluded that neic interpretation was unreasonable because it failed to give effect to every term in the policy.we quote and adopt the court impeccable reasoning 
neic contends that the reference in the first sentence of the second paragraph to any settlement means that coverage is limited to the amount of the proposed settlement in every case where the insured refuses to consent,without regard to whether the insured acted reasonably.however,that interpretation conflicts with the provision in the preceding paragraph requiring the insured consent to settle.
by preventing the insurer from settling without the insured consent and prohibiting the insured from un reasonably withholding consent,that provision,in effect,confers on the insured the right to reasonably withhold consent.construing the policy in the manner suggested by neic would negate that right.the insured refusal to consent to a settlement,however reasonable,would deprive the insured of the full indemnification protection for which he contracted.in addition,it would deprive the insured of the right to be defended by the insurer because the second sentence of the paragraph upon which neic relies would allow neic to withdraw from further defense.
at the very least,neic reading of the policy would render meaningless the provision prohibiting consent from being unreasonably withheld.if coverage were reduced to the amount of a proposed settlement even where the insured reasonably refuses to consent,the prohibition against unreasonably withholding consent would be superfluous.coverage would be reduced whether the insured acted reasonably or unreasonably.
having rejected neic interpretation as unreasonable,the court adopted the only interpretation that gave effect to both provisions,and construed the policy to limit neic liability to the amount of the proposed settlement only if kirshenbaum refusal to consent was unreasonable.
on appeal,neic argues that the district court erred in concluding that its interpretation of its own insurance policy was unreasonable.although the two paragraphs at issue are set forth consecutively in the policy exactly as set forth in the text above under a section of the policy entitled defense and settlement,neic insists that these paragraphs address separate issues,requiring that each paragraph be read individually.as such,the second paragraph is not limited,as the district court found,by the first paragraph,but instead acts on its own to place a strong incentive upon the insured to settle because any refusal to consent brings with it the full risk of an adverse judgment 
interestingly,however,neic never argues that the interpretation of the two paragraphs adopted by the district court is unreasonable.indeed,at oral argument,while maintaining that the court interpretation was,from its point of view,incorrect,neic also acknowledged that the meaning works,conceding,in effect,that the reading offered by the district court was a reasonable response to the language of the policy.that acknowledgment demonstrates that,even if we accept neic protestations about the reasonableness of its own reading of the policy,it has done nothing more than show that there are two reasonable interpretations of the contract language.in other words,neic argument on appeal indicates only that the contract was ambiguous.goldstein occidental ins,noting that a policy is ambiguous if doubtful,uncertain or ambiguous terms are used,or if its language is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations internal citations omitted.such a showing is not helpful
