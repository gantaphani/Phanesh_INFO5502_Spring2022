petitioner service employees international union,local local or the union seeks review of three decisions of the national labor relations board nlrb or board affirming in part and reversing in part the administrative law judge findings with respect to allegations that am property holding corporation am participated in a scheme with two successive cleaning contractors,planned building services,pbs,and servco industries,servco,to avoid a bargaining obligation with local after am purchased a building located at maiden lane in manhattan,new york city.the union argues on appeal that the nlrb erred by finding that am was not a joint employer with either pbs or servco the board was precluded from determining whether pbs was individually a successor employer to clean right,the cleaning division of the former owner of maiden lane,because the general counsel had not litigated a violation based on that theory and local was not entitled to additional remedies.we conclude that the nlrb adequately addressed its own precedents in finding that am was not a joint employer with pbs or servco and that this finding was supported by substantial evidence.we further conclude that the board did not err by refusing to grant local extraordinary remedies.we hold,however,that the board misunderstood its authority to determine whether pbs was individually a successor employer of clean right,and thus we remand so that the board may reconsider this issue.
background 
factual background 
the material facts are not in dispute.in april,am closed on the purchase of an office building at maiden lane maiden lane or the building in manhattan from the witkoff group witkoff.at the time of the sale,cleaning services for the building were provided by twelve employees of clean right,an cleaning division of witkoff.witkoff was a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement between the realty advisory board on labor relations of which witkoff was a member and local,under which clean right employees earned approximately per hour.immediately following the sale,am entered into a contract with pbs for cleaning services,which provided that employees would receive wages and benefits specified in a union collective agreement,under which wages were set at and per hour.within a week following the sale,pbs entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the united workers of america uwa covering the service employees at maiden lane and maiden lane a building across the street,the terms of which ran from may,to april.
when clean right employees appeared for work the day after am took possession of the building,they were told they no longer had jobs because pbs was bringing in its own work force.several days later,a group of clean right employees went to maiden lane and gave their names,addresses,and phone numbers to jack constantine,an am official,who told them that he would contact pbs and see what we could do.constantine admitted that he did not follow through with pbs.
at am request,the contract between it and pbs provided that pbs would retain one night supervisor,with single health coverage,holidays and sick days,adding that a ny employee that is retained from am staff at am request who is receiving wages benefits in excess of those contained with the wage rates structure and benefits within union collective agreement,shall continue to receive said rates differential other benefits.this language was inserted by pbs based on am recommendation that it hire dennis henry for a supervisory role at the building henry had previously been employed by am as a night porter at maiden lane,and was transferred to maiden lane following its sale to am when henry first reported for work at the building,he was told that his duties consisted of preparing the supplies for the cleaning personnel and checking to make sure that their work was completed.this entailed distributing keys and cleaning supplies to employees at the start of a shift,preparing and signing employee time cards,and instructing employees to redo their work if it was not done properly.although henry was placed on pbs payroll incident to his transfer to maiden lane,he continued to complain to paul wasserman,an am official,about his wages and benefits,and on at least one occasion,wasserman contacted pbs and arranged for henry to receive a wage increase.based on henry repeated complaints,wasserman transferred henry back to the am payroll in july but his duties at maiden lane remained the same.
in july,pbs sent a written offer of employment to zoila gonzalez,a former clean right employee.when gonzalez reported to work at the building,she was met by henry,who presented her with a work cart and a mop.gonzalez protested that she had not previously been required to perform this type of heavy work,and when henry insisted that she had to mop,gonzalez claimed she had a medical condition that prevented her from mopping.henry then told gonzalez that he had to go to the building office to explain what was happening.gonzalez accompanied henry and waited outside the office,and when henry emerged a few minutes later,he explained that if gonzalez refused to mop,she could not work.gonzalez testified that she did not know to whom henry had spoken.
in april,all of the pbs employees at maiden lane went on strike.on may,am sent a letter to pbs terminating its services at the building effective june,and on may,am entered into a contract with servco to provide cleaning services at maiden lane.under the terms of that contract,servco agreed that am present night supervisor wa s to remain as night supervisor and compensated by am,a provision which,it is undisputed,referred to henry.on june while the strike was ongoing,but before servco took over cleaning operations for maiden lane,several pbs workers entered the building and asked henry to assist them in obtaining jobs with the new company.henry told them,however,that they,servco do want anyone from the strike.two of the pbs employees then separately asked for job applications from constantine,who explained that he could not do anything for them because they had made trouble.a few days later,constantine gave a similar response to several of the striking pbs employees who had returned to the building and asked for job applications,stating that it was a bad decision that they went on strike,and that striking was not the best choice.
as for the pbs employees,henry instructed them to report to maiden lane on june because servco might offer them employment.when the employees arrived,they were joined by a number of servco employees who were also applying for positions,and together,they were addressed by mark giacoia,servco sales manager,who warned the employees that nobody better not fucking talk to the union because if you do,you be fired on the spot.giacoia also told the employees that their salary would be per hour.henry urged,however,that because the employees had previously been paid per hour by pbs,it would only be fair to continue their salary at that rate.giacoia indicated that he would consider henry suggestion.ultimately,servco president decided to pay the employees per hour,but did not consult henry in making this decision.after servco took over operations at maiden lane,henry recommended that it retain certain employees.servco later interviewed those employees and made its own hiring decisions.
ii.procedural history 
in and,local filed a series of unfair labor practice charges against pbs,am,and servco.among other charges,the union alleged that pbs and am,as joint employers,violated sections a,and of the national labor relations act the act,a,and,by discriminating against building service employees previously represented by local at maiden lane to avoid successorship bargaining obligations am violated sections a and of the act by terminating building service workers employed at maiden lane in retaliation for their union activity and am and servco,as joint employers,violated sections a,and of the act by refusing to hire building service workers in retaliation for their union activity and for refusing to recognize and bargain with local.in march,the nlrb began issuing complaints relating to these allegations,and the consolidated cases were heard before an administrative law judge alj in.the alj found,inter alia,that am and pbs were joint employers with respect to the maiden lane employees,am and servco were joint employers with respect to those same employees,and am and pbs were successor employers to clean right and had a duty to bargain with local.each party filed exceptions to the decision,and local sought additional remedies against pbs.
in august,a divided nlrb panel reversed in part the alj decision see am prop.holding.the board found there was insufficient evidence that am exercised control over pbs hiring and firing decisions or directed extensively the work of pbs employees so as to establish that am and pbs were joint employers.in addition,the board found that am role in overseeing servco employees and recommending wage rates and employees for hire was similarly insufficient to establish that am and servco were joint employers.given its reversal of the alj joint employer finding,the board also determined that am and pbs were not joint successors to clean right,but the board held that it was precluded from considering whether either am or pbs individually was a successor to clean right with an obligation to recognize because the general counsel has not litigated a violation based on that theory.finally,the nlrb declined the union request to order extraordinary remedies,finding that pbs conduct was not so numerous,pervasive,and outrageous as to warrant this relief.
local moved for reconsideration of the board refusal to consider whether pbs was an independent successor to clean right and of the board denial of extraordinary remedies.in march,a group of the nlrb denied the motion,after which the union petitioned this court for review of both agency decisions.see am prop.holding.following the supreme court decision in new process steel,nlrb,d holding that a delegee group of the nlrb could not continue to exercise its delegated authority once the group and the nlrb membership was reduced to two members,we remanded to the agency,and in,a properly constituted nlrb panel affirmed the agency march decision for the reasons stated therein.see am prop.holding.jurisdiction was subsequently returned to this panel of this court pursuant to the procedures set forth in united states jacobson,cir 
discussion 
joint employer status 
local challenges the board legal conclusions and its factual findings regarding whether am was a joint employer with either pbs or servco.first,the union asserts that while the board applied the correct legal standard,it failed to distinguish or overrule prior decisions in which the agency found a joint employer relationship based on facts similar to the instant case.second,the union contends that the board factual findings are flawed.
i.the board legal analysis 
in general,our review of the board legal conclusions is deferential.long island head start child dev.servs.nlrb,cir see nlrb caval tool,cir this court reviews the board legal conclusions to ensure that they have a reasonable basis in law.in so doing,we afford the board a degree of legal leeway.quoting nlrb town country,d.that said,the agency must examine relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.long island head start,at quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.for this reason,we will examine whether an agency decision accurately reflects its own caselaw.id.internal quotation marks omitted where the board departs from prior interpretations of the act without explaining why that departure is necessary or appropriate,the board will have exceeded the bounds of its discretion.district lodge,int l ass of machinists and aerospace workers afl cio nlrb,cir see also good samaritan hosp.shalala,d t he consistency of an agency position is a factor in assessing the weight that position is due.
a n essential element of any joint employer determination is sufficient evidence of immediate control over the employees,clinton ditch nlrb,cir namely,whether the alleged joint employer did the hiring and firing directly administered any disciplinary procedures maintained records of hours,handled the payroll,or provided insurance directly supervised the employees or participated in the collective bargaining process,at t nlrb,cir citing clinton ditch,at see also laerco transp.warehouse,finding that to establish a joint employer relationship,there must be evidence that one employer meaningfully affects matters relating to the employment relationship such as hiring,firing,discipline,supervision,and direction of the other entity employees.local does not dispute that the board applied this standard.rather,it contends that in analyzing two of these factors supervision and hiring the board failed to address contrary precedent.
local asserts that in finding henry supervisory responsibilities the pbs and servco employees did not demonstrate that am was a joint employer with those companies,the board articulated a new rule that represents a significant departure from settled law and is inconsistent with agency precedent.we disagree.in its analysis of henry responsibilities,the board reasoned that evidence of supervision which is limited and routine in nature does not support a joint employer finding,noting that it had generally found supervision to be limited and routine where a supervisor instructions consist primarily of telling employees what work to perform,or where and when to perform the work,but not how to perform the work.am prop.holding,at citing wes,island creek coal.this is not a new rule.the cases the board relied on broadly support the proposition that limited and routine supervision,wes,at,consisting of directions of where to do a job rather than how to do the job and the manner in which to perform the work,island creek coal,at,is typically insufficient to create a joint employer relationship.see also local,serv.emps.intern.union,alf cio,no joint employer relationship where employer regularly directed maintenance employees to perform specific tasks at particular times but did not instruct employees how to perform their work cal.gas,employer direction of porters and janitors insufficient to establish joint employer relationship where employer did not,inter alia,affect wages or benefits,or hire or fire employees.
local counters that these cases are distinguishable and that the board erred by not following the precedents of other cases where it found a joint employer relationship despite evidence that the putative employer did not instruct employees how to perform their work.although we recognize certain factual distinctions between the present case and those cited by the board,its reliance on those cases does not evidence an abuse of discretion.far from announcing a categorical rule based on the prior decisions it cited,the board made the observation that supervision which does not include instructions on how to perform work is generally insufficient to establish a joint employer relationship,a proposition roundly supported by those cases.see am holding prop,at.the decisions cited by local in its brief constitute an exception to this general proposition,and in the vast majority of those cases,the board joint employer finding was based on other circumstances not present here in any event,the board finding that the extent of henry responsibilities was insufficient to establish a joint employer relationship did not rest exclusively on the nature of the instructions he gave to the pbs employees.see id.the board emphasized in addition that henry did not train the employees,he could not assign overtime work without pbs consent,and the employees could refuse overtime work all of which,in aggregate,demonstrated that henry role was insufficient in scope and authority to prove the existence of a joint employer relationship.see id.at citing computer assocs.int l,recognizing that the employer independent authorization of overtime for employees of another company was a strong factor to establish status,enforcement denied in part by.in sum,the board did not abuse its discretion by analyzing this issue as it did.
local also argues that in analyzing whether am role in pbs hiring of employees evidenced a joint employer relationship,the board failed to address its decision in le rendevous restaurant le rendevous ii.we find that case to be distinguishable.in le rendevous restaurant,the ambassador plaza hotel casino the hotel decided to subcontract operation of the hotel restaurant to bultman enterprises,bultman as a means to reduce operating costs.see le rendevous restaurant le rendevous i,prior to bultman acquisition of the restaurant,its workforce was unionized,and based on an economic analysis of the restaurant earnings,the most significant factor affecting profitability was high labor costs.see id.at.against this backdrop,the record contained concrete evidence including detailed memoranda between representatives of the two companies that confirmed an explicit agreement to purge the workplace of union personnel and to insulate bultman new hires from the hotel other unionized employees.see id.at.to this end,evidence showed that the hotel had expressly identified which employees had been contaminated by their union activities,thus providing notice to bultman that these employees should not be retained if a nonunion workforce was to be realized.see id.at.based on this and other evidence,the board found a joint employer relationship between the two companies.see le rendevous ii,at.
contrary to the above,there is no record evidence here of any express agreement between am and pbs not to hire the clean right employees.moreover,the nature of the relationship between the two companies is markedly different from that of the hotel and bultman.see le rendevous i,at.whereas the hotel had originally operated the restaurant itself and then subcontracted operations to bultman,am was never directly involved in providing cleaning services at maiden lane rather,it contracted with pbs to provide those services simultaneous with its purchase of the building.thus,we reject the union assertion that am role with respect to pbs hiring of employees was just like the role played by the hotel operator in le rendevous ii.given these factual distinctions,the board did not abuse its discretion by omitting that case from its analysis of whether am was a joint employer with pbs.
ii.the board findings of fact 
the board determination as to the existence of a joint employer relationship,which is essentially a factual issue,can not be disturbed if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.nlrb solid waste,cir per curiam internal quotation marks and citation omitted see e the findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.under substantial evidence review,our inquiry is limited to determin ing whether the supporting evidence,even if not preponderating in this court view,nevertheless provides a sufficient basis for the board decision.unite here nlrb,cir quoting nlrb interboro contractors,cir alteration in unite here.
local alleges two errors with the board factual findings.first,it argues the board erred by finding that the incident between dennis henry and zoila gonzalez did not demonstrate am involvement in pbs hiring decisions.the record indicates that when gonzalez explained to henry that her medical condition prevented her from mopping,henry went to the building office to explain what was happening,and when he emerged from the office a few minutes later,he told gonzalez that if she refused to mop,she could not work.while the alj acknowledged that,based on these facts,there was no evidence as to who,if anyone,henry spoke to,he found nonetheless that a fair inference may be drawn that am building manager constantine or his designee made the decision to present the ultimatum to gonzalez that she must mop or else not be hired.am prop.holding,at.the board reversed,finding there wa s no evidence that an am official vetoed gonzalez s hire.id.at.
we disagree with the union and conclude that the board finding was supported by substantial evidence.the alj finding that am vetoed gonzalez hiring rested on the attenuated assumption that henry spoke to some person in the building office that person occupied a position of authority at am and that same person instructed henry to veto gonzalez employment application.but because there is no evidence in the record that henry spoke to anyone in the office,these inferences are unsupported.the union further contends that the board reversal of the alj finding on this point violated allentown mack sales and,nlrb,d when the board purports to be engaged in simple factfinding,unconstrained by substantive presumptions or evidentiary rules of exclusion,it is not free to prescribe what inferences from the evidence it will accept and reject,but must draw all those inferences that the evidence fairly demands,but we reject this argument for the reasons we have stated.because the record failed to show that henry spoke to anyone,it can not be said that the evidence fairly demand ed the alj inference that am vetoed gonzalez hiring.id.
second,local challenges the board finding that am was not involved in ensuring that servco did not hire the striking pbs employees,asserting that constantine and henry statements to those employees support a finding of a joint employer relationship.we are not convinced.although there is no question that constantine and henry told the employees they were ineligible for employment because of their participation in the strike,we agree with the board that there wa s no evidence that servco had authorized either constantine or henry to make any representations on it s behalf,or that servco had involved them in its hiring process.am prop.holding,at.indeed,as the board noted,see,these circumstances are easily distinguishable from le rendevous restaurant ii,where there was explicit evidence of coordination between the hotel and the restaurant concerning the hiring of a nonunion workforce facts noticeably absent from the record in this case,see supra at.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the board factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.
ii.successorship 
as noted above,the board determined that it lacked the authority to consider whether pbs was individually a successor employer to clean right and thus had an obligation to bargain with local because the general counsel ha d not litigated a violation based on that theory.am prop.holding,at see also am prop.holding,at denying the union motion for reconsideration on this issue because t he general counsel frames the theory of the case,and the charging party may not enlarge upon or change the general counsel theory.the board reasoned,as well,that the key question in deciding the merits of this issue was whether the pbs employees at maiden lane constituted an appropriate bargaining unit,but that the general counsel had not established or even alleged this fact.see am prop.holding,at.local challenges this determination.it asserts that under pergament united sales,enforced cir,the board was not precluded from finding that pbs was an individual successor to clean right,and that the general counsel need not have established the appropriateness of the bargaining unit because the unit consisting of the maiden lane employees was presumptively appropriate.
pergament addressed whether the board could find a violation of the act that had not been alleged in either the charge or the general counsel complaint.see id.at.underlying this question was the concern that,to comport with due process,the nlrb may not find that an unfair practice exists without first affording the alleged violator notice and an opportunity for a hearing,which,as to the former,requires ordinarily that the complaint contain notice of the particular violations charged.coca cola bottling of buffalo,cir see pergament,at due process requires the board to afford an alleged violator notice and an opportunity for a hearing on a charge under the act.to account for this concern,the board held that it may find and remedy a violation even in the absence of a spe
