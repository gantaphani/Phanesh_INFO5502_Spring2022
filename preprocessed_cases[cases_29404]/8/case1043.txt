michael spielman,the named plaintiff in a putative class action,appeals the district court dismissal of his suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court found that the plaintiff individual damages claim failed to satisfy the minimum set by for entry into federal court.the court also rejected the plaintiff alternative argument that his claim for attorney fees under chapter of the massachusetts consumer protection statute fulfilled the requirement because massachusetts law allowed him to aggregate all of the fees anticipated by the class.we agree that spielman does not meet the minimum and affirm the district court dismissal of his suit.
in,michael spielman,a new york resident,bought a limited partnership interest in genzyme clinical partners,gcp,which sought to develop a treatment for gaucher disease.at that time genzyme development corporation genzyme development,a subsidiary of genzyme corporation genzyme,was the general partner of gcp.as general partner,genzyme development was obligated by law and by the limited partnership agreement to issue annual federal and state tax schedules to the limited partners.no schedules were issued between and.in,the gcp limited partners approved the sale of the partnership assets to genzyme in exchange for shares of common stock.as a result,gcp was liquidated.
this transaction had tax implications for spielman and some of the other gcp limited partners who lived outside of massachusetts.sometime after genzyme bought gcp,the massachusetts department of revenue determined that the sale and liquidation was a taxable event under state law.in,the department notified the former limited partners who had not filed massachusetts tax returns that they owed state taxes on their share of the liquidation income.spielman was assessed a tax of,which he did not pay.in,the department penalized spielman for delinquent payment by doubling the amount he owed to.
on november,spielman filed a class action in federal court on behalf of himself and similarly situated former gcp limited partners against genzyme development and genzyme the complaint included claims of negligent misrepresentation,common law fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract.it alleged that genzyme development failure to issue the required tax schedules for gcp caused spielman and the other class members to incur massachusetts tax liability.as a resident of new york suing a massachusetts corporation,spielman asserted diversity jurisdiction under,but did not specify a damages amount.at the time the suit was filed,a required that the matter in controversy exceed for federal court jurisdiction to attach.see act of,stat.amending a so as to raise jurisdictional amount from to.
five days after filing the class action complaint,spielman filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board to determine the taxes and penalty he owed for the gcp liquidation.on october,genzyme filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,alleging that spielman damages fell below the required minimum.in opposition to this motion,spielman filed an affidavit on november,claiming in double taxes,in interest,in penalties,and in accountant fees.the itemized damages totaled.the affidavit asserted,however,that spielman damages as of the date his complaint was filed were,though it did not explain the discrepancy between that amount and the itemized total.
on december,the district court denied genzyme motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,but stayed spielman action pending the state tax board ruling on the amount of his tax liability.the court said this action has been prematurely brought.after a review of the papers and pleadings,it is not possible at this time to determine plaintiff damages,as damages can be reasonably calculated only upon completion of the state administrative proceedings.
this stay remained in place for more than two years.then at a february,status conference,spielman told the court that the tax board had assessed his final tax liability at taxes he owed for gcp liquidation,with no assessment of penalties or interest.spielman also said that to achieve this result he had paid attorney fees of and accountant fees of,for a total of.spielman told the court he would consider whether the tax board ruling meant that he could no longer meet the minimum.the next day,the court lifted the stay on spielman class action.
five months later,on july,spielman asked the court for leave to file an amended complaint.the amendment alleged no new facts,but added a claim under chapter of the massachusetts consumer protection act,which permits prevailing plaintiffs to recover attorney fees as part of their damages award.genzyme protested,arguing that spielman attempt to amend the complaint was untimely and a transparent attempt to establish federal court jurisdiction where none exists.on september,the court granted spielman request to amend the complaint,saying that the court december stay accounted for the delayed filing of the amendment.
on november,genzyme renewed its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,claiming that the state tax board ruling established that spielman had incurred at most in damages in opposition to this motion,spielman argued that his damages claim for attorney fees under chapter should include the fees for the class,and that aggregating the fees to him would boost his claim over the minimum.spielman also urged the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the other members of the class even if they individually failed to meet the requirement 
on may,the district court granted genzyme motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.the court found that the tax board ruling meant that the damages that spielman alleged on the face of his original complaint failed to satisfy the jurisdictional minimum at the time that complaint was filed.the court also declined to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of spielman amended complaint,finding that under massachusetts law chapter anticipated the pro rata distribution of attorney fees to members of the class for purposes of determining jurisdiction,rather than aggregation to the named plaintiff.spielman appeals.
we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.coventry sewage dworkin realty,cir.the facts pertinent to this appeal are undisputed.however,as the party seeking to invoke jurisdiction,spielman has the burden of showing that he has met the statutory requirements.id.at.
as we have noted before,competing interests are at stake when federal courts determine whether they may hear a case.charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure at.on the one hand,the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts,see const.art.iii,and congress has further narrowed our jurisdiction by periodically increasing the minimum for diversity cases.this means that we have a responsibility to police the border of federal jurisdiction.pratt cent.park.dames moore,cir.on the other hand,determining whether a case belongs in federal court should be done quickly,without an extensive inquiry.to make the which court decision expeditiously and cheaply,a judge must simplify the inquiry id.
with these competing interests in mind,we apply the supreme court longstanding test for determining whether a party has met the minimum.paul mercury indemnity red cab.states that 
the rule governing dismissal for want of jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal court is that,unless the law gives a different rule,the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith.it must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.
id.at.footnotes omitted.under paul,a plaintiff general allegation of damages that meet the amount requirement suffices unless questioned by the opposing party or the court.see dep t of recreation and sports world boxing ass n,cir.once the damages allegation is challenged,however,the party seeking to invoke jurisdiction has the burden of alleging with sufficient particularity facts indicating that it is not a legal certainty that the claim involves less than the jurisdictional amount.see also barrett lombardi,cir.a party may meet this burden by amending the pleadings or by submitting affidavits.dep t of recreation and sports,at.
courts determine whether a party has met the requirement by looking to the circumstances at the time the complaint is filed.coventry sewage,at wright miller at.thus paul legal certainty standard does not mean that jurisdiction is ousted because of the eventual inability of plaintiff to recover an amount adequate to give the court jurisdiction,or because the complaint discloses the existence of a valid defense to the claim.coventry sewage,at.in addition,e vents occurring subsequent to the institution of suit which reduce the amount recoverable below the statutory limit do not oust jurisdiction.paul,at.on the other hand,and importantly for this case,
if,from the face of the pleadings,it is apparent,to a legal certainty,that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed or if,from the proofs,the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount the suit will be dismissed.
id.at.emphasis added.
after genzyme challenged his damages allegation,spielman tried in two ways to meet the burden of showing that his claim met the legal certainty test for the minimum.first,he submitted an affidavit itemizing in damages and claiming total damages of.spielman says that the damages allegations in the affidavit meet paul legal certainty test because they represent his claim at the time he filed suit.according to spielman theory,the state tax board ruling that his tax liability was only was a subsequent event under paul,and thus unrelated to the facts as they existed at the time he filed his complaint.alternately,spielman sought to meet the minimum by amending his complaint to include a claim for attorney fees under chapter.he argues that the fees claim boosts his damages allegation over because it encompasses not only the fees anticipated for his individual case,but also the fees that will be generated on behalf of other members of the class.we address each of spielman arguments in turn.
spielman individual damages claim 
invoking paul,spielman argues that the tax board ruling was a subsequent event that can not be factored into the court analysis.here spielman attempts to draw an analogy between the facts in this case and those in our own precedent,coventry sewage dworkin realty,cir.in coventry sewage,the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff for usage after a increase.the plaintiff sued for approximately,basing that amount on invoices provided by the local county water authority.after the complaint was filed,the water authority discovered that it had misread the defendant water meters.correction of this error left less than in dispute.id.at.
we found that the water authority correction of its error was a subsequent event under paul.in summarizing the rationale for this holding,we said 
in the instant case,an independent third party with otherwise no connection to the case made an apparently error so that the at the time of filing,in fact,exceeded the jurisdictional minimum.coventry had no reason to know that its claimed amount of damages was in error.moreover,the reduction of the amount in controversy resulted from acts occurring wholly after the action commenced.
id.at.spielman argues that we should exercise jurisdiction here based on a similar rationale.we decline.
coventry sewage is inapposite.unlike the water authority in coventry sewage,the tax board did not reduce an initial assessment of the damages amount that exceeded the jurisdictional minimum.here there was considerable question at the outset as to whether spielman damages amount met the jurisdictional question that the trial judge raised but deferred resolution of when he issued the stay.spielman included as damages in taxes that he owed independently of any act or omission by genzyme development,and he boosted his claim over the jurisdictional minimum by adding from a source he never identified.the state tax board ruling thus confirmed what had been apparent earlier spielman attempt to meet the jurisdictional minimum was in vain from the beginning 
spielman chapter attorney fees claim 
spielman argues that his attorney fees should be included as part of his anticipated damages.normally,attorney fees are excluded from the determination because the successful party does not collect his attorney fees in addition to or as part of the judgment.velez crown life ins,cir citing moore federal practice.there are two exceptions to this rule when the fees are provided for by contract,and when a statute mandates or allows payment of the fees.id.the second exception applies here.chapter of the massachusetts consumer protection act allows plaintiffs to collect attorney fees as part of their damages.see.laws ch.we thus must decide whether spielman met the minimum by amending his complaint to include a chapter claim.
spielman does not allege,however,that his individual attorney fees are high enough to boost his damages claim over the minimum.rather he seeks,for jurisdictional purposes,to aggregate the attorney fees that he anticipates will be needed to press the claim of the entire class for which he is named plaintiff.because of supreme court precedent,this is a difficult argument to make.
as we have noted,the statute that provides for federal court diversity jurisdiction,a,requires that the matter in controversy exceed the jurisdictional minimum.based on this language,t he traditional judicial interpretation has been from the beginning that the separate and distinct claims of two or more plaintiffs can not be aggregated in order to satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement.snyder harris,d citing earlier cases.in snyder,the court rejected the argument that this rule should not apply to class action plaintiffs,whose claims,the argument goes,should instead be aggregated for jurisdictional purposes.the court said 
to overrule the aggregation doctrine at this late date would run counter to the congressional purpose in steadily increasing through the years the jurisdictional amount requirement.that purpose was to check,to some degree,the rising caseload of the federal courts,especially with regard to the federal courts diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.
id.at.the court reaffirmed this holding in zahn international paper,d,adding,neither are we inclined to overrule snyder harris nor to change the court construction of the matter in controversy requirement of.id.at.
the supreme court has not discussed whether the named plaintiff in a class action may aggregate the attorney fees of the class to satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement when a state statute like massachusetts chapter authorizes the awarding of fees to a successful litigant.two circuits have addressed this question.reviewing a claim made under a california statute that authorizes attorney fees,the ninth circuit held that aggregating anticipated fees to the named plaintiff to allow her to meet the requirement would conflict with the policy of zahn in which the supreme court reaffirmed that the matter in controversy requirement must be satisfied by each member of the plaintiff class.goldberg cpc int l,cir,cert.denied,d.the court thus held that potential attorney fees could not be used to satisfy the minimum.id.at.several district courts have followed this approach.see,karofsky abbott.ratliff sears,roebuck.quebe ford motor.visintine saab auto,gilman wheat,first.
the fifth circuit considered the question of whether attorney fees may be aggregated to obtain federal jurisdiction under a louisiana statute that specifically authorizes the awarding of attorney fees in a class action.in re abbott,cir,determined that there was federal jurisdiction for a class action claim governed by article of the louisiana code of civil procedure.article provides the court may allow the representative parties their reasonable expenses of litigation,including attorney fees,when as a result of the class action a fund is made a
