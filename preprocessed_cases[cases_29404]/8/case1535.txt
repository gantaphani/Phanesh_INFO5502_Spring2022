plaintiff penguin group usa penguin appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york gerard lynch,judge granting defendant american buddha motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss penguin copyright infringement action for lack of personal jurisdiction.penguin group usa am.buddha,civ,wl,dist.lexis.penguin alleges in its complaint that american buddha unlawfully uploaded to servers an unauthorized copy of four of penguin copyrighted works for downloading,via the internet and free of charge,by any of the members of what american buddha terms its online library.
the sole issue on appeal is whether there is a basis for personal jurisdiction over american buddha in new york enabling the district court to decide this dispute.penguin asserted that the court has such jurisdiction under a provision of new york statute,a ii,that allows for jurisdiction over an defendant with no contacts with new york,if,inter alia,the defendant is alleged to have committed a tortious act outside the state that caused,and reasonably should have been expected by the putative defendant to cause,injury to a person or property within the state.
the district court recognized two competing lines of authority interpreting section a ii,one that views the situs of injury as the location of the infringing conduct and one that views the situs of injury as the location of the plaintiff and,in some cases,the location of its intellectual property.relying on the first line of authority and rejecting the second,the court concluded that the situs of the injury allegedly resulting from the asserted infringement of penguin copyrights would be where the book was electronically in arizona or oregon,where american buddha and its computer servers were not new york,where penguin was headquartered.accordingly,the court dismissed the case for failure adequately to plead injury in new york.penguin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
determining the situs of injury for the purposes of a ii in a copyright case requires analysis of state law and policy considerations that this court is to make.specifically,it requires a determination of how the new york state legislature intended to weigh the breadth of protection to new yorkers whose copyrights have allegedly been infringed against the burden on alleged infringers whose connection to new york may be remote and who may reasonably have failed to foresee that their actions would have consequences in new york.
we therefore certify the following question to the new york court of appeals in copyright infringement cases,is the situs of injury for purposes of determining jurisdiction under a ii the location of the infringing action or the residence or location of the principal place of business of the copyright holder although penguin has not effectively pleaded that the situs of injury is affected by the fact that the infringement here occurred through the media of the internet and an online library,we recognize that this factor may be relevant to the considerations underlying the definition of the situs of injury due to the speed and ease with which the internet may allow out of state actions to cause injury to copyright holders resident in new york.
background 
the plaintiff,penguin group usa,describes itself as the arm of the internationally renowned penguin group,a leading united states trade book publisher and the trade book publisher in the world,with its principal place of business in new york city.appellant br.at.american buddha describes itself as an oregon nonprofit corporation that,through its operation of a passive website known as the ralph nader library but unaffiliated in any way with ralph nader,operates an online library that provides access to classical literature and other works through the website,including three works published in print format by penguin group usa appellee br.at footnotes omitted.
penguin brought this copyright infringement action against american buddha under,alleging that american buddha infringed on penguin copyrights in four by publishing complete copies of them on coordinated comprising online libraries that it operates called the american buddha online library and the ralph nader library.american buddha has made these works available to its members free of charge.it has also provided its members with assurances that american buddha uploading of these works and the users downloading of the works do not constitute copyright infringement because they are protected under sections and of the copyright act,et,which govern fair use and reproduction by libraries and archives,respectively.penguin disputes that any exception to the copyright act applies to american buddha conduct.
american buddha,as noted,is an oregon corporation whose principal place of business is in arizona and whose websites are hosted on servers located in arizona and oregon.aside from the accessability of its sites in new york,american buddha conducts no business in,and has no other contacts with,the state.the infringing conduct was not alleged to have occurred in new york.
american buddha filed a motion in the district court to dismiss penguin complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of personal jurisdiction.penguin asserted personal jurisdiction under new york statute.american buddha was not subject to the jurisdiction of courts in new york under a conferring jurisdiction over a party that transacts any business within the state or contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the state or a conferring jurisdiction over a party that commits a tortious act within the state.penguin therefore premised its claim of jurisdiction on a ii,which,under specified circumstances,allows for jurisdiction over residents who commit tortious acts outside of the state if the resulting injury occurs in,and it was foreseeable to the prospective defendant that the injury would occur in,new york the central question for the district court,in deciding whether it had personal jurisdiction over the defendant with respect to the claims made in the complaint,was whether the injury from the alleged infringement by american buddha occurred in new york.
the district court granted american buddha motion to dismiss because it found the situs of injury to be where the electronic copying of the works was,although this was not explicitly stated by the court,in arizona or oregon,where the servers to which american buddha uploaded the works were not in new york,where penguin headquarters is located.penguin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court recognized a division of authority as to how to determine the situs of injury for the purposes of a ii.it was ultimately persuaded by a line of cases recognizing the principle requiring a direct injury in new york and rejecting jurisdiction based on purely derivative economic injury suffered solely because of the location of the plaintiff business,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the court recognized that the internet was a complicating factor for personal jurisdiction analysis.it nonetheless concluded that in this case,the internet plays no role in determining the situs of plaintiff alleged injury because a single incident of copyright infringement that occurred in oregon or arizona was alleged downloading of that copied material by users in other locations,including hypothetically new york,was not,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.

discussion 
introduction 
there is only one issue presented on appeal,which is whether,for the purposes of new york statute,the situs of injury in copyright infringement cases is the location of the infringing conduct or the location of the plaintiff and,perhaps,the copyright.the language of the statute provides insufficient guidance to allow us to answer that question based on the statute plain meaning.and while penguin has not specifically pleaded that the situs of injury is influenced by the fact that the alleged infringement here was conducted by means of the internet and online libraries,we recognize that this fact may affect the analysis.
we find insufficient guidance to answer the question of where the situs of injury is located in the text of the statute,the statute legislative history,or the jurisprudence of new york state courts.the district court did not have the ability to ask the new york court of appeals for guidance.we do.we therefore certify to the new york court of appeals this question in copyright infringement cases,is the situs of injury for purposes of determining jurisdiction under a ii the location of the infringing action or the residence or location of the principal place of business of the copyright holder 
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal of an action for want of personal jurisdiction de novo,construing all pleadings and affidavits in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and resolving all doubts in the plaintiff favor.distefano carozzi,cir per curiam.
iii.new york statute 
a plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction over a person or entity against whom it seeks to bring suit.in re magnetic audiotape antitrust,cir per curiam.in order to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that jurisdiction exists.thomas ashcroft,cir.such a showing entails making legally sufficient allegations of jurisdiction,including an averment of facts that,if credited,would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.in re magnetic audiotape,at internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
in litigation arising under federal statutes that do not contain their own jurisdictional provisions,such as the copyright act under which suit is brought in the case at bar,federal courts are to apply the personal jurisdiction rules of the forum state,see fort knox music,baptiste.cir,provided that those rules are consistent with the requirements of due process,see metro.life ins,cir.except where the statute permits jurisdiction to the extent permitted by principles of due it commonly does in states other than new under due process principles is not necessary unless there is jurisdiction under the applicable state statute.see best van lines,walker,cir savin ranier,cir.
in new york,the question of personal jurisdiction over an defendant is governed by the only basis for personal jurisdiction over american buddha in new york that is asserted by penguin is provided by section a ii.it provides for jurisdiction over an defendant who commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state,if he expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce 
in order to establish jurisdiction under that subsection of the law,a plaintiff is thus required to demonstrate that the defendant tortious act was committed outside new york,the cause of action arose from that act,the tortious act caused an injury to a person or property in new york,the defendant expected or should reasonably have expected that his or her action would have consequences in new york,and the defendant derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce.lamarca.
only the third requirement of section a ii is in dispute on this appeal whether the defendant allegedly conduct in oregon or arizona caused the requisite injury in new york.
if these five requirements were satisfied and personal jurisdiction were thus established under new york law,we would then assess whether a finding of personal jurisdiction comports with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.best van lines,at savin,at.for reasons explained below,we do not reach that issue on this appeal.
iv.the situs of injury under a ii 
neither the new york court of appeals nor this court has decided what the situs of injury is in an intellectual property case.district courts in this circuit that have addressed the question have reached disparate results,some concluding that the injury occurs where the plaintiff experiences the loss some concluding that it depends where the infringed property is held,apparently assuming that the property is held at its owner residence or principal place of business and some concluding that the injury occurs where the infringing conduct took place.see section iv e,infra.
a.the district court analysis of the situs of injury 
the district court recognized a division of authority as to the situs of injury for purposes of section a ii in intellectual property infringement cases.the court was persuaded by decisions that suggested or concluded that the situs of injury is where the infringing conduct occurred in this case,oregon or arizona rather than where the plaintiff is located and the copyrights are owned in this case,new york.penguin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
new york has long held that the residence or domicile of the injured party within a state is not a sufficient predicate for jurisdiction,which must be based upon a more direct injury within the state and a closer expectation of consequences within the state than the indirect financial loss resulting from the fact that the injured person resides or is domiciled there.

the principal factual question addressed in the course of the district court analysis was where the plaintiff lost business,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing am.eutectic welding alloys sales,dytron alloys.cir.the court analyzed this case as a copyright infringement action it did not explicitly consider the impact,if any,of the means by which the alleged infringement was use of an online library delivered through the internet.because penguin pleaded infringement only by american buddha,and not by any individual who downloaded material from american buddha site,the court reasoned that business was lost through the copying of the copyrighted works by american buddha and not through their placement on the internet,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the business was therefore lost where the books were or where they were downloaded and used,which could have been anywhere that the internet is available,including new york.id.
penguin arguments regarding the situs of injury 
on appeal,penguin contends that the district court relied on the wrong line of cases both as a matter of law and as a matter of policy.as a legal matter,penguin argues that those cases are inconsistent with the reasoning of distefano carozzi,cir per curiam,in which we concluded that the termination of employment of an employee at a meeting in new jersey caused the employee injury in new york state,because new york was where the employee lived and where he performed the duties of his employment.from a policy perspective,penguin argues that 
t he restrictive reading of the statute under the line of cases followed by the district court would the deck against the authors,publishers and other intellectual proprietors in new york in the accelerating struggle against internet piracy,allowing pirates with the entire arsenal of digital infringement tools to shelter behind a personal jurisdiction model based on their physical location.
appellant br.at.
legislative history of a ii 
the legislative history of a is of little assistance.the provision was adopted to fill a gap in the new york statute that was recognized in feathers mclucas.there,the new york court of appeals declined to apply section a,which provides for jurisdiction over any person who commits a tortious act within the state,to a manufacturer whose negligent construction of a gas tank in kansas had caused bodily injury in new york state,at,at,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the following year,according to a memorandum of the new york judicial conference,the new york state legislature adopted section a for the purpose of broaden ing new york jurisdiction so as to include who cause tortious injury in the state by an act or omission without the state.mem.of judicial conference,sess.laws mckinney as quoted in reyes,misc d.according to that memorandum,the amendment was intended to be broad enough to protect new york residents yet not so broad,even though constitutionally feasible,as to burden unfairly whose connection with the state is remote and who could not reasonably be expected to foresee that their acts outside of new york could have harmful consequences in new york.id.
we have not found in the legislative history any discussion of how to strike this balance in commercial tort cases much less internet copyright infringement cases,with respect to which the new york court of appeals has acknowledged that the locus of injury is not as readily identifiable as it is in torts causing physical harm.sybron wetzel.
penguin advocates an approach that emphasizes protection of new york residents or domiciliaries,while american buddha advocates an one that persuaded the district focuses on avoiding unjust burdens on whose connection with the state may be tenuous or remote.we think that deciding which approach better comports with the intent of the new york legislature is more appropriate for the new york court of appeals than it is for us.
new york courts interpretation of a ii 
the new york court of appeals has never squarely applied.a ii in the intellectual property context.lower new york courts that have addressed section a ii have not provided a clear indication of how the court of appeals would apply the section to the case we are presented with here.
it is settled new york law that the suffering of economic damages in new york is insufficient,on its own,to establish a direct injury in new york for a purposes.fantis foods,at,at,at rejecting jurisdiction based on loss of overall sales where conversion of goods occurred en route from greece to chicago sybron,at,at,at recognizing that courts have concluded that remote injuries located in new york solely because of domicile or incorporation here do not satisfy cplr subd.a,par.lehigh valley indus.birenbaum,cir s ection a is not satisfied by remote or consequential injuries such as lost commercial profits which occur in new york only because the plaintiff is domiciled or doing business here.
from this premise,some new york courts have concluded that the situs of injury is the location where the actions or events associated with the injury took place.see,hermann sharon,dep t the situs of the injury is the location of the original event which caused the injury,not the location where the resultant damages are subsequently felt by the plaintiff.internal citations omitted weiss greenburg,traurig,askew,hoffman,lipoff,quentel wolff,dep t i t has been held that the situs of a nonphysical,commercial injury is where the critical events associated with the dispute took place.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
but in cases in which something more than economic injury is alleged,some new york courts have determined the situs of injury to be the place where the plaintiff is located and conducts business.most prominently,in sybron,the case in which the new york court of appeals recognized the applicability of section a to commercial torts,the court decided that domicile or incorporation in new york state alone was insufficient as a basis for personal jurisdiction.it concluded,however,that jurisdiction was appropriate where the plaintiff had additional ties to the state,such as the presence of the trade secrets and the threatened loss of customers here.sybron,at,at,at.
the ties to new york state in sybron were stronger than those in the case at bar.sybron involved the alleged loss of a new customer base and the alleged acquisition of trade secrets in new york,at,at,at.its holding therefore does not dictate the result of this appeal.but sybron does raise a reasonable likelihood that the new york court of appeals may interpret the alleged wrong is analogous to a commercial tort and involves both the presumptive presence of intellectual property rights in the state,and the likely ability of the plaintiff to foresee that the distribution of the copyrighted material in issue will cause loss beyond that caused by the initial unauthorized uploading of the copyrighted involve more than derivative economic harm within the state.penguin has alleged infringement not only through the copying of its copyrighted work,but also through the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of the works over the internet.compl.penguin presented evidence that american buddha had offered the materials to its users via the internet free of charge,and had provided assurances that downloading the works would not constitute copyright infringement.penguin has not asserted the foreseeable loss of customers in new york,and apparently for this reason the district court treated the alleged infringement to be analogous to an unauthorized photocopy of a copyrighted book in oregon or arizona.penguin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we note nonetheless in the context of certifying a question to the new york court of appeals that the allegation of distribution over the internet may be a factor in the court interpretation of the statute in question.
legal arguments for and against finding new york to be the situs of injury 
legal arguments in favor of deeming new york to be the situs of injury.penguin strongest legal argument would appear to be an argument based on the logic this court employed in distefano.the question there was the location of the situs of injury for section a purposes where an employee who lived and worked in new york was fired at a meeting held in new jersey.distefano,at.
we concluded that to determine whether there is an injury in new york sufficient to warrant a jurisdiction,courts must generally apply a test,which asks them to locate the original event which caused the injury.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.this original event is,however,generally distinguished not only from the initial tort but from the final economic injury and the felt consequences of the tort.id.quoting bank brussels lambert fiddler gonzalez rodriguez,cir.t he original event occurs where the first effect of the tort that ultimately produced the final economic injury is located.id.at internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
in distefano case,the original event occurred in new york because the original event was distefano experience of being removed from his job.id.at.distefano experienced the first effect of losing his job in new york,even though he was fired in new jersey.id.penguin argues that similarly here,although the copying that allegedly infringed its copyright occurred in oregon or arizona,penguin experienced the effect of the infringing conduct in new york,where its business was located and its copyright was located for present purposes.see,e,appellant br.at alleging that the injury was experienced by penguin in new york,where its offices and personnel are located,and where its copyrights are held calder jones,concluding that jurisdiction over florida defamation defendants in california satisfied due process standards because the defendants wrote and edited article they knew would have a potentially devastating impact upon the plaintiff,a california resident.
although we have never extended this logic to conclude that there was jurisdiction in new york courts over a defendant in an intellectual property dispute,district courts in this circuit have.see,ingenium techs,d,the torts of copyright and trademark infringement cause injury in the state where the allegedly infringed intellectual property is held.design tex group,vinyl,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,b ecause the plaintiffs and their intellectual property are based in new york,the injury is felt within the state no matter where the infringement takes place.similarly,in savage universal grazier,civ,wl,dist.lexis,the district court found the situs of injury under section a to be new york state where an defendant committed trademark infringement that affected a new defendant website through damage to its goodwill,lost sales,or lost customers,wl at,dist.lexis,at citing citigroup city holding,d.
although,as noted,penguin does allege copyright infringement through the distribution of its copyrighted work over the internet,compl,penguin does not specifically allege the loss of customers or other direct harm in new york,distinguishing this case from most of those cited,see,citigroup,d at.but these cases can be read to suggest that the injury from the infringement of an intellectual property r
