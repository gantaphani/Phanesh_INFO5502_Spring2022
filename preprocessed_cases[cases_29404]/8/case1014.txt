this appeal requires us to traverse largely unexplored terrain concerning the operation of the and work product privileges.the underlying controversy arises out of a subpoena duces tecum issued by a federal grand jury to a corporation,seeking records pertaining to the affairs of a subsidiary.although the corporation and the subsidiary waived all claims of privilege,the subsidiary former attorney and two of its former officers intervened and moved to quash the subpoena.they claimed that the subsidiary had entered into a longstanding joint defense agreement with the former officers and contended that the subpoenaed materials were privileged and,thus,not amenable to disclosure.the district court eschewed an evidentiary hearing and denied the motion to quash,but stayed production of the documents pending appeal.
we affirm the district court order.we hold that an individual privilege may exist in these circumstances only to the extent that communications made in a corporate officer personal capacity are separable from those made in his corporate capacity.because the intervenors do not allege that any of the subpoenaed documents are solely privileged to them but rest instead on the theory that all the documents are jointly privileged,their claim,as a matter of law,does not survive the subsidiary waiver.the joint defense agreement does not demand a different result privileges are created,and their contours defined,by operation of law,and private agreements can not enlarge their scope.moreover,this particular joint defense agreement is unenforceable.
we have a second,independently sufficient ground for our decision.the denial of the motion to quash must be upheld in all events because the intervenors failed to generate a descriptive list of the documents alleged to be privileged.
background 
we start by recounting the events leading to this appeal.consistent with the secrecy that typically attaches to grand jury matters,see.e,this case has gone forward under an order sealing the proceedings,the briefs,and the parties proffers.to preserve that confidentiality,we use fictitious names for all affected persons and corporations.
on march,massachusetts corporation in the business of processing,packaging,and distributing food into a plea agreement with the united states attorney for the district of massachusetts.under the agreement terms,oldco pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue service and agreed to cooperate with the government ongoing investigation of certain present and former officers,employees,and customers.as part of this cooperation,oldco expressly waived applicable and work product privileges.soon thereafter,a federal grand jury issued a subpoena duces tecum to oldco parent corporation,newparent,demanding the production of documents relating to its rebate program a program under which,according to the government,oldco would charge certain complicit customers more than the going rate for its products,but would then refund the difference by payments made directly to principals of these customers.
at the time the subpoena was served,oldco was a subsidiary of newparent.its records were in the possession of newparent counsel,a law firm that we shall call smith jones.newparent had acquired oldco in june of,but the grand jury investigation focused on conduct that occurred prior to the acquisition date.during that earlier period,oldco had operated as a closely held corporation,owned by a number of members of a single family one family member richard roe served as its board chairman and chief executive officer,and another morris moe served on the board and as executive for sales and marketing.nameless lawyer was oldco principal outside counsel.these three,moe,and in the proceedings and filed a motion to quash the subpoena.
the factual premise for the motion to quash is derived largely from lawyer affidavit.he states that while representing oldco he also represented roe and moe in various individual matters.moreover,he claims to have conducted this simultaneous representation of corporate and individual clients under a longstanding joint defense agreement.according to lawyer,this agreement,although never committed to writing,provided that communications among the three clients were jointly privileged and could not be released without unanimous consent.despite the absence of any reference to this agreement in the corporate was no resolution or other vote of the board of directors authorizing oldco to participate in such an intervenors assert that roe,as chief executive officer,had the authority to commit the corporation to it.
pertinently,lawyer claims to have represented oldco and its officers in connection with the grand jury investigation from and after october when the grand jury served oldco with an earlier subpoena requesting the production of certain customer records.he says that the oral joint defense agreement applies to this representation and that he told the government that he represented oldco and all of its executives.
there is,to be sure,a written joint defense agreement entered into by and between lawyer,as counsel for,and smith jones,as counsel for however,that agreement was not executed until the fall of by which time lawyer was no longer representing oldco.there is no evidence in the voluminous record apart from lawyer affidavit that any joint defense agreement existed before that time.moreover,the intervenors neglected to mention the existence of an oral joint defense agreement when newparent acquired oldco and likewise failed to incorporate any reference to such a pact into the subsequent written agreement.
notwithstanding these discrepancies,the intervenors solemnly maintain that the oral joint defense agreement existed from forward that its terms apply to the grand jury investigation and that it gives them a joint mention both and work product the oldco documents currently in the hands of smith jones.but they do not identify any particular documents as privileged,nor do they specify the reasons why certain communications should be considered privileged.thus,like soothsayers scrutinizing the entrails of a goat,we are left to scour the record for indications of what these documents might be and what they might contain.as best we can tell,some of the documents comprise transcripts of interviews with oldco employees including roe and moe others comprise lawyer written summaries of oldco internal investigation into the rebate program.
not surprisingly,the government and oldco both filed oppositions to the intervenors motion to quash.in response,the intervenors sought leave to present immunized evidence with respect to the privilege claims.they also filed a formal offer of proof and requested an evidentiary hearing.the district court denied the motion to quash at a hearing held on july,thereby implicitly denying the intervenors other requests.this expedited appeal ensued.
ii.justiciability 
we turn first to a pair of threshold questions that implicate our authority to hear and determine this appeal.neither question need occupy us for long.
first,we are satisfied that roe,moe,and lawyer were properly allowed to intervene in the proceedings below for the purpose of pursuing quashal of the subpoena.intervention is appropriate as of right when the disposition of an action may impair or impede the applicant cognizable interest.a.colorable claims of and work product privilege qualify as sufficient interests to ground intervention as of right.see in re grand jury proceedings diamante,cir implying that the existence of a privileged relationship or of a legitimate property or privacy interest in the documents possessed by the third party is sufficient to establish standing.clearly,those interests would be forfeited if newparent were to comply with the grand jury,as matters now stand,newparent has no incentive to protect the intervenors interests.consequently,this is a textbook example of an entitlement to intervention as of right.
second,although denial of a motion to quash a subpoena is not usually considered a final judgment and thus is not ordinarily an appealable event,we believe that we have appellate jurisdiction in this instance.an exception to the requirement of finality exists when a substantial privilege claim can not effectively be tested by the through a contemptuous refusal to produce the documents.fdic ogden,cir see also perlman united states.recognizing that,as a practical matter,denials of an intervenor motion to quash a subpoena must be immediately appealable because no effective remedy otherwise would exist.courts have invoked this exception when,as now,a client who is herself a party or a grand jury target seeks to appeal an order compelling her attorney to produce allegedly privileged materials.ogden,at accord in re grand jury subpoenas,cir.although in this case the documents are in the hands of newparent counsel rather than in the custody of the intervenors counsel,this only reinforces the essential fact that,absent an immediate appeal,the allegedly privileged material will be disclosed.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal.
iii.the merits 
this appeal presents a smorgasbord of legal issues,but we must forgo the temptation to sample them all.instead,we masticate only those issues that are necessary to a principled resolution of the matter.
we begin by discussing the ramifications of roe and moe claim that they were individual clients of lawyer with respect to the grand jury investigation.we conclude that although such individual representation might have occurred in theory,no individual privilege exists as to documents in which oldco also has a privilege.because no independently enforceable privilege is alleged here,the corporation waiver is effective for all communications covered by the subpoena,notwithstanding the existence vel non of the oral joint defense agreement.in all events,the intervenors failed adequately to inform the district court of the particular communications to which their claims of privilege allegedly attached.in the pages that follow,we proceed to discuss these issues one by one.
privilege claims.
because the and work product privileges differ,we treat them separately.
individual privilege claims.the privilege protects communications made in confidence by a client to his attorney.see,united states.inst.of,cir limning the scope of the privilege.because it stands in the way of a grand jury right to every man evidence,the privilege applies only to the extent necessary to achieve its underlying goal of ensuring effective representation through open communication between lawyer and client.see fisher united states,d.
roe and moe can mount a claim of privilege only if,and to the extent that,lawyer represented them individually.if the only privilege at stake is that of their corporate employer,then oldco waiver defeats the claim of privilege.after all,the law is settled that a corporation privilege may be waived by current management.see cftc weintraub,d w hen control of a corporation passes to new management,the authority to assert and waive the corporation attorney client privilege passes as well.
it is often difficult to determine whether a corporate officer or employee may claim an privilege in communications with corporate counsel.the default assumption is that the attorney only represents the corporate entity,not the individuals within the corporate sphere,and it is the individuals burden to dispel that presumption.see united states bay state ambul.hosp.rental,cir.this makes perfect sense because an employee has a duty to assist his employer counsel in the investigation and defense of matters pertaining to the employer business.see united states sawyer.
to determine when this presumption bursts,several courts have adopted the test explicated in in re bevill,bresler schulman asset mgmt,cir.that test enumerates five benchmarks that corporate employees seeking to assert a personal claim of privilege must meet 
first,they must show they approached counsel for the purpose of seeking legal advice.second,they must demonstrate that when they approached counsel they made it clear that they were seeking legal advice in their individual rather than in their representative capacities.third,they must demonstrate that the counsel saw fit to communicate with them in their individual capacities,knowing that a possible conflict could arise.fourth,they must prove that their conversations with counsel were confidential.and fifth,they must show that the substance of their conversations with counsel did not concern matters within the company or the general affairs of the company.

we think that bevill general framework is sound.of course,the first four elements of its test are most relevant when an attorney disputes a corporate officer claim of individual privilege.here,however,lawyer affidavit makes it clear that he represented both roe and moe in their personal capacities.thus,even though the intervenors brief does not specifically address the bevill factors,we assume for argument sake that the first four prongs of the test are satisfied.
with respect to the final prong,the government claims that all of roe and moe communications were within the orbit of oldco general affairs,and therefore could not be individually privileged.in the government view,bevill precludes a finding of individual representation with respect to as the grand jury investigation into the rebate involve the corporation.we do not read bevill so grudgingly.as the tenth circuit explained 
the fifth prong of in matter of bevill,properly interpreted,only precludes an officer from asserting an individual attorney client privilege when the communication concerns the corporation rights and responsibilities.however,if the communication between a corporate officer and corporate counsel specifically focuses upon the individual officer personal rights and liabilities,then the fifth prong of in matter of bevill can be satisfied even though the general subject matter of the conversation pertains to matters within the general affairs of the company.
grand jury proceedings,at.we adopt this interpretation and conclude that,theoretically,lawyer could have represented roe and moe individually with respect to the grand jury investigation.still,this relationship would extend only to those communications which involved roe and moe individual rights and responsibilities arising out of their actions as officers of the corporation.
the corporation right to waive the privilege.having concluded that there are potentially some communications protected by the privilege,we next consider the effect of oldco waiver of that privilege.the major are others,but we need not discuss them that the individuals allegedly protected communications with lawyer do not appear to be distinguishable from discussions between the same parties in their capacities as corporate officers and corporate counsel,respectively,anent matters of corporate concern.the intervenors propose that such dual communications be treated as jointly privileged such that the consent of all parties would be required to waive the privilege.but they fail to cite authority supporting this position,and we ultimately decline to accept it permitting a joint privilege of this type would unduly broaden the privilege by allowing parties outside a given relationship to prevent disclosure of statements made by the client.
the reference to an alleged joint defense agreement does little to advance the intervenors argument on this point.the joint defense privilege protects communications between an individual and an attorney for another when the communications are part of an ongoing and joint effort to set up a common defense strategy.bay state,at citation omitted.because the privilege sometimes may apply outside the context of actual litigation,what the parties call a joint defense privilege is more aptly termed the common interest rule.see united states schwimmer,cir.even when that rule applies,however,a party always remains free to disclose his own communications.see in re grand jury subpoena duces tecum,cir.thus,the existence of a joint defense agreement does not increase the number of parties whose
