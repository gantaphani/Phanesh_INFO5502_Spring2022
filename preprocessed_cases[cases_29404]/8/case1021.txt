background 
we highlight from the voluminous record the following facts relevant to these appeals.
standard register provides document management systems and services to companies within the health care,financial,and general business markets.on january,standard register acquired its competitor,uarco,where cummings,at the time years old,had worked for seventeen years as a national account director nad in health care sales for the northeastern united states.this area included all of new england,new york,new jersey and the philadelphia metropolitan area.
standard register had a similar position to cummings called a national account manager nam.for the northeast region,standard register assigned two nams pamela pedler,age,covered new england and the new york metropolitan area,and timothy gabb,age,covered the mideast area,which extended westward from pennsylvania into ohio.as a result of the merger,standard register had an overlapping sales force in the northeast,with pedler,gabb,and cummings covering some of the same regions.standard register directed ted stark,the head of standard register national healthcare accounts,to integrate the sales force and eliminate overlapping sales areas.
to do this,stark decided to divide the new york metropolitan area into two different regions.in filling the positions,stark reassigned gabb to the new york metropolitan area,and reduced pedler sales region to the new england area.stark then hired old jed cavadas,a former uarco employee,to represent the firm in the mideast area.cummings was not offered a position.stark advised cummings to contact two regional sales managers for other sales openings,but both managers told cummings that they had none available.cummings employment thus ended.
on december,cummings brought an action in massachusetts superior court,alleging that standard register had terminated his employment on account of his age according to cummings,stark informed him that he was being terminated because he did not fit standard register model of someone young,handsome,aggressive,a little arrogant,and just like jed cavadas.cummings also alleged that the six different,nondiscriminatory reasons offered by standard register at various times were pretexts for age animus.standard register removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction,on february.
during discovery,cummings and standard register sought to reach informal and formal agreements concerning the production of documents and taking of depositions.on march,cummings made an informal request for the production of the personnel files of pedler,gaab,and cavadas.cummings served a formal request for these same documents on april.on april,standard register agreed to produce the documents on the condition that they be viewed only by cummings attorney and his staff.cummings filed an emergency motion to compel production of the documents without the stipulation on april,five days before standard register response to the formal request was officially due.included in the motion was a request for attorney fees for expenses incurred in filing the emergency motion.the magistrate judge granted the emergency motion but denied the request for attorney fees because the motion had been filed prior to the expiration of the thirty day time period in which standard register response was due.cummings filed a motion to reconsider which was denied by the district court on october.
trial commenced on january.in presenting his case,cummings offered the deposition testimony of two former standard register employees,john weatherly and michael talley,who believed that they also were victims of age discrimination.weatherly,who worked as a field engineer in nashville,tennessee stated that beginning in,his boss,gabe perkins,indicated that he would be terminating weatherly because he and other employees were too old to do the job and because the older guys and guys like him just did have the stamina to keep up with this.weatherly also testified that perkins comments to him and others were like a broken record about these men.talley worked as a sales representative in seattle,washington from to.talley testified that his supervisor,rick campbell,repeatedly told him that standard register needed to make room for young blood.talley also stated that after he was replaced by a younger employee,he filed an age discrimination complaint with the eeoc,which was removed to federal court and ultimately settled.
cummings also introduced live testimony from his economic expert,martin duffy.duffy testified to cummings future losses as a result of being terminated by standard register to calculate this,duffy used cummings uarco salary and bonus,which totaled,as a base salary.using the average earnings increases cited by the bureau of labor statistics bls for salaried workers in the economy,duffy increased cummings base salary by per year to estimate his future salary.estimating that cummings would retire at age,adding in the value of future fringe benefits,and subtracting the income and benefits cummings would earn if he continued at his then current employment,duffy arrived at a total estimate for future front pay losses.on direct examination,duffy testified that he estimated that,in,cummings would have earned if he had stayed at standard register,and,in.he further testified that,based on his various assumptions,cummings future losses would total.this figure was the expert first front pay figure.however,he later withdrew it as being in error.
after being,duffy realized that either he or his software had made a mathematical error in applying the estimated annual salary increases,resulting in inflated salary estimates for and all subsequent years.after the court recessed for the evening,duffy performed new calculations.continuing on on the following day,duffy revised his estimate downward.to further complicate the matter,neither on nor on did duffy explicitly state the corrected front pay estimate.instead,he gave a corrected figure for total losses past and future,which was less than his initial estimate for total losses.because the mathematical error did not affect the past losses figure,the corrected estimate for future losses would be.and so,the expert final front pay figure was the figure.
duffy also conceded on that he had not used data specific to standard register,such as its average retirement age and its caps on compensation,nor considered the nature of the health care market in reaching his calculations.in addition,he stated that rather than using the mean of cummings earnings over the past five years as a base,he used cummings salary in,a earnings year.following duffy testimony,standard register made a motion to strike the expert evidence,which the district court denied.
duffy expert report was not introduced into evidence,nor was the posterboard he used during testimony to explain his calculations given to the jury.the jurors did not request a transcript of his testimony.they had only their own notes and memories of his testimony to guide them in arriving at a damages award.
on january,the jury returned a verdict in favor of cummings and awarded him in front pay,in back pay,and in emotional distress damages.the district court struck the emotional distress damage award because it was not included in cummings complaint and,pursuant to.laws ch,doubled the front and back pay awards for a total award of million.cummings standard register,at.june.standard register filed a motion to strike,or in the alternative,to remit,the jury front pay award on the grounds that it was speculative and excessive.the court denied both motions.id.at.
on february,cummings applied for an award of attorney fees for all services rendered in the case,including those rendered by paralegals,law clerks,and associates.the district court reduced the number of hours of compensation for four of the attorneys and the hourly rate for one attorney,and entered an award of attorney fees in the amount of.id.at.adding fees and costs,the court entered final judgment in the amount of on june,id.at.cummings moved to alter or amend the judgment to include interest on the front pay award from the date of the verdict to the date of entry of judgment.on august,the district court denied the motion.
discussion 
the issues raised on appeal are whether the district court erred in i admitting the deposition testimony of weatherly and talley ii admitting the testimony of cummings expert,martin duffy iii refusing to remit the jury front pay award iv failing to grant attorney fees on the motion to compel discovery and v denying cummings motion for prejudgment interest on the front pay award from the date of the verdict to the entry of final judgment.we will address each issue in turn.
evidentiary issues 
standard register claims that other employees allegations of age discrimination were irrelevant and unfairly prejudiced its case.it also argues that duffy failed to meet the requirements for expert testimony under.we review a district court decision to admit or exclude testimony for an abuse of discretion.sheek asia badger,cir.
weatherly and talley testimony 
rule of the federal rules of evidence states that evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.we have noted previously that this standard grants the district court substantial latitude in admitting testimony and for that reason,o nly in exceptional cases will reversible error be found in the district court determination of the probative value of testimony in a particular case.conway electro switch,cir.in admitting weatherly and talley testimony over the objections of standard register,the district court offered the following rationale 
i t seems to me that,that the atmosphere,if you will,at the company is relevant for the purposes of drawing inferences one way or the other so i think that what happened at the company in general and what people heard is indeed relevant to the plaintiff showing that there was an atmosphere that permits the inference he is asking the jury to draw.
we believe that the court did not abuse its discretion under rule.
the sole issue at trial was whether age was a motivating factor in standard register decision to terminate cummings.we have recognized that since discrimination is often subtle and pervasive,plaintiffs must be able to rely on circumstantial evidence to prove discriminatory intent.see id.to this end,evidence of a discriminatory atmosphere may sometimes be relevant to showing the corporate at the time of the termination.see id.while such evidence does not in itself prove a claim of discrimination,see ruíz posadas de san juan,cir,it does tend to add color to the employer decisionmaking processes and to the influences behind the actions taken with respect to the individual plaintiff.conway,at citing sweeney bd.of trs.of keene state,cir see centennial wireless,cir.
standard register challenges the relevancy of the testimony on the ground that it covered different time periods,different supervisors,and different areas of the company.it is true that evidence of discrimination can be too attenuated to justify admission,conway,at,and that testimony to this effect should be let in sparingly.however,evidence of a corporate or a discriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by its failure to coincide precisely with the particular actors or timeframe involved in the specific claim that generated a claim of discriminatory treatment.id.at.rather,the trial court must consider the evidence in light of the entire case and determine whether it provides a basis for reasonable inferences related to the plaintiff claim.see,koster trans world airlines,cir noting that admissibility of anecdotal evidence is often a judgment call,and that while e xclusion would not have been an abuse of discretion,neither was admission goldman first bank,cir anecdotal evidence did not give rise to reasonable inferences supporting plaintiff claim of age discrimination.here,standard register raised,as part of its defense,its national corporate practices of nondiscrimination,making evidence challenging those claims especially relevant.the district court,moreover,carefully weighed the probative value of other employees testimony against its potential prejudicial effects,as evidenced by its exclusion of at least three other depositions in their entirety because they were too remote in time from the termination while the question is close and exclusion of the evidence would not have been error,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting weatherly and talley deposition testimony.see,at stating that evidence of a company general atmosphere is admissible along with other evidence bearing on motive.
of course,decisions to admit or exclude such evidence always demand careful balancing,and it is noteworthy that any prejudicial effects of the testimony were further mitigated in light of the other evidence presented in this case.see.see also kelley airborne freight,cir noting that all probative evidence is prejudicial and that the relevant question is whether the testimony was unfairly prejudicial.first,stark alleged statement to cummings following the termination suggested that he was being terminated because he was too old.schrand fed.pac,cir with no other direct evidence of age discrimination in the case,the impact of the two former employees testimony would be great.the combination of stark statement and evidence of standard register changing reasons for dismissal provided an independent basis for the jury to conclude that the company stated rationales were pretextual and that the real motivation was age animus.the anecdotal testimony was therefore not so central to cummings case that it overwhelmingly influenced the jury verdict.consequently,we do not believe the probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by its potential for prejudice and uphold the district court decision.
testimony of martin duffy 
under rule,a witness may testify to scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge if it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.see daubert merrell dow,d.in admitting such testimony,the trial court must perform a gatekeeping function and decide whether the proposed testimony,including the methodology employed by the witness in arriving at the proffered opinion,rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the facts of the case.ed peters jewelry c j jewelry,cir internal citations omitted.whether a witness meets these criteria is a inquiry,irvine murad skin research,cir,and a question that the law grants the trial judge broad latitude to determine.id.citing kumho tire carmichael,d.
standard register first challenges the methodology employed by duffy in calculating cummings future losses.according to standard register,duffy failure to take into account as the average retirement age of its workers or its salary well as his use of an unusually high earnings year as a base point contributed to an inflated and inaccurate forecast of front pay damages.it may be true that using specific variables would have resulted in a lower,and perhaps more accurate,figure.however,during,duffy offered sufficient explanations for why he chose to use bls data and cummings salary in his calculations see,mcmillan.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to animals,cir upholding an expert regression analysis where her testimony show ed solid reasoning in her determinations to exclude certain variables that the defendants argued should have been included.more importantly,standard register has failed to show how the information duffy did use was incorrect,and does not dispute the district court conclusion that duffy assumptions are ones that economists make with some frequency.see sms.maint.servs.digital,cir requiring that the cumulation of an expert data be consistent with standards of his profession.we agree with the district court that whatever shortcomings existed in duffy calculations went to the weight,not the admissibility,of the testimony and uphold the district court decision to allow it.see mcmillan,at noting that the failure to include particular variables could diminish the testimony probativeness,but would not render it unacceptable.
standard register also highlights duffy computational error that was exposed on the second day he testified.the inflated estimation of cummings salary for the year could raise some red flags concerning the reliability of the predicted front pay damages.however,duffy mistake was not only revealed to the jury,but was duly corrected while he was still on the stand.the district court determined that as a result,standard register could argue,and cummings would have to concede,that duffy report contained errors,allowing the jury room to discredit his testimony accordingly.we do not believe that this was an abuse of the court discretion and affirm its decision to let the testimony stand.see ed peters jewelry,at citing united states schneider,cir emphasizing that the district court has a comparative advantage over an appeals panel in determining relevance and reliability.
standard register next challenges the amount of front pay awarded by the jury.first,standard register argues that the time period covered by the award is unduly speculative.alternatively,standard register assigns as error the district court refusal to remit the jury award based on the fact that it exceeded duffy estimates.we review the district court determination to uphold the jury award for an abuse of discretion,kelley,at,keeping in mind that a jury award is proper if it is based on any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages offered into evidence.beaupre cliff smith,citing kolb goldring,cir.
duration of the front pay award 
we begin by noting that a n award of front pay,constituting as it does,an estimate of what a plaintiff might have earned had been reinstated at the conclusion of trial,is necessarily speculative.kelley,at citing selgas am.airlines,cir.an award of front pay that extends over many years to an estimated retirement date should be examined carefully,however,since the greater the period of time upon which a front pay award is calculated in a case involving an employee the less likely it is that the loss of future earnings can be demonstrated with any degree of certainty or can reasonably be attributed to the illegal conduct of the employer.conway electro switch.additionally,the award must take into account an employee duty to mitigate damages by seeking other employment.id.to sustain a front pay award over a period of fourteen years in this case,therefore,the jury must have sufficient evidence to conclude that cummings would be unable to find employment comparable to standard register until his estimated retirement date,and that the date specified was a plausible one.
examining the damages award in the light most favorable to cummings,kelley,at,we believe that there was a sufficient basis for the jury so to conclude.first,as we have already stated,duffy assumption that cummings was a employee who would retire at age was admissible.the jury was free to credit fully this testimony and conclude that had he not been discriminated against,cummings would have continued to work at standard register until this age.the jury also had evidence that following his termination,cummings had several unsuccessful interviews with various competitors of standard register,including moore business forms,reynolds reynolds,creative business forms,and business forms.cummings also submitted his resume to internet employment services such as headhunter and,but received no response.cummings then acquired one job at ikon,which paid,but was laid off through no fault of his own.finally,after a lengthy period of unemployment,cummings secured a job at kinko which paid him than his job at ikon and substantially less than his salary at standard register.as a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction,we must apply state substantive law to causes of action.under federal law,we have grave doubts as to the sustainability of a front pay award of so great a duration.but the massachusetts cases,as we read them,are more.here,even though cummings did not present any specific evidence concerning the nature of the forms and documents industry,we believe that the jury could have reasonably concluded,based on cummings inability to find comparable employment despite substantial effort,that he was unable to mitigate further and was thus entitled to the lost pay differential until retirement.
award in excess of expert testimony 
after correcting for his computational error,duffy estimated cummings total front pay damages to be.the district court concluded that since duffy offered only a conservative estimate,the jury was allowed some margin to increase the award reasonable minds could certainly question whether duffy provided the jury with enough evidence to arrive at a higher figure,even if the jury used less conservative assumptions such as a later retirement age or a lower discount rate.under massachusetts law,determinations as to the amount of front pay damages are within the common sense of the jury and do not require expert testimony.see,griffin general motors,boothby texon.here,though,there was expert testimony and it was for a figure,and not.on the record,it is far from clear that the jury even attempted to arrive at its own determination of future damages.rather,the record suggests that the jury was simply confused by the expert initial computational error.duffy initial,erroneous estimate for front pay damages was slightly more than.the jury awarded.the similarity here is striking.moreover,there is no clear way to reconstruct how the jury would have arrived at an award of.we think it likely that this was a case of jury confusion,rather than a case of a jury intentionally adjusting an expert figures upwards.this determination,coupled with the very real question as to whether the evidence suffices to support a award,leads us to conclude that cummings must choose between a new trial on the issue of front pay damages,or agree to remit the jury front pay award to.see conde starlight i,cir ordering remittitur or new trial on damages where trial court neglected to discount for present value in calculating remittitur shingleton armor velvet,cir entering remittitur where jury miscalculated damages and mere mechanical correction was required,quoting stapleton kawasaki heavy industries,cir.
