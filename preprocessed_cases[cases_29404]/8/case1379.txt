this appeal is the latest,longest,and perhaps even the last,chapter in a long legal struggle involving a host of trademark and unfair competition claims over the name patsy.patsy italian restaurant,and patsy brand,collectively patsy italian restaurant or appellants appeal from a judgment entered after a jury trial before magistrate judge reyes.anthony banas,anthony patsy,allan zyller,al anthony patsy,realty,and patsy collectively patsy pizzeria or appellees.
patsy italian restaurant appeal raises the following issues i whether the district court erroneously cancelled their service mark registrations ii whether the district court decisions regarding injunctive relief constituted an abuse of discretion and iii whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied their request for attorneys fees.patsy pizzeria raises the following issues i whether their rights were erroneously limited to pizzeria services ii whether the jury verdict that they fraudulently obtained their service mark registration can be upheld iii whether the jury verdict that appellants did not fraudulently obtain their service mark registrations should have been vacated iv whether the district court erroneously refused to reinstate their service mark registration and v whether the district court decisions regarding injunctive relief constituted an abuse of discretion.
we affirm.relevant factual disputes were resolved by the jury,and the district court equitable relief was appropriately balanced and designed to limit ongoing consumer confusion.
background 
to shorten this section and overall opinion,we provide only an overview of the parties,their trademarks,their relationship with one another,and the current dispute.relevant descriptions of the evidence at trial,the jury instructions,and various aspects of the motion practice in the district court will be given in the discussion section when relevant.
a the parties 
appellants are associated with patsy italian restaurant on west street in midtown,new york city.it has been in operation since and is for italian cuisine.the entity patsy italian restaurant,operates the restaurant.patsy brand,was created in to sell packaged food products in association with patsy italian restaurant.at the beginning of this action,patsy italian restaurant,held two federal service registrations issued november,registration the registration and the registration which have since been transferred to patsy brand.the registration is for the stylized mark patsy pr for restaurant services.the registration is for the mark patsy for restaurant services not including pizza.patsy brand also holds registration the registration for the trademark patsy for sauces.
appellees are associated with patsy pizzeria.the original patsy pizzeria opened in in east harlem and claims to have been the first pizzeria to sell pizza by the slice.realty,purchased the original patsy pizzeria in and entered into a licensing agreement with patsy in.under the current agreement,realty owns the real estate and trademarks,whereas patsy is the franchising arm of patsy pizzeria.there are currently six patsy pizzeria locations in manhattan in addition to the original location,the staten island location,and the syosset location.when appropriate,we refer to realty and patsy collectively as the intervening appellees.realty previously received two federal service mark registrations registration the registration and registration the registration.the registration,issued may,was for the mark patsy for restaurant services.the registration,issued december,was for the mark patsy pizzeria for restaurant services.
appellees banas and anthony patsy,are associated with the staten island location of patsy pizzeria,and,when appropriate,are referred to collectively as the staten island appellees.the district court found that,as a matter of law,the staten island location was opened after they obtained a license to use realty marks.appellees banas,zyller,and al anthony patsy,are associated with the syosset location of patsy pizzeria,and,when necessary,are referred to as the syosset appellees.the district court found that,as a matter of law,the syosset location also obtained a license to use realty marks.
b the prior sauce dispute 
the parties coexisted without litigation until each began to sell packaged sauce under the name patsy,thereby causing considerable consumer confusion.on october,the intervening appellees brought a cancellation proceeding before the patent and trademark office the pto seeking the cancellation of patsy brand registration for patsy for sauces.patsy brand responded by filing a cancellation proceeding before the pto seeking the cancellation of realty registration for patsy for restaurant services and registration for patsy pizzeria for restaurant services.patsy brand also filed suit in the southern district against the intervening appellees.the action the sauce litigation alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition due to appellees sale of sauces using the patsy mark.the cancellation proceedings were consolidated and suspended pending resolution of the sauce litigation.
in granting patsy brand a preliminary injunction in the sauce litigation,the district court rejected the intervening appellees argument that they were entitled to bridge the gap into sauces as the senior user of the patsy mark for restaurant services.patsy brand realty patsy brand i.the court reasoned that the mark patsy for restaurant services was weak,as both parties had the right to use the mark for restaurant services.id.at.it also observed that it was unclear when the intervening appellees entered the sauce market,because evidence provided in support of the alleged date of entry was clearly falsified,a fact that suggested that the intervening appellees did not choose their sauce label in good faith.id.at.in a later opinion granting patsy brand motion for summary judgment in the sauce litigation,the district court again reiterated its findings that the intervening appellees presented falsified evidence and ordered them to show cause why they should not be sanctioned for doing so.patsy brand realty patsy brand ii.the district court sanctioned the intervening appellees and enjoined them from petitioning to cancel patsy brand registrations for sauces,other packaged food products,and restaurant services.in addition,it directed the commissioner of the pto to cancel the intervening appellees registration.
on october,patsy brand filed a motion with the pto requesting that the cancellation proceedings be reinstated.this request led to the subsequent judgment cancelling the intervening appellees registration on september.however,after patsy brand filed its request,the intervening appellees filed a notice of appeal in the sauce litigation.notably,this appeal did not challenge the portion of the injunction that enjoined them from petitioning to cancel patsy brand registrations for restaurant services.patsy brand,realty,patsy brand iii,cir.on january,we affirmed the sanctions against the intervening appellees,struck the provision cancelling the intervening appellees registration,and stated that the injunction should be confined to the marketing of pasta sauce and food products and should not reach the intervening appellees restaurant business id.at.
on may,the commissioner erroneously cancelled the intervening appellees registration and registration.on july,after realizing the previous order was erroneous,the commissioner issued an order cancelling the registrations due to realty failure to file declarations of continuing use pursuant to.
c the current action 
on february,appellants brought suit against the staten island appellees for federal and common law trademark infringement,injury to business reputation,and common law unfair competition.the staten island location closed in september.during the course of settlement negotiations,appellants discovered that the syosset location was preparing to open.on october,appellants brought suit against the syosset appellees for federal and common law trademark infringement,federal and common law unfair competition,false designation of origin,and injury to business reputation.the two actions were then consolidated,and realty and patsy intervened,alleging that they had prior use rights to patsy for restaurant services.on november,the syosset appellees,realty,and patsy filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration either that appellees did not infringe appellants marks or that those marks were invalid.after appellants sought a temporary restraining order,judge irizarry issued an order allowing the syosset appellees to open the syosset location as long as the words trattoria impazzire were not used with any materials associated with the restaurant 
in march,appellees filed a motion for summary judgment before the district judge seeking restoration of the registration,cancellation of appellants registration and registration,and the dismissal of appellants claims.the district judge granted restoration of the registration,but denied summary judgment on appellants claims and the request for the cancellations.see generally patsy italian,banas patsy italian rest.i,d.the district court also rejected appellants argument that the injunction from the sauce litigation prohibited appellees from seeking such relief on the ground that the injunction applied only to registrations owned by patsy brand.see id.at.patsy italian restaurant,owned the registrations at issue.id.at.
the parties proceeded to a jury trial before the magistrate judge.the jury found that i realty was the senior user of the marks patsy and patsy pizzeria,and continuously used the marks for pizzeria services but not restaurant services ii there was a likelihood of confusion between appellees marks and appellants and registrations iii the staten island and syosset appellees had exceeded the scope of their license with realty iv realty had abandoned its marks through naked licensing,a lack of adequate quality control over goods and services sold under the mark by the licensees v the staten island appellees engaged in unfair competition and infringed appellants federal and common law marks,but the infringement was not willful vi the syosset appellees engaged in unfair competition and willfully infringed appellants federal and common law marks vii both the staten island appellees and the syosset appellees were likely to injure appellants business reputation viii appellees fraudulently obtained the registration and ix appellants did not fraudulently obtain either the registration or the registration.
after trial,appellants sought an injunction preventing the syosset appellees from using the mark patsy.although this initial request was denied,on april,the district court ordered the syosset location to put up a x sign in its front door that contained,in red capital letters,the statement we are not affiliated with patsy italian restaurant located at west street,new york,ny.
on september,the district court issued a decision dealing with the issues.see generally patsy italian,banas patsy italian rest.iv,d.it denied appellees motions for judgment as a matter of law because appellees failed to make such requests during trial.id.at.the district court also denied appellees various motions for a new trial.id.at.nevertheless,while the district court denied appellees motion for a new trial with regard to the abandonment of their marks,the district court granted their motion to interpret the abandonment verdict narrowly.see id.at.concluding that the jury verdict of abandonment was based on naked licensing but that the jury had not addressed the geographic scope of the naked licensing,id.at,the district court determined that appellees had abandoned their marks only in staten island and syosset.id.at.
with regard to the parties service mark registrations,the district court superseded the prior order reinstating appellees registration,thus refusing reinstatement of the registration,reasoning that the jury verdicts precluded such relief.id.at.however,the district court also determined that appellants and registrations should be cancelled due to appellees limited remaining rights in their marks.id.at.
addressing injunctive relief,the district court permanently enjoined the syosset appellees from using the words trattoria impazzire in connection with their establishment.id.at.additionally,the district court required the syosset appellees to maintain the previously imposed disclaimer sign for not less than three years from the entry of judgment.id.the district court denied appellants requests for further injunctive relief,as well as appellees request for injunctive relief.id.at.however,the district court went on to enter an injunction prohibiting both patsy italian restaurant and patsy pizzeria from using the term patsy alone in connection with their establishments.id.at.
finally,the district court denied appellants request for attorneys fees.id.at.
discussion 
a patsy italian restaurant appeal cancellation of appellants registrations 
patsy italian restaurant advances several arguments that the district court erred in cancelling the and registrations.we address them seriatim.
a cancellation not barred by the prior injunction 
appellants argue that the injunction in the sauce litigation prohibited appellees from seeking cancellation.
the injunction issued in the sauce litigation provided,in relevant part 
that defendants realty,patsy,brija,brecevich,and nick tsoulos,their successors,assigns,officers,directors,servants,employees,distributors,customers,representatives,agents and attorneys,and all persons in active concert and participation with them,or any of them,be and they are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined 
from opposing any application for registration or petitioning to cancel any registration of plaintiff patsy brand for any trademark incorporating patsy for sauces or other packaged food products or restaurant services 
the district court held that the sauce litigation injunction applied only to registrations owned by patsy brand and not to those owned by patsy italian restaurant.
we review a district court interpretation of another court order de novo.see united states spallone,cir.in doing so,we apply traditional principles of contract law and look to the intent of the issuing court.see mastrovincenzo city of new york,cir spallone,at.under traditional principles of contract law,a contract should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.painewebber bybyk,cir quoting am.express bank uniroyal,dep t alteration in original.
appellants essentially argue that we should read plaintiff to include not just patsy brand but also its associate,patsy italian restaurant.however,that would impermissibly stretch the injunction language.whereas defendants,as used in the order,specifically includes their successors,assigns,officers,directors,servants,employees,distributors,customers,representatives,agents and attorneys,and all persons in active concert and participation with them,or any of them,the word plaintiff lacks any such expansion.injunctions are serious orders,enforceable in contempt proceedings,and such an order must give notice of the specific conduct ordered or prohibited.see.d requiring that e very order granting an injunction must state its terms specifically and describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained or required.we therefore read plaintiff to refer only to the party bringing the action.
this interpretation is fully consistent with the context in which the injunction was issued.patsy italian restaurant and patsy pizzeria had peacefully for quite some time.see patsy brand iii,at.this ended only when both parties sought to enter the packaged foods market.see id.at.in the sauce litigation,appellees had sought to cancel only patsy brand registrations and committed misconduct only with regard to the date of first use of their sauces.see id.at.thus,the injunction does not bar appellees counterclaim 
b patsy pizzeria only partially abandoned its marks 
the district court decision to cancel appellants and registrations pursuant to section of the lanham act,codified as amended at,depended on its conclusion that realty had retained some rights even after the jury abandonment finding.patsy italian rest.iv,d at.the district court concluded that,because the jury found that realty continuously used the marks,the finding of abandonment had to have been based on a finding of naked licensing.id.at.appellants do not challenge this reasoning,but argue,rather,that the jury verdict was one of total abandonment.
a district court determination to grant relief pursuant to u.is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,cir s ection use of the permissive may in authorizing courts to grant relief,is distinct from its use of the mandatory shall in requiring any orders or decrees that are entered to be sent to and followed by the pto.appellants argue that our review should be de novo because the district court based its decision on its disagreement with the jury fact findings and its misreading of the lanham act.appellant br.at.however,while claims of factual error or mistakes of law may inform the determination of abuse of discretion,they do not alter the standard of review.
appellants first argue that any finding of naked licensing necessarily acted as a total abandonment of all rights.we disagree.although some forms of trademark abandonment may result in a loss of all rights in the mark,see,feathercombs,solo prods,cir,abandonment of a mark through naked licensing has different effects on the validity of the mark in different markets.see dawn donut hart food stores,cir a finding of naked licensing in the retail market would not result in the loss of trademark rights in the wholesale market.for example,if a restaurant operates in both new york and california,but engages in naked licensing only in california,the restaurant registered mark may lose its significance in california while retaining its significance in new york.thus,naked licensing will lead to an abandonment of a mark only where the mark loses its significance.
as a result,we agree with the district court that a mark owner can abandon a mark through naked licensing in a particular geographic area without abandoning its rights throughout the entire united states.see also tumblebus cranmer,cir recognizing that there is considerable support for the concept that rights in a mark may be abandoned in certain geographic areas but not others sheila shine,sheila shine,cir recognizing abandonment in some areas but not others prichard consumers brewing,cir snuffer watkins mgmt.snuffy,accordingly,an allegation of abandonment in a specific geographic location is an insufficient pleading in a cancellation proceeding.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed 
the district court limited the scope of realty abandonment pursuant to.a a party waives the right to a jury trial on any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or evidence but not submitted to the jury unless,before the jury retires,the party demands its submission to the jury.if the party does not demand submission,the court may make a finding on the issue.
in its answer to a special interrogatory,the jury concluded that patsy pizzeria abandoned its marks.patsy italian restaurant argues that the verdict encompassed the staten island location,the syosset location,and all manhattan locations other than the east harlem location.we disagree 
s pecial interrogatories must be read in conjunction with the district court charge.romano howarth,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the jury was asked to determine whether there was abandonment but not the geographic scope of any such abandonment.appellants requested no instruction on whether the naked licensing was limited to certain entities or certain geographical areas.while the abandonment instructions never identified as their subject the specific licenses granted to the staten island location or the syosset location,those are the entities that were the subject of the naked licensing claim at trial.therefore,the district court properly resolved the scope of abandonment issue pursuant to.a.
finally,patsy italian restaurant argues that patsy pizzeria limited rights in the manhattan area do not warrant cancellation of their registration.they contend that they are entitled to expand nationwide because patsy pizzeria rights are limited.moreover,they suggest that the expansion by patsy pizzeria outside manhattan that caused the likelihood of confusion occurred after their applications for registration were filed.they argue,therefore,that the cancellation was in violation of their rights and should not affect their registrations.we disagree.
local rights owned by another have been consistently viewed as sufficient to prevent a party from obtaining registration of a federal mark.see giant food,nation foodservice,refusing registration due to likelihood of confusion,even where there was no evidence of actual confusion mainly due to the geographical separation of the two parties operations peopleware,peopleware,noting that geographical separation of the parties principal places of business can not be considered to be of significance in determining registrability of applicant mark since it seeks a geographically unrestricted registration thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.geographical separation of the parties is not relevant in an opposition.indeed,this is consistent with the principle in trademark law that the second comer has a duty to so name and dress his product or service as to avoid all likelihood of consumers confusing it with the product or service of the first comer.harold ritchie,chesebrough pond,cir.
because registration of a federal mark confers upon the owner of the mark a presumption that the owner has the exclusive right to use the mark nationwide,a,it is proper to consider the rights of users nationwide when determining whether a party is entitled to registration of their mark.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.in fact,section d itself provides that a mark can not be registered if it c onsists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the patent and trademark office,or a mark or trade name previously used in the united states and not abandoned,as to be likely to cause confusion d.thus,the very language of the statute contemplates that a mark used anywhere in the united states can be sufficient to block federal registration.see id.
in these circumstances,the principles applicable to the initial registrability of a mark should also be applied to a claim seeking the cancellation of a registration that has not yet become incontestable pursuant to section.id.young agb,the linguistic and functional similarities between the opposition and cancellation provisions of the lanham act mandate that we construe the requirements of these provisions consistently.there is no basis for interpreting them differently.internal citations omitted mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition f or principal register marks not yet five years on the register,cancellation may be based on any ground in the lanham act that would have barred registration in the first instance.limiting the grounds on which cancellation can be sought after the mark has been registered for five years.
in conclusion,the district court did not abuse its discretion by cancelling appellants registrations.nevertheless,the lack of a federal registration does not prevent patsy italian restaurant or patsy pizzeria from expanding as they so desire,so long as they respect each other existing rights.rather,the cancellation simply precludes appellants from utilizing the statutory presumptions and other benefits conferred to a mark owner through federal registration.see setting forth the evidentiary presumptions a mark owner is entitled to and limiting the defenses against an incontestable registration id.a providing a federal cause of action for infringement of an unregistered mark.
c jury instructions pursuant to grants of judgment as a matter of law 
appellants argue that the district court erroneously instructed the jury that there was privity as a matter of law between the purported predecessors of realty and realty as well as between realty and the syosset and staten island appellees.the instruction being a question of law,we review it de novo.see wilkinson ex rel.wilkinson russell,cir.however,appellants waived any claim of error regarding the privity issue by failing to raise them with the district court.see gwozdzinsky ex rel.revco,magten asset mgmt,cir.appellants made no objection whatsoever to the finding of privity between realty predecessors and realty.as for the finding of privity between realty and the other defendants,counsel for appellants stated only that we object to reference to the license agreement as being a valid agreement perhaps you could take out the word valid then there would be more consistency there.later,appellants clarified their objection stating w e do believe that a naked license is a valid license.notably,the issue of naked licensing went to the jury.
appellants similarly challenge the district court instruction to the jury that there was,as a matter of law,use of the marks in interstate commerce.they argue in that regard that appellees were required to demonstrate use in interstate commerce as part of their prior use defense because a mark must be used in interstate commerce in order to be eligible for federal registration.
no provision of the lanham act supports that contention.the lanham act merely provides that a mark is not registrable if there is a likelihood of confusion between that mark and a mark or trade name previously used in the united states by another and not abandoned d.a party need not meet the statutory requirement of use in interstate commerce to oppose,or seek cancellation of,a registration based on confusion.see first niagara ins.brokers,first niagara fin.likewise,prior use as a defense against a trademark infringement suit does not require use in commerce.see b.indeed,as discussed above,even appellees local rights would be sufficient to warrant cancellation of appellants marks due to a likelihood of confusion.see mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition.
nevertheless,even if use in commerce had to be shown,the evidence showed such use as a matter of law.due to the different nature of the marks,use in commerce is defined differently for trademarks and service marks.see.a service mark is used in commerce when,among other things,it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce,where commerce includes all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by congress.id.we have previously recognized that this broad definition reflects congress intent to legislate to the limits of its authority under the commerce clause.buti perosa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
appellants rely on the failure to show use of the mark in advertising materials,but there is no requirement that a mark be so used.rather,it is enough to show use or a display of the mark in the sale of services rendered in commerce,as was the case here.appellees mark was prominently displayed on numerous versions of the patsy pizzeria menu entered into evidence as well as displayed on the exterior of the east harlem building.
additionally,these services were rendered in commerce.the provision of services to interstate customers is sufficient to show that the services were rendered in commerce.see larry harmon pictures williams rest,application of gastown.a map in evidence demonstrates that patsy pizzeria is easily accessible from several nearby interstate highways.numerous articles about patsy pizzeria were also in evidence,including one from the new york times,which undoubtedly extends to an interstate audience.furthermore,reviews for patsy pizzeria from guides such as the not for tourists guide to new york city and the zagat survey for new york city restaurants were also entered into evidence.finally,there was testimony that cab drivers knew where patsy pizzeria was,that people came from all over to go there,and even that pizza was shipped to the west coast.thus,the district court properly instructed the jury to find that appellees used their mark in interstate commerce as a matter of law.
denial of attorneys fees 
patsy italian restaurant appeals the district court denial of its request for attorneys fees.patsy italian rest.iv,d at.section a of the lanham act,codified as amended at a,provides that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.thus,in order to be entitled to attorneys fees,the party must be the prevailing party and the case must be exceptional,or,in other words,involve fraud,bad faith,or willful infringement.patsy brand iii,at.even then the statute provides only that the district court may award attorneys fees.see a.as a result,we review the district court decision for an abuse of discretion.see quaker state oil refining kooltone,cir per curiam.
appellants argue that the district court erred because it held that they were not a prevailing party.we disagree with that characterization of the district court holding.to be sure,some of the district court statements,if read in isolation,could be read to suggest that appellants were not a prevailing party.however,the district court explicitly exercised its discretion not to award.see patsy italian rest.iv,d at t he court does not find this case is so exceptional as to justify an award of attorneys fees the court thus exercises its discretion and denies plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees.given the facts of this case and the mixed outcome of the litigation,the district court clearly did not abuse its discretion in so ruling 
b patsy pizzeria cross appeal merits 
limitation of appellees rights to pizzeria services 
patsy pizzeria argues that the district court erred by including the distinction between general restaurant services and pizzeria services in the jury instructions and special verdict sheet when no definition of pizzeria services was offered it asserts that the lack of a definition is particularly important because it misled the jury into believing this distinction is recognized at law,and the jury special verdicts on many of the issues turned on the definition of pizzeria services.we disagree.the court was not obliged to define pizzeria services for the jury because the jury was capable of determining the meaning of that term,which is neither technical nor ambiguous.united states morris,f d,cir since the word is of common usage,without any technical or ambiguous meaning,the court was not obliged to instruct the jury on its meaning.citing united states chenault,cir.
patsy pizzeria also suggests that the distinction between pizzeria services and restaurant services was inappropriate because the classification system used by the pto does not distinguish between the two services,providing only the category of restaurant services.this argument misunderstands the purpose of the pto classification system.the pto classifications exist solely for administrative purposes,and does not affect the substantive rights of a mark owner in any way.see the director may establish a classification of goods and services,for convenience of patent and trademark office administration,but not to limit or extend the applicant or registrant rights.rather,patsy pizzeria substantive rights are defined by the scope of the services used in connection with the mark.see in re trade mark cases,itc punchgini,cir.
patsy pizzeria further argues that there was no evidence to support the jury finding that they did not provide restaurant services and use for pizzeria services.we disagree.patsy pizzeria argument appears to rely heavily on their claim that pizzeria services are limited to businesses serving pizza only by the slice.however,as noted,patsy pizzeria did not request that the district court provide this definition in the jury instructions,and there is no manifest injustice in the district court failure to do so.without a definition,it was up to the jury to determine the appropriate distinction,and there was sufficient evidence to support its determination.
for example,the jury had before it a variety of menus,including the menus for various patsy pizzeria locations,patsy italian restaurant menu,and menus from pizza hut and dominos pizza.they were able to compare those to determine whether there was a distinction between the services provided and,if so,what that distinction was.in addition,during the trial,the deposition testimony of a patsy pizzeria franchisee was read into the record,in which the franchisee stated that in p izzerias you just serve pizza,and a witness for patsy italian restaurant also gave a similar definition.thus,there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to draw the distinction in question.
there was also sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict that patsy pizzeria rights were limited to pizzeria services.patsy pizzeria argues that there was no evidence that they served solely pizza,and,indeed,that they demonstrated that they continuously sold a variety of foods.having conceded that they failed to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law,appellants merely seek a new trial on this ground.as we have previously explained,w here a jury verdict is wholly without legal support,we will order a new trial in order to prevent a manifest injustice,despite an appellant failure to move for a directed verdict.russo new york,cir quoting sojak hudson waterways,cir.
there was no manifest injustice calling for a new trial.with regard to the element of continuous provision of restaurant services,the contract of sale transferring ownership to realty states that the east harlem location restaurant section was closed,and realty agreed only to provide pizzeria services during a specified period of time.evidence introduced by patsy pizzeria itself suggests a focus on only pizza.for example,franchisees were trained regarding how to make pizza the patsy way,and one franchisee testified to the purchase of a pizza oven because their focus was on the pizza.additionally,the jury was shown a documentary that discussed how the original patsy pizzeria was the first pizzeria to sell pizza by the slice.thus,patsy pizzeria is not entitled to a new trial on the ground of manifest injustice.
fraud on the pto 
appellees challenge the jury verdict that they made fraudulent statements to the pto.generally,a party alleging that a registration was fraudulently obtained must prove the following elements by clear and convincing evidence 
a false representation regarding a material fact.
the person making the representation knew or should have known that the representation was false scienter.
an intention to induce the listener to act or refrain from acting in reliance on the misrepresentation.
reasonable reliance on the misrepresentation.
damage proximately resulting from such reliance.
thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed footnote omitted see also in re bose,quicksilver,kymsta,cir united phosphorus,midland fumigant,cir.
appellees argue that the jury verdict that they made fraudulent statements to the pto either relied on facts that,even if proven,were insufficient as a matter of law,or was supported by legally insufficient evidence again,because appellees failed to move for a directed verdict,they are limited to seeking a new trial,which we will grant only if necessary to prevent manifest injustice when a jury verdict is wholly without legal support.russo,at.
appellants claimed that realty committed fraud in its application for the registration for patsy pizzeria for restaurant services by i the statement that the mark was used continuously for restaurant services since ii the statement that they believed realty had the exclusive right to use the name patsy pizzeria or any mark similar thereto for restaurant services and that no one else had the right to use that name and iii their failure to tell the pto about patsy brand registration for patsy for pasta sauces,even though they were petitioning to cancel that mark on the ground that it was confusingly similar to the mark patsy pizzeria for restaurant services.
appellees argue that there was insufficient evidence that realty knew that statement i was a misrepresentation because the jury found realty continuously used the marks patsy and patsy pizzeria,and thus was the senior user.appellees additionally argue that statements ii and iii were insufficient as a matter of law because they had no obligation to inform the pto of junior users.they add that,even if they were legally sufficient,there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict under either ii or iii because the evidence showed that realty believed it was the senior user and thus was under no legal obligation to disclose the information.
appellees have failed to meet their burden of showing manifest injustice because the jury verdict was not wholly without support.there was evidence of fraud in realty statement that it had continuously used the mark for restaurant services since.it follows that realty specified the services in connection with which the mark was used more broadly than it was actually used,a fact they had to have known.
s ince a registration is prima facie evidence that the registrant is using the registered mark on the goods or services specified in the registration,thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed,realty misrepresentation resulted in a registered mark that was broader in scope than it should have been.as a result,appellees have failed to show that the jury verdict lacked any legal basis,and they are thus not entitled to a new trial.
refusal to reinstate registration 
appellees argue that the district court refusal to reinstate the registration for patsy pizzeria for restaurant services was erroneous because it was inconsistent with the district court conclusion that they retained some rights in the mark.as previously discussed,the district court refusal to reinstate a registration pursuant to is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see empresa,at.registration provides the mark owner with certain presumptions and additional procedural rights,see,but owners of unregistered marks also retain some,albeit more limited,rights under the lanham act.see,orient express trading,at.specifically,when a party registered mark is cancelled due to fraud before the pto,the party can still bring an action as an owner of an unregistered mark for relief pursuant to section a of the lanham act,a.see orient express,at.thus,the district court determination that realty mark should not be restored but that appellants marks should be cancelled due to realty limited remaining rights is not inconsistent in this respect.the jury fraud verdict fully justified the district court decision not to restore realty registration.we,therefore,need not address appellees other arguments in that regard.
c injunctive relief 
with regard to the injunction issued by the district court,appellants claim that it erred when it did not enjoin appellees from using the patsy mark in connection with any locations other than those currently located in manhattan.appellants and patsy pizzeria both challenge the injunction prohibiting them from using the term patsy alone.
a permanent injunction is appropriate where the party seeking the injunction has succeeded on the merits and show s the absence of an adequate remedy at law and irreparable harm if the relief is not granted.roach morse,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,i njunctive relief should be narrowly tailored to fit specific legal violations.patsy brand iii,at internal quotation marks omitted see also sterling drug,bayer ag,cir the lanham act does not require a total ban on the use of a mark by an infringing junior user.to the contrary,the lanham act demands that injunctive relief be no broader than necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,i n fashioning the injunction,the court should balanc e the equities to reach an appropriate result protective of the interests of both parties.sterling drug,at internal quotation marks omitted.we review a district court determinations regarding the scope of injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.see id.at polymer tech.mimran,cir.we review determinations regarding the authority to enter an injunction de novo.starter converse,cir.in addition,rule d a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that e very order granting an injunction must state the reasons why it iss
