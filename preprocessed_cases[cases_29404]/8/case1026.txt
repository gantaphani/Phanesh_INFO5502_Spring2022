the appellants in this case,the penobscot nation and the passamaquoddy tribe the tribes,occupy tribal lands in maine.the corporate,great northern paper,and champion international the companies operate pulp and paper mills that discharge waste water in rivers near or flowing through the tribes reservations.a dispute developed between the tribes and the state of maine as to the regulation of waste water discharge under the clean water act,b.
concerned that the tribes would seek to regulate their activities,the companies requested that the tribes turn over broad categories of documents bearing on such potential regulation,including efforts by the tribes to secure authority to regulate and pertinent agreements between the tribes and federal agencies.the companies demand,made on may,was based on maine freedom of access act the maine access act.ann.tit.west supp.under maine law,the tribes are regulated in certain respects as municipalities,and municipalities are covered by the access act.
the tribes then brought the present lawsuit against the companies in federal district court to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief debarring the companies from obtaining the documents they sought.the substance of the tribes position was that a settlement between maine and the tribes,reflected in both maine law and a federal statute,precluded state regulation of internal tribal matters and that applying the maine access act as sought by the companies would impermissibly regulate the tribes internal affairs.this federal suit was filed on may.
on may,the day before they were served with the federal complaint,the companies brought suit against the tribes in the maine superior court.invoking the maine access act.tit,the companies demanded that the tribes produce the documents previously sought.in this suit,the tribes resisted the demand by asserting,inter alia,that the internal affairs limitation in the settlement meant that the maine access act could not validly be applied to require the tribes to produce the documents.the same question as to the breadth of the limitation was thus posed in both courts.
the federal district court acted first,ruling on july,that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the tribes suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the companies.penobscot nation,d,penobscot i.the court assumed that the internal affairs limitation could comprise a defense if the companies sued the tribes under the maine access act but it ruled that under the complaint rule,the anticipatory assertion of such a defense in a suit by the tribes did not create a case arising under federal law for purposes of the general jurisdiction statute,nor under the parallel language of section,the special indian jurisdiction statute id.at.the court thereafter on september,denied reconsideration.penobscot nation,d,penobscot ii.
shortly before the denial of reconsideration,the maine superior court ruled on the merits of the companies suit against the tribes to enforce the maine access act.great paper,penobscot indian nation,no,slip op.at.the state court ruled that the demand for documents did not contravene the internal affairs limitation and ordered the tribes to produce the documents immediately,save for conventionally privileged documents which needed only to be logged.the tribes refused,were held in contempt,and appealed to the maine supreme judicial court.the tribes also appealed to us from the district court dismissal of their federal suit.
on may,while the present appeal was pending before us awaiting decision,the supreme judicial court decided the state appeal.great paper,penobscot nation,me.it ruled that the internal affairs limitation did protect the tribes from having to produce documents reflecting internal deliberations about the waste water issue,but not from turning over under the maine access act any correspondence between the tribes and federal agencies on that issue.id.the court vacated the lower court judgment and contempt ruling and remanded for production of the narrower category of materials.
because the district court dismissed for want of federal jurisdiction based on rulings of law,our review is de novo.mills maine,cir.to sum up our conclusion at the outset,we think that whether the tribes claims arise under federal law within the meaning of either section or section is a difficult question but the answer is now irrelevant in this case because the maine supreme judicial court has decided the merits of the underlying dispute,and any further proceedings in the federal district court are controlled by res judicata doctrine and would be pointlessly duplicative.
understanding the jurisdictional issue requires a short excursion.the tribes in this case occupy a status,and are subject to a legal framework,that is atypical.the federal maine indian claims settlement act the settlement act,and the maine implementing act.ann.tit.west supp,capped a settlement,reached in,between the tribes and the state of maine involving disputes as to whether the tribes should be recognized at all and as to their claimed ownership of large tracts of land in maine.in the settlement,the tribes gave up much of their land claims but got recognition,trust funds,title to designated reservations,and certain regulatory powers within those lands.see.ann.tit.
however,partly as a result of the tribes disputed status,the state of maine,as part of the settlement,obtained legal authority over the tribes exceeding the usual state authority over native american tribes.the tribes were for most purposes subject to all the laws of the state of maine.b accord id.ann.tit.the tribes were also with a few exceptions not relevant here made subject to suit in state courts.a.ann.tit.and a central provision of the state statute codifying the settlement contains both a general rule and a key qualification 
except as otherwise provided in this act,the passamaquoddy tribe and the penobscot nation,within their respective indian territories,shall have,exercise and enjoy all the rights,privileges,powers and immunities,and shall be subject to all the duties,obligations,liabilities and limitations of a municipality of and subject to the laws of the state,provided,however,that internal tribal matters,including membership in the respective tribe or nation,the right to reside within the respective indian territories,tribal organization,tribal government,tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the state.
in the federal settlement act,congress did not expressly include the provision just quoted but the settlement act did state,as a purpose of the statute,congress intent to ratify the maine implementing act which defines the relationship between the state of maine and the tribes.b.this court has assumed,albeit without extensive discussion,that the internal affairs limitation on state authority in the maine implementing act is also an overriding federal limitation on maine authority over the tribes.akins penobscot nation,cir see also.the companies do not dispute that premise in this case.
this background brings us to the jurisdictional issue decided by the district court.the tribes,in bringing their federal suit,based their claim of jurisdiction on the premise that their suit arises under federal law within the meaning of sections and.in the tribes view,the controlling federal issue in the lawsuit is whether the internal affairs limitation is violated by applying the maine access act to require the tribes to produce the documents sought.the district court assumed arguendo that the internal affairs limitation was a creature of federal as well as state law.penobscot i,d at.
but,as the district court pointed out in its very able decision,penobscot i,d at,it is not enough to satisfy traditional arising under jurisdiction under section that a case involve a federal issue.although this would certainly satisfy article iii,the supreme court has read the statutory grant more narrowly,verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d,and has,for some time,required that it be apparent from the face of the plaintiff complaint either that a cause of action arise under federal
