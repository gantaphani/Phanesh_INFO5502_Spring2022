this case requires us to determine whether,when an employer seeks to benefit from the exception described in greenway buffalo hilton hotel,cir,the burden is on the employer to establish that a title vii plaintiff made no reasonable effort to find comparable employment and whether,when the defendant fails to object to jury consideration of lost wages under title vii,the issue may be submitted to the jury for a jury determination.the first question was,we believe,answered in the affirmative in greenway.the second question,which has not previously been addressed in the second circuit,we also answer in the affirmative.in a summary order issued simultaneously with this opinion,we analyze several other issues raised by this appeal that present no novel questions of second circuit law.because we rule in favor of broadnax on all the issues that would entitle the city to relief,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the plaintiff,sheryl broadnax,a former member of the new haven fire department the department,was terminated on february.however,the state labor board later reduced this termination to a suspension without pay,and,in a appeal,the connecticut superior court vacated the suspension.broadnax testified that although she understood the effect of the decisions by the state labor board and the connecticut superior court was that she could return to work,she chose not to do so because she could take it anymore.later,she testified that she was unemployed,and,when asked if she had any plans about what to do next,she replied,no,i do,but i was waiting for the trial to be over and the date kept moving.so i kind of have been in limbo.she also testified that had she not been subjected to the treatment that she described,she would have continued as a member of the department and pursued her goal of being chief.
broadnax case went to trial on september.during closing argument,counsel for broadnax asked the jury to grant her approximately per year from the time of entry of judgment until broadnax reaches retirement age.at no time did defense counsel contend that the court,and not the jury,should determine any lost wages award.the jury found in favor of broadnax on her title vii gender discrimination,hostile work environment,and retaliation claims her fourteenth amendment equal protection claim and her first amendment free speech claim.the jury awarded broadnax total damages of.this amount included in lost wages.
on october,the city filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b,and in the alternative for a new trial under rule a.after the district court denied that motion by order entered on march,the city filed this appeal.as noted,this opinion addresses only two of the issues raised by this appeal whether the lost wages award should be vacated because broadnax did not demonstrate that she sought other employment,and whether the district court was permitted to submit the lost wages issue to the jury based on the city failure to object to jury determination of the question.the remaining issues are addressed in the accompanying summary order.
discussion 
evidence of an effort to seek other employment 
the city argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law under rule on the lost wages component of the jury monetary award because broadnax failed to use reasonable diligence in attempting to pursue other employment.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.olivier robert yeager mental health,cir.
rule a permits a court during a trial and once a party has been fully heard on an issue to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party.a.rule b allows a party to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the jury has returned its verdict.that rule,however,only permits a party to renew an earlier request for judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion no later than days after entry of judgment.b.the requirement that a motion for judgment as a matter of law be preceded by an earlier motion on the same subject is important because t he very purpose of rule b requiring a prior motion for a directed verdict is to give the other party an opportunity to cure the defects in proof that might otherwise preclude him or her from taking the case to the jury.cruz local union of the int l of workers,cir quoting baskin hawley,cir second alteration in original.thus,if an issue is not raised in a previous motion for a directed verdict,a rule b motion should not be granted unless it is required to prevent manifest injustice.id.at quoting baskin,at.the city concedes that this argument was not raised in its rule a motion before the verdict.
generally,an employer seeking to avoid a lost wages award bears the burden of demonstrating that a plaintiff has failed to satisfy the duty to mitigate.dailey societe generale,cir.this may be done by establishing that suitable work existed,and that the employee did not make reasonable efforts to obtain it.id.greenway buffalo hilton hotel,cir,however,establishes an exception to this general rule and holds that an employer is released from the duty to establish the availability of comparable employment if it can prove that the employee made no reasonable efforts to seek such employment.id.at.
the city does not argue that it established that any suitable alternative work existed for broadnax.instead,relying on the exception carved out by greenway,the city contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because broadnax offered absolutely no evidence of any effort on her part to seek alternative employment.by asserting that broadnax failure to offer evidence of a job search precludes a lost wages award,the city suggests that greenway shifts to the plaintiff the burden of showing effort to obtain employment.the city is mistaken.again,greenway holds that a n employer is released from the duty to establish the availability of comparable employment if it can prove that the employee made no reasonable efforts to seek such employment.id.emphasis added.thus,the plain language of greenway indicates that it is the employer,not the employee,who bears the burden on the issue of effort to seek employment.indeed,greenway makes clear that the exception it creates is merely an alternate evidentiary route by which a defendant can prove that the plaintiff did not fulfill the duty to mitigate,not a device.the decision states that the underlying rationale for the exception it creates is that an employer should not be saddled by a requirement that it show other suitable employment in fact threat being that if it does not,the employee will be found to have mitigated his the employee,who is capable of finding replacement work,failed to pursue employment at all.id.these passages establish that the greenway exception is an exception to the necessity of evidence of alternative employment,not an exception to the general burden borne by the employer.
this outcome is consistent with the cases from other circuits on which greenway relied.in weaver casa gallardo,cir,the eleventh circuit observed that the has the burden of showing that the plaintiff did not make reasonable efforts to obtain work.id.at,cited in greenway,at.similarly,the fifth circuit in sellers delgado college,cir,stated that if an employer proves that an employee has not made reasonable efforts to obtain work,the employer does not also have to establish the availability of substantially equivalent employment.id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted,cited in greenway,at.
in addition,our conclusion that greenway does not disturb the employer traditional burden in employment cases is consistent with how the law allocates the burden of establishing failure to mitigate damages in cases.where a claimant has a duty to mitigate damages,the opposing party generally bears the burden of showing that the claimant did not take reasonable measures to do so.see,ingersoll milling mach.bodena,cir stating in an insurance dispute that the burden of proving a failure to mitigate damages falls on the insurer jones consol.rail,cir stating in a federal employee liability act case that once i
