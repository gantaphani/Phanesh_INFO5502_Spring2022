this appeal presents the question of whether the supreme court decision in comcast behrend,d,overruled the law of this circuit that class certification pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure can not be denied merely because damages have to be ascertained on an individual basis.the united states district court for the northern district of new york mcavoy,concluded that comcast permits certification under rule b only when damages are measurable on a classwide basis,and denied plaintiffs appellants motion for class certification.
we hold that comcast does not mandate that certification pursuant to rule b requires a finding that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court denying class certification,and remand.
background 
plaintiffs appellants plaintiffs,four former employees at certain applebee restaurants owned and operated in upstate new york by cannon cannon,filed suit against cannon in the united states district court for the northern district of new york the amended complaint alleged a collective action for violation of the fair labor standards act and a putative class action for violations of the new york labor law.plaintiffs alleged that cannon had a policy of not paying hourly employees an extra hour of pay when working a work day as was then required by regs.tit,the claim plaintiffs also alleged that cannon required its managerial staff to subtract pay for rest breaks that the employees did not actually take the claim 
following discovery,plaintiffs moved to certify subclasses corresponding to each new york labor law claim pursuant to rule b and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.with respect to rule b,plaintiffs argued that issues common to the question of liability predominated over any individual questions relating to damages.the district court referred plaintiffs motion to magistrate judge david peebles,who issued a report and recommendation on march.
with respect to plaintiffs claim,magistrate judge peebles recommended that plaintiffs motion be granted in part.magistrate judge peebles found that plaintiffs had satisfied the rule a prerequisites to class certification,but only with respect to employees employed between april and august.magistrate judge peebles also found that the common question of whether cannon had a policy of depriving employees the extra hour of pay was subject to generalized proof that predominated over individual questions,thus warranting class certification under rule b.
with respect to the claim,magistrate judge peebles recommended that plaintiffs motion be denied.magistrate judge peebles found that plaintiffs had satisfied the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a,but that plaintiffs could not satisfy the adequacy of representation requirement because three of the four plaintiffs,when serving in a managerial capacity,had revised employee timecards to deduct pay for untaken rest breaks.because plaintiffs could not satisfy the prerequisites to class certification under rule a,magistrate judge peebles did not consider whether their claim warranted class certification under rule b.
plaintiffs filed timely objections to magistrate judge peebles report and recommendation.with respect to plaintiffs claim,plaintiffs argued that the class should be certified for all claims arising after may,when the statute of limitations first began to run.with respect to their claim,plaintiffs argued that they were adequate representatives for a class because they were not employers within the meaning of the new york labor law who could be subject to liability for revising employee timecards.moreover,plaintiffs argued,roach never worked in a managerial capacity and therefore was an adequate representative of the class.
on march,the district court issued a decision and order in response to plaintiffs objections,denying certification on both plaintiffs and claims.see roach cannon,cv,wl.the district court noted that the supreme court decision in comcast behrend,d,had issued after magistrate judge peebles report and recommendation,and that,in light of comcast,class certification was inappropriate.roach,wl,at.
the district court construed comcast as holding that t he failure of the proponent of the class to offer a damages model that is susceptible of measurement across the entire class for purposes of rule b is fatal to the certification question.id.quoting comcast.at.plaintiffs view that the presence of individualized damages was not fatal to the predominance inquiry,the district court concluded,was therefore contrary to comcast.id.
having so construed comcast,the district court analyzed whether either the or claim merited certification.without considering whether there existed any common questions of law or fact with respect to plaintiffs claim,the district court explained that damages in this putative class are highly individualized.id.because plaintiffs did not offer a model of damages susceptible of measurement across the putative class,the district court concluded that rule certification must be denied for plaintiffs failure to satisfy their requirements under rule b.id.citing comcast.given its exclusive reliance on comcast,the district court did not address plaintiffs objections to magistrate judge peebles report and recommendation.id.at.
the district court resolution of plaintiffs claim was substantially identical.without considering whether there existed any common questions of law or fact,the district court concluded that proof of damages on this claim is highly individualized and q uestions of individual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm questions common to this class.id.at.again,citing comcast,the district court concluded that class certification of this claim fails under rule b.id.at.as with the claim,the district court relied exclusively on comcast and did not address plaintiffs objections to the report and recommendation.id.at.
plaintiffs sought leave to file this interlocutory appeal pursuant to e and rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure,which motion we granted.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that,after comcast,class certification pursuant to rule b requires a finding that damages are measurable on a classwide basis.we review a district court class certification determination for abuse of discretion,applying a noticeably less deferential standard when the district court has denied class certification.augustin jablonsky in re nassau cnty.strip search cases,cir quoting parker time warner entm t,cir internal quotation mark omitted.while we review the district court construction of legal standards de novo,we review the district court application of those standards for whether the district court decision falls within the range of permissible decisions.myers hertz,cir.
a class may be certified only if,after a rigorous analysis,the district court is satisfied that the prerequisites of rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure are met.comcast behrend,d quoting wal mart stores,dukes,d.those prerequisites require showing that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there are questions of law and fact common to the class the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of those of the class and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.
in addition,the district court must be satisfied that certification is appropriate under rule b.comcast.at.one of the bases for certification under rule b,at issue here,allows for certification if both questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.predominance is satisfied if resolution of some of the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof,and if these particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof.catholic hea
