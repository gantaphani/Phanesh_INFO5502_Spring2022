john fenimore is major general and commander of the new york air national guard air guard or guard.donald dibble was a staff sergeant with the air guard in late,dibble was ordered honorably discharged from the guard and denied the opportunity to following his dismissal and the unsuccessful pursuit of various administrative remedies,dibble brought this action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn,claiming that he was unlawfully denied in retaliation for his constitutionally and statutorily protected activities as a union steward fenimore moved to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that dibble claims were under the doctrine of immunity.the district court denied the motion and on reconsideration,adhered to its decision.fenimore brought this appeal 
this case presents two issues whether the interlocutory order denying the motion of the commander of the state national guard to dismiss the suit by reason of the doctrine of immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order rule of cohen beneficial industrial loan.and if so,whether such a suit is under the doctrine of intramilitary immunity.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court order was immediately appealable and that defendant motion to dismiss should have been granted.

appealability 
interlocutory orders of federal district courts are not ordinarily appealable until the rendition of a final decision.see.a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.van cauwenberghe biard,d quoting catlin united states.an order denying a defendant motion to dismiss on the grounds of intramilitary immunity is certainly not final indeed,such an order ensures that litigation will continue in the district court.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d.in limited circumstances,however,federal appellate courts may review nonfinal orders.for example,under the collateral order rule of cohen,appeals may be taken in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen at.
district court orders denying claims of immunity are at times held appealable,because,as appellant notes,immunity is intended to shield the defendant not only from an adverse outcome,but also from the burden of having to go through the litigation process at all.as the supreme court has observed with respect to a state officer immunity from a suit alleging a constitutional tort under,the defense is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.mitchell forsyth,d.this court has applied the collateral order rule to permit appeals from district court orders denying a wide variety of immunity claims.see,transatlantic shiffahrtskontor gmbh shanghai foreign trade,cir foreign sovereign immunities act immunity baker coughlin,cir official immunity under state law goldberg town of rocky hill,cir municipal immunity smith reagan,cir eleventh amendment immunity barrett united states,cir prosecutorial immunity.but see in re agent orange prod.liab,cir rejecting an interlocutory appeal from an order denying a defense of intramilitary immunity.
under the collateral order rule,a prejudgment order is eligible for immediate interlocutory appeal if it satisfies three criteria it must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable upon the eventual appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d.the orders appealed in this case satisfy these three standards.first,there is no dispute that they conclusively determine the availability of the immunity defense.second,the immunity question is separate from the merits of the action and as to the third requirement,we conclude that the interlocutory order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment because an important element of absolute immunity is its possessor entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.mitchell forsyth,d citing nixon fitzgerald,d.the defendant would irrevocably lose this benefit of immunity if obligated to defend the case at trial.
the supreme court appears to take this view of the nature of the right,at least with respect to claims of immunity made by officers in the active military.in united states stanley,d,the court suggested that the process of defending a lawsuit,not merely the end result,compromises military discipline and thus gives rise to immunity.concerned by the prospect of compelled depositions and trial testimony by military officers concerning the details of their military commands,the stanley court explained that if a subordinate were allowed to prosecute a lawsuit against his superior officer,the mere process of arriving at correct conclusions would disrupt the military regime.stanley,at.see also stencel aero eng g united states,d the trial would involve military orders,and would often require members of the armed services to testify in court as to each other decisions and actions.we see no reason why this logic would apply with any less force to claims brought by members of the national guard.see jones state div.of military naval affairs,cir a bsent some reasoned distinction,justiciability of constitutional tort actions incident to federal and state military service should be.
intramilitary immunity is designed to protect a defendant from the obligation to participate in the litigation,and not merely from an adverse result.the loss of such a benefit can not be vindicated by appeal from an adverse final judgment.were we required to refrain from hearing an appeal of an interlocutory order denying a claim of intramilitary immunity,the benefit claimed by the defendant freedom from the burden of suit would be irrevocably lost by the time we were able to hear his claim.
we are mindful of our decision in in re agent orange product liability litigation,in which we declined to exercise jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal challenging an order denying dismissal on intramilitary immunity grounds.however,we believe agent orange to be both distinguishable on its facts and in large part superceded by subsequent decisions of the supreme court.as to the facts,the order appealed from in agent orange was tentative in its wording,thus raising doubt whether it conclusively determined the question of immunity.id.at.furthermore,agent orange relied on an understanding of the intramilitary immunity doctrine since rejected by the supreme court.we held in agent orange that intramilitary immunity was inextricably intertwined with the merits of the action because it was difficult to predict whether a finding of liability would undermine military discipline without a more complete factual record.id.at.subsequent supreme court cases have rejected a particularized inquiry into the effect a suit will have on discipline in determining claims of intramilitary immunity,applying the doctrine instead whenever a plaintiff injury arises out of activity incident to military service.stanley,at.internal quotation marks omitted.see also united states shearer,d defining intramilitary immunity as applicable whenever the plaintiff claims are the type of claims that,if generally permitted,would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.these same cases have also called into question the argument advanced in agent orange that an order wrongly denying a claim of intramilitary immunity does not present a sufficiently grave threat of irreparable harm such that it would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.agent orange,at.see also stanley,at.
we conclude that the district court order denying appellant claim of intramilitary immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
