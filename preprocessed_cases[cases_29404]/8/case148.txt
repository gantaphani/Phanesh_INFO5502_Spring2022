the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment allows a state courts to exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only when doing so does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.this contract case presents these issues where the parties contacts were not and involved no physical presence in massachusetts,but were by phone,and internet over an international border.the district court concluded that it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant consistently with the due process clause.downer bioriginal food sci,djc,wl.we conclude to the contrary that the massachusetts courts do have jurisdiction over the canadian defendant.
in,the defendant bioriginal food science corporation,a canadian company,contracted with downer,a massachusetts investment bank,to be its exclusive financial advisor for the sale of its business.the parties negotiated and executed the agreement remotely,and subsequently spent four years collaborating from their respective home offices.downer later sued in state court in massachusetts for breach of contract,and bioriginal removed the case to federal court.the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.in light of the nature,the number of contacts over time,the origin,and the duration of the parties contacts,we hold that the exercise of jurisdiction by massachusetts is consistent with fair play and substantial justice.we reverse and remand.
downer is a global investment bank founded and headquartered in boston,massachusetts.of its employees work in boston.bioriginal is a canadian corporation that produces nutritional supplements,and is headquartered in saskatoon,saskatchewan.
in september,christopher johnson visited boston.johnson was an employee of bioriginal investor crown capital and sat on bioriginal board of directors as its de facto chairman.while in boston,johnson met with downer in downer headquarters.the purpose of the meeting is not in evidence.however,johnson indicated to downer while meeting there that bioriginal would be offered for sale in the next twelve months.the record does not reveal whether johnson explicitly approached downer on behalf of bioriginal.
after the meeting,downer contacted bioriginal,referencing johnson visit.bioriginal including johnson and ceo joseph vidal and representatives from downer boston office remotely negotiated by calls,and teleconferences a letter agreement under which bioriginal hired downer to assist in the sale of bioriginal.on march,vidal transmitted his signed copy of the agreement,dated march,to downer in boston.there was never a physical meeting of the contracting parties.
under the terms of the letter agreement,downer acted as bioriginal exclusive financial adviser in connection with the potential sale of bioriginal.the agreement provided it could be terminated by either party with thirty days written notice.according to downer,neither side ever provided such written notice.the agreement also contained a provision in favor of saskatchewan law and consent by both parties to jurisdiction in saskatchewan courts,but it did not,by its terms,preclude suit in massachusetts.
bioriginal agreed to pay downer four milestone payments of when specified tasks were completed,three of which it subsequently made to downer in massachusetts.bioriginal also agreed to pay downer another contingent fee for each completed transaction involving bioriginal and another company prior to the termination of this program.the contingent transaction fee stated is the greater of or plus one to five percent of the transaction value depending on the size of the transaction.all paid milestone payments were to be deducted from this contingent fee for the completion of a transaction,so long as the resulting amount was not less than a specified value.
three members of downer boston office handled downer performance under the contract.downer has no other north american offices.they communicated regularly but remotely with vidal,johnson,and other members of bioriginal management team and board.from april to july,downer prepared a detailed information memorandum which the parties exchanged with comments eleven times.downer regularly received input from vidal by teleconferences and,including an from vidal to downer collecting comments from bioriginal board members.by september,downer had contacted potential buyers and received four bids,keeping vidal abreast of its efforts all the while.downer then worked with bioriginal management and a subcommittee of the board to prepare a joint management presentation for select bidders.bioriginal gave input even at the level of preparing individual slides of the presentation.
though no sale of bioriginal was made in or,downer continued to work on getting bioriginal a deal.from february,downer contacted potential suitors and exchanged information with bioriginal before delivering an m a update document on may,at bioriginal request.downer persisted in its efforts to secure a buyer.downer says in september it identified a private equity group as a potential buyer and informed bioriginal.downer then hosted a conference call the next month,october,for bioriginal and the private equity group to explore an acquisition of bioriginal.the potential sale never took place.downer claims that its personnel remained in contact with bioriginal through.downer managing director asserted in his affidavit that there were periodic phone calls and with vidal.
sometime in the spring of,downer learned that bioriginal had been sold to westbridge capital,downer asked biorignial to pay its transaction fee and the fourth milestone payment,but bioriginal refused.downer states that bioriginal has asserted that it had terminated the agreement earlier,perhaps in.here,bioriginal seems to ground its merits defense on the argument that downer was not involved in the sale of bioriginal to westbridge.
on july,downer sued bioriginal in massachusetts superior court claiming breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,and violation of the massachusetts unfair trade practices statute.laws ch.bioriginal removed the case to federal district court in massachusetts on july.on august,bioriginal moved to dismiss,arguing that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over bioriginal,that a forum non conveniens dismissal was appropriate in favor of saskatchewan court,and that downer claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
the district court allowed the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under rule b,did not reach the forum non conveniens issue,and denied as moot the b motion to dismiss the claim.this appeal followed.
where,as here,a district court dismisses a case for lack of personal jurisdiction based on the prima facie record,rather than after an evidentiary hearing or factual findings,our review is de novo,phillips prairie eye,cir.in reviewing the facts,we take the plaintiff evidentiary proffers as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff claim,and we also consider uncontradicted facts proffered by the defendant.daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson,poole,cir.
to establish personal jurisdiction in a diversity case,a plaintiff must satisfy both the forum state statute and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.ticketmaster new york,alioto,cir.the district court and the parties each proceed directly to the constitutional analysis,and we will do so as well.
downer asserts only that massachusetts has specific in personam jurisdiction over bioriginal,not general jurisdiction.that is,the jurisdictional basis for downer suit arises from and is limited to bioriginal conduct.see walden fiore,d.to evaluate whether bioriginal conduct creates the necessary minimum contacts with massachusetts,courts consider whether the claim directly arise s out of,or relate s to,the defendant forum state activities whether the defendant contacts represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state laws and making the defendant involuntary presence before the state courts foreseeable and whether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.daynard,at quoting foster miller,babcock wilcox,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
there is one fact about this case which has not been recognized in the briefing.it is that a state jurisdiction is being asserted against a defendant who is in a foreign country,and not in a sister state.in asahi metal industry superior court,d,the court applied the usual three part analysis in a case.id.at.as to the reasonableness prong,in part of its opinion,the court noted that the reasonableness of the exercise of jurisdiction depends on different factors,including the burden on the defendant,the interests of the forum state,and the plaintiff interest in obtaining relief.id.at.a court must also weigh in its determination the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies and the shared interests of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.id.quoting world wide volkswagen woodson,d.the court applied those considerations with special emphasis in light of that case factual context,including the defendant international home forum.we return to asahi when we discuss reasonableness.
downer must succeed on all three prongs in order to establish personal jurisdiction.we hold that it has.
relatedness 
bioriginal did not contest relatedness in the district court and spends less than three pages of its brief here on the issue.we discuss it because the district court found no relatedness,as it found no purposeful availment.downer,wl,at.
the relatedness prong requires the plaintiff to show a demonstrable nexus between its claims and the defendant activities,such that the litigation itself is founded directly on those activities.adelson hananel,cir third and fourth alterations in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this test is a flexible,relaxed standard.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in a contract case,we focus on the parties prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,along with the terms of the contract and the parties actual course of dealing.daynard,at quoting burger king rudzewicz,d.we conduct this analysis with reference to the contacts the defendant creates with the forum state,though those contacts may be intertwined with the activities of the plaintiff.walden.at see adams adams,cir discussing whether the defendant activity in the forum state was instrumental either in the formation of the contract or its breach or whether the defendant was subject to substantial control and ongoing connection to the forum state in the performance of th e contract first alteration in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,the evidence of contacts during the course of dealing is powerful.bioriginal had an ongoing connection with massachusetts in the performance under the contract.downer claims arise from the alleged breach of that contract.that is enough to establish relatedness.see adelson,at.
purposeful availment 
we now turn to the purposeful availment prong.the purposeful availment prong represents a rough quid pro quo when a defendant deliberately targets its behavior toward the society or economy of a particular forum,the forum should have the power to subject the defendant to judgment regarding that behavior.carreras pmg collins,llc,cir.the cornerstones of this inquiry are voluntariness and foreseeability.daynard,at.this places the emphasis on the defendant intentions and prohibits jurisdiction based on random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts.carreras,at quoting burger king,at internal quotation marks omitted.purposeful availment is an equally important factor when foreign defendants are involved.see mcintyre,nicastro,d plurality opinion.
the contacts here clearly were not random,fortuitous,or attenuated.first,the genesis of the downer engagement strongly supports the case for purposeful availment.after all,downer first learned of bioriginal sale from johnson,bioriginal de facto chairman,in downer boston office,adelson,at relying in part on solicitation phillips,at emphasizing the absence of solicitation when finding no purposeful availment.johnson statement was certainly voluntary,and there is nothing to indicate bioriginal lacked foreseeability as to it.downer,in response,then contacted bioriginal headquarters to negotiate the agreement.downer call to bioriginal was not a cold call it was with reference from johnson.
second,the contract was not of a short duration or quickly accomplished.bioriginal had a working relationship with downer,including intense periods with many exchanges bioriginal knew or should have expected downer boston office its only north american office,and the one with which bioriginal negotiated the letter agreement to be the site of its partner team.this was no small project according to the letter agreement,downer was bioriginal exclusive financial adviser on the sale of the entire firm.to that end,bioriginal personnel including its ceo and board and downer boston office collaborated intensively.the record includes statements from downer personnel detailing contacts,eleven emails and documents traded between the two firms,and eleven iterations on one document.moreover,many of those refer to other or to phone calls and teleconferences involving bioriginal and downer boston office.bioriginal and downer worked together on significant documents,and bioriginal provided its input on many items,including individual slides.as part of that work,downer asserts it contacted hundreds of potential buyers on bioriginal behalf.at least once,downer arranged and hosted a conference call with bioriginal and a potential buyer.and bioriginal sent three payments to downer in boston.
to be sure,the purposeful availment inquiry is focused on contacts between the defendant and the forum state,not between the defendant and the plaintiff.walden.at.the contacts here,however,are hardly the random,fortuitous,attenuated,or isolated contacts inadequate to give rise to jurisdiction.burger king,at.rather,bioriginal reach ed out beyond canada and into massachusetts by entering a contractual relationship that envisioned continuing and contacts in the forum state.walden.at quoting burger king,at.
true,many of the,phone calls,and other activities were originated by downer in massachusetts and directed to bioriginal and third parties elsewhere although others were directed by bioriginal to downer in massachusetts.but it makes little sense to focus too much on who initiated a particular contact in exploring a lengthy course of dealing in a services contract.by retaining downer,bioriginal actively caused downer to undertake extensive activities on bioriginal behalf within massachusetts.part of what bioriginal was paying for was for downer to take initiative on its behalf.and so,while a plaintiff unilateral activity can not constitute a jurisdictional contact,world wide volkswagen,at internal quotation marks omitted,downer extensive massachusetts activities in this case,given the context,were not unilateral.they were undertaken at bioriginal request and are attributable to bioriginal.
the district court rejection of jurisdiction was based on reasoning that interstate communications by phone and mail are insufficient to demonstrate purposeful availment absent other contacts.downer,wl,at.the district court then concluded that bioriginal negotiated the agreement from canada,felt the benefit of the agreement in canada,and was in breach of the agreement by failing to act in canada.id.at.bioriginal urges the same on appeal.
that reasoning does not support rejection of jurisdiction.i t is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines burger king,at.in light of this reality,the supreme court has consistently rejected a physical contact test for personal jurisdiction.id.before burger king,in international shoe,the court had already said that a nonresident physical presence within the territorial jur
