appeal from an order entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york koeltl,dismissing a bankruptcy appeal.the district court concluded appellant lacked standing to opt out of or object to the joint reorganization plan of appellee and its subsidiary on behalf of a putative class in a separate securities class action against appellee.because appellant had opted out in his individual capacity,the district court also found he was not affected by the bankruptcy court order and thus lacked standing to pursue his personal objection to the plan on appeal.we affirm.
background 
in november,dynegy holdings llc,a subsidiary of dynegy inc,filed a voluntary chapter petition in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york morris.dynegy only asset was ownership of of the equity of dynegy holdings.in march,charles silsby filed a securities class action complaint against dynegy and three individual defendants,two executives of the company and its alleged controlling shareholder,carl icahn,in the district court for the southern district of new york koeltl.lucas dynegy,in re dynegy,civ,wl,at june.the complaint alleged dissemination of false and misleading information and failure to disclose material facts about dynegy financial performance and prospects in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of id.at.the putative,not yet certified class included investors who acquired dynegy common stock between september,and march.id.in may,dynegy and its subsidiaries,including dynegy holdings,collectively,dynegy,and certain major stakeholders reached an agreement settling claims stemming from allegations of fraudulent transfers between dynegy,dynegy holdings,and other subsidiaries.id.at.under the settlement agreement,the major stakeholders received an equity stake in the entity that would emerge from the bankruptcy of dynegy id.none of the members of the putative class in the securities litigation were parties to the settlement.
dynegy followed its subsidiary into chapter reorganization.dynegy,wl,at.this prompted an automatic stay of the securities class action in the district court as to dynegy but not the three individual defendants.id.the reorganization plan the plan contained a binding release of third parties including the three individual defendants in the securities class action from liability unless a party opted out.id.at.because the release did not cover intentional fraud,willful misconduct,gross negligence,or criminal conduct,only the class action section a claim but not their b claim came within the scope of the release.id.the release also precluded litigation against the third parties.id.
on july,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on dynegy bankruptcy petition.dynegy,wl,at.at the hearing,an attorney for charles silsby,the named plaintiff in the securities litigation,argued there was inadequate notice to certain shareholders of the putative class regarding the release and the mechanism.the bankruptcy court,however,approved dynegy disclosure statement and form of notice to the class.the bankruptcy court did not require dynegy to distribute the plan to holders of a claim or interest in the non voting classes,some of whom are members of the putative securities class.but,the bankruptcy court did require dynegy to individually notify holders as of july,of claims and interest in non voting classes of their status.this notice of non voting class status included an explanation of the release.the court also required dynegy to publish a confirmation hearing notice in the new york times and the wall street journal.this notice explained the plan included a binding release of third parties from liability unless a party opted out.the bankruptcy court did not,however,require individual notice to members of the putative class who had sold all of their shares of dynegy prior to july.
on july,the district court appointed appellant stephen lucas as lead plaintiff in silsby icahn,the securities class action litigation.dynegy,wl,at.on august,lucas requested the district court expand the lead plaintiff order to allow him to represent the putative class in dynegy bankruptcy proceedings.id.the district court denied this request.id.
on august,lucas opted out of the release in the bankruptcy court on his behalf as well as on behalf of the putative class in the securities litigation.id.he also submitted an objection to the plan on behalf of himself and the putative class.id.
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan on september,subject to hearing lucas objection.the bankruptcy court delayed ruling on his objection in order to allow settlement negotiations.the parties,however,did not reach a settlement,and during a hearing on october,the bankruptcy court overruled lucas objection,holding he lacked standing both in his individual capacity,and on behalf of the putative class.the bankruptcy court found lucas could not object to the release on his own behalf because he had personally opted out and thus,the release did not affect his rights,and he could not appeal and lucas could neither opt out of the release nor object to the plan on behalf of the putative class because he lacked the authority to represent the class outside of the separate securities litigation in the district court.the bankruptcy court determined in order to represent the class in bankruptcy court,lucas was required to follow class action procedures under the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.the bankruptcy court stated lucas utterly failed to move under rule to make rule applicable in this bankruptcy case,despite having more than two months to do so.the bankruptcy court refused to permit lucas to contravene the federal rules,and to operate as though his class were certified without a court having made that determination.ruling on the merits of lucas objections to the plan confirmation,the bankruptcy court determined the release was consensual because the affected parties received notice and did not opt out.
lucas appealed to the district court on his behalf as well as on behalf of the putative class.dynegy,wl,at.the district court agreed lucas lack ed standing to opt out of or object to the r elease on behalf of the putative class and to object to the r elease individually.id.at.accordingly,it did not reach the merits of lucas objections and dismissed his appeal.this appeal followed.

standing to represent the putative class in bankruptcy court 
lucas argues his status as lead plaintiff in the securities litigation gives him standing to opt out of or object to the release on behalf of the putative class in the bankruptcy proceeding.lucas also argues he was not required to seek class action status in the bankruptcy court to assert such standing.we disagree with both of these arguments and hold lucas does not have standing to represent the putative securities class in the bankruptcy proceeding.
in general,a plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights or interests of third parties the third party standing doctrine.kane johns manville,cir citing cases.ordinarily,a party that seeks an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only,does so via a class action.comcast behrend,see also califano yamasaki.but here,lucas failed to move for class action status in the bankruptcy court.lucas,notwithstanding his failure to move,claims he has standing to represent the putative securities class in the bankruptcy proceeding.
lucas contends that the lead plaintiff order in the civil proceeding authorize d him to act to prevent collateral attacks upon the claims of the p utative c lass through the bankruptcy proceeding.appellant br.see also.we disagree the lead plaintiff order provided no such authorization.first,i t is that consent to being a member or the representative of a class in one piece of litigation is not tantamount to a blanket consent to any
