appellant official committee of unsecured creditors of worldcom,the committee appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,approving a plan by the securities and exchange commission the sec to distribute money to the victims of worldcom,worldcom securities fraud.the sec prepared a distribution plan pursuant to the fair funds for investors provision the fair fund provision of the act of,a,stat,codified at a supp.iii,under which the sec would distribute to defrauded investors the money it collected through the settlement of its civil enforcement action against worldcom.the committee,which was not a party to the litigation below,argues that the distribution plan wrongfully excluded certain categories of creditors and that the district court,had it applied the correct standard of review,would have rejected these exclusions.we conclude that the committee has nonparty standing to appeal the district court order,but hold that the district court correctly reviewed the sec plan for fairness and reasonableness and did not abuse its discretion in approving it.
background 
on june,worldcom announced its intention to restate its financial results for all four quarters of and the first quarter of because of accounting irregularities.one day later,the sec filed a civil complaint against worldcom in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to section a of the securities act of securities act,a sections b,a and b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,a,b and regulations promulgated thereunder.it alleged that worldcom had overstated its income by billion between and the first quarter of and in doing so violated various federal securities laws.on july,worldcom filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on july,the united states trustee appointed the committee to represent worldcom unsecured creditors,pursuant to.see in re worldcom,wl,at.
on july,the district court approved a final settlement between worldcom and the sec under which the company would pay a civil penalty of million the settlement included a nominal disgorgement of,which triggered the fair fund provision,a,allowing the civil penalty to be added to the disgorgement fund and distributed to defrauded investors.in a written opinion,the district court remarked that the settlement was not only fair and reasonable but as good an outcome as anyone could reasonably expect in these difficult circumstances.sec worldcom,d.
worldcom filed a motion in the bankruptcy court in support of the settlement,and the bankruptcy court approved the settlement on august,noting the committee support.the committee also supported the settlement in a filing before the district court.although the sec sought and received the committee approval of the settlement,the committee was not formally a party to the proceedings before the district court or a signatory to the settlement.the terms of the settlement provided that the sec would propose a plan to distribute the funds collected from worldcom.
on april,after worldcom emerged from bankruptcy,the sec sought the district court approval of its plan to distribute the funds.because there was not enough money to compensate all the victims of worldcom fraud,the plan excluded several groups of investors.in particular,it excluded investors who recovered cents or more on the dollar under the chapter reorganization plan or through the sale of their securities,and investors who made a net profit on their combined purchases or sales of worldcom securities during the period in which the fraud occurred on july,having found the plan fair and reasonable,the district court approved it.sec worldcom,wl,at july.
although the district court allowed the committee to voice its objections to the plan at the fairness hearing,the committee did not move to intervene in the action below.the committee now seeks to appeal from the district court order approving the distribution plan.it challenges the exclusion of creditors who recovered more than cents on the dollar and creditors who made a net profit on the sale of their worldcom securities.
discussion 
the committee argues that the district court inappropriately afforded heightened deference to the sec when it approved the distribution plan.before turning to the merits of this claim,however,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.see goldberg cablevision,cir.
standing to appeal 
the sec contends that the committee may not bring this appeal because it was not a party below and does not meet the requirements to appeal as a nonparty.it also contends that the committee lacks the authority to appeal because it is acting beyond the powers granted to it by the bankruptcy code.we conclude that the committee has nonparty standing to appeal for the limited purpose of challenging the terms of the distribution plan.we do not reach the question of the committee statutory authority,however,but rather we assume that it is acting within its powers for purposes of this appeal.
a.the committee right to appeal as a nonparty 
the sec argues that the committee lacks nonparty standing to pursue this appeal because it declined to intervene in the sec action against worldcom and because it has no interest affected by the district court judgment.the sec further argues that the committee insufficiently explains which bondholders it purports to represent or the precise nature of the financial interest it holds in the fund.although the committee failure to describe in detail the effect its challenge would have on the distribution plan has made this a close case with regard to standing,we conclude on the basis of the limited record before us that the committee has alleged a sufficient affected interest for nonparty standing to attach.
standing to appeal is an essential component of our appellate jurisdiction.concerned citizens of cohocton valley,dep t of envt l conservation,cir.the question of nonparty standing to appeal does not implicate the jurisdiction of the courts under article iii of the constitution.devlin scardelletti,d.rather,the issue is whether an appellant should be treated as a party for purposes of appealing a judgment when it was not a party in the proceedings below.id.at.the committee article iii standing is uncontested,and we are satisfied,on the basis of the limited record before us,that the constitutional requirements are met because the committee is composed of creditors who suffered economic injuries that are fairly traceable to worldcom violations of the securities laws,and because it seeks financial compensation to redress those losses,the committee meets the requirements for article iii standing.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envt l servs.toc,d discussing the requirements for standing watt energy action educ,d recognizing economic injury as an.
as a general rule,only parties to a lawsuit,whether from the outset or through intervention,may appeal an adverse judgment.marino ortiz,d.the sec correctly notes that the committee objection to the distribution plan in the district court did not make it a party to the sec civil enforcement action against worldcom.see new york by vacco reebok int l,cir concluding that a district court willingness to consider objections concerning the fairness of a proposed settlement did not create standing to appeal.there are,however,two exceptions to the rule prohibiting nonparty appeals.first,as the supreme court has recognized,a nonparty may appeal a judgment by which it is bound.see devlin,at.holding that nonnamed members of a class could appeal a settlement that would dispose of their claims.second,a nonparty may appeal if it has an interest affected by the judgment.hispanic soc y of the city police dep t city police dep t,cir,aff sub nom.marino ortiz,d hispanic society.the committee does not claim that it is bound by the district court judgment.rather,it asserts that it has an interest affected by the judgment sufficient to confer standing to appeal.
we have not required that a nonparty prove that it has an interest affected by the judgment stating a plausible affected interest has been sufficient.see sec certain unknown purchasers of the common stock of and call options for the common stock of santa fe int l,cir santa fe.in santa fe,we allowed an investor excluded from a settlement to pursue an appeal because the district court judgment may have affect ed his ability to pursue his rule claims against defendants.id.we noted that it was possible,although not certain,that the nonparty rule action would be barred by the settlement,and concluded that it is sufficient to note that the nonparty appellant asserts an interest that may be affected by the trial court judgment.id.similarly,in kaplan rand,cir,we found that a shareholder had standing to appeal the awarding of attorney fees as part of the settlement of a shareholder derivative suit.id.at.we observed that although the fees would be paid by an insurance policy,the shareholder had an interest affected by the judgment because the corporation insurance premiums could plausibly go up in the future as a result of the payment.id.at.
a nonparty may not appeal,however,when it is clear that it has no interest affected by the judgment.in hispanic society,we rejected an appeal by nonparty police officers who objected to the settlement of an employment discrimination suit that,they claimed,harmed their chances for promotion.we noted that the objecting officers had no right to promotion and had not been on the eligible list for promotion before the settlement,and therefore e ven if the settlement were invalidated,they would not be entitled to promotion.id.we therefore held that they lacked an interest affected by the judgment.id.
the sec contends that the committee has failed to demonstrate even a plausible affected interest because its success on appeal would only reapportion funds among its members and not change its share of the distribution.as the sec explains it,the pool of funds available for distribution is fixed,and therefore if the committee successfully challenges the exclusion of certain creditors from the distribution,the result will be to increase the number of creditors sharing limited funds,and thus the funds available to pay the claims of creditors who currently stand to benefit under the distribution plan will be reduced.
it is true that the inclusion of the two groups of creditors might have the effect of redistributing a limited pool of funds among the committee constituents.the committee,however,also challenges more generally the distribution plan favoring of shareholders over creditors and the deference the district court accorded to the sec in drafting the plan.given the complexity of the distribution plan and the limited record before us regarding its workings,we are unable to determine how the committee challenge would affect the distribution,and we lack the benefit of an evaluation of this issue by the district court.we therefore can not conclude,as we could in hispanic society,that the committee success on appeal will not affect the amount of money available to creditors at the expense of shareholders or otherwise affect the creditors interests by requiring greater judicial scrutiny of the sec distribution plan.without more information,we are reluctant to conclude that the committee asserted affected interest is implausible.we therefore conclude,on the basis of the limited record before us,that the committee has asserted an interest affected by the judgment sufficient to confer nonparty standing to appeal 
b.the committee statutory authority 
the sec argues that the committee is acting beyond its statutory mandate by initiating proceedings outside the bankruptcy court.we recognize that the committee is operating at least at the outer edge of its statutory authority.for the reasons that follow,however,we do not consider this the appropriate case in which to determine the scope of creditors committees statutory authority,a question for which there is little guiding precedent and which was not argued before the district court.nor do the merits of the committee appeal turn on our resolution of this complicated question.
a creditors committee is a creature of statute,deriving its powers and duties from bankruptcy law.manville equity sec.holders comm.in re,in re,aff,rev on other grounds,cir see also.the principal source of a creditors committee powers and duties is c,which grants,inter alia,the authority to consult regarding the administration of the bankruptcy case,perform certain investigations of the debtor business,participate in the formulation of a bankruptcy plan,request the appointment of a trustee,and perform such other services as are in the interest of those represented.c.the committee claims that the present action is authorized by this provision 
section c does not provide unlimited authorization for legal action by creditors committees,however.for example,we have imposed limits on creditors committees actions in adversary proceedings in the bankruptcy courts.a creditors committee seeking to initiate an adversary proceeding on behalf of the debtor must first seek the approval of the bankruptcy court and demonstrate to the court satisfaction that it acts in the interests of the estate.unsecured creditors comm.noyes in re stn enters,cir.similarly,a creditors committee may not settle an adversary proceeding over the objections of the.see smart world,llc,juno online,in re smart world,llc,cir.
moreover,in the few cases we have identified in which creditors committees have attempted to act entirely outside the bankruptcy proceedings,courts have construed the committees authority narrowly.see in re,at while contemplates a committee taking an active role in the reorganization proceedings,it does not grant a committee blanket authority to represent its constituency in matters outside and independent of the bankruptcy case.in in re industries,a bankruptcy court concluded that an equity committee had exceeded its statutory authority by opposing delisting of the debtor stock before the board of directors of the new york stock exchange because even if this action were in the interest of the committee constituents,does not grant committees such extensive authority to represent its constituents in matters beyond the bankruptcy proceedings.id.at.in official committee of tort claimants dow corning in re dow corning,wl cir,the sixth circuit,in an unpublished opinion concluded that legislative lobbying was not among the activities authorized by c,even where it would benefit the committee constituents.id.at.
there is,in short,a serious question regarding what legal action,if any,the committee is authorized by statute to pursue outside of the bankruptcy court.we are aware of no cases considering the situation before us,in which a committee seeks to appeal as a nonparty in a proceeding collateral to the proceeding in the bankruptcy court.this knotty question of bankruptcy law has not been fully briefed before us.moreover,the few cases addressing this question have arisen when committees sought approval in advance of taking action outside the bankruptcy proceeding,see in re dow corning,wl,at,sought authorization to continue such an action already in progress,see in re,at,or requested reimbursement of expenses after the fact,see in re,at.given that the committee in this case does not claim that it sought the bankruptcy court authorization to initiate this appeal,we think it prudent to allow the bankruptcy court in the first instance to consider the question of the committee statutory authorization in the context of a request for reimbursement of the committee expenses.we express no opinion regarding the committee entitlement to reimbursement,either statutorily or in the bankruptcy court discretion.
to the extent that our jurisdiction depends on the committee statutory authority to bring this appeal,our decision not to reach this question requires us to exercise hypothetical jurisdiction.so long as we are satisfied that we have article iii jurisdiction,we have discretion to decline to resolve difficult jurisdictional questions.see gonzales,cir because the exhaustion requirement raises a question of statutory,rather than constitutional,jurisdiction,we need not resolv
