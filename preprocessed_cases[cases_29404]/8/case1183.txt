this appeal arises out of the attempted resolution of a dispute between a real estate listing website and one of its over the propriety of actions taken by the when he separated from the company in,and the validity of corporate actions that occurred before his departure.it requires us to decide whether the district court had jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement that resulted in the dismissal of the underlying case.we must also decide whether the district court properly exercised its authority under federal rule of civil procedure to sanction the defendant for proffering unfounded factual contentions in his filings with and oral representations to the court.because the order of dismissal failed to retain jurisdiction over enforcement of the parties settlement agreement,or to incorporate the terms of that agreement,the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.accordingly,we vacate the district court orders enforcing the settlement agreement and holding the defendant in contempt for noncompliance.in addition,because the defendant was properly sanctioned for only one of the three factual contentions identified by the district court as the basis for its sanctions award,we vacate that award and remand the matter for reconsideration of the appropriate amount of monetary sanctions in light of this decision.
background 
appellee streeteasy,streeteasy operates a website that provides real estate listings and related information to brokers and the public appellant douglas chertok chertok streeteasy in or around with nonparties michael smith smith,anthony schmitz,and nataly kogan in the process of establishing streeteasy,chertok registered the domain name.in august,streeteasy sought and obtained million in venture capital financing by issuing preferred stock the series a stock sale.consummation of this transaction required certain actions to be taken by the company board and shareholders the parties strongly dispute whether these corporate actions were validly effected.while streeteasy claims that approval was obtained through telephonic board and shareholder meetings in which chertok participated on august,chertok contends that approval was fabricated as part of a scheme by smith streeteasy chief executive officer to usurp control of the company.
around the same time that streeteasy was negotiating the venture capital investment,chertok relationship with the company began to sour.streeteasy alleges that in the summer of the company discovered that chertok had embezzled.upon making this discovery,the company severed all relations with chertok,removing him as a on the company bank account and later electing a new board of directors that excluded chertok.after chertok and streeteasy parted ways,chertok allegedly refused to provide the company with possession and control of its domain names,including.streeteasy also claims that in chertok attempted to gain access to the company bank records by falsely representing to bank staff that he was still associated with streeteasy.
following these actions by chertok,streeteasy initiated suit in the southern district of new york,asserting claims under the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,d,as well as claims for breach of a fiduciary duty and conversion,and requesting a declaratory judgment that chertok has no continuing relationship with streeteasy.after commencement of the action,chertok took the position that the corporate actions including the election of a new board of directors were invalid,because he was allegedly the sole board member at the time of those actions,and he allegedly had not approved them.chertok agreed,however,to transfer control of the domain names to streeteasy.streeteasy then amended its complaint,maintaining its previously asserted claims,and adding claims for a declaratory judgment that the corporate actions taken in august and streeteasy election of a new board of directors in were valid.
on january,after limited discovery,the parties reached a settlement agreement during a settlement conference with magistrate judge andrew peck.judge peck stated the terms of the parties agreement,and the parties confirmed their consent to the agreement,on the record.pursuant to the settlement,chertok agreed,among other things,to transfer to streeteasy any and all streeteasy internet domain names that he had not already transferred,and not to register any similar domain names acknowledge that his involvement with streeteasy,other than as a shareholder,ended in october,and that he would not hold himself out as a representative of streeteasy ratif y and consent to the actions taken at the august,board and shareholder meetings and sign any and all documents required by that,including the action by written consent dated as of august,acknowledge that the revised certificate of incorporation and bylaws are valid and sign the series a stock sale documents.in return,streeteasy agreed,among other things,to create an about us page on its website recognizing chertok contribution to the company,and to provide chertok with certain financial documents each calendar quarter.both parties also agreed to execute mutual general releases so that the company releases chertok and his company,and chertok releases streeteasy and its management,employees,directors,and shareholders,in the immortal words of the blumberg form,from any and all causes of action from the beginning of the world to the date of this settlement agreement and release,and that the case would be dismissed with prejudice.
at the conclusion of the conference,judge peck informed the parties that they now had a binding settlement agreement,and that n o settlement agreement documents were necessary.while the releases and series a transaction documents,and other paperwork need ed to be completed,there was not going to be drafted a more formal settlement agreement,because t he transcript constitute d the agreement.by order dated january,judge peck dismissed the action with prejudice.that order states 
based on the settlement agreement reached by all parties and transcribed by the court reporter on january,and on the stipulation of the parties pursuant to c,it is hereby ordered that this action is dismissed with prejudice and without costs.any pending motions are to be terminated as moot.
unfortunately,the repose anticipated by the parties settlement agreement did not last long.within days of entering the settlement agreement,streeteasy sought chertok signature on a number of documents associated with the series a stock sale,including an august,action by written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders and an august,written consent in lieu of special meeting of board of directors.chertok counsel then sought and received from streeteasy the closing binder for the series a stock sale that had been prepared by streeteasy former legal counsel proskauer rose llp proskauer.the closing binder contained a number of documents that,in chertok view,substantiated his earlier contention that the corporate actions were unauthorized.in particular,the binder included proskauer written opinion that the series a stock sale was properly approved by the stockholders by a written consent dated august,proskauer opinion it also contained partially executed copies of backup and compliance certificates related to the series a stock sale.
on may,after relieving counsel who had represented him during the settlement,chertok moved,pro se,to vacate the order of dismissal and rescind the settlement agreement pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.chertok argued that the settlement should be rescinded because streeteasy had fraudulently concealed the proskauer opinion and the backup and compliance certificates from him prior to the settlement,and that these documents constituted newly discovered evidence of which chertok was justifiably ignorant that would have altered the outcome of the case.streeteasy responded with a motion to compel compliance with the parties settlement agreement,and soon thereafter moved for sanctions against chertok,seeking the fees and costs associated with litigating chertok rule b motion and the motion for sanctions itself.streeteasy argued that sanctions were justified because chertok motion contained deliberate falsehoods and lacked a reasonable basis in law.on march,the district court denied chertok rule b motion,granted streeteasy motion to enforce the settlement agreement,and granted streeteasy motion for sanctions.
thereafter,the parties continued to disagree about the scope of chertok obligations under the settlement agreement.on april,chertok was ordered to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for refusing to comply with the court march order directing his compliance with the settlement agreement,and on april he was held in contempt,fined a day for his noncompliance,and ordered to pay fees and costs incurred by the plaintiff as a result of chertok noncompliance.that evening,chertok signed and delivered a mutual release contemplated by the settlement agreement.the following day,the district court issued an order relieving chertok from the contempt order and instructing him to pay for his one day in contempt.finally,on september,the district court ordered chertok to pay in attorneys fees and costs to the plaintiff,representing the rule sanctions imposed by the court and the attorneys fees incurred by and awarded to the plaintiff after the order to show cause hearing.chertok now appeals the district court orders enforcing the parties settlement agreement,imposing sanctions,holding him in contempt,and setting the amount of attorneys fees and costs to be paid to 
discussion 
enforcement of settlement and contempt 
a federal court does not automatically retain jurisdiction to hear a motion to enforce or otherwise apply a settlement in a case that it has previously dismissed.in re am.express fin.advisors sec,cir citing kokkonen guardian life ins.of.such motions are essentially contract claims.id.where,however,the federal court makes the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement part of the order of dismissal either by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order that court is a proper forum for litigating a breach of the settlement agreement.id.quoting kokkonen,at ellipsis in original accord perez westchester county dep t of,cir.in such cases the district court necessarily ma kes compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement a part of its order so that a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order,roberson giuliani,cir quoting kokkonen,at,and the district court may therefore enforce the settlement as an exercise of its ancillary jurisdiction to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees,kokkonen,at.
here,the district court concluded that it had jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the parties settlement agreement because the dismissal order p lainly incorporated the settlement.we disagree.the order dismissing the underlying case provided that b ased on the settlement agreement reached by all parties and transcribed by the court reporter on january,it is hereby ordered that this action is dismissed with prejudice and without costs.the order does not expressly retain jurisdiction over enforcement of the agreement,nor does it incorporate any of the terms of that agreement.instead,it merely acknowledges the existence of the settlement that precipitated the dismissal the parties settlement agreement,in turn,says nothing about the district court retaining jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising out of the agreement these circumstances are insufficient to confer ancillary jurisdiction on the district court to adjudicate what remains a state law contract claim.see,scelsa city of new york,cir see also in re pharmor.sec,cir the phrase pursuant to the terms of the settlement in dismissal order fails to incorporate the terms of the settlement agreement into the order because a dismissal order mere reference to the fact of settlement does not incorporate the settlement agreement in the dismissal order.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
in opposition,streeteasy argues that the actions of chertok and the district court confirm that the settlement was incorporated into the dismissal order.in particular,streeteasy points out that chertok himself repeatedly asked the district court to enforce the settlement agreement,that the magistrate judge indicated that he would retain a copy of the settlement transcript in his chambers file,and that the district court plainly thought it had jurisdiction to enforce the agreement because it entered the enforcement order.these arguments are unpersuasive.the order of dismissal unambiguously omits to retain jurisdiction or to incorporate the terms of the settlement.statements and actions of the parties,and even of the district court,can not create ancillary jurisdiction where such jurisdiction was not retained upon dismissal williams united states,cir s ubject matter jurisdiction may not be created by estoppel or consent of the parties.see also in re pharmor.sec,at u nder kokkonen,unexpressed intent is insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction.
in sum,as in kokkonen,the only order here was that the suit be dismissed,a disposition that is no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agreement.see kokkonen,at.because the district court lacked ancillary jurisdiction or any other basis for jurisdiction over appellee motion to enforce the settlement agreement,we vacate the district court orders enforcing the settlement agreement and holding chertok in contempt for noncompliance see willy coastal,given that civil contempt is designed to coerce compliance with the court decree,it is logical that the order itself should fall with a showing that the court was without authority to enter the decree.tekkno,perales,cir where a federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to grant a particular type of injunction,it also lacks the power to issue a civil contempt order for noncompliance with that injunction.
ii.rule sanctions 
we review a district court imposition of sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure for abuse of discretion,mindful that a material error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of evidence is an abuse of discretion.derechin state of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under rule b,an unrepresented party who presents a written motion to the court certifies that 
the motion is not being presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass,cause unnecessary delay,or needlessly increase the cost of litigation 
the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending,modifying,or reversing existing law or for establishing new law 
the factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery and 
the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or,if specifically so identified,are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.
b.a false certification violates rule b,and the district court has discretion to impose sanctions to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.id.c.when sanctions are imposed on motion of an adversary,t he standard for triggering the award of fees under rule is objective unreasonableness and is not based on the subjective beliefs of the person making the statement.star mark,koon chun hing kee soy sauce factory,f d cir internal quotation marks omitted.with respect to factual contentions,sanctions may not be imposed unless a particular allegation is utterly lacking in support.storey cello holdings,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
on streeteasy motion,the district court sanctioned chertok pursuant to rule for propounding unsupported factual contentions in his submissions and oral representations to the court.in particular,the district court identified three sanctionable instances chertok claimed to have had no notice of the backup and compliance certificates,despite admitting to having received copies of those certificates as email attachments chertok willfully ignored plain language in the settlement requiring him to sign the action by written consent dated as of august,in order to argue that he was not obligated to sign such a form and chertok misrepresented that the parties settlement was even though magistrate judge peck stated unequivocally that the settlement agreement would be binding even without a written agreement.we consider each of these instances in turn.we share the district court desire to check chertok conduct,but for the following reasons we conclude that the district court erred in sanctioning chertok on the basis of two of the identified instances.we also conclude,however,that the district court acted within its discretion in sanctioning chertok for his misrepresentation of what documents he agreed to sign pursuant to the settlement agreement.accordingly,we vacate the district court award of sanctions and remand the matter for reconsideration of the appropriate sanction amount in light of this decision.
notice of the backup and compliance certificates 
in august and september,in connection with the series a stock sale,smith sent chertok a number of documents and signature pages to sign.in response,chertok requested to see certain documents before signing the signature pages.on september and,smith sent chertok most of these documents as email attachments.among the attached documents were a compliance certificate and a backup certificate it is undisputed that the versions of these certificates that chertok received in were unexecuted.following the parties settlement,streeteasy forwarded partially executed versions of the compliance and backup certificates to chertok.these versions of the certificates reflected the fact that smith had already signed the certificates as of august,days before smith emailed the unexecuted versions of these certificates to chertok in september.based on these circumstances,chertok argued to the district court that smith purposely concealed the executed versions from him in furtherance of smith scheme to usurp control of the company.in his rule b motion,chertok stated that he saw the executed signature pages of these certificates for the first time and was not previously aware of their existence.he further argued that h ad he known the backup certificate or compliance certificate were sic executed,he would not have settled,and that the settlement should therefore be rescinded.
the district court sanctioned chertok for claiming to have had no notice of the backup and compliance certificates,despite admitting having received copies of those certificates as email attachments in.in other words,the district court concluded that chertok represented that he had no notice of the backup and compliance certificates and that this representation was utterly lacking in support.that conclusion is erroneous.chertok never represented that he lacked notice of the existence of the backup and compliance certificates.instead,chertok consistently represented that he lacked notice of the executed or signed versions of these certificates.
although the district court correctly concluded that chertok alleged unawareness of the executed versions of the certificates did not warrant rule b relief,the standards for rule b relief and rule sanctions are not the same.that the failure to provide chertok with executed copies of the documents did not entitle chertok to rule b relief does not mean that chertok claim not to have received such copies was factually false.in order for a factual contention to be sanctionable under rule,it must be utterly lacking in support.kiobel millson,cir.in this case,chertok sufficiently supported his contention that he was unaware that smith had executed the backup and compliance certificates until he received the executed versions of those certificates because the district court sanction award rested on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,it must be vacated to the extent it is founded on chertok supposed misrepresentation regarding the backup and compliance certificates.
action by written consent dated august,
the district court also sanctioned chertok for willfully ignoring the plain language of the settlement in arguing that he was not obligated to sign an action by written consent dated august.in the parties settlement agreement,chertok ratifie d and consent ed to the actions taken at the august,board and shareholder meetings and agreed to sign any and all documents required by that,including the action by written consent dated as of august.a few days after streeteasy suit was dismissed,streeteasy forwarded two written consents dated august,for chertok signature.chertok refused to execute those consents and in his rule b motion he argued that the settlement did not require him to execute either of them because the settlement did not contemplate that he was to consent to meetings which streeteasy alleged never took place.emphasis omitted.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning chertok for his mischaracterization of the parties settlement.chertok contention that the settlement agreement did not require him to execute either of these documents is flatly contradicted by the record.in the agreement,chertok expressly agreed to execute an action by written consent dated august.he offers no logical reason to believe that neither of the documents proffered by streeteasy constituted the action by written consent that he agreed to execute on appeal,chertok argues that he believed the consent described in the settlement referred to a document labeled exhibit a in the minutes of an august,board meeting,and that exhibit a was a different written consent from the ones streeteasy requested he execute after the settlement chertok asserted belief is objectively unreasonable.chertok offers no evidence that the consent referenced in the board minutes is meaningfully different from the consents presented for his signature.moreover,although he claims that he could not have guessed that streeteasy would ask him to execute the shareholder and board written consents dated august,his proclaimed belief is not credible.indeed,he admits that smith sent him these written consents and asked him to sign them as early as september.under the circumstances,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning chertok for his mischaracterization of the parties settlement agreement.
binding nature of settlement agreement 
finally,the district court sanctioned chertok for representing that the parties settlement was nonbinding absent a writing even though magistrate judge peck stated unequivocally that the recorded transcript of the parties settlement would itself constitute a binding settlement agreement and no formal writing would be necessary.during the parties settlement conference,judge peck described the material terms of the settlement on the record.at no point did judge peck state that the settlement agreement would be absent a writing,and indeed he indicated the exact opposite.following judge peck description of the terms of the settlement,chertok and smith on behalf of streeteasy expressly confirmed their agreement.neither party indicated that the agreement would only take effect upon execution of a written document.despite the fact that the parties agreement did not expressly state that it would only become binding upon incorporation in a written document,during oral argument for chertok rule b motion,chertok represented to the district court that the parties settlement was not binding absent a writing because streeteasy expressed its intent not to be bound in the release it forwarded to chertok for his signature,and because the record contemplates a writing.
chertok argues that the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning him for this statement because it was not utterly lacking in factual support and because he did not receive notice that this statement allegedly violated rule b.we agree that chertok did not receive adequate notice that his representation about the nature of the parties settlement would expose him to sa
