appellants insurance company of north america and ina reinsurance company appeal collectively,ina from a judgment of the district court harold baer,judge,granting appellee public service mutual insurance company psmic rule b motion based on newly discovered evidence that an arbitrator who had resigned was,in fact,able to rejoin the arbitration panel prior to the district court decision on whether to convene a new panel or order a replacement.we conclude that the rule articulated in marine products export globe galaxy,cir that,absent special circumstances,if a vacancy arises on an arbitral panel due to the death of an arbitrator prior to the rendering of an award,a new panel should be not apply to a vacancy occasioned by a resignation,and that,in the instant case,the district court decision either to reappoint the arbitrator who had resigned,or,in the alternative,to direct ina to appoint a replacement was proper pursuant to.we therefore affirm the district court order.
background 
i.the resignation of the arbitrator 
psmic commenced arbitration against ina in april seeking reimbursement under reinsurance contracts for payments made to its insured for the settlement of certain pollution claims.the arbitration commenced before a panel consisting of an arbitrator appointed by ina,john sullivan an arbitrator appointed by psmic,thomas tobin and an umpire,roger moak.the panel supervised a substantial amount of discovery,received briefing,and held oral argument on psmic motion for summary judgment regarding what it deemed to be ina chief legal defense.on april,the panel granted psmic motion for summary judgment rejecting ina defense.all three members of the panel,including sullivan,ina appointed arbitrator,signed the order.
ina moved for reconsideration of this order on april,and a briefing schedule was set.however,on may,while the motion for reconsideration was pending,sullivan advised the parties and the other panel members that he had been diagnosed with cancer,that he was to undergo a course of treatment that was to last approximately six weeks,and that he was doubtful he could perform in a professional or timely manner.the parties accepted his resignation.
the parties and remaining panel members disagreed as to how to proceed.on may,the remaining panel members ordered ina to appoint a replacement arbitrator.ina responded the same day,stating that it was unsure whether it would be proper for sullivan to be replaced,and suggesting that a new panel might have to be constituted.the following day,psmic responded that it would be unwilling to convene a new panel,and argued that sullivan should be replaced either by ina or by a court.
to avoid any potential assertion of waiver,psmic included sullivan on the email.ina wrote back a few hours later reiterating its position that it was still deciding whether to replace sullivan or constitute a new panel,and adding that 
sullivan has resigned and copying him on communications does not change his status.additionally,in light of sullivan health situation,one would have hoped that psmic realizes that he has more urgent concerns th a n this matter.indeed,given the situation,it is both legally improper and morally repugnant to continue to involve sullivan.
ina added that s o that sullivan need not be bothered further,ina will agree that psmic has not waived any rights by failing to include him in further communications and hopefully,out of simple human decency,psmic will refrain from copying him.psmic apparently internalized this reproach and refrained from contacting sullivan.the parties were unable to reach agreement on whether to replace sullivan or convene a new arbitral panel.the remaining panel members found that psmic had substantive rights,and that it would be unduly prejudiced if an entirely new panel were convened instead of simply replacing sullivan and continuing the process.however,they acknowledged that ina refused to proceed in this fashion and suggested the parties seek guidance from a court.
following this,ina filed a petition in the southern district of new york for a stay of arbitration and an order disqualifying the panel and compelling the arbitration to start over with a new panel.psmic filed a to compel ina to proceed before the two remaining panel members and a substitute for sullivan,and to confirm the panel april,summary judgment order.
ii.the december,decision 
the district court consulted the general rule that absent special circumstances,where one member of a arbitration panel dies before the rendering of an award and the arbitration agreement does not anticipate that circumstance,the arbitration must commence anew with a full panel.trade transport,natural petroleum charterers,cir.applying that rule to the context of sullivan resignation,the district court granted ina petition for a new panel.the court acknowledged the potential for abuse and manipulation intrinsic in permitting a losing party a second bite at the apple upon resignation of his or her arbitrator,but found that because there is no suggestion of any misconduct here and neither party disputes the severity of the health condition that forced sullivan to resign,and because the resignation had occurred while a motion for reconsideration was being considered and there had been no partial final award granted by the panel,the arbitration should commence anew.the court concluded that it would be unfair to force ina to submit its motion for re consideration to a panel comprised of two arbitrators who heard argument on,and ultimately decided,the summary judgment motion for which reconsideration is requested and one arbitrator who did not.psmic appealed and ina.
iii.psmic discovery of sullivan recovery 
on january,shortly after filing the notice of appeal,psmic counsel learned,through another client who sought to appoint sullivan as an arbitrator,that sullivan health had improved to such a degree that he was again seeking work as an arbitrator.psmic counsel wrote to sullivan that day,copying the original panel members and ina counsel,stating that he had learned that sullivan had recovered and asking if sullivan might be available to rejoin the panel,which would resolve the dispute regarding panel composition.ina counsel responded,copying sullivan,before sullivan did and stated that ina was unwilling to agree to allow sullivan to rejoin the prior,defunct panel.on january,following more correspondence between the parties,sullivan responded to psmic that i am not willing to put my name forward to rejoin the panel because i believe that i have no right to do so.i stepped down from the panel on and am unwilling to attempt to change my status.
in early february of that year,psmic counsel learned that sullivan had attended a arbitration conference in new york from november to,that ina counsel had also attended.this conference took place the week before the oral argument in the district court regarding ina petition and psmic,where,needless to say,ina counsel did not mention that he had seen sullivan.
on february,after learning this information,psmic filed a rule b motion seeking relief from the december,order on the basis of,inter alia,newly discovered evidence that sullivan health had improved to the point that he had been actively seeking work by the time the district court rendered its original judgment 
iv.the july,decision 
on july,the district court granted psmic motion the court found that psmic ignorance of sullivan recovery was justified,because ina had strongly exhorted psmic not to contact sullivan following his resignation,noting that ina can not have it both ways.having instructed psmic not to contact sullivan and agreed that psmic would not waive any rights by complying with psmic request,ina can not now claim that psmic failed to exercise reasonable diligence to determine the condition of sullivan health in november.the court added that if ina knew that sullivan was healthy it was disingenuous for it to have stressed the seriousness of sullivan illness at the oral argument on the petitions 
the court next found that evidence of sullivan recovery and availability would have been admissible and would have changed the outcome of the o rder.the court noted that,in its december,order,it applied cases dealing with the death of an arbitrator,because it h a d no reason to question the seriousness of sullivan diagnosis and treatment,and stated that h ad i known that at the time the order was issued that sullivan was actively soliciting engagements as an arbitrator,i could have reappointed sullivan pursuant to my authority under and thereby eliminated th e potential unfairness to ina while also addressing the two policy concerns noted in the order regarding the potential for manipulation and waste if a new panel must be convened whenever a party arbitrator resigns.the court then found that the fact that sullivan had resigned,but was actively seeking appointment to other panels,qualified as a special circumstance that justified departing from the general rule requiring a new panel be convened upon the death of an arbitrator,which the court observed was premised on permanent unavailability of an arbitral panelist.emphasis in original.
the court concluded that it had the power under to reappoint sullivan,reappointed him,and directed that if he was unwilling or unable to rejoin the panel,then ina would have to appoint a replacement.sullivan informed the court that he would not accept reappointment to the panel,and ina appointed a replacement arbitrator.
ina now appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review questions of law de novo,dalal,cir,and a district court grant of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,quoting cooter gell hartmarx.
ii.analysis 
ina argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting psmic rule b motion,because the newly discovered availability to act as an arbitrator at the time of the district court december,irrelevant to the court decision since the law in our circuit is that whenever an arbitrator dies or resigns the panel must automatically be reconstituted anew absent special circumstances that are not present here,and because,even if it were relevant,psmic was not justifiably ignorant of this evidence.we disagree on both grounds.
first,we conclude that the marine products rule does not apply to vacancies resulting from resignations,because application of the rule in that context would create problems that do not arise in the case of vacancies caused by an arbitrator the potential for manipulation by a party that,perceiving itself to be losing the arbitration,could disrupt the arbitration and obtain a new proceeding by pressuring its appointed arbitrator to resign.therefore,sullivan availability was certainly relevant to the district court decision on whether to convene a new panel or appoint a replacement arbitrator pursuant to its power under.second,psmic was justifiably ignorant of sullivan condition,because it was not required to monitor sullivan progress in his battle against cancer,especially following ina insistence that psmic no longer contact him.for these reasons,we affirm the district court july,order to reappoint sullivan,or,in the alternative,to require ina to appoint a replacement arbitrator to the panel.
a.the marine products rule does not apply to vacancies resulting from resignations.
title specifies certain circumstances under which a court may appoint an arbitrator 
if in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire,such method shall be followed but if no method be provided therein,or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method,or if for any other reason there shall be a lapse in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire,or in filling a vacancy,then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire,as the case may require,who shall act under the said agreement with the same force and effect as if he or they had been specifically named therein and unless otherwise provided in the agreement the arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator.
section can be applied to the filling of a vacancy on a panel of arbitrators.in re salomon.derivative,cir.ina does not dispute that the arbitration agreement provides no guidance as to selecting a replacement arbitrator,or that unless the marine products rule governs the case,the default selection process under section would permit the court to appoint a substitute arbitrator.however,as ina points out,we stated in marine products that,a bsent any special circumstances,there is a general rule in our circuit that despite section,where one member of a arbitration panel dies before the rendering of an award and the arbitration agreement does not anticipate that circumstance,the arbitration must commence anew with a full panel.marine products,at,quoting trade transport,at.ina argues that this rule also applies to resignations,and,therefore,because special circumstances were not present here,the court should have constituted the panel anew and erred in ordering that sullivan be replaced pursuant to section.
however,ina has pointed to no decision where we have extended this general rule to apply to resignation for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that marine products is distinguishable,and that its holding should not be so extended.
we note at the outset that our case law has tended to restrict,rather than to extend,the reach of the rule articulated in marine products.indeed,psmic goes so far as to contend that this rule has been implicitly overruled.while that is a considerable exaggeration,psmic is correct that the manifest inefficiency of requiring a new panel to be constituted has made us reluctant to expand the scope of the marine products rule.
psmic argument appears to be premised on a parenthetical in zeiler deitsch,cir,describing trade transport holding as in domestic arbitration,absent express agreement to that effect,full panel should not be removed due to the death of member replacement arbitrator should be designated.zeiler,at.while,as we discuss below,it is fair to say that the authority of the marine products rule has somewhat eroded,and that it has not been extended to other contexts,marine products has not been overruled.our precedents can not be overruled by a stray dictum by one panel in a parenthetical description of a case that in fact preceded the precedent at issue.
the very case on which marine products principally relied in stating the general rule in fact created an exception to it.in trade transport,the parties and arbitrators agreed to bifurcate the arbitration proceedings so the first stage would determine liability and the second damages.trade transport,at.after the panel rendered a partial final award finding that liability was established,and denied a motion to reconsider the issue because it found that the panel was functus officio,without power to modify the award,one of the arbitrators died.id.at.the arbitrator died after the panel determination on liability,but before the damages phase of the arbitration.id.at.the losing party,not surprisingly,demanded that the panel be convened anew.id.instead,the district court appointed a substitute arbitrator to replace the deceased arbitrator so that the proceeding could continue.id.after the district court confirmed the panel subsequent damages award,the losing party appealed arguing,inter alia,that a new panel was required due to the death of the arbitrator.id.
we cited the general rule,later relied on in marine products,requiring the convening of a new arbitral panel upon the death of an arbitrator,but found it inapplicable.id.we concluded that because the parties had agreed to bifurcate the proceeding,because the arbitrator death followed a partial final award as to liability,and because the parties agreement did not state that the death of an arbitrator following a partial final award required constituting a new panel and was silent as to how to pick a replacement arbitrator,the district court had the a
