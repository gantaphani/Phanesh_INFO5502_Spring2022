respondent greg manning held over two million shares of stock in escala group.he claims that he lost most of his investment when the share price plummeted after petitioners,merrill lynch and other financial institutions collectively,merrill lynch,devalued escala through naked short sales of its stock.unlike a typical short sale,where a person borrows stock from a broker,sells it to a buyer on the open market,and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker,the seller in a naked short sale does not borrow the stock he puts on the market,and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer.this practice,which can injure shareholders by driving down a stock price,is regulated by the securities and exchange commission regulation sho,which prohibits from intentionally failing to deliver securities,thereby curbing market manipulation.
manning and other former escala shareholders collectively,manning filed suit in new jersey state court,alleging that merrill lynch actions violated new jersey law.though manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules,his complaint referred explicitly to regulation sho,cataloguing past accusations against merrill lynch for flouting its requirements and suggesting that the transactions at issue had again violated the regulation.merrill lynch removed the case to federal district court,asserting federal jurisdiction on two grounds.first,it invoked the general federal question statute,which grants district courts jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under federal law.it also invoked the securities exchange act of exchange act,which grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules or regulations thereunder.a.manning moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his claims.the district court denied his motion,but the third circuit reversed.the court first decided that did not confer jurisdiction,because manning claims all arose under state law and did not necessarily raise any federal issues.nor was the district court the appropriate forum under of the exchange act,which,the court held,covers only those cases that would satisfy arising under test for general federal jurisdiction.
held the jurisdictional test established by is the same as test for deciding if a case arises under a federal law.
a section text more readily supports this meaning than it does the parties two alternatives.merrill lynch argues that plain language requires an expansive rule any suit that either explicitly or implicitly asserts a breach of an exchange act duty is brought to enforce that duty even if the plaintiff seeks relief solely under state law.under the natural reading of that text,however,confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an exchange act requirement.the brought to enforce language thus stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the exchange act.meanwhile,manning far more restrictive interpretation that a suit is brought to enforce only if it is brought directly under that statute veers too far in the opposite direction.instead,language is best read to capture both suits brought under the exchange act and the rare suit in which a claim rises and falls on the plaintiff ability to prove the violation of a federal duty.an existing jurisdictional test well captures both of these classes of suits brought to enforce such a duty provision of federal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under federal law.federal jurisdiction most often attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted,but it may also attach when the claim necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state power.grable sons metal products,darue engineering.
b this court precedents interpreting the term brought to enforce have likewise interpreted jurisdictional grant as coextensive with the court construction of arising under standard.see pan american,matsushita industrial epstein.
c construing,consistent with both text and precedent,to cover suits that arise under the exchange act serves the goals the court has consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes.it gives due deference to the important role of state courts.and it promotes administrative simplicity,which is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.hertz friend.both judges and litigants are familiar with the arising under standard and how it works,and that test generally provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions.

justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
section of the securities exchange act of exchange act,stat,as amended,et,grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules or regulations thereunder.a.we hold today that the jurisdictional test established by that provision is the same as the one used to decide if a case arises under a federal law.see.
respondent greg manning held more than two million shares of stock in escala group,a company traded on the nasdaq.between and,escala share price plummeted and manning lost most of his investment.manning blames petitioners,merrill lynch and several other financial institutions collectively,merrill lynch,for devaluing escala during that period through naked short sales of its stock.
a typical short sale of a security is one made by a borrower,rather than an owner,of stock.in such a transaction,a person borrows stock from a broker,sells it to a buyer on the open market,and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker.the short seller hope is that the stock price will decline between the time he sells the borrowed shares and the time he buys replacements to pay back his loan.if that happens,the seller gets to pocket the difference minus associated transaction costs.
in a naked short sale,by contrast,the seller has not borrowed or otherwise obtained the stock he puts on the market,and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer.see naked short selling antifraud rule,securities exchange commission sec release,fed.reg.that practice beyond its effect on individual purchasers can serve as a tool to drive down a company stock price which,of course,injures shareholders like manning,at.the sec regulates such short sales at the federal level the commission regulation sho,issued under the exchange act,prohibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities and thereby curbs market manipulation.see cfr.
in this lawsuit,manning joined by six other former escala shareholders alleges that merrill lynch facilitated and engaged in naked short sales of escala stock,in violation of new jersey law.his complaint asserts that merrill lynch participated in short sales at times when it neither possessed,nor had any intention of obtaining,sufficient stock to deliver to buyers.app.to pet.for cert,amended complaint.that conduct,manning charges,contravened provisions of the new jersey racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,new jersey criminal code,and new jersey uniform securities law it also,he adds,ran afoul of the new jersey common law of negligence,unjust enrichment,and interference with contractual relations.see,at.manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules.his complaint,however,referred explicitly to regulation sho,both describing the purposes of that rule and cataloguing past accusations against merrill lynch for flouting its requirements.see,at.and the complaint couched its description of the short selling at issue here in terms suggesting that merrill lynch had again violated that regulation,in addition to infringing new jersey law.see,at.
manning brought his complaint in new jersey state court,but merrill lynch removed the case to federal district court.see allowing removal of any civil action of which federal district courts have original jurisdiction.merrill lynch asserted federal jurisdiction on two grounds.first,it invoked the general federal question statute,which grants district courts jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under federal law.second,it maintained that the suit belonged in federal court by virtue of of the exchange act.that provision,in relevant part,grants district courts exclusive jurisdiction of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder.a.manning moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his collection of claims.the district court denied his motion.see d nj,app.to pet.for cert.
the court of appeals for the third circuit reversed,ordering a remand of the case to state court.see.the third circuit first decided that the federal question statute,did not confer of the suit,because all manning claims were brought under state law and none necessarily raised a federal issue,at.nor,the court held,did of the exchange act make the district court the appropriate forum.relying on this court construction of a nearly identical jurisdictional provision,the court of appeals found that covers only those cases involving the exchange act that would satisfy the arising under test of the federal question statute.see,at citing pan american petroleum superior court of for new castle.because the district court lacked jurisdiction of manning suit under,so too it was not the exclusive forum under.
merrill lynch sought this court review solely as to whether commits manning case to federal court.see pet.for cert.because of a circuit split about that provision meaning we granted certiorari.we now affirm.
like the third circuit,we read as conferring exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same suits as aris e under the exchange act pursuant to the general federal question statute.see.the text of more readily supports that meaning than it does either of the parties two alternatives.this court precedents interpreting identical statutory language positively compel that conclusion.and the construction fits with our practice of reading jurisdictional laws,so long as consistent with their language,to respect the traditional role of state courts in our federal system and to establish clear and administrable rules.
section,as noted earlier,provides federal district courts with exclusive jurisdiction of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder.a see supra,at much the same wording appears in nine other federal jurisdictional provisions mostly enacted,like,as part of new regulatory statutes 
merrill lynch argues that the plain,unambiguous language of requires an expansive understanding of its scope.brief for petitioners.whenever says merrill lynch a plaintiff complaint either explicitly or implicitly assert s that the defendant breached an exchange act duty,then the suit is brought to enforce that duty and a federal court has exclusive jurisdiction,at reply brief see tr.of oral arg.confirming that such allegations need not be express.that is so,merrill lynch contends,even if the plaintiff,as in this case,brings only claims in his complaint that is,seeks relief solely under state law.see reply brief.and it is so,merrill lynch continues,even if the plaintiff can prevail on those claims without proving that the alleged breach of an exchange act duty here,the violation of regulation sho actually occurred.see,at tr.of oral arg.t he words brought to enforce do not focus on what the court would necessarily have to decide 
but a natural reading of text does not extend so far.brought in this context means commenced,black law dictionary ed.to is a word expressing purpose or consequence,the concise oxford dictionary and enforce means give force or effect to,webster new international dictionary of the english language.so confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an exchange act requirement.that language,in emphasizing what the suit is designed to accomplish,stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the exchange act.consider,for example,a simple action for breach of contract,in which the plaintiff alleges,for atmospheric reasons,that the defendant conduct also violated the exchange act or still less,that the defendant is a bad actor who infringed that statute on another occasion.on merrill lynch view,would cover that suit indeed,merrill lynch points to just such incidental assertions as the basis for federal jurisdiction here.see brief for petitioners supra,at.but that hypothetical suit is brought to enforce state contract law,not the exchange act because the plaintiff can get all the relief he seeks just by showing the breach of an agreement,without proving any violation of federal securities law.the suit,that is,can achieve all it is supposed to even if issues involving the exchange act never come up.
critiquing merrill lynch position on similar grounds,manning proposes a far more restrictive interpretation of language one going beyond what he needs to prevail.see brief for respondents.according to manning,a suit is brought to enforce the exchange act duties or liabilities only if it is brought directly under that statute that is,only if the claims it asserts and not just the duties it means to vindicate are created by the exchange act.on that view,everything depends as justice holmes famously said in another jurisdictional context on which law creates the cause of action.american well works layne bowler.if a complaint asserts a right of action deriving from the exchange act or an associated regulation,the suit must proceed in federal court.but if,as here,the complaint brings only claims,then the case belongs in a state forum.and that is so,manning claims,even if contrary to what the third circuit held below the success of the state claim necessarily hinges on proving that the defendant breached an exchange act duty.see brief for respondents.
manning view of the text requirements,although better than merrill lynch,veers too far in the opposite direction.there is no doubt,as manning says,that a suit asserting an exchange act cause of action fits within scope bringing such a suit is the prototypical way of enforcing an exchange act duty.but it is not the only way.on rare occasions,as just suggested,a suit raising a claim rises or falls on the plaintiff ability to prove the violation of a federal duty.see,grable sons metal products,darue engineering,smith kansas city title trust.if in that manner,a action necessarily depends on a showing that the defendant breached the exchange act,then that suit could also fall within compass.suppose,for example,that a state statute simply makes illegal any violation of the exchange act involving naked short selling.a plaintiff seeking relief under that state law must undertake to prove,as the cornerstone of his suit,that the defendant infringed a requirement of the federal statute.indeed,in this hypothetical,that is the plaintiff only project.accordingly,his suit,even though asserting a claim,is also brought to enforce a duty created by the exchange act.
an existing jurisdictional test well captures both classes of suits brought to enforce such a duty.as noted earlier,provides federal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under federal law.see supra,at.this court has found that statutory term satisfied in either of two circumstances.most directly,and most often,federal jurisdiction attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted.that set of cases is what manning highlights in offering his view of.but even when a claim finds its origins in state law,there is a special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.gunn minton,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.as this court has explained,a federal court has jurisdiction of a claim if it necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state power.grable,at see gunn,at slip,at framing the same standard as a test.that description typically fits cases,like those described just above,in which a cause of action is brought to enforce a duty created by the exchange act because the claim very success depends on giving effect to a federal requirement.accordingly,we agree with the court below that jurisdictional test matches the one we have formulated for,as applied to cases involving the exchange act.if but only if such a case meets the arising under standard,commands that it go to federal court 
merrill lynch objects that our rule construes completely different language the phrases arising under and brought to enforce in and,respectively to mean exactly the same thing.reply brief.we can not deny that point.but we think it far less odd than merrill lynch does.after all,the test for jurisdiction is not grounded in that provision particular phrasing.this court has long read the words arising under in article iii to extend quite broadly,to all cases in which a federal question is an ingredient of the action.merrell dow pharmaceuticals thompson,quoting osborn bank of united states,wheat.in the statutory context,however,we opted to give those same words a narrower scope in the light of history,the demands of reason and coherence,and the dictates of sound judicial policy.romero international terminal operating.because the resulting test does not turn on text,there is nothing remarkable in its fitting as,or even more,neatly a differently worded statutory provision.
nor can merrill lynch claim that congress use of the new brought to enforce language in shows an intent to depart from a settled even if linguistically ungrounded test for statutory arising under jurisdiction.that is because no such test then existed.as we recently noted,our caselaw construing was for many decades including when the exchange act passed highly unruly.gunn,at slip,at referring to the canvas of our old opinions as look ing like one that jackson pollock got to first against that muddled backdrop,it is impossible to infer that congress,in enacting,wished to depart from what we now understand as the arising under standard.
this court has reached the same conclusion before.in two unrelated decisions,we addressed the brought to enforce language at issue here.see pan american,matsushita industrial epstein.each time,we viewed that phrase as coextensive with our construction of arising under.
pan american involved of the natural gas act nga,an exclusive jurisdiction provision containing language materially indistinguishable from the case began in state court when a natural gas purchaser sued a producer for breach of a contract setting sale prices.prior to the alleged breach,the producer had filed those contractual rates with the federal power commission,as the nga required.relying on that submission which the complaint did not mention,the producer claimed that the buyer suit was brought to enforce a liability deriving from the nga,a filed rate and so must proceed in federal court.see,at.this court rejected the argument.
our decision explained that use of the term brought to enforce,rather than arising under,made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis.the inquiry,we wrote,was not affected by want of the language contained in the federal question statute,at.the limitation s associated with arising under jurisdiction,we continued,were clearly implied in alternative phrasing.ibid.in short,the linguistic distinction between the two jurisdictional provisions did not extend to their meaning.
pan american thus went on to analyze the jurisdictional issue in the manner set out in our arising under precedents.federal question jurisdiction lies,the court wrote,only if it appears from the face of the complaint that determination of the suit depends upon a question of federal law.at.that inquiry focuses on the particular claims a suitor makes in his complaint meaning,whether the plaintiff seeks relief under state or federal law,at.in addition,the court suggested,a federal court could adjudicate a suit stating only a claim if it included as an element,and an essential one,the violation of a federal right,at quoting gully first nat.bank in meridian.with those principles of arising under jurisdiction laid out,the court held that did not enable a federal court to resolve the buyer case,because he could prevail merely by proving breach of the contract.see,at.pan american establishes,then,that an action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by a federal statute is nothing more and nothing less than an action arising under that law.
merrill lynch reads pan american more narrowly,as holding only that does not confer federal jurisdiction when a complaint unlike manning fails to reference federal law at all.see brief for petitioners.but that argument ignores pan american express statement of equivalence between language and the federal question statute brought to enforce has the same limitation s meaning,the same scope as arising under.at.and just as important,merrill lynch disregards pan american analytical structure the decision proceeds by reviewing this court arising under precedents,articulating the principles animating that caselaw,and then applying those tenets to the dispute at hand,at.the court thus showed as well as told that brought to enforce jurisdiction mirrors that of arising under.
as a fallback,merrill lynch claims that pan american is irrelevant here because it relied on legislative history distinct to the nga in finding brought to enforce language coterminous with arising under.see brief for petitioners.the premise of that argument is true enough in support of its holding,the court quoted a committee report describing as conferring federal jurisdiction over cases arising under the act.at.but we can not accept the conclusion merrill lynch draws from that statement that courts should give two identically worded statutory provisions,passed less than five years apart,markedly different meanings.indeed,the result of merrill lynch approach is still odder,for what of the eight other jurisdictional provisions containing brought to enforce language see,supra.presumably,merrill lynch would have courts inspect each of their legislative histories to decide whether to read those statutes as reproducing the arising under standard,adopting merrill lynch alternative view,or demanding yet another jurisdictional test.we are hard pressed to imagine a less sensible way of construing the repeated iterations of the phrase brought to enforce in the jurisdictional provisions of the federal code.
in any event,this court in matsushita addressed itself,and once again equated the brought to enforce and arising under standards.that decision arose from a action against corporate directors for breach of fiduciary duty.the issue was whether the state court handling the suit could approve a settlement releasing,in addition to the state claims actually brought,potential exchange act claims that would have committed to federal court.in deciding that the state court could do so,we described not once,not twice,but three times as conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits arising under the exchange act.see,at section confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts for suits arising under the exchange act at section prohibits state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the exchange act at section prohibit s state courts from exercising jurisdiction over suits arising under the exchange act emphases added.over and over,then,the court took as a given that jurisdictional test mimicked the one in the general federal question statute.
and still more the matsushita court thought clear that the suit as filed which closely resembled manning in its mix of state and federal law fell outside grant of exclusive jurisdiction.as just noted,the claims brought in the matsushita complaint sought relief for breach of a duty.but in support of those claims,the plaintiffs charged,much as manning did here,that the defendants conduct also violated federal securities laws.see,at supra,at.we found the presence of that accusation insufficient to trigger.t he cause pleaded,we wrote,remained a state action,at,notwithstanding the potential federal issue,the suit was not brought to enforce any rights or obligations under the exchange act,at.the court thus rejected the very position merrill lynch takes here,that precludes a state court from adjudicating any case,even if brought under state law,in which the plaintiff asserts an exchange act breach.
construing,consistent with both text and precedent,to cover suits that arise under the exchange act serves the goals we have consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes.our reading,unlike merrill lynch,gives due deference to the important role of state courts in our federal system.and the standard we adopt is more straightforward and administrable than the alternative merrill lynch offers.
out of respect for state courts,this court has time and again declined to construe federal jurisdictional statutes more expansively than their language,most fairly read,requires.we have reiterated the need to give d ue regard to the rightful independence of state governments and more particularly,to the power of the states to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts.romero,at quoting healy ratta,shamrock oil gas sheets.our decisions,as we once put the point,reflect a deeply felt and traditional reluctance to expand the jurisdiction of federal courts through a broad reading of jurisdictional statutes.romero,at that interpretive stance serves,among other things,to keep actions like manning in state court,and thus to help maintain the constitutional balance between state and federal judiciaries.
nor does this court concern for state court prerogatives disappear,as merrill lynch suggests it should,in the face of a statute granting exclusive federal jurisdiction.see brief for petitioners.to the contrary,when a statute mandates,rather than permits,federal jurisdiction thus depriving state courts of all ability to adjudicate certain claims our reluctance to endorse broad reading s,romero,at,if anything,grows stronger.and that is especially so when,as here,the construction offered would place in federal court actions bringing only claims created by state law even if those claims might raise federal issues.to be sure,a grant of exclusive federal jurisdiction,as merrill lynch reminds us,indicates that congress wanted greater uniformity of construction and more effective and expert application of federal law than usual.brief for petitioners quoting matsushita,at.but greater and more do not mean total,and the critical question remains how far such a grant extends.in resolving that issue,we will not lightly read the statute to alter the usual constitutional balance,as it would by sending actions with all claims to federal court just because a complaint references a federal duty.
our precedents construing other exclusive grants of federal jurisdiction illustrate those principles.in pan american,for example,we denied that a state court resolution of claims potentially implicating the nga meaning would jeopardize the uniform system of regulation that the statute established,at.we reasoned that this court ability to review state court decisions of federal questions would sufficiently protect federal interests.and similarly,in tafflin levitt,we permitted state courts to adjudicate civil rico actions that might raise issues about the scope of federal crimes alleged as predicate acts,even though federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of all offenses against the laws of the united states,there,we expressed confidence that state courts would look to federal court interpretations of the relevant criminal statutes.accordingly,we saw no significant danger of inconsistent application of federal criminal law and no incompatibility with federal interests.tafflin,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
so too here,when state courts,in deciding claims,address possible issues of the exchange act meaning.not even merrill lynch thinks those decisions wholly avoidable it admits that does nothing to prevent state courts from resolving exchange act questions that result from defenses or counterclaims.see brief for petitioners pan american,at.we see little difference,in terms of the policies merrill lynch invokes,if those issues instead appear in a complaint like manning.and indeed,congress likely contemplated that some complaints intermingling state and federal questions would be brought in state court after all,congress specifically affirmed the capacity of such courts to hear securities actions,which predictably raise issues coinciding,overlapping,or intersecting with those under the act itself.see a matsushita,at.so,for example,it is hardly surprising in a suit like this one,alleging short sales in violation of state securities law,that a plaintiff might say the defendant previously breached a federal prohibition of similar conduct.see supra,at describing manning complaint.and it is less troubling for a state court to consider such an issue than to lose all ability to adjudicate a suit raising only causes of action.
reading in line with our caselaw also promotes administrative simplicity,which is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.hertz friend.both judges and litigants are familiar with the arising under standard and how it works.for the most part,that test provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions.and an existing body of precedent gives guidance whenever borderline cases crop up.see supra,at.by contrast,no one has experience with merrill lynch alternative standard,which would spring out of nothing to govern suits involving not only the exchange act but up to nine other discrete spheres of federal law.see,supra listing statutes with brought to enforce language supra,at noting merrill lynch backup claim that legislative histories might compel different tests for different statutes.adopting such an untested approach,and forcing courts to toggle back and forth between it and the arising under standard,would undermine consistency and predictability in litigation.that result disserves courts and parties alike.
making matters worse,merrill lynch rule is simple for plaintiffs to avoid or else,excruciating for courts to police.under that rule,a plaintiff electing to bring claims in state court will purge his complaint of any references to federal securities law,so as to escape removal.such omissions,after all,will do nothing to change the way the plaintiff can present his case at trial they will merely make the complaint less informative.recognizing the potential for that kind of avoidance,merrill lynch argues that a judge should go behind the face of a complaint to determine whether it is the product of artful pleading.see tr.of oral arg.if the plaintiffs had just literally whited out,deleted the references to reg ulation sho,the court should still understand the complaint to allege a breach of that rule the fact that the plaintiffs did cite it would change the fact we have no idea how a court would make that judgment,and get cold comfort from merrill lynch assurance that the question would arise not in this case but in the next third,fourth,fifth case down the road.at.jurisdictional tests are built for more than a single dispute that merrill lynch threatens to become either a useless drafting rule or a tortuous inquiry into artful pleading is one more good reason to reject it.
section provides exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same class of cases as arise under the exchange act for purposes of.the text of,most naturally read,supports that rule.this court has adopted the same view in two prior cases.and that reading of the statute promotes the twin goals,important in interpreting jurisdictional grants,of respecting state courts and providing administrable standards.
our holding requires remanding manning suit to state court.the third circuit found that the district court did not have jurisdiction of manning suit under because all his claims sought relief under state law and none necessarily raised a federal issue.see supra,at.merrill lynch did not challenge that ruling,and we therefore take it as a given.and that means,under our decision today,that the district court also lacked jurisdiction under.accordingly,we affirm the judgment below.
it is so ordered.

merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,et,petitioners greg manning,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice thomas,with whom justice sotomayor joins,concurring in the judgment.
the court concludes that respondents suit belongs in state court because it does not satisfy the multifactor,atextual standard that we have used to assess whether a suit is one arising under federal law.ante,at.i agree that this suit belongs in state court,but i would rest that conclusion on the statute before us,of the securities exchange act of.that statute does not use the phrase arising under or provide a sound basis for adopting the standard.it instead provides federal jurisdiction where a suit is brought to enforce exchange act requirements.a.that language establishes a straightforward test if a complaint alleges a claim that necessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the act,confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit.because the complaint here does not allege such claims and because no other statute confers federal jurisdiction this suit should return to state court.accordingly,i concur in the judgment.
section provides that t he district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.a.as the court explains,under a natural reading,confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an exchange act requirement.ante,at see also webster new international dictionary of the english language enforce means give force to or give effect to and by providing exclusive jurisdiction to federal district courts over certain suits,strips state courts of jurisdiction over such suits.
put differently,under a suit belongs in federal court when the complaint requires a court to enforce an exchange act duty or liability.in contrast,a suit belongs in state court when the complaint assert s purely causes of action that do not require binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the exchange act or a judgment on the merits of an exchange act breach.matsushita industrial epstein.such a suit is not brought to enforce any rights or obligations under the act,and thus does not fall within scope,at.so does not provide federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce liabilities or duties under state law or over every case that happens to involve allegations that the act was violated.the provision leaves state courts with some authority over suits involving the act or its regulations.
the statutory context bolsters this understanding.that context confirms that congress reserved some authority to state courts to adjudicate matters.although the act provides numerous federal rights and remedies,it also generally preserves all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity,such as claims that could be litigated in state courts of general jurisdiction.a.that provision shows that congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transactions.matsushita,supra,at.a natural reading of text preserves the dual role for federal and state courts that congress contemplated,and it confirms that mere allegations of exchange act breaches do not alone deprive state courts of jurisdiction.
a natural reading promotes the uniform interpretation of the federal securities laws that congress sought to ensure when it gave federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over federal suits.a.the textual approach fosters uniformity because it leaves to federal courts which are presumptively more familiar with the intricate federal securities laws the task of adjudicat ing exchange act claims.matsushita,at.when state courts decide cases where the complaint pleads only claims and do not resolve the merits of exchange act rights or liabilities,they are not trespass ing upon the exclusive territory of the federal courts.at.
the statutory text and structure thus support a straightforward test section confers federal jurisdiction over a case if the complaint alleges claims that necessarily depend on establishing a breach of an exchange act requirement.
the third circuit was correct to remand this suit to state court.respondents complaint does not seek to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or its regulations.a.
although respondents complaint alleges at different places that petitioners violated the exchange act or its regulations,the complaint does not bring claims requiring enforcement of the exchange act or its regulations.the complaint instead brings causes of action that seek to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law.count alleges that petitioners violated state law by investing money derived from racketeering.see app.to pet.for cert,amended complaint citing stat.ann.a west.counts through allege standard contract and tort claims unjust enrichment,unlawful interference with economic advantage,tortious interference with contractual relations,unlawful interference with contractual relations,claims,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and negligence.see app.to pet.for cert,amended complaint.count pleads a freestanding claim for punitive and exemplary damages.see,at,amended complaint.none of these claims requires a court to enforce to give effect to a requirement created by the act,thus,does not confer federal jurisdiction over them.
count presents a closer call,but it too does not trigger federal jurisdiction.that count pleads that petitioners violated a state law that makes it unlawful for a person to participate in a racketeering enterprise,at,amended complaint citing stat.ann.c.the alleged racketeering includes violating the new jersey uniform securities law through fraud,deception,and misappropriation,committing theft by taking under state law,and committing theft by deception under state law.app.to pet.for cert,amended complaint.respondents allege that t he sec has expressly noted that naked short selling involves the omission of a material fact as part of their securities fraud allegation,at,amended complaint.vindicating that claim would not require the enforcement of a federal duty or liability.new jersey law encompasses fraudulent conduct that does not necessarily rest on a violation of federal law or regulation.see,e west fraud and deceit include a ny misrepresentation by word,conduct or in any manner of any material fact,either present or past,and any omission to disclose any such fact see app.to pet.for cert.invoking et.so although count refers to the securities and exchange commission view about naked short selling,that count does not require respondents to establish a violation of federal securities law to prevail on their fraud claim.because respondents cause of action in count seeks to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law and does not necessarily depend on the breach of an exchange act duty or liability,does not provide federal jurisdiction over that claim.
although the court acknowledges the natural
