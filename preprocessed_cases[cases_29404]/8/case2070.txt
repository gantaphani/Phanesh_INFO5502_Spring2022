background 
accepting the truth of plaintiffs factual allegations at the pleading stage,dawes walker,cir,the following account is drawn substantially from cfi complaint.
cfi is a nevada corporation with offices in los angeles,california.until september,cfi was a holding company that owned various operating companies engaged primarily in the brokerage of securities and the sale of financial market data.in september,cfi transferred substantially all of its assets to cantor fitzgerald limited partnership cflp,a delaware limited partnership.as a result of this reorganization,iris and bernard cantor iris cantor and cantor,respectively became the sole owners of cfi,which became the managing general partner of cflp.defendants lutnick,fraser,and ginsberg became partners in cflp.cantor died in july.at the present time,iris cantor,a california resident,is the trustee of the cantor family trust,which holds cfi shares.
during the relevant period,defendants lutnick,fraser,and ginsberg were officers,directors,or both,of cfi,and all were citizens of new york.merkel,also of new york,was general counsel of cflp,in which capacity he provided legal advice to cfi.during the relevant period he also assumed the positions of secretary and senior vice president of cfi.plaintiffs claim that defendants owed fiduciary duties to cfi and its shareholders,the cantors.
under the agreement of limited partnership of cantor fitzgerald,dated september,the partnership agreement,section a released cfi from its fiduciary duty not to compete against cflp,as follows 
nothing contained in this agreement shall be deemed to preclude cfi or any affiliate of cfi from engaging or investing in or pursuing,directly or indirectly,any interest in other business ventures of every kind,nature or description,including those which compete with the partnership,independently or with others provided,however,that upon the occurrence of a change of control cfi shall be so precluded.
emphasis added.thereafter,cantor competed with cflp through market data corporation mdc,an affiliate of cfi as defined by the partnership agreement.
the dispute in this case stems from amendments made to the partnership agreement in that limited the ability of cfi and its affiliates to compete with cflp.cantor and all of the defendants except fraser played significant roles in the amendment process.cantor received the final draft,approved on june,and the cantors both executed consents in which they acknowledged having received,reviewed,and consented to the amendments 
among the amendments,two changes were made that limited the ability of cfi and its affiliates to compete with cflp.first,the language in section a that had previously permitted competition was removed and was replaced by language that precluded competitive activities 
nothing contained in this agreement shall be deemed to preclude cfi or any affiliate of cfi from engaging or investing in or pursuing,directly or indirectly,any interest in other business ventures of every kind,nature or description,independently or with others provided,that such activities do not constitute competitive activities.
agreement of limited partnership of cantor fitzgerald,amended and restated as of june,the partnership agreement a emphasis added.the term competitive activities is defined to include directly or indirectly engag ing in,represent ing in any way,or being connected with,any competing business.id.c.a competing business,in turn,is broadly defined to include any activity that 
i involves the conduct of the wholesale or institutional brokerage business,ii consists of marketing,manipulating or distributing financial price information of a type supplied by the partnership to information distribution services or iii competes with any other business conducted by the partnership if such business was first engaged in by the partnership after the restatement date.
in the second relevant change worked by the amendments,section a was supplemented with a new subsection,section b,which provided that each partner acknowledges its duty of loyalty to the partnership and agrees to take no action to harm or that would reasonable sic be expected to harm the partnership or any affiliated entity.id.b.
the gravamen of cfi and iris cantor complaint is that for almost five years appellees exploited and failed to correct cantor mistaken belief that cfi right to cause mdc to compete with cflp survived the amendments.plaintiffs claim that lutnick approved the amendments,which he believed limited the right to compete,without authorization from and contrary to the wishes of cantor.further,plaintiffs claim that the defendants failed to inform cantor of these restrictions,or at least their understanding of them,even as he continued to allow mdc to compete with cflp.according to plaintiffs,as part of a second campaign of deception aimed at preventing cantor from discovering the changes made by the amendments,defendants prepared and in some cases circulated documents pertaining to various securities offerings by cflp and mdc that stated,or gave the impression,that mdc could compete with cflp.these documents reinforced cantor belief that mdc had the right to compete under the partnership agreement and prevented him from taking steps to correct the amendments to restore that right.
based on the foregoing allegations,plaintiffs claimed in the first count of their complaint that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to cfi and its shareholders,the cantors.in the second count,plaintiffs asserted that lutnick breached his fiduciary duties by taking advantage of iris cantor ignorance of the partnership agreement restrictions on competition during negotiations to settle one of two previous lawsuits between the parties in delaware chancery court.
the first delaware action was commenced on march,and settled in may.as part of the settlement agreement,cfi exchanged its general partnership units in cflp for newly created limited partnership units.cfi and iris cantor maintain that,by keeping silent during the settlement negotiations about the restrictions on cfi and mdc ability to compete,lutnick unfairly caused the cantors and cfi to exchange their general partnership units at a deep discount price that did not reflect that the cantors were relinquishing the right to compete with cflp.
cfi and iris cantor assert that they first discovered defendants breaches of their fiduciary duties in march,when the second suit was commenced by cflp in delaware chancery court.in this action,cflp sued cfi and iris cantor for violating the partnership agreement by causing or permitting mdc to license an automated electronic brokerage system to one of cflp competitors.in a opinion,the chancery court found that cfi conduct was an egregious breach of the partnership agreement,and rejected iris cantor counterclaims seeking to reform the partnership agreement to conform to her and cfi alleged understanding that the agreement did allow mdc to compete with cflp.
on june,plaintiffs cfi and iris cantor commenced this diversity action charging defendants with fiduciary breaches in failing to disclose the partnership agreement provision.defendants moved to dismiss on the basis,among other reasons,that all of plaintiffs causes of action accrued between june when the partnership agreement was amended and may when the first delaware action was settled and,therefore,were barred by the applica
