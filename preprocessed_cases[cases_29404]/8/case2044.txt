this is an appeal from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york stanton,dismissing on the pleadings a diversity action brought by ambase corporation ambase against for indemnification of legal expenses incurred in a tax dispute with the internal revenue service irs.this dispute concerned certain tax liabilities that allegedly were assumed by the predecessor corporation of city investing company liquidating trust the trust.the district court dismissed the complaint upon a finding that the express contractual indemnification claim pleaded therein failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that the restitution,unjust enrichment,implied contract,and breach of fiduciary duty claims were time barred by new york statute of limitations.the district court further denied ambase leave to amend its complaint because the breach of contract and breach of beneficiary contract claims ambase sought to add in its amended complaint were also time barred.
this is ambase second bite at the litigation apple,its first bite having been taken in an action filed in the delaware chancery court,see ambase city inv.liquidating trust,wl,ca.ch delaware action,which was dismissed as time barred by delaware shorter statute of limitations.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that ambase claims are barred as a matter of law by the doctrine of res judicata.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court without reaching the merits of whether ambase various claims either fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted or are time barred.
background 
i.the parties 
city investing company city was a delaware holding company that was dissolved and liquidated in.before its dissolution and liquidation,city was the holding company for a multinational conglomerate with subsidiaries in the manufacturing,housing,and insurance industries.ambase comm r,cch,wl.one of city subsidiaries was the home group,which changed its name to ambase in ambase owned several operating subsidiaries,including the home insurance company,and in the mid held assets in excess of billion.ambase,at.
in,as part of its dissolution and liquidation,city consummated a transaction pursuant to which it distributed out its assets and liabilities.the relevant detail of this transaction was that city distributed the outstanding shares of ambase to city common stockholders.at the same time,the trust was formed to,among other things,assume all of the claims,liabilities,and obligations of city that were not otherwise provided for.the trust was initially funded with assets having an aggregate estimated value of approximately million.city shareholders were the beneficiaries of the trust and received ownership units in it.between and,the trust distributed over million in cash and assets to the former stockholders of city.
certain directors and officers of city trustee defendants occupied certain fiduciary positions with both ambase and the trust.george scharffenberger was a trustee of the trust since its creation and served as chairman of the board of directors of ambase from prior to until january,and as ambase chief executive officer from march until may.eben pyne has been a trustee of the trust since its creation and was a member of the ambase board from prior to until january.and lester mantell has served as a trustee of the trust since its creation,had been a senior city officer before the ambase,and served in several officer positions including treasurer and chief financial officer at ambase from prior to until december.while at ambase,mantell a tax attorney had significant responsibility for ambase tax matters.
ii.the assignment of certain liabilities from city to ambase 
pursuant to an august assignment agreement,ambase assumed certain liabilities of city in consideration for city payment of and the unwinding of certain debits and credits relating to intercorporate transactions.among those liabilities were city obligations for federal income taxes as the common parent of city corporate affiliates.in addition,ambase assumed certain other liabilities and obligations of city,provided that ambase would be only secondarily liable for the payment of those liabilities.
shortly after the assignment agreement was executed,city and the trustees entered into a trust agreement.ambase was not a party to the trust agreement.among other things,the trust agreement provided that the trustees were to assume all the claims,liabilities,and obligations including unascertained or contingent liabilities in expenses of city listed on schedule i of the trust agreement.schedule i listed among the liabilities assumed any cost,expense or liability associated with any claim asserted against city with respect to any act or omission attributable to its operations or affairs which has not been discharged in full or adequately provided for.in addition,schedule i included,as a liability of the trust,the costs and liabilities incurred in the defense of any litigation arising after september,in which city investing was a defendant.tax liabilities were not expressly mentioned in schedule 
iii.tax dispute 
during the latter half of the,city sought access to the eurobond market to obtain financing at a fixed rate of interest and to reduce the amount of indebtedness it had borrowed from its american bankers under a revolving credit agreement.ambase,cch at.at this time,t he practice in the eurobond market was for issuers of securities to provide indemnification for withholding taxes to foreign investors.id without such indemnification,f oreign investors would not have purchased eurobond obligations because the imposition of withholding taxes would decrease their rate of return on the eurobond obligations.id.
during this time,american companies looking to raise money in the eurobond market often formed a subsidiary in the netherlands antilles,which would issue debt securities in the eurobond market that were guaranteed by the american parent corporation.id.the netherlands antilles subsidiary would then lend the eurobond offering proceeds to the parent or one its affiliates.id.in certain circumstances,the american parent company payment of interest on its indebtedness to the netherlands antilles subsidiary would be exempt from american withholding taxes by reason of the application of the income tax convention,as extended by protocol to the netherlands antilles.id.
in,city formed a subsidiary in the netherlands antilles.in and,city raised million and million,respectively,from the eurobond market through its netherlands antilles subsidiary.id.at.the payment of principal and interest on these notes was unconditionally guaranteed by city.id.furthermore,the notes provided that the issuer would indemnify the holders with respect to any american withholding taxes that might be imposed.id.city netherlands antilles subsidiary immediately lent the proceeds from the eurobond offering to city.id.in may,the notes were repaid in full.id.at.in september,city liquidated and dissolved its netherlands antilles subsidiary,and the remaining debt on the notes was upstreamed to city.id.
in or about march,the irs issued a revenue agent report to city contending that city had failed properly to withhold taxes during tax years and for the interest payments it made to the foreign holders of the eurobonds.the irs claimed that this subsidiary did not meet the requirements for exemption from united states withholding taxes the irs later extended that claim to the period covering tax years through.the amount of the withholding at issue was almost million.as of march,the accrued interest on that sum was about million.
in,ambase did not pay the taxes alleged to have been owed moreover,ambase did not demand that the trust pay the taxes allegedly owing,nor did it demand that the trust assume the defense against the irs.on or about may,the irs issued a notice of deficiency to ambase,claiming entitlement to the funds that it alleged should have been withheld.
on or about june,ambase filed a petition with the united states tax court on behalf of city contesting the alleged tax liability.by,the accrued interest on the withholding obligation of million had risen to million for a total liability of over million.ambase did not seek to bring the trust into the case or to sue the trust.a little over years then passed,during which time ambase did not claim that the trust was primarily responsible for the withholding taxes.
iv.delaware action 
on august,ambase filed a complaint against the trust and the trustee defendants for declaratory and injunctive relief in the delaware chancery court,contending that the potential withholding tax obligation that it had been apprised of fourteen years earlier was not its primary responsibility under the assignment agreement.ambase sought a preliminary injunction preventing the trust from making distributions that would endanger the trust ability to pay the withholding tax liability,which had by then grown to million ambase also sought the recovery of million in legal expenses and related costs that it had allegedly incurred in connection with the irs dispute and the tax court litigation.in particular,ambase alleged that,when the irs dispute arose during the,the trustee defendants 
apparently taking the position that ambase was primarily responsible for the alleged withholding obligation,caused ambase to effectively assume the costs and expenses of defending against the alleged withholding obligation without obtaining independent professional advice or guidance concerning whether the alleged withholding obligation was the primary obligation of ambase,or the trust,as successor to city.competent and independent professional advisors likely would have informed management that the alleged withholding obligation was an obligation for which the trust was primarily liable.
count i of the complaint in the delaware action sought an order declaring that the trust,as successor to city,is primarily liable for any alleged withholding obligation that is the subject of the tax court litigation and alleged that such liability was based on the trust agreement and the assignment agreement.in count ii,captioned restitution and implied contract,ambase alleged that the trust had been unjustly enriched by ambase expenditure of the million in legal expenses associated with the tax court litigation and that equity impose d an obligation on the trust to repay these costs and expenses incurred on the trust behalf by ambase,which was entitled to restitution from the trust for these expenditures.in september,the trust and the trustees moved to dismiss the delaware action on the grounds that the causes of action alleged were time barred by the delaware statute of limitations and that the complaint failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted.
in a december,ruling from the bench which was later memorialized in an unpublished order dated february,the delaware chancery court dismissed the delaware action with prejudice solely on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches.in ruling from the bench,the chancery court began its analysis by describing the claims alleged by ambase as essentially saying this primary liability was never contractually shifted from city to ambase.it never was there in the first place.we should be dealing with this.it is not within the scope of the agency that we took on.turning to the question of the timeliness of the delaware action,the chancery court stated 
giving ambase all of its due,the claim began to run at least as early as the notice of deficiency,because if you do act on the notice of deficiency by challenging it,it is going to be reduced to a judgment.all along this has been a sum certain,and interest has been running.
the chancery court then turned to ambase allegations that delaware statute of limitations should have been equitably tolled because the trustee defendants presence on ambase board of directors created a conflict of interest that prevented the board from acting sooner.the court began its analysis with the facts pleaded in the complaint that there were no trustees remaining on ambase board by the end of and that,by the end of,trustee mantell stopped serving as an officer of ambase.therefore,by the end of,this cloud that supposedly kept this corporate entity from discovering a claim that was based on a contract that was out there in the open had been lifted.
the chancery court issued an unpublished written decision dated february,in which it denied ambase motion for reargument and sought to expound further on its ruling from the bench.after recapping the facts of the case,the court characterized its prior discussion of when ambase claims accrued as follows 
in sum,am b ase claims that the trust was primarily responsible for the potential withholding tax liability,that it should be required to set aside assets sufficient to satisfy that liability,and that it and not am b ase should bear the cost of contesting the liability were surely ripe as of,if not in.these claims could also have been explicitly framed as breaches of the trust obligations under the assignment agreement they are in fact pled implicitly as such now.
footnotes omitted.
the court then turned to its earlier treatment of ambase equitable tolling argument,that the trustee defendants fraudulently concealed the basis for am b ase claims or that the claims were inherently undiscoverable before all of the trustee defendants had departed from am b ase.the court noted how thin it had found ambase equitable tolling argument to be based on the facts that a majority of ambase board had always been comprised of directors who were not affiliated with the trust and who were aware of the trustee defendants affiliations with the trust and the facts necessary to learn of ambase potential liability for the withholding taxes were contained in the assignment agreement and the code,neither of which was concealed.even though the court had found ambase equitable tolling argument to be weak,it noted that,in the end it had not based its dismissal on a holding that the statute of limitations began to run before the last of the trustee defendants had left am b ase,in or.emphasis added.instead,the court held that the equitable tolling argument lacked merit,assuming for the purposes of that holding that ambase claims accrued as late as december.
district court proceedings and resolution of the tax dispute 
in january after the delaware chancery court had dismissed the delaware action but while ambase motion for reargument of that decision was pending,ambase commenced the action giving rise to this appeal by filing a complaint in the district court against the trust and the trustee defendants.the factual allegations in this complaint closely mirrored those in the complaint filed in the delaware action.for example,in count i of the complaint,ambase once again sought a declaration that the trust rather than ambase was primarily liable for the payment of the disputed withholding taxes and accrued interest,alleging that the liabilities ambase assumed in the assignment agreement did not include the obligation to pay the withholding taxes,which accordingly fell among the other liabilities of city that were assumed by the trust.ambase also again sought a declaration that it was entitled to reimbursement from the trust of the million in legal expenses that ambase had incurred in the tax court litigation.in addition to this declaratory relief,ambase once again sought injunctive relief preventing the trustees from winding up the trust affairs or disbursing any trust assets to the beneficiaries of the trust.and,in count ii of the complaint,ambase once again alleged causes of action sounding in restitution,unjust enrichment,and implied contract,seeking the return of the million in legal expenses incurred in the tax court litigation.
ambase also alleged two additional causes of action that are relevant to this appeal in count iii of the complaint,ambase alleged that the trustee defendants breached the fiduciary duties that they owed to ambase as a result of the conflicts of interest created by their dual service as trustees of the trust and officers and directors of ambase.in particular,ambase alleged that the trustee defendants breached their fiduciary duties to ambase by i improperly attempting to impose upon ambase a purported withholding tax obligation that was and remain ed the lawful obligation of the trust ii failing or refusing to obtain independent and competent advice concerning the subject of whether the alleged withholding obligation was properly the responsibility of the trust iii causing ambase to incur substantial expenses,including attorneys fees,in attempting to eliminate or minimize the potential exposure relating to the alleged withholding obligation iv failing to properly inform new management of ambase that the withholding tax obligation was one that was properly borne,if at all,by the trust and v causing the trust to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars to city former stockholders,the beneficiaries of the trust when they knew or,in the absence of gross negligence should have known,that the trust was primarily liable for the alleged withholding obligations.
in addition to its breach of fiduciary duty claim,ambase also pleaded a cause of action sounding in indemnification in count iv of the complaint.in particular,ambase alleged,pursuant to the assignment agreement or the trust agreement,that it was entitled to contractual indemnification from the trust for the legal expenses it incurred in the tax court litigation.
in february,the defendants moved,pursuant to.b,to dismiss ambase complaint on the ground that,inter alia,the causes of action pleaded therein were barred by new york statute of limitations.the gravamen of the defendants motion was that ambase claims accrued in date when the irs issued its revenue agent that the delaware chancery court decision in the delaware action collaterally estopped ambase from claiming otherwise.thus,the defendants argued,ambase claims were time barred some time in.alternatively,the defendants argued that,if ambase claims accrued as late as december when the last of the trustee defendants departed from ambase,under new york discovery rule,ambase had only two additional years from in which to file suit,so its claims were time barred after.
while the district court action was pending,on may,the tax court resolved the dispute between ambase and the irs in favor of ambase,holding that neither city nor ambase was liable for the withholding taxes on the interest payments made to the foreign bond holders.see ambase,cch at.the irs did not appeal.consequently,because the tax court held in favor of ambase and there was no longer any liability for the withholding taxes,ambase only remaining claim before the district court was for the million in legal expenses,which it alleged that the trust should pay.
following its victory in the tax court,ambase sought leave in october to amend its complaint to include two additional causes of for breach of contract and one for breach of a contract to which ambase was a beneficiary.in the breach of contract claim,ambase alleged that the trust breached the assignment agreement by i designating ambase as city agent for purposes of the tax dispute with the irs and refusing to acknowledge the primary liability therefor ii transferring the tax dispute with the irs to ambase and iii failing to be primarily liable for the payment,discharge and performance of the obligations associated with the tax dispute with the irs and the costs and expenses of the tax court litigation and otherwise failing to live up to the terms and conditions of the assignment agreement.in the beneficiary claim,ambase alleged that it was an intended beneficiary of the trust agreement between city and the trust and that the trust breached the trust agreement by failing to compensate ambase for its costs,expenses,and legal fees associated with the tax court litigation.the district court decided to defer consideration of ambase request for leave to amend its complaint until after it had addressed the defendants motion to dismiss the original complaint.
in an unpublished opinion and order dated january,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss.as an initial matter,the district court rejected the defendants collateral estoppel argument,finding that the delaware chancery court had not specified that ambase claims accrued in.according to the district court,all that was needed to support the chancery court decision that those claims were time barred under the delaware statute of limitations was that the claims accrued no later than august,three years before the commencement of the delaware action.in particular,the district court reasoned that no finding had been made by the chancery court other than that the claims were barred because they accrued at some earlier time and nothing supported a tolling of the delaware statute of limitations beyond,which was over three years before ambase commenced the delaware action.the district court then dismissed as a matter of law the restitution,unjust enrichment,implied contract,and breach of fiduciary duty claims as being time barred.the district court agreed with the defendants argument that these claims accrued either in in which case they were time barred six years later in or in in which case they were time barred two years later in.the district court next dismissed ambase contractual indemnity claim for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in reaching this conclusion,the district court interpreted the assignment agreement as not providing for indemnification as a matter of law.
six days later,the district court entered final judgment dismissing all of ambase claims.on january,ambase moved,pursuant to.e and b,to alter or amend the judgment and again requested leave to amend its complaint to include the breach of contract and beneficiary contract claims referenced above.the district court denied ambase motion by a memorandum endorsement dated february,stating that the proposed amendments to ambase complaint would be futile because they would do nothing to alter the date of accrual under the six year statute of limitations which applies equally to actions upon an express or an implied contractual obligation or liability.this timely appeal followed.
