on november,counsel for bounds forwarded a letter by certified mail to pine belt.the text of the letter in its entirety is as follows 
as attorney for greg bounds,this letter is to serve as the statutory notice required under ann.of his claims of professional negligence against your facility and his intention to begin legal action within sixty days of this notice.primarily,bounds alleges that you were professionally negligent in your failure to advise him that the prescription zyprexa could result in various complications,including but not limited to diabetes,and your continued prescription of zyprexa once he developed diabetes.additionally,bounds alleges that you were professionally negligent in your failure to advise and instruct your staff on the dangers and complications that studies had shown to be related to the prescription zyprexa.
bounds may assert such additional claims as his experts or representatives believe the evidence supports.
the ann.citation in the letter describes a mississippi statute that requires sixty days prior written notice in advance of suit against any health care provider for professional negligence.this statute provides that the notice must advise the health care provider of the legal basis of the claim and the type of loss sustained,including with specificity the nature of the injuries suffered.id.apparently,there was no specific response to the letter,although the mississippi citizen defendants do not contest the statement in bounds brief on appeal that,subsequent to the letter,bounds attorney cooperated with the insurer and attorneys representing the mississippi citizen defendants in providing additional information and medical releases for bounds to facilitate their investigation of the claims.
ii.commencement of the action,removal,and proceedings in the district courts 
this action was commenced by the filing of a complaint in the forrest county circuit court on july.the complaint alleges causes of action in malpractice and professional negligence against the mississippi citizen defendants count i negligence and gross negligence against eli lilly count ii strict liability in tort and failure to warn against eli lilly count iii liability under the mississippi extended manufacturers liability doctrine against all defendants count iv breach of implied warranty against all defendants count v breach of express warranty against all defendants count vi fraud against all defendants count vii and fraud by concealment against all defendants count viii.the complaint included the following specific allegations in paragraph four thereof 
the plaintiff specifically avers that the core claim alleged in this complaint contends that the health care providers named as defendants herein to wit,pine belt mental health care and the individual defendants,lamousin and ulusarac were professionally negligent and commitment sic medical malpractice in their treatment of the plaintiff,with the claims alleged against the defendant eil sic lilly being primarily either a proximate cause of or a contributing factor to such professionally sic negligence,or otherwise alleging that eli lilly committed acts collaterally related to or causally connected to the alleged acts of professional negligence and medical malpractice.accordingly,any attempt by any named defendant herein to remove this case to federal court would be baseless in fact,frivolous and in contradiction to controlling and applicable legal authority.
thereafter,on december,eli lilly removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi.in its notice of removal,eli lilly asserted that bounds had failed to comply with the requirements of the mississippi tort claim act,ann,which requires written notice containing specific information to be served within ninety days prior to filing suit on tort claims against governmental entities in mississippi.included in the notice of removal was the following 
because plaintiff did not provide timely and proper notice as required by ann,the complaint is insufficient as a matter of law to state claims against defendants pine belt mental health care,lamousin and ulusarac,and those claims must be dismissed.accordingly,defendants pine belt mental health care,and lamousin have been fraudulently and improperly joined as defendants to defeat diversity and must be disregarded for purposes of determining diversity of citizenship for federal jurisdiction.
accordingly,eli lilly contended that jurisdiction in the mississippi district court was properly invoked on the basis of complete diversity of citizenship,since it was a citizen of indiana and the sole remaining defendant,and plaintiff bounds was a citizen of mississippi.bounds thereafter filed a motion to remand,and the mississippi citizen defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action with respect to the claims pleaded against them.
iii.decisions of the district courts 
in its opinion for dismissal,the mississippi district court first observed that federal diversity jurisdiction can not be defeated by the improper joinder of an defendant and that there is improper joinder where there is actual fraud in pleading jurisdictional facts or the plaintiff is unable to establish a cause of action against the defendant.bounds
