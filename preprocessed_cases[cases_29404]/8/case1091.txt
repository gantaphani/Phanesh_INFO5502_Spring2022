patrick proctor is an inmate in the custody of the new york state department of corrections and community supervision doccs,serving a sentence of years to life for murder,robbery,and attempted escape.he is confined in the special housing unit the shu,or,as it is better known,solitary confinement,where he has spent the last years.proctor spent his first nine years in the shu under disciplinary segregation and the last thirteen years and counting under administrative segregation.are current and former doccs administrators lucien leclaire,a former deputy commissioner of doccs brian fischer,a former commissioner of doccs anthony annucci,the current acting commissioner of doccs and joseph bellnier,the current deputy commissioner of doccs collectively,defendants.
proctor brings this action under,alleging that his continuous confinement in the shu under administrative segregation violates his fourteenth amendment rights to procedural and substantive due process of law.the district court sharpe,granted defendants motion for summary judgment on proctor procedural due process claim,holding that no reasonable juror could conclude that proctor was denied meaningful periodic reviews of his administrative segregation commitment.the district court also awarded summary judgment to defendants sua sponte on proctor substantive due process claim.
we conclude that the record presents triable issues of fact regarding proctor procedural due process claim and that the district court violated federal rule of civil procedure f in awarding summary judgment sua sponte on proctor substantive due process claim.the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
background 
in the doccs system,there are two relevant reasons for prison administrators to send an inmate to the shu disciplinary segregation and administrative segregation ad seg.disciplinary segregation,as its name suggests,is designed to discipline an inmate found guilty of a tier iii violation,the most serious of three infraction levels in the doccs system.comp.codes regs.tit,a.a disciplinary segregation term lasts for a designated period of time as specified by the hearing officer.id.a.once that time elapses,the statute does not empower doccs to punish the inmate doubly for the same infraction by imposing further disciplinary segregation.see id.
ad seg serves a different purpose.as relevant here,ad seg removes an inmate from the general population when he pose s a threat to the safety and security of the prison facility.id.b.given the importance of that purpose,ad seg is flexible and accords doccs officials substantial discretion in deciding whether to impose an ad seg term.ad seg terms are and do not require that doccs predetermine when it will release an inmate a t any time when deemed appropriate by doccs,an inmate may be evaluated and recommended for return to general population.id.e 
there is,however,a constitutional ceiling on that flexibility to ensure that a state prison facility does not use ad seg as a pretext to commit an inmate to the shu indefinitely,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment mandates that prison officials periodically review whether an inmate continues to pose a threat to the facility.hewitt helms,abrogated in part on other grounds by sandin conner.new york effectuates that mandate by providing an inmate with an initial hearing within fourteen days of his confinement in ad seg,see comp.codes regs.tit,a,and with reviews conducted pursuant to section d of the doccs regulatory code section d reviews every sixty days until he is returned to the general population,see id.d.
section d review,as it manifests itself in this case,is a process first,a committee commonly referred to as the facility committee,consisting of a representative of the facility executive staff,a security supervisor,and a member of the guidance and counseling staff,convenes to review the inmate institutional record.id.d.the facility committee prepares and submits to the superintendent of the prison a report outlining i reasons why the inmate was initially determined to be appropriate for ad seg ii information on the inmate subsequent behavior and attitude and iii any other factors that the committee believe s may favor retaining the inmate in or releasing the inmate from ad seg and recommending whether to continue the inmate shu term.id.
second,the superintendent forwards the facility committee report and any written response that the inmate submits to a central office committee located at doccs headquarters in albany,new york,for central office review.the central office committee,consisting of a representative from the office of facility operations,a member of the doccs inspector general staff,and an attorney from the office of counsel,reviews the facility committee report,develops its own recommendation whether the inmate continues to pose a safety threat to the facility,and forwards the paperwork to the deputy commissioner of doccs.id.d.
third,the deputy commissioner reviews the two committees recommendations,as well as the inmate written statement when applicable,and decides whether to continue the inmate in ad seg.id.once the deputy commissioner makes a final decision,he or she notifies the superintendent of the inmate prison facility,who provides written notice to the inmate of the decision and its reason s,and a statement notifying the inmate of his right to submit a written statement in the next section d review.id.d.
proctor is currently held under ad seg in the shu at the upstate correctional facility.he is serving a state prison term of years to life for murder and attempted escape and is first eligible for parole in.proctor previously served two other terms in state prison for convictions of,inter alia,burglary,robbery,and assault.
proctor early years in prison in the and early were marked by violence and dangerous defiance of the law.proctor stabbed an inmate.he absconded from a job search from the edgecombe correctional facility.proctor kelly,wl,at,proctor i suddaby,internal quotation marks omitted.he attempted to escape from a police vehicle by unlocking his handcuffs and kicking a window.see id at.he professed a desire to be more famous than willie bosket,a notorious prisoner in doccs.id.at.and he used a prison telephone to solicit unsuccessfully another person to firebomb a residence.id.at.
proctor defiance reached its apex in november,when he and three executed an elaborate escape from shawangunk correctional facility,a maximum security facility doccs officials apprehended proctor after he had been at large for about five hours.disciplinary proceedings against proctor for his escape resulted in a sentence of ten years of disciplinary segregation in the shu.
proctor behavior in the shu under disciplinary segregation varied.for the first three years of his shu term,he continued his defiance.proctor managed to remove his handcuffs without permission while in his cell.see proctor i,wl,at.he threw feces at doccs officials.see id.at.he twice set fire to his cell.id.at.he concealed a razor in his rectum.id.he stabbed another inmate.id.and he received disciplinary reports for disorderly conduct,fighting,harassment,movement violations,refusing direct orders,and violent conduct.id.at.later in his time in disciplinary segregation,however,proctor behavior improved considerably.defendants recount in their brief in this court that b ecause proctor had periods of good behavior while in the shu,over time,doccs gradually reduced his disciplinary segregation penalty to nine years and one month.appellees br.
on the day he was scheduled to be released from disciplinary segregation,doccs served proctor with an ad seg recommendation and retained him in the shu.proctor i,wl,at.doccs held a hearing shortly thereafter to determine if proctor was appropriate for ad seg.see id.at.the hearing officer found that proctor posed a threat to the prison facility based on proctor criminal history and misbehavior,including his escape and his early behavior in disciplinary segregation.see id.at.as a result,as soon as proctor disciplinary segregation ended,doccs retained him in the shu under ad seg,where he has spent the last thirteen years and remains today 
proctor behavioral record in ad seg has not been spotless.in the first few years,proctor received minimal disciplinary reports for possession of contraband,lewd exposure,and unhygienic acts,littering and harassment.in the last decade,he has committed two unhygienic acts and possessed one unidentified weapon.at times,he can be argumentative with his fellow ad seg inmates.
but in the main,proctor behavior has remained positive.he has gone long stretches including one period of almost four years without any disciplinary reports.see fourteen months without a disciplinary report,almost four years without a disciplinary report,twenty months without a disciplinary report,twenty months without a disciplinary report.particularly in the last eight years,doccs has observed that proctor has made an extensive effort to minimize his disciplinary violations.he received just one disciplinary report between december and the close of the record in this case.doccs considered proctor attitude positive,co operat ive,and much improved.
defendants have without fail conducted a section d review for proctor every sixty days he has been in ad seg.each time,the upstate corrections facility committee made up of a rotating panel of upstate corrections officials convenes to review proctor institutional record and make a recommendation.that committee forwards proctor paperwork to the central office committee comprising a rotating panel of officials from doccs headquarters,which in turn reviews proctor case and any written statement proctor submits.the central office committee then issues a recommendation,which to this point invariably has been that proctor should remain confined in ad seg,and forwards the paperwork to the deputy commissioner of doccs.the deputy commissioner reviews the facility and central office committees reports and adopts their recommendations.finally,the upstate corrections facility superintendent notifies proctor of the deputy commissioner decision in a summary report.
the procedural history in this case involves multiple lawsuits and a prior appeal,mostly addressing procedural issues unrelated to our decision today.much of that history is described in detail in proctor leclaire,cir.proctor iii.here,we briefly summarize the prior history and lay out the present dispute.
proctor brought his first pro se challenge to his ad seg commitment in.proctor i,wl.he brought a claim alleging,inter alia,that various doccs officials,including commissioner leclaire,deprived him of procedural and substantive due process by confining him in ad seg as soon as his disciplinary segregation ended,and violated the eighth amendment by forcing him to live in inhumane conditions in the shu.id.at.in a brief at the stage,proctor also claimed for the first time that defendants denied him due process by failing to conduct a single meaningful section d review to date.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.id.at.proctor appeal in this court was dismissed as frivolous.
in,proctor instituted his second pro se challenge to his ad seg commitment,the action which is ultimate source of this appeal.proctor leclaire,wl july,proctor ii sharpe.again,proctor brought a claim against leclaire asserting,inter alia,that his section d reviews since his initial commitment to ad seg were sham s,perfunctory,and meaningless and performed as a pretext to confine proctor in ad seg indefinitely.id.at.the court understood proctor to assert that leclaire had deprived him of due process.see id.at willey kirkpatrick,cir.requiring that courts interpret pro se litigants papers liberally to raise the strongest arguments they suggest quoting burgos hopkins,cir.on leclaire motion,the district court dismissed proctor action on res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds.proctor ii,wl,at.this time,proctor timely appealed and was appointed counsel.proctor iii,at.we reversed without expressing a view on the merits of proctor claim,vacated the dismissal,and remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
on remand,proctor,still aided by counsel,filed an amended complaint,the pleading in play in this appeal.that complaint added former commissioner fischer in his personal capacity and acting commissioner annucci and deputy commissioner bellnier in their personal and official capacities as defendants to this action.proctor alleges that defendants denied him procedural due process because none of the section d reviews while he was confined in ad seg has been meaningful.proctor supports his claim by arguing that,inter alia,defendants justified his continued confinement in ad seg by citing incidents,such as the escape,for which he already served his disciplinary sentence,that defendants used his consistent good behavior over the past several years against him as further justification to continue his confinement in ad seg,emphasis omitted and that many of proctor reviews have consisted of mere copying and pasting of language from one review to the next.proctor concludes that defendants have used sham reviews of his ad seg as a pretext to indefinitely confine him in the shu.
proctor also alleges that his confinement in the shu for uninterrupted years amounts to a deprivation of substantive due process.in light of physical and psychological injuries he claims to suffer,proctor alleges that defendants failure to undertake meaningful section d reviews render s his indefinite confinement arbitrary and oppressive in a constitutional sense.
defendants moved for summary judgment on proctor procedural due process claim,arguing primarily that proctor section d reviews comport with procedural due process.
to defend against defendants motion,proctor deposed witnesses from all three levels of his section d reviews.he began with christopher delutis and joseph porcelli,members of facility committee panels that reviewed proctor ad seg commitment.both witnesses espoused the belief that,by and large,inmates who once posed an escape risk would never be appropriate candidates for release from ad seg.delutis testified that there is nothing any of the shu inmates he has reviewed could do for him to believe that they were no longer an escape risk,and that there is no behavior that those specific inmates could exhibit that would make him change his mind about whether or not they were an escape risk.when asked if there was anything an inmate can ever do to overcome an escape history,delutis said,all i know is in my experience,i never recommended anybody for release.porcelli testimony was similar he affirmed that he has never dealt with a prisoner released from ad seg who has a history of escape.and when asked,in your experience,once an inmate is placed in ad seg,they never released to general population porcelli responded,y es,that correct.
the general view expressed by delutis and porcelli did not change in proctor case both indicated that,given his escape attempts,they believed proctor would never be released from ad seg.when asked,is there anything that proctor could ever do to change your opinion about whether or not he should be released from ad seg delutis answered,no.i believe proctor is right where he belongs.delutis ultimately admitted that proctor behavior plays no role in the decision whether or not to maintain him in a d s eg because proctor is an escape risk.id.porcelli again struck a similar tone,stating that the only thing that proctor could do for porcelli to believe he not an escape risk is g et old or reach the end of his sentence.even as proctor counsel walked porcelli through section d review reports demonstrating that proctor had a positive disciplinary record for over five years,porcelli stood by his decision to recommend continuation of proctor ad seg term.he testified that proctor s till posed an escape risk given the amount of time he ha s to do and that he had j ust an inner feeling that given the opportunity,proctor would try to escape again.
porcelli raised one more issue of note as a general matter,porcelli confirmed that ad seg is used for disciplinary reasons.he identified at least one instance in which ad seg was used in place of discipline because prison officials did not have enough evidence to pin a disciplinary infraction on an individual that they suspected.he then admitted that ad seg is being used for disciplinary reasons for proctor.but see miller ad s eg is not to punish proctor.
proctor next deposed scott kelly and mark miller,members of central office committee panels that conducted some of proctor section d reviews.both recounted methodical central office review procedures,marked by strong reliance on facility committee reports.kelly stated that he places great weight on the facility committee because they are boots on the ground with the inmate.miller similarly stated that the central office committee relies very heavily on the facility committee.miller testified that he does no preparation for meetings of the central office committee and instead rel ies on what is presented by the facility committee.miller testified that he has never disagreed with a recommendation by the facility committee.
proctor counsel also asked both kelly and miller whether,in their experiences,ad seg inmates who once posed an escape risk have any hope of being returned to the general population.kelly identified one instance in which an inmate who had been committed to ad seg after escaping from a juvenile facility outside the doccs system was later released from the shu.see that t he initial incident occurred outside the doccs system was taken into account when deciding whether to release the inmate from ad seg.miller was unable,however,to identify any inmate placed in ad seg after escaping a doccs facility who had been returned to the general population.see.
lastly,proctor deposed bellnier and leclaire,the two deputy commissioners who conducted the final level of proctor section d reviews.bellnier recollection of his participation in the section d review process demonstrated significant reliance on both the facility and central office committees.bellnier testified that in each section d review form he receives,the portion indicating his final decision has already been completed for him by an unknown member of the central office committee.that is,someone completes the deputy commissioner portion of the section d review form before bellnier reviews the committees work,and bellnier merely signs the bottom of the form to indicate his approval.just as miller has never disagreed with a recommendation by the facility committee,bellnier testified that he has never disagreed with a recommendation by the central office committee.
when asked about proctor in particular,both bellnier and leclaire focused on proctor escape history as justification for continuing his ad seg.leclaire stated,i not sure any action that proctor could do would counteract his criminal history because proctor criminal history alone justif ies his retention in ad seg.that proctor escapes and other serious misbehavior occurred in the distant past was not relevant to leclaire section d reviews.id.bellnier concurred,testifying that he has formed the opinion that proctor would be a threat to any facility that he was in in general population.bellnier stated that he ha s not been presented with any type of behavior proctor could exhibit to get out of ad seg and suggested that he would continue to keep proctor in ad seg even if proctor behavior remained positive for decades so long as proctor did not accept responsibility for past actions.see.
proctor also sought production of the paperwork for each of his section d reviews since his initial ad seg commitment in.many of the section d reports reflect detailed evaluations of the appropriateness of proctor continued ad seg term occasionally,the reports contain specific responses to proctor written complaints.the reports also reveal,however,three issues of note first,six of proctor section d reviews,from december through october,note that proctor ad seg status has a disciplinary aspect to it.see.second,many of the reports are virtually identical to each other,with the exception of a few stray notations.see,over one year of virtually identical reports,over one year of virtually identical reports,over one year of virtually identical reports.and third,the facility committee reasoning in some of the reports is hard to understand the committee wrote that proctor positive behavior and attitude with staff make him a high profile security concern,that proctor superficial cooperat ion on a day to day basis can not sic mask his resistance to authority,and that proctor good behavior was irrelevant because the shu provides little opportunity for infractions.when asked at his deposition to explain what the facility committee meant by these notations,porcelli responded,that a little weird,is it.i ca explain that.
in october,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.proctor leclaire,wl,sharpe,proctor iv.the court held that although defendants had deprived proctor of a liberty interest by confining him in ad seg for more than days,proctor had received all the process due for that deprivation because defendants provided proctor with section d reviews that were,as a matter of law,meaningful.id.at.the district court then addressed proctor substantive due process challenge,even though defendants had not moved for summary judgment on that claim.id.at.without acknowledging it was raising summary judgment sua sponte and providing the parties with notice,the district court concluded on its own that d efendants did not exhibit sic behavior because they were never made aware of the alleged devastating effects of proctor continued placement in ad seg.id.as a result,the court held defendants were entitled to summary judgment on proctor substantive due process claim as well.id.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
w e review de novo a grant of summary judgment,affirming only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.willey,at quoting fed.civ.a.summary judgment is inappropriate when the admissible materials in the record make it arguable that the claim has merit.kaytor boat,cir.quoting jasco tools,dana in re dana,cir.we construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.willey,at.in reviewing the evidence and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn,we may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.kaytor,at omission in original emphases omitted quoting reeves sanderson plumbing,
proctor claims that he was denied procedural due process.to prevail,he must be able to demonstrate that defendants deprived him of a cognizable interest in life,liberty,or property,without affording him constitutionally sufficient process.const.amend.xiv,wolff mcdonnell.the district court held that proctor shu term in excess of days gives rise to a cognizable liberty interest.see sandin,at holding that an inmate has a cognizable liberty interest in freedom from restraint which imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.because defendants take no issue with that decision,the sole issue before us on this claim is whether defendants afforded proctor sufficient process.
proctor raises a view of inmate procedural due process this court has yet to address.while he acknowledges that defendants have nominally afforded him sufficient process by conducting regular section d reviews,proctor argues that those reviews have been in substance hollow,perfunctory,and meaningless.appellant br.a meaningless section d review,proctor asserts,is the functional equivalent of no review at all and therefore constitutionally insufficient.proctor also argues that defendants have violated the due process clause by using ad seg as a means to punish him improperly and as a pretext to confine him in the shu indefinitely.
proctor argument raises two preliminary concerns first,proctor claim can not serve as an appeal from his section d reviews.procedural due process does not permit a court to review the substance of defendants decision to confine proctor in ad seg.see graziano pataki,cir.per curiam.we may not substitute our judgment for defendants,nor may we rebalance the section d criteria.see id.the due process clause permits only an evaluation of whether defendants method for coming to their ad seg determinations is sufficient.second,we are mindful of the context in which this case arises and the deference we owe prison officials in carrying out their daily tasks.see bell,at.o ne can not automatically apply procedural rules designed for free citizens in an open society to the very different situation in a state prison.wolff,at.with those observations in mind,we proceed to the merits of proctor claim.
in hewitt helms,the supreme court described what process is due from prison officials making ad seg determinations.at.the court made clear that ad seg is appropriate when necessary to incapacitate an inmate who represents a security threat or to complet e an investigation into misconduct charges.id.at.so long as prison officials seek to achieve one or both of those goals,they have wide latitude in the procedures they deploy.before confining an inmate in ad seg,prison officials must provide some notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to transfer him to ad seg,although not necessarily a full hearing.accord taylor rodriguez,cir.once that has occurred,prison officials need only conduct an informal,nonadversary evidentiary review of whether the confinement is justified.hewitt,at.their final ad seg decision may turn largely on purely subjective evaluations and on predictions of future behavior.id.at internal quotation marks omitted 
once an inmate has been confined in ad seg,hewitt mandates that prison officials engage in some sort of periodic review of the confinement to verify that the inmate remains a security risk throughout his term.hewitt,at.periodic ad seg reviews are also flexible and may be based on a wide range of administrative considerations,including but not limited to observations of the inmate in ad seg,general knowledge of prison conditions,misconduct charges,ongoing tensions in the prison,and any ongoing investigations.id.the purpose of these periodic reviews is to ensure that the state institutional interest justifying the deprivation of the confined inmate liberty has not grown stale and that prison officials are not using ad seg as a pretext for indefinite confinement of an inmate.see id.
it is well established that whenever process is constitutionally due,no matter the context,i t must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.armstrong manzo,accord parratt taylor,mathews eldridge,goldberg kelly,taylor,at.proctor claim seeks to measure what hewitt requires for meaningful periodic review of ad seg.guiding that analysis are the three mathews factors the government interest in limited fiscal and administrative burdens,the private interest in freedom from restraint,and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the private interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.at.
the state interest in flexible ad seg review procedures maintaining institutional security is substantial.institutional safety and security are perhaps a prison facility most important considerations.bell,at quoting pell procunier,citing jones prisoners labor union,procunier martinez.courts must preserve prison officials free dom to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of inmates and corrections personnel and to prevent escape.bell,at.prison administrators therefore should be accorded deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.id.but see covino.dep t of,cir.per curiam at some point the administrative necessity for involuntary begins to pale.
however,the private interest implicated by an extended and indefinite stay in ad seg is also weighty.hewitt instructs that an inmate in ad seg who was merely transferred from one extremely restricted environment to an even more confined situation generally does not have a private interest of great consequence.see at.but helms,the inmate in hewitt,spent less than two months in ad seg awaiting his disciplinary hearing.id.at.proctor,by contrast,has spent thirteen years in ad seg with no release date in sight.proctor interest in avoiding an indefinite ad seg term is surely substantial,more so than helms interest in avoiding a temporary ad seg term awaiting a hearing.compare comp.codes regs.tit,a providing for limited admission to the shu in the case of an inmate who is awaiting initial appearance before or determination of a disciplinary hearing as in the case of helms,with id.providing for admission to the shu under ad seg as in this case.we are not alone in this view.the third circuit has similarly concluded that an inmate who has spent an extended period of time in ad seg and whose term is potentially limitless has a more significant liberty interest for due process analysis than that attributed to helms.mims shapp,cir.
in light of those counterbalancing interests,we believe that meaningful periodic reviews of ad seg must at least satisfy the following criteria 
first,the reviewing prison officials must actually evaluate whether the inmate continued ad seg confinement is justified.see hewitt,at.it is not sufficient for officials to go through the motions of nominally conducting a review meeting when they have developed a conclusion that the inmate will be confined in ad seg no matter what the evidence shows.review with a outcome is tantamount to no review at all.
second,the reviewing officials must evaluate whether the justification for ad seg exists at the time of the review or will exist in the future,and consider new relevant evidence as it becomes available.it is inherent in hewitt use of the term periodic that ongoing ad seg reviews may not be frozen in time,forever rehashing information addressed at the inmate initial ad seg determination.proctor iii,at t he initial authorization for confinement and the subsequent decisions to continue confinement although plainly involving considerations that overlap are not the same transaction.internal quotation marks omitted.rather,reviews must take into account prison conditions and inmate behavior as they change over time those changes may modify the calculus of whether the inmate presents a current threat to the safety of the facility.the periodic ad seg review test announced by the hewitt court is not whether the confined inmate was a threat to the facility when he was confined initially it is whether the inmate remains a security risk on the date of the periodic review.see at emphasis added.this is not to say that prison officials are barred from according significant weight to events that occurred in the past.neither do we suggest that recent events categorically ought to be more salient in periodic reviews than those that occurred long ago.we conclude merely that prison officials must look to the inmate present and future behavior and consider new events to some degree to ensure that prison officials do not use past events alone to justify indefinite confinement.see id.
third and finally,the reviewing officials must maintain institutional safety and security or another valid administrative justification as their guiding principles throughout an inmate ad seg term.shu confinement that began for proper ad seg purposes may not morph into confinement that persists for improper purposes.the state is entitled to the procedural flexibility that hewitt allows because of its manifest interest in maintaining safe detention facilities and other similar administrative concerns the mathews balancing test tips in favor of the inmate liberty interest when a state seeks to impose discipline.patterson,at.the state may not use ad seg as a charade in the name of prison security to mask indefinite punishment for past transgressions.
