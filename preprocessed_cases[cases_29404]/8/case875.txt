this is an appeal from a terse order dismissing a civil complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.because it is impossible to tell what arguments the district court found persuasive,we have canvassed the field.we conclude that the complaint states one potentially actionable claim and another that is not beyond hope of repair.consequently,we reverse the order of dismissal in part and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because this is an appeal from an order under.b,we take the facts as they are alleged in the plaintiff complaint sec sg,cir lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir.we ignore,however,bald assertions,periphrastic circumlocutions,unsubstantiated conclusions,and outright vituperation,cir.once the scene is set,we recount the travel of the case.
a.the facts.
in july of,joseph rodi,a law student who resided in new jersey,received a recruitment letter from francis larkin,dean of southern new england school of law snesl.the letter stated in pertinent part that the accreditation committee of the american bar association aba had voted to recommend snesl for provisional accreditation,a status that would be granted upon ratification of the recommendation by two other aba bodies.the letter also stated that snesl was highly confident of receiving the needed ratifications and that the future of the school has never been brighter.because the plaintiff intended to take the new jersey bar examination,the prospect of accreditation was critically important to him new jersey requires bar applicants to hold law degrees from institutions.
larkin letter ended with a pitch for enrollment.the solicitation bore fruit the plaintiff enrolled at snesl that month.he received a catalogue from snesl containing,inter alia,a statement in the same type size and font as the surrounding text to the effect that the law school makes no representation to any applicant or student that it will be approved by the american bar association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student.the complaint alleges that,despite the cheery optimism of larkin letter,the dean knew full well that snesl had identifiable deficiencies that would almost certainly preclude aba accreditation.
the aba denied snesl application for accreditation in september of.as a result,the plaintiff considered transferring to an accredited law school for his second year of study.word of his ambivalence reached the dean office.david prentiss,who was then the acting dean,wrote to the plaintiff in order to make sure that he was fully informed of the school current status regarding aba accreditation.that communique stated in substance that the school had improved the four areas found deficient by the aba and that there should be no cause for pessimism about the school achieving accreditation before the plaintiff forecasted graduation date.
in reliance on these and other of which the complaint says were knowingly plaintiff remained at snesl.he came to regret the choice according to the complaint,snesl knew,but elected not to disclose,that the aba was highly critical of snesl that any faint hope of attaining accreditation depended upon a complete overhaul of the faculty,administration,curriculum,and student body and that the level of made the prospect of snesl accreditation remote.to compound this mendacity,the school frustrated students attempts to learn about the true status of the accreditation pavane.
in november of the plaintiff third year of legal aba denied snesl renewed application for accreditation.snesl failed to appeal to the aba house of delegates as it previously had promised.instead,the school cashiered half of its faculty,thereby straying even further from standards.
the plaintiff completed his studies in june of.snesl remained unaccredited.notwithstanding his diploma,the plaintiff has not been able to sit for the new jersey bar examination.
travel of the case.
on july,the plaintiff sued snesl,larkin,and prentiss in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the district court dismissed that action for want of in personam jurisdiction on april.rodi new engl.sch.of law,d.on june,the plaintiff,acting pro se,sued the same defendants in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.grounding jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,a,his complaint incorporated copies of the larkin and prentiss letters and limned nine statements of claim.
we confine our discussion to the two claims that the plaintiff presses on appeal i that the defendants statements constituted actionable fraud or misrepresentation,and ii that snesl actions violated a consumer protection statute.laws ch.the defendants filed a timely motion to dismiss,positing that the complaint,for a variety of reasons,failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.as to the fraudulent misrepresentation count,the defendants asseverated that the misrepresentations were statements of opinion that the supposed fraud had not been alleged with the requisite particularity that,in all events,the plaintiff professed reliance on those statements was unreasonable and that the statute of limitations had run.with respect to the chapter count,the defendants averred that the complaint failed to state an actionable claim because the alleged misrepresentations were insufficient to trigger the prophylaxis of the statute,and,moreover,the complaint failed to allege that a demand letter had been sent before suit.see.laws ch.
the plaintiff,still acting pro se,filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss in which he made a rebuttal of the defendants asseverations.as part of his opposition,he tendered five affidavits,two additional letters,and an array of other documents.snesl filed a reply and,not to be outdone,proffered a welter of documents including copies of its catalogues for the years in question.
the district court abjured oral argument and ruled on the papers.it entered a cryptic order,providing in its entirety that the motion to dismiss should be allowed for substantially the reasons outlined in defendants memorandum of law.the plaintiff promptly moved for reconsideration,suggesting,among other things,that if the district court found the complaint allegations too scanty,it could have granted leave to amend.the court denied the motion without comment.this counseled appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we divide our discussion of the issues into several segments.first,we ascertain what materials are properly before us.we then proceed count by count and theory by theory.in so doing,we omit any reference to the seven counts that the plaintiff has elected not to defend on appeal.
configuring the record.
the threshold issue here involves a determination of what legal standard the district court applied or should have applied in examining the pleadings before it.the defendants styled their motion as a motion to dismiss,but the parties then proffered exhibits containing information extraneous to the complaint.that presents a quandary.
the civil rules provide that when matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule.b.the district court order is silent as to whether it elected to convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment.consequently,we must decide whether the court actually took cognizance of the supplemental material,or invoked rule,in arriving at its decision.garita hotel.ponce fed.bank,cir.
the state of this record is tenebrous.we do know,however,that the district court embraced the defendants memorandum of that memorandum relied upon the rule b standard,not the quite different rule standard.in the same vein,both sides have briefed the case on appeal as if rule b,rather than rule,controls.under the unique circumstances of this case,considerations of fundamental fairness counsel in favor of following the parties and the lower court lead and testing the arguments on appeal under the jurisprudence of rule b.we adopt that course.
once that decision has been made,the standard of review becomes straightforward.orders granting motions to dismiss under rule b engender de novo review.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir.in ruling on whether a plaintiff has stated an actionable claim,an inquiring court,be it a trial or appellate court,must consider the complaint,documents annexed to it,and other materials fairly incorporated within it.in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir cogan phoenix life ins,cir.this sometimes includes documents referred to in the complaint but not annexed to it.see coyne cronin,cir beddall state bank trust,cir fudge penthouse int l,cir.finally,the jurisprudence of rule b permits courts to consider matters that are susceptible to judicial notice.colonial mortg.bankers,at boateng interamerican,cir.
giving force to these principles,we may consider on this appeal the facts alleged in the complaint,the larkin and prentiss letters which were annexed to it,and any matters that may be judicially noticed.we also may consider snesl catalogue,alleged by the plaintiff to comprise a part of the contract between the parties,as a document fairly incorporated into the complaint.see beddall,at.however,we may not consider at this stage the array of affidavits and miscellaneous documents proffered by the parties.
having identified the materials that are properly before us,we briefly address the question of affirmative defenses.on a rule b motion,the court inquiry sometimes may encompass affirmative defenses.everything depends on the record.as a general rule,a properly raised affirmative defense can be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss so long as i the facts establishing the defense are definitively ascertainable from the complaint and the other allowable sources of information,and ii those facts suffice to establish the affirmative defense with certitude.colonial mortg.bankers,at.
against this backdrop,we examine the bases on which the district court could have predicated its decision.we take each count and each ground in turn.
b.the fraudulent misrepresentation count.
the defendants advance a motley of potential defenses to the plaintiff fraudulent misrepresentation claim.we address them sequentially.
in general.we start by testing the vitality of the claim as a whole.we will uphold a dismissal on this ground only if the plaintiff factual averments hold out no hope of recovery on any theory adumbrated in his complaint.id.at citing rogan menino,cir.our task is not to decide whether the plaintiff ultimately will prevail but,rather,whether he is entitled to undertake discovery in furtherance of the pleaded claim.scheuer rhodes,d.in this process,the fact that the plaintiff filed the complaint pro se militates in favor of a liberal reading.see boivin black,cir explaining that courts hold pro se pleadings to less demanding standards than those drafted by lawyers.
sitting in diversity,we look to the substantive law of the forum state here,massachusetts to guide our analysis.correia fitzgerald,cir.under massachusetts law,a claim for misrepresentation entails a false statement of material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act and reasonably relied upon by him to his detriment.zimmerman kent.the plaintiff claim passes this screen.
as to larkin,the complaint,read liberally,alleges the following i larkin knew that the plaintiff was a new jersey resident who wanted to practice law there ii he also knew that the plaintiff could not sit for the new jersey bar unless he graduated from an accredited law school iii he sent a letter to the plaintiff in new jersey stating that snesl was highly confident of receiving accreditation,knowing that this statement was materially false because snesl had substantial deficiencies that would make accreditation difficult if not impossible and iv the plaintiff,relying on larkin letter,enrolled at snesl,paid substantial sums for tuition,and invested three years of his life in mastering its curriculum.we think that these allegations,if proven,would make out a viable claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.see kerr shurtleff,holding that college committed fraudulent misrepresentation by falsely telling prospective student that it could make him a when student enrolled and graduated but school lacked the authority to grant the degree.
a similar analysis applies to the plaintiff fraudulent misrepresentation claim against prentiss.prentiss statement that there was no cause for pessimism about the prospect of accreditation is materially false if there was in fact cause for pessimism due to the extent of the school known shortcomings.the plaintiff alleges that prentiss knowingly made this false statement in order to induce him to remain enrolled at snesl and that he rodi took the bait and relied on it to his detriment.
as pleaded,snesl is vicariously liable for these fraudulent misrepresentations.it is reasonable to infer from the allegations contained in the complaint that larkin and prentiss were employees of snesl acting within the scope of their employment.consequently,their misrepresentations are attributable to snesl on respondeat superior grounds.see generally kavanagh trs.of boston,citing restatement third of agency tent.draft.accordingly,the complaint,on its face,states a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against all three defendants.
matters of opinion.the defendants effort to this claim is multifaceted.their first counter is that the cited statements were,at most,statements of opinion.that is true,in a sense,but it does not get the defendants very far.
a statement,though couched in terms of opinion,may constitute a statement of fact if it may reasonably be understood by the reader or listener as implying the existence of facts that justify the statement or,at least,the of any facts incompatible with it.see mceneaney chestnut hill realty,see also restatement second of torts explaining that a statement of opinion as to facts not disclosed may be interpreted as an implied statement that the facts known to the maker are not incompatible with his opinion levinsky,stores,cir a statement couched as an opinion that presents or implies the existence of facts which are capable of being proven true or false can be actionable.thus,it is an actionable misrepresentation for a corporation falsely to tell investors that a specific project is a great success that is proceeding smoothly and better than expected in order to keep them from pulling the plug.stolzoff waste.int l.similarly,it is an actionable misrepresentation for a car dealer to tell a buyer that he believes a vehicle is in good condition when he knows that it has significant mechanical defects.briggs carol cars.
the restatement,favorably referenced in the massachusetts cases,gives a stunningly appropriate example 
w hen an auditor who is known to have examined the books of a corporation states that it is in sound financial condition,he may reasonably be understood to say that his examination has been sufficient to permit him to form an honest opinion and that what he has found justifies his conclusion.the opinion thus becomes in effect a short summary of those facts.when he is reasonably understood as conveying such a statement,he is subject to liability if he has not found facts that justify the opinion,on the basis of his misrepresentation of the implied facts.
restatement second of torts,cmt.b.the parallel is apparent.the plaintiff complaint alleges that the aba has formulated certain objective criteria that inform its decisions about whether and when to accredit law schools.it also alleges that larkin,knowing of these criteria,wrote a letter to the plaintiff implying that the school was reasonably capable of satisfying them.if larkin did know of disqualifying and probably irremediable deficiencies as the plaintiff has alleged,his statement that snesl was highly confident of accreditation was actionably misleading.prentiss statement that there was no cause for pessimism about the fate of the school renewed accreditation application is subject to much the same analysis.
to be sure,knowing falsity is much easier to allege than to prove.here,however,the district court jettisoned the fraudulent misrepresentation count at the pleading stage.given the liberal standards of rule b,that dismissal can not rest on the opinion defense.
failure to plead with particularity.for the most part,a civil complaint need only contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.for that reason,g reat specificity is ordinarily not required to survive a rule b motion.garita hotel,at.that proposition,however,is not universally applicable.cases alleging for this purpose,misrepresentation is considered a species of an exception to it.alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir.that exception,codified in.b,requires that fraud be alleged with particularity.id.this heightened pleading standard is satisfied by an averment of the who,what,where,and when of the allegedly false or fraudulent representation.accord powers boston cooper,cir mcginty beranger volkswagen,cir.
in this instance,the defendants assert that the district court was warranted in dismissing the fraudulent misrepresentation claim for failure to abide by these strictures.in addressing that assertion,we note that the specificity requirement extends only to the particulars of the allegedly misleading statement itself.see educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.the other elements of fraud,such as intent and knowledge,may be averred in general terms.see.b.
after careful perscrutation,we deem this line of defense unavailing.the larkin and prentiss letters are unarguably specific as to speaker,content,context,and time.these statements are sufficient to shield the fraudulent misrepresentation count from dismissal at the pleading stage.see,powers,at see also philippe shape,holding that documents affixed to complaint that contained alleged misrepresentations satisfied rule b.
we note,however,that the complaint attributes a gallimaufry of other substantially similar statements to the defendants.we count no fewer than four such allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations i that a snesl employee had reported that the application for accreditation came within an inch of aba approval ii that an admissions officer proclaimed that snesl will be accredited iii that snesl claimed it had received a special time waiver from the aba because its case for accreditation was so strong and iv that if accreditation were again denied,snesl would appeal directly to the aba governing body.none of these four statements is pleaded with the particularity required under rule b.insofar as we can tell from the complaint,each such statement was made by an unidentified person at an unnamed place and at an unspecified time such gossamer allegations are patently inadequate under rule b.see alternative.concepts,at ahmed rosenblatt,cir.
when a claim sounding in fraud contains a hybrid of allegations,some of which satisfy the strictures of rule b and some of which do not,an inquiring court may sustain the claim on the basis of those specific allegations that are properly pleaded.see vess.usa,cir serabian amoskeag bank shares,cir.so it is here.for that reason,we take no view either as to whether the plaintiff,on remand,should be permitted to amend his complaint to add particulars anent the other four statements or as to whether,absent an amendment,evidence of those statements may be introduced at trial in support of the allegation that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the larkin and prentiss letters.in the first instance,such matters,should they arise,are for the district court.
reasonable reliance.reasonable reliance is,of course,an element of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim under massachusetts law.zimmerman,at.the defendants strive to persuade us that the disclaimer placed in the school any representation to any applicant or student that snesl will be approved by the american bar association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student renders any reliance by the plaintiff on larkin and prentiss epistles unreasonable as a matter of law.we are not convinced.
under massachusetts law,the reasonableness of a party reliance ordinarily constitutes a question of fact for the jury.laborers health welfare fund philip morris,d,cataldo ambulance,city of chelsea.when,however,the facts alleged in the complaint preclude a finding of reasonable reliance,a court may enter an order of dismissal under rule b.see.laborers health welfare fund,d at saxon theatre sage.the defendants argue that the disclaimer,incorporated by reference in the plaintiff complaint,makes this such a case.
in mounting this argument,the defendants distort the fraudulent misrepresentation.they insist that the plaintiff asserted injury flows from a broken promise of accreditation,that he was promised accreditation that did not occur.since the disclaimer flatly contradicts any such representation,the defendants say,reliance on that promise was objectively unreasonable.
this argument erects,and then attacks,a straw man.as said,the plaintiff complaint alleges that the defendants falsely implied that snesl had the capacity to achieve accreditation.this is a meaningful distinction.it is one thing for an actor to demur when asked to guarantee a third party actions.it is quite another for an actor to mislead a person into believing that the actor itself possesses means and abilities fully within its control.given this distinction,the defendants reliance on the disclaimer is misplaced inasmuch as the disclaimer does not cover the alleged misrepresentations,it can not defeat them.see hitachi credit am.signet bank,cir holding that a contracting party may recover for fraud notwithstanding specific disclaimers that do not cover the allegedly fraudulent representations.
it is,of course,arguable that the proof at summary judgment or at trial may show that the disclaimer does cover whatever misrepresentations if any were actually made.but even if the defendants characterization of the plaintiff fraudulent misrepresentation claim was on the mark,we could not affirm the order of dismissal on this ground.we explain briefly.
under massachusetts law,a party may not contract out of fraud.turner johnson johnson,cir.with this in mind,massachusetts courts consistently have held that disclaimers do not automatically defeat fraudulent misrepresentation claims.see,bates southgate,sound techniques,hoffman,see also vmark software,emc,collecting cases.
at the motion to dismiss stage,information such as the conspicuousness of the disclaimer and the parties discussions concerning it is largely undeveloped.these details are relevant,as the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract will shed light upon the disclaimer meaning and effect.see turner,at stating that when dealing with an ambiguous disclaimer,the agreement is to some extent left undefined,and the plaintiff understanding of the agreement logically may be colored by the defendant prior statements,fraudulent or otherwise.on an empty record,we would have no principled choice but to decline the defendants invitation to hold,as a matter of law,that there is no possible set of circumstances under which the disclaimer might prove ineffective.see realty,texaco,cir cautioning against deciding whether an exculpatory clause precludes a misrepresentation claim without development of a factual record.
statute of limitations.the defendants have a final fallback position.they assert that,even if the fraudulent misrepresentation claim is actionable,it is.we explore this possibility.
to a limited extent,a statute of limitations defense can be considered on a rule b motion.see,lachapelle,at.the key is whether the complaint and any documents that properly may be read in conjunction with it show beyond doubt that the claim asserted is out of time.id.
massachusetts law provides that an action in which fraudulent misrepresentation is a species shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.laws ch.a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation does not begin to accrue until a plaintiff learns or reasonably should have learned of the misrepresentation.kent dupree,accord patsos first albany,mceneaney,at.in this context,courts sometimes ask when sufficient indicia of warnings,so to have been apparent to a reasonably prudent person.see,wolinetz berkshire life ins,cir young lepone,cir.
in the case at hand,the plaintiff complaint alleges that he learned of persistent deficiencies precluding aba accreditation at an unspecified date in november of.there are no facts alleged in the complaint that require an inference of an earlier accrual date.as of that time,then,the plaintiff should have figured out that the defendants rodomontade about the school capabilities and the imminence of accreditation was quite likely pie in the sky.on that basis,the plaintiff should have commenced his action no later than november of the precise date is inconsequential,for reasons that shortly will become apparent.because this action was not docketed until june,a cursory glance would appear to validate the defendants assertion that the statute of limitations had run.see,jolicoeur new engl.sch.of law,fed.appx,cir per curiam holding a similar action,filed by one of the plaintiff classmates on june,to be.
appearances sometimes are this is such an instance.here,unlike in jolicoeur,the plaintiff filed an antecedent suit in the district of new jersey on july,within the putative limitations period.although that case was dismissed on april,the dismissal was not on the merits,but,rather,for want of personal jurisdiction over the named defendants snesl,larkin,and prentiss.rodi,d at.
this history is significant because,under massachusetts law,if an action is duly commenced within the limitations period and then dismissed for any matter of form,the plaintiff is entitled to commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal.laws ch.the savings statute applies,inter alia,to an action originally filed and dismissed in a court of another state or in a federal district court.see boutiette dickinson,liberace conway.
we have no doubt that,for purposes of this savings statute,dismissals for want of personal jurisdiction are appropriately classified as dismissals arising out of matters of form.ciampa beverly airport comm n,holding that dismissal for bringing an action in the wrong court is a matter of form within the meaning of.after all,as the supreme judicial court of massachusetts wrote almost two centuries ago in describing an earlier version of the law,the legislature enacted the savings statute to ensure that where a plaintiff has been defeated by some matter not affecting the merits,some defect or informality,which he can remedy or avoid by a new process,the statute of limitations shall not prevent him from doing so.coffin cottle,pick,emphasis supplied.a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is the paradigmatic example of a decision not on the merits that can be cured by new process in a different court.see teva,usa,fda.
that ends this aspect of the matter.this action and the earlier new jersey action are sisters under the skin they involve the same parties,the same events,the same nucleus of operative facts,and the same causes of action.by means of the savings statute,the plaintiff had one year from the dismissal of his timely new jersey april,file anew.he instituted the action sub judice on june.his fraudulent misrepresentation claim is therefore timely.
in an effort to blunt the force of the savings statute,snesl raises the red flag of waiver.it asserts that because the plaintiff first set forth the savings statute argument in his opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss,he is not entitled to benefit from it.snesl overlooks,however,that a court asked to dismiss a complaint on statute of limitations grounds may examine not only the complaint but also such other documents as may appropriately be considered under.b.see blackstone realty llc fdic,cir.
here,the facts that the plaintiff relies on to show the applicability of the savings statute,the date that he filed the original action,the nature of that action,the date it was dismissed,and the basis for the dismissal are all susceptible to judicial notice.see.those facts may,therefore,be considered in assessing the force of the limitations defense.see colonial mortg.bankers,at see also kowalski gagne,cir it is that federal courts may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts if those proceedings have relevance to the matters at hand.
snesl citation to granahan commonwealth,does not alter this conclusion.in a diversity case,procedure,unlike substance,is governed by federal law.see correia,at federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural rules.under federal procedural precedents,there has been no waiver the plaintiff presented developed argumentation on the savings statute to the lower court,and thus preserved that issue for appellate review b t masonry constr.pub.serv.mut.ins,cir.
to say more on this issue would be supererogatory.at this stage of the game,the statute of limitations affords no basis for dismissal of the plaintiff fraudulent misrepresentation claim 
c.the chapter claim.
the situation concerning the plaintiff claim under the massachusetts consumer protection act is less.before bringing suit under that statute,a plaintiff must mail to the defendant a written demand for relief,identifying the claimant and reasonably describing the unfair or deceptive act or practice relied upon.laws ch.this notification must be furnished no fewer than thirty days prior to the filing of suit.id.the statutory notice requirement is not merely a procedural nicety,but,rather,a prerequisite to suit.entrialgo twin city dodge.furthermore,as a special element of the cause of action,it must be alleged in the plaintiff complaint.id.
in this instance,neither the plaintiff complaint nor the documents attached thereto mention any such notification.that is sufficient ground to justify dismissal of the chapter claim.see,city of boston aetna life ins,spilios cohen,see also gooley mobil oil,cir explaining that,in order to survive a rule b motion,a complaint must set forth factual allegations,either direct or inferential,respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.
this ruling has no effect on the plaintiff fraudulent misrepresentation claim.see york sullivan,explaining that the notice requirement is a prerequisite to an action under chapter,but nothing in the statute makes it a prerequisite to any other remedy available to aggrieved consumers.moreover,it may represent no more than a temporary victory for the defendants.a failure to allege compliance with the statutory notice requirement is not necessarily a death knell for a chapter claim.massachusetts courts typically have allowed plaintiffs to amend in order to cure this kind of modest pleading defect.see,jacobs yamaha motor,parker.federal practice is no less permissive.see.a stating that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.
allowing an opportunity to amend is especially fitting here.our reasons are fivefold.first,the plaintiff filed the complaint pro se,and courts should endeavor,within reasonable limits,to guard against the loss of pro se claims due to technical defects.boivin,at.second,a fraudulent misrepresentation,actionable at common law,often can form the basis for a chapter claim.see,adams liberty mut.ins,levings forbes wallace,see also vmark software,at collecting cases.so here apart from the question of notice,the plaintiff allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation state a colorable claim for relief under chapter.third,the plaintiff vouchsafed in his opposition to the motion to dismiss,and now reaffirms,that he did in fact furnish the statutorily required notice fourth,we do not know whether the district court even focused on this defect as we have said,the district court did not state a particularized ground for dismissing this claim.finally,the plaintiff,even without knowing the precise basis for the district court order of dismissal,did seek leave to amend as part of his reconsideration request an overture that the district court denied without any explanation.
the supreme court declared long ago that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.conley gibson,d.the view that the pleading of cases is a game in which every miscu
