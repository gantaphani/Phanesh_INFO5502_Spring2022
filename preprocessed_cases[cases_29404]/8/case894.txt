these arise out of an indemnification dispute between an employer and its insurer.the principal issue is whether the employer must be indemnified for certain belated contributions it made to the accounts of various subsidiary employees.upon determining that these payments and certain other amounts were covered by the relevant policy,the district court granted the employer motion for summary judgment in the amount of and denied the insurer for summary judgment seeking a declaration of no coverage under the policy.see pacific ins.eaton vance,d,pacific ins.eaton vance,d.april.we reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand.
the relevant facts having been twice reported,see,we confine ourselves to the essentials.
a.the plan 
since the,eaton vance management eaton vance and its predecessors have operated a qualified plan plan for their employees.annual contributions to the plan are discretionary and,if made,are derived from eaton vance profits in a given fiscal year.of particular importance are the plan criteria.
prior to november,employees of eaton vance subsidiaries were not included in the plan unless the respective subsidiary expressly adopted the plan by written resolution in july,eaton vance adopted new plan november,documents that allegedly broadened the plan eligibility criteria to include automatically subsidiary employees unless specifically excluded.supplying our own emphasis to language that significantly differs from,or adds to,language in the prior governing documents,see supra,the documents provide in pertinent part 
the term employee includes a any employee of the employer 
employer means the employer named in the last section of the adoption agreement,any commonly controlled organization,and any predecessor organization 
an employee ordinarily becomes an active participant on his entry date.however,there are three exceptions c an employee is not an active participant during any period in which he is not an employee in an eligible class.
an employee is in an eligible class unless he falls within one of four exceptions not germane to this appeal.
subject to the rules of this article,a commonly controlled organization may join the principal employer eaton vance in adopting this plan.a commonly controlled organization with any employees eligible must join the principal employer in adopting this plan.no other organization may do so.
an organization joins by a written resolution 
it is uncontested that,despite its adoption of the documents,eaton vance management was unaware of the change in language.
because eaton vance did not intend to broaden the eligibility criteria,it continued to believe that a subsidiary affirmative adoption of the plan was a condition precedent to the subsidiary employees eligibility,it continued to operate the plan as it had prior to the adoption of the documents and treated as participants only those employees of those subsidiaries that had expressly adopted the plan.accordingly,it did not automatically establish accounts in the names of all subsidiary employees.nor did it specifically exclude them from the plan or provide them with information regarding the plan.
b.the claim against eaton vance 
on february,wilfredo hernandez,then an employee of an eaton vance subsidiary compass management,sent to eaton vance a letter indicating that money due him under the plan had not been deposited into his account.upon receiving this letter,eaton vance contacted its outside erisa counsel for an evaluation of hernandez claim.although compass had not adopted the plan by written resolution,outside counsel advised eaton vance that,due to the plain language of the documents,hernandez likely would be successful if he chose to litigate.further,counsel warned eaton vance that there would be serious tax consequences if the irs discovered that the plan had not been administered according to its terms.eaton vance thereafter adopted counsel advice and has since steadfastly before the district court and on the documents were worded so as to cover hernandez and other similarly situated employees.
on april,outside erisa counsel sent to hernandez attorney a letter acknowledging that eaton vance should have recognized hernandez and other similarly affected participants as plan participants.the letter also stated that eaton vance would fund those accounts at the level they would have been funded had the employees been recognized as participants all along 
c.the insurance policy 
back in,pacific insurance company pacific had issued to eaton vance a mutual fund errors and omission policy policy effective from august,to august.the policy provided coverage for 
l oss or liability incurred by eaton vance,from any claim made against eaton vance during the endorsement period,by reason of any actual or alleged failure to discharge his or its duties or to act prudently within the meaning of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,or by reason of any actual or alleged breach of fiduciary responsibility within the meaning of said act in eaton vance capacity as a fiduciary with respect to any pension or employee plan or trust.
d.the notification the funding of overdue accounts 
by letter dated june,eaton vance notified pacific of the hernandez claim.pacific thereafter responded with a letter acknowledging receipt of eaton vance letter.subsequently,eaton vance asked pacific to agree to a filing with the irs under the voluntary compliance review vcr program.this filing had been proposed by outside erisa counsel as a means to end eaton vance exposure to governmental penalties for noncompliance with the documents.pacific acknowledged this request but before consenting to this action urged eaton vance to consider withholding any additional contributions to the plan.pacific further stated that it was reserv ing its rights and advised eaton vance to take whatever action it deems appropriate to protect eaton vance including the filing of a vcr application.
the vcr application ultimately was filed with,and approved by,the irs.although hernandez had been the only party to make a claim under the plan,eaton vance thereafter established accounts for a total of employees and contributed to those accounts representing the and to fund the accounts to the level they would have attained had eaton vance timely contributed.
e.the litigation 
on june,pacific filed a diversity action in the district of massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment of no coverage under the policy.see and.specifically,pacific alleged,inter alia,that eaton vance did not breach its fiduciary duties or fail to discharge its duties or act prudently within the meaning of erisa the obligation to make payments is not due by reason of a breach of fiduciary responsibility or by reason of a failure of eaton vance to discharge its duties and,even if there is coverage under the policy,a per claim deductible exists for each excluded employee.eaton vance counterclaimed,alleging that the policy covered its liabilities.eventually,both parties moved for summary judgment.
on august,the district court entered summary judgment for eaton vance upon determining,inter alia,that eaton vance had breached its fiduciary duty under erisa and eaton vance liability to the excluded employees was caused by this breach.see pacific ins,d at.the court did find,however,that there existed a deductible for each employee claim accordingly,it granted summary judgment to pacific on this issue.see id.at.finally,on april,pacific was ordered to pay eaton vance see pacific ins,d at.
these followed.
standards of review 
summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in ruling on the motion,the district court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.barbour dynamics research,cir.and,of course,t he standards are the same where,as here,both parties have moved for summary judgment.bienkowski northeastern,cir citing charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the court must rule on each party motion on an individual and separate basis,determining,for each side,whether a judgment may be entered in accordance with the rule standard.the district court rulings on the for summary judgment are reviewed de novo.see of justice,cir citations omitted.
in order for pacific to be held liable under the policy,eaton vance must have incurred a loss or liability by reason of any actual or alleged failure to discharge its duties or to act prudently within the meaning of erisa or by reason of any actual or alleged breach of fiduciary responsibility within the meaning of erisa.as already stated,the district court determined that coverage existed under the policy because each element was satisfied.without necessarily opining on whether the facts of this case implicate either the first or third prong,we turn directly to a discussion of the second.
b y reason of is not defined in the policy accordingly,if the language were ambiguous,we normally would consider whether the phrase should be construed in favor of eaton vance.see cody.life ins,i f the contract is ambiguous,doubts as to the meaning of the words must be resolved against the insurance company that employed them and in favor of the insured.citations and internal quotation marks omitted ins.of north,cir applying massachusetts law and noting that the presumption against the insurer does not apply where the policy language results from the bargaining between sophisticated commercial parties of similar bargaining power citation omitted.
here,however,we need not reach the contra proferentem issue because we consider the language unambiguous by reason of means because of,black law dictionary ed,and thus necessitates an analysis at least approximating a causation test.united states,cir the statutory phrase by virtue of,by its plain meaning,suggests a causation test.citing webster third new int l dictionary defining by virtue of to mean by reason of three sons,phoenix ins,the words liability imposed by reason of any statute,clearly imports a direct causal relation between the fact of liability and the violation of a statute.to qualify for this exclusion,liability must directly result from the violation of the statute emphases added.we therefore reject eaton vance assertion that by reason of is a more generous standard that extends coverage beyond the strict test pacific seems to be applying.see cody,at a policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely expressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance with its terms.citations and quotation marks omitted.
having defined the relevant language,we next consider whether eaton vance liability to the employees falls within the policy scope.eaton vance argues that,even under a restrictive reading of the policy causation element,coverage exists because the cause of eaton vance liability was its failure to administer the plan in accordance with the plan documents by identifying the proper participants,hernandez and other similarly situated employees and establishing and funding accounts for them when contributions were made this failure was a breach of eaton vance fiduciary obligations and that o nce this breach occurred,no intervention from any other force was required to bring about the liability.presented with a similar argument the district court agreed with eaton vance the failure to read the plan documents closely enough to see that the scope of the plan had changed was a breach of fiduciary duty which resulted in hernandez account not being funded.pacific ins,d at emphasis added.
having had the benefit of additional briefing and oral argument on this tricky issue,we arrive at a different conclusion.as we see it,the relevant liability for which eaton vance seeks recovery from its insurer is not one for breach of fiduciary duty relative to the belatedly funded employee accounts rather,eaton vance seeks reimbursement for amounts it and satisfaction of its obligation to establish and fund those accounts to the level they would have attained had eaton vance initially complied with the plan.so understood,the cause of this obligation can not be the breach of the obligation instead,in our view,this obligation derived from the broadened eligibility criteria in the documents themselves as now interpreted by eaton vance,management discretionary decision to fund,and the employees concomitant entitlement to interest that would have accrued in their accounts had eaton vance acted in accordance with the plan by establishing and funding the accounts see,american cas.of reading,hotel rest.employees bartenders int l union welfare fund,the refusal to pay an obligation simply is not the cause of the obligation,and the insured wrongful act in this case did not result in their obligation to pay its contract imposed on it the obligation to pay.
whether or not eaton vance breached its fiduciary duties under erisa by initially failing to administer the plan in timely accordance with its terms is thus of no import to the relevant causation inquiry because the underlying obligation for which reimbursement is sought existed regardless of whether eaton vance first complied with its fiduciary duties or breached them.accordingly,we must also reject eaton vance alternative argument that the asserted breach of fiduciary duty was a concurrent cause of the obligation.see couch,couch on insurance ed.the concurrent cause rule takes the approach that coverage should be allowed whenever two or more causes do appreciably contribute to the loss,and at least one of the causes is an included risk under the policy.
as we understand the situation,the difference between what did happen the belated funding of the accounts and what should have happened the timely funding of the accounts is only one of timing because eaton vance management failed to read the documents prior to receiving the hernandez letter,management became aware of the company liability to the accounts later than it otherwise would have.eaton vance essentially argues this same point in its brief had eaton vance administered the plan according to its terms during each affected year,the omitted participants would have had funded accounts at the time they came to seek benefits.
but the fact that the alleged breach of fiduciary duty resulted in the late payment of funds does not alter the essential fact that the liability was incurred by reason of the adoption of the documents,management discretionary decision to fund the accounts of eligible employees,and the employees entitlement to the interest that would have accrued in their accounts had eaton vance established and funded the accounts as required by the plan.the insurance policy at issue covers debts incurred by reason of,inter alia,a breach of fiduciary duty it does not cover debts that are incurred through a contractual obligation although belatedly paid because of a breach of fiduciary duty.
as indicated above,eaton vance admits that hernandez and other similarly situated employees were,pursuant to the documents,automatically covered unless specifically excluded.indeed,the company acknowledges as much in its brief to this court.there,in arguing that it breached its fiduciary duty under erisa,eaton vance concedes that t he governing plan documents by their terms made all employees of the employer eaton vance and its commonly controlled participants.emphasis added.effectively,then,eaton vance asserts that the documents established eligibility so as to render eaton vance failure to fund in years in which funding was authorized a breach of fiduciary duty while at the same time arguing that,for purposes of the policy,the resulting obligation was incurred by reasons other than the documents and management decision to fund in the relevant years.eaton vance can not have it both ways.would we have reached the same result had the employees claims wound up in litigation while not intuitively obvious,the answer is yes.this hypothetical lawsuit might have alleged several theories of liability for example,breach of plan documents breach of fiduciary duties
