this appeal requires us to consider whether charles simon simon,a retail consumer of electricity in new york city,can maintain an antitrust action against keyspan corporation keyspan,a producer of electricity in new york that allegedly colluded with one of its rivals to increase installed capacity prices,and morgan stanley capital group morgan stanley,a financial firm that allegedly facilitated keyspan anticompetitive conduct.the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge dismissed claims principally on the grounds that he lacked antitrust standing and that his claims were barred by the filed rate doctrine we agree and conclude that,as an indirect purchaser,lacks standing to bring his federal antitrust claims.we further hold that the filed rate doctrine bars state and federal claims even though the allegedly supracompetitive rate was the product of a auction.
background 
in reviewing a motion to dismiss,we accept all factual claims in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.famous horse photo,cir.where necessary,we take judicial notice of the regulatory structure governing the new york city electricity market.
i.the new york city electricity market 
the market for electricity in new york city is overseen by the new york independent system operator nyiso on the wholesale side,the market is based on the producers installed capacity,the amount of electricity that the producer can supply at a given time.retail sellers of electricity must purchase enough installed capacity from producers to meet their expected peak demand plus a share of reserve capacity.the system is designed to ensure that the amount of electricity eventually sold to consumers is consistent with the total production capacity of the producers.
in order to determine the price at which producers can sell their capacity,nyiso has established an auction system that results in a rate mbr.producers submit bids indicating the amount of capacity they can produce and the lowest per unit price at which they are willing to sell.the bids are then stacked from lowest to highest price until the total demand for capacity has been met.the point at which demand is met determines the market price for installed capacity and every producer stacked below that price point can sell its full capacity for the market price.the producer whose bid set the price can sell as much of its capacity as is necessary to meet demand.the rest remains unsold.any producer that bid higher than the market price can not sell its capacity.
the new york city capacity market is highly concentrated.three firms keyspan,nrg energy,nrg,and astoria generating company astoria control a substantial portion of the total generating capacity the total demand for installed capacity can not be met without at least some of the capacity from each of these three firms.accordingly,nyiso has imposed a price cap on these firms bids and barred them from selling electricity outside of the auction process.keyspan bid cap is the highest of the three.
ii.the anticompetitive agreement 
as a result of the prevailing market conditions from june to december,most of keyspan capacity was necessary to satisfy total demand.keyspan therefore routinely bid at its price cap and set the market price at that level.however,because other producers would be bringing new plants online,keyspan anticipated that in,supply would increase,leaving keyspan to either bid below its cap or risk selling only a small amount of its capacity.to avoid these unappealing options,keyspan indirectly entered into an agreement with astoria the agreement.using morgan stanley as an intermediary,keyspan de facto agreed to pay astoria a fixed income in exchange for any potential profits after a certain point from astoria generating capacity 
the agreement consisted of two separate deals the keyspan swap and the astoria hedge.the keyspan swap,executed on january,provided that if the market price after auction were set above per the fixed price,morgan stanley would pay keyspan the difference between the market price and the fixed price multiplied by megawatts mw.if the market price were lower than the fixed price,keyspan would pay the difference times mw to morgan stanley.the astoria hedge,executed on january,provided that if the market price were higher than per,astoria would pay morgan stanley the difference times mw.if the price were below,morgan stanley would pay the difference times mw to astoria.the net effect of the agreement was that astoria was assured of always receiving exactly per for its capacity while keyspan received any profits if the market price were above and subsidized any losses if the market price were below from the sale of astoria capacity.the combination of the keyspan swap and the astoria hedge enabled morgan stanley to receive a fixed rate of fifty cents per kwmonth in exchange for facilitating the deal.
as a result of the agreement,it remained lucrative for keyspan to continue to bid as high as its cap permitted and set the market price at that level.if it then sold only a small amount of its own capacity,it would still receive substantial profits from astoria capacity.since either all of keyspan or all of astoria capacity would be required by the market,keyspan stood to make a substantial profit by setting the price as high as possible,at its cap.in the absence of the agreement,keyspan would likely have had to bid competitively,which might have lowered the market price of capacity.this was borne out by experience keyspan continued to bid at its cap,setting the market price and leaving a significant portion of its capacity unsold.thus the market price of capacity did not drop despite an increase in generating capacity.
iii.investigations of the agreement 
in may,the united states department of justice doj began an investigation into the keyspan agreement based on its anticompetitive effect.in february,it filed a civil complaint alleging that keyspan had unlawfully restrained trade.keyspan entered into a stipulation with the doj to settle the case.pursuant to a consent decree,keyspan paid the united states million and the case was resolved without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law.
ferc also conducted an investigation of the agreement.its enforcement office issued a detailed report concluding that keyspan had not violated ferc regulations prohibiting market manipulation.the report noted that 
market participants in the icap installed capacity market have always known that keyspan,pursuant to the applicable market mitigation rules,was permitted to offer at its cap and set the price.in addition,as noted,keyspan offering behavior was consistent with market rules and the commission announced expectations that dgos,such as keyspan,would in the absence of sufficient capacity additions offer their capacity at their caps.
ferc enforcement staff report,at joint appendix.ferc agreed with the enforcement staff report and noted that it had expected keyspan cap to set the market price.
iv.the complaint 
simon purchased electricity as a retail customer from con ed between and.con ed in turn purchased electricity in the form of installed capacity through the previously described new york city auction process.on july,simon filed this complaint in the district court alleging that the conduct had caused him to be unlawfully overcharged for electricity.he sought to represent a class of customers who had purchased electricity from con ed between and.the complaint claimed violations of federal antitrust law as well as new york law.
on march,the district court dismissed all of simon federal and state claims with prejudice.simon keyspan,d.the district court concluded that simon lacked standing to bring his federal claims because he was an indirect purchaser.id.at.it further found that all of his claims were barred by the filed rate doctrine,which precludes legal challenges to rates set or approved by federal agencies,because the rate he sought to challenge was authorized by ferc.id.at.the district court also held that simon state law claims were preempted and denied leave to amend on the basis of futility.id.at.on may,it denied simon motion for reconsideration.simon keyspan,civ.sas,wl may.it reiterated its holding that simon claims were barred by the filed rate doctrine even though it acknowledged that those rates were set at a auction rather than filed directly with ferc.see generally id.simon appeals.
discussion 
we review a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss under rule b de novo,accepting all factual claims in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.famous horse,at.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.we hold that simon complaint fails to state a plausible antitrust claim both because he lacks federal antitrust standing and because all of his claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine.
antitrust standing 
simon federal claims are barred because he was an indirect purchaser and therefore lacks standing to sue under section of the clayton act,et generally,only direct purchasers have standing to bring civil antitrust claims.see.brick illinois,d hanover shoe,united shoe mach,d.this rule has two rationales.first,defendants may otherwise face multiple liability.brick,at.second,there are too many uncertainties and difficulties in analyzing price and decisions in the real economic world rather than an economist hypothetical model.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at.in other words,it is nearly impossible for a court to determine which portion of an overcharge is actually borne by the direct purchaser and which portion is borne by a subsequent indirect purchaser.the supreme court has therefore established a general rule that the direct purchaser is the only appropriate antitrust plaintiff.
an indirect purchaser may have standing,however,if it had a contract with the direct purchaser,meaning that the indirect purchaser has agreed in advance to purchase a fixed quantity,paying the direct purchaser costs plus a predetermined additional fee.id.at.
in such a situation,the purchaser is insulated from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on the overcharge,because its customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity regardless of price.the effect of the overcharge is essentially determined in advance,without reference to the interaction of supply and demand that complicates the determination in the general case.
id.in this type of situation,there is no difficulty apportioning the overcharge because the indirect purchaser paid the direct purchaser entire cost.there is no chance that the indirect purchaser decreased its demand because it had previously agreed to purchase a fixed quantity.finally,there is no risk of duplicative liability the defendant would have a valid passon defense against the direct purchaser because the latter suffered no injury.see id.at.
the contract exception to the indirect purchaser bar is a narrow one that is only appropriate when the contract has removed all doubts about who bore the antitrust injury.for the exception to apply,the contract quantity must be determined prior to the overcharge to avoid uncertainty about what effect a change in a company price will have on its total sales.hanover shoe,at.a direct purchaser that passes on all of its costs may still suffer an antitrust injury if passing on increased costs decreased its sales and therefore its profits.additionally,there must be no possibility that the direct purchaser would have raised his prices absent the overcharge.id.
simon contends that he qualifies for the contract exception because con ed passed on of its installed capacity costs to its consumers.the complaint alleges 
each month from at least may through february,con ed passed through of con ed costs for the purchase of installed capacity in the nyc capacity market to its customers.its customers,including plaintiff,were contractually required to pay and did pay of such costs as supply charges on their monthly billing statements.the quantity of installed capacity for which plaintiff was required to pay con ed was contractually fixed prior to the time the price for such capacity was known and charged to plaintiff.
further,he argues that r etail distribution utilities like con ed typically are not permitted to make a profit on the sale of electricity or capacity.appellant br.
the supreme court has previously addressed the applicability of the contract exception to regulated utilities and their retail customers.in kansas utilicorp united,d,natural gas wholesalers were sued by several public utilities as well as kansas and missouri,acting as parens patriae for their citizens.the court held that only the utilities,as direct purchasers,were proper plaintiffs.it declined to create an exception to the indirect purchaser rule for situations where regulated public utilities pass on of their costs to consumers.id.at.the court noted that a utility might still suffer an antitrust injury because it might be unable to effect a rate increase that would have otherwise been possible.id.at.moreover,the court viewed the presence of government regulation as a complicating,rather than simplifying,factor.this was so because a reviewing court would have to examine whether the regulator would have allowed a rate increase in the absence of the overcharge in addition to determining whether the utility would have sought an increase.id.at.
the kansas court also rejected the states argument,even without a general exception,they qualified for the exception because the utilities had passed on of their costs to their retail customers.the court noted that 
t he utility customers made no commitment to purchase any particular quantity of gas,and the utility itself had no guarantee of any particular profit.even though the respondent raised its prices to cover its costs,we can not ascertain its precise injury because we do not know what might have happened in the absence of an overcharge.
simon attempts to differentiate this case from kansas are unavailing.we credit the complaint claim that con ed passed on of its installed capacity costs to consumers each month as supply charges,a portion of the overall bill the kansas court central concern,however,remains applicable we can not say with any certainty what would have occurred in the absence of an overcharge.if the price for capacity had been lower,con ed might have requested and received permission to increase its rates.additionally,increased supply charges might have driven down con ed customers electricity usage,diminishing its profits.even though con ed does not make a profit on its retail sale of electrical capacity,it does make a profit on its distribution of electricity.like any business,con ed has overhead costs,and the rates it charges reflect a variety of factors in addition to its supply costs.even if con ed increased its rates by exactly the amount it was overcharged for installed capacity,it does not follow that con ed sales and profits were unaffected.in short,con ed may have suffered an antitrust injury as a result of the agreement,and therefore under hanover shoe and illinois brick,it is the only proper plaintiff.
simon points to the allegation in his complaint that t he quantity of installed capacity for which plaintiff was required to pay con ed was contractually fixed prior to the time the price for such capacity was known and charged to plaintiff.although simon is further attempting to analogize his situation to that of a contract,this argument fails.simon neglects to account for the fact that he was not contractually obligated in advance to purchase a fixed quantity of electricity each month,we reject this contention as implausible.con ed,like all electrical utilities of which we are aware,charges its customers a metered fee based on their actual electricity usage.see simon,d at taking judicial notice of
