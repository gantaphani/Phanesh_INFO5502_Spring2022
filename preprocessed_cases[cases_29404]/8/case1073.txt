background 
the facts underlying this appeal are extensive and,to some extent,disputed.for the purposes of this appeal,we summarize the relevant facts and note the determination of the district court as to disputed issues 
excel is a business with employees nationwide.in august,it began hiring staff for a new facility in taunton,massachusetts.in september,representatives of the united food and commercial workers union,local the union began attempts to unionize the taunton plant.employees keith and tamila fiola became active in the unionization effort.during october,the union gained significant support among excel employees.an initial meeting,attended only by the fiolas,was held on october.ten employees attended a second meeting held on october.fourteen employees attended a third meeting on october.during this period,a number of employees signed union authorization cards the fiolas and another employee,michael paiva,also placed union bumper stickers on their vehicles to indicate their support for unionization.
excel has a stated company policy discouraging union membership and a stated commitment to maintaining a union free environment at its plants.the district court found that after learning of the union initiative,several members of excel management,including plant manager stephen fleming,expressed their displeasure with the unionization effort and threatened to punish any troublemakers.excel,district court order at.the district court also found that employees were told that their k plans would be in jeopardy if the plant were unionized.id.at.
on october,the fiolas asked for the next day off because they planned to attend a wrestling match that evening.fleming refused the request.the fiolas then called in sick that night to warn excel that they would not be at work the next day.when they returned to work on october,the fiolas were fired for the stated reason that they had falsely claimed to be sick another employee,who had missed work for the same reason but had not called in sick,was not discharged,although he later quit.
the same day,excel management requested copies of the employment questionnaires and pinkerton background checks required of all new employees.they determined that paiva had represented on his questionnaire that he had never received workers compensation,when in fact he had received.as a result,excel discharged paiva,ostensibly for violating the policy against falsification.during the next several days,excel reviewed the questionnaires and background checks of other employees and discharged two employees,jan pacheco and ernest watson,for similar falsifications of workers compensation information.the court concluded that it was likely to be proven that the real reason for excel discharges of the fiolas was to punish them for their union activity and to discourage other employees from supporting the union.id.at.the court also found that it was likely to be proven that paiva was discharged not because he lied on his questionnaire,but due to his union sympathies,and that the discharges of pacheco and watson were made for pretextual reasons,that is,to the real reason for firing paiva.
the district court then applied the standard for j interim relief,which requires i that the board show reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the unlawful labor practices alleged and ii that injunctive relief be just and proper.see,asseo centro medico del turabo,cir.the court concluded that the set of facts likely to be proved demonstrated reasonable cause to believe that excel had violated the nlra,that the board position was fairly supported by the evidence.excel,district court order at.specifically,if the facts indicated were ultimately proven,excel would be shown to have violated a and a of the act,a and excel,district court order at.
the district court then evaluated whether the injunction was just and proper.in accordance with this court decision in sullivan,the district court applied the familiar test for granting preliminary relief,including the caveat that when,as in this case,the interim relief sought by the board is essentially the final relief sought,the likelihood of success should be strong.at quoting pan am.grain,at.sullivan,at citing narragansett indian tribe guilbert,cir first,the district court noted that the evidence indicated a strong likelihood of success in ultimately proving the violations.excel,district court order at.second,the court evaluated the potential for irreparable injury in the absence of interim relief.it determined that the discharges of the fiolas and paiva had a substantial,chilling effect on union activity,that the unionization efforts had ground to a halt,and that delays in board adjudication might make reinstatement as a final remedy impossible.id.at.third,the court weighed this harm against that which the injunction would impose on excel,and concluded that any hardship incurred in the displacement of new employees due to reinstatement was outweighed by the restoration of a free and fair process for determining whether employees wanted to unionize.id.at.finally,the court noted that the issuance of an injunction was in the public interest,due to the public interest in ensuring that the purposes of the nlra be furthered.id.at citing pan american grain,at.
the district court enjoined excel from engaging in any further unfair labor practices,reinstated the five discharged employees,and required excel to post copies of the order in the taunton facility.id.at.the district court later denied appellant petition for a stay pending appeal,pye excel case ready,order.may,a decision we affirmed,pye excel case ready,cir.prior to oral argument before this court,an alj heard the case and determined that excel had engaged in unfair labor practices.the alj recommended that excel be ordered to cease and desist such practices and reinstate the five discharged employees.excel,alj opinion at.
on appeal,excel only argues that the board failed to meet its burden of proof on the irreparable harm prong of the preliminary injunction test.
discussion 
the district court determination to grant a j injunction is accorded significant deference we review the court determination of reasonable cause for clear error.sullivan,at.our review of the ultimate decision to grant or deny equitable relief is for abuse of discretion.id.a court abuses its discretion if it applies an improper legal standard or erroneously applies the law to particular facts.id.at.
appellant first argues that the district court abused its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard.according to appellant,the district court erroneously presumed the existence of an irreparable injury based on its determination that the board was substantially likely to succeed on the merits appellant argues that if the court had not relied on this presumption and had used the correct standard,the evidence was insufficient to meet the irreparable harm requirement,in particular because of eleven employee affidavits denying any infringement of rights after the discharge of the five employees.
in support of this argument,appellant cites the following statement made by the court during the j hearing
