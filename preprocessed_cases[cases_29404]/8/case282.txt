facts background 
on january,the furlongs purchased the assets of drew plumbing heating,drew i from andrew donarumo for million,of which was in cash and of which was in the form of a promissory note secured by mortgages on the furlongs real property.with the purchased assets,the furlongs formed drew ii,but the business failed by june.the furlongs claim that drew ii failed because donarumo engaged in fraud with respect to the original sale and competed with drew ii after the sale,including poaching its customers.donarumo contests these allegations.
on december,the furlongs filed chapter bankruptcy petitions for themselves personally and for the corporate bankruptcy of drew ii.john burdick,trustee was appointed to serve as trustee for both cases.in both bankruptcies,the furlongs listed on the schedule b personal property schedule b claims for breach of contract andrew donarumo et,with indeterminate value.on the schedule b for the personal bankruptcy,the furlongs listed drew plumbing heating ii,interest,with unknown value.
at a creditors meeting held pursuant to on january,furlong discussed with the trustee and present creditors the claims against donarumo.though the schedule only listed claims for breach of contract,at the meeting,furlong described related claims stemming from donarumo sale of drew ii that the furlongs intended to bring on their own behalf and on behalf of drew ii,including claims sounding in tort.after the creditors meeting and before the trustee took any action on the claims,donarumo consulted his attorney as to how he should respond to the furlongs claims 
following the creditors meeting,the furlongs exchanged letters and emails with the trustee regarding the claims and also sent him a draft complaint.the complaint laid out claims for breach of contract,but also claims for deceit,misrepresentation,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional interference with advantageous business or contractual relationships,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and for violations under the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.the trustee,using the draft complaint,attempted to retain an attorney to pursue the case on a contingency basis but was unable to do so on terms he found acceptable.
with the statute of limitations on the state claims running,the furlongs asked the trustee to abandon the claims.at the same time,the trustee was seeking to establish that that the furlongs held in a bank account was not exempt from the personal bankruptcy.the furlongs agreed to turn over the to the trustee,while the trustee agreed to abandon all claims against donarumo.
on october,in the corporate bankruptcy,the trustee filed a no asset and no distribution report,and on december,the corporate bankruptcy estate was closed.accordingly,any scheduled assets that had not been administered,including all claims,were abandoned by operation of law under c as of the closing of the corporate bankruptcy estate.
the trustee filed a notice of intention to abandon notice in the personal bankruptcy on november,in which the trustee stated his intent to abandon a cause of action against andrew donarumo,et in the reason for abandonment section,the trustee explained his failure to find an attorney who would prosecute the claims on acceptable terms,and stated that,in his business judgment,pursuing this litigation would not be cost effective for the estate.also in the reason for abandonment section,the trustee characterized the claims as based upon the debtors allegation that certain misrepresentation and other business related tort cause sic of action arose from the purchase of a business known as drew plumbing and heating.ii.no objections to the notice were filed,and the bankruptcy court approved the abandonment on november.
on january,the furlongs and drew ii filed suit against donarumo and others in suffolk superior court in boston,massachusetts,alleging claims similar to those outlined in the draft complaint that the furlongs had shown to the trustee,all of which related to the sale of the assets to drew ii.
prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petitions,drew ii had surrendered its business assets,including both tangible assets and general intangibles and therefore possibly some or all of its claims against donarumo to its secured lender,key bank.key bank then sold the tangible and intangible assets to gem plumbing.on february,gem plumbing assigned back to the furlongs and drew ii whatever rights it held in any claims against donarumo or his business entities.on february,the furlongs,at a meeting of the directors of drew ii at which they were the sole attendees,assigned to themselves these rights.the trustee was not invited to the meeting,of which he was unaware,nor was he asked to approve the assignment.
on december,the trustee filed his final report and account before distribution in the personal bankruptcy,but he subsequently moved to withdraw the report before any hearing could take place,citing donarumo january,offer to purchase from the personal bankruptcy estate both the claims against him and the furlongs stock in drew ii for a total of.the bankruptcy court granted the motion to withdraw,and the furlongs responded on march,by filing the motion to verify.donarumo filed an opposition and,and murray supply,a creditor,joined the,adopting all of donarumo positions.
the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum of decision on september,ruling that the trustee had abandoned all claims in the corporate bankruptcy case by operation of law under c,as well as all claims in the personal bankruptcy case via the notice under a.furlong i,at.however,the bankruptcy court also ruled that the drew ii stock had never been abandoned and remained the property of the personal bankruptcy estate,possibly entitling the personal bankruptcy estate to proceeds from any damages awarded to drew ii id.at.donarumo appealed the first ruling,and the furlongs the second.on april,the district court issued its memorandum and order,affirming the rulings of the bankruptcy court.furlong ii,at.this timely appeal followed,in which donarumo and murray supply again appeal the ruling on the abandonments,and the furlongs again the ruling on the drew ii stock.
ii.discussion 
though none of the parties raised the issue of standing before the district court,the furlongs here argue that neither donarumo nor murray supply has standing to appeal the ruling on the abandonments,while donarumo and murray supply challenge the furlongs standing to the stock issue.where the issue of standing was not raised below,this court must undertake the inquiry without remanding.spenlinhauer,cir.standing to appeal a bankruptcy order is limited to persons aggrieved,that is,persons whose pecuniary interests are adversely affected by the challenged order.id.at.all parties here meet the persons aggrieved standard and therefore have standing to appeal the various parts of the bankruptcy court order 
b.the corporate bankruptcy abandonment 
donarumo and murray supply appeal the lower courts determinations that claims against donarumo held by the corporate bankruptcy estate were effectively abandoned by operation of law under c.on appeal from a district court decision reviewing a bankruptcy court order,we review the bankruptcy court order directly,disturbing its factual findings only if clearly erroneous,while according de novo review to its conclusions of law.spenlinhauer,at.
a ll legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of bankruptcy,including causes of action,become property of the bankruptcy estate.a dimaio family pizza luncheonette,v.the charter oak fire ins,cir.so long as the claims remain in the bankruptcy estate,the trustee steps into the shoes of the debtor for the purposes of asserting or maintaining the debtor causes of action.dimaio,at quoting in re rare coin galleries,cir.
however,like any other property,claims that are disclosed by the debtor to the bankruptcy court may be abandoned by the trustee to the debtor.a debtor has a duty to disclose all assets to the bankruptcy court on a schedule,including legal claims.a graupner town of brookfield,d.if an asset has been formally scheduled under a but has not been administered by the trustee when the estate is closed,the asset is abandoned to the debtor by operation of law.c however,property that is neither administered nor abandoned including property not properly scheduled that was never administered remains property of the estate.d.
in this case,any of drew ii claims that were properly scheduled under a were abandoned by operation of law under c,but those claims that were not properly scheduled remain property of the estate under d.this would be an easy issue to decide if the furlongs had listed every theory of recovery they intended to pursue against donarumo,or had more broadly described their cause of action as claims arising from the sale of drew i,instead of scheduling claims for breach of contract andrew donarumo et.however,those are not the facts we have,and we are left with the task of addressing what level of detail is required for proper scheduling.
while a legal claim that is totally unscheduled may not be abandoned by operation of law under c,jeffrey desmond,cir,a claim requires a more careful inquiry into whether the requirements of a were met.
once an asset is referenced on a schedule,a does not specify the level of detail with which that asset must be described.see furlong i,at quoting kuehn cadle,cv oc,wl,at.march,the statute does not provide any guidance as to the level of specificity required when listing assets on a bankruptcy schedule.alteration omitted see also in re mohring,there are no rules for how much itemization and specificity is required on a bankruptcy schedule,aff,cir,aff,cir.
while a debtor has a duty to prepare schedules carefully,completely,and accurately,generally,an asset is adequately scheduled if its description exhibits reasonable particularization under the circumstances.in re mohring,at see also payne wood,cir it would be silly to require a debtor to itemize every dish and fork.as investigation is part of the trustee duties under,see in re bonner,at cir a,a debtor is required only to do enough itemizing to enable the trustee to determine whether to investigate further,payne,at.
here,the trustee was not only on inquiry notice as to the extent of the asset,he was on actual notice the trustee was able to conduct his investigation into the value of the claims with the help of the draft complaint before determining that it would not be to pursue the claims.
further,the bankruptcy code does not require every component of a cause of action to be spelled out on a debtor schedule.see bonner,at where debtors scheduled auto accident claim,it was common knowledge that a personal injury suit could arise out of the same underlying facts,and the trustee was on notice to investigate,satisfying the requirements of tilley anixter,reasoning that the scheduling of one claim does not amount to the proper scheduling of another if the first claim does not put the trustee on inquiry notice to investigate the second.
here,the furlongs described their claims with reasonable particularity and it is common knowledge that business tort claims and claims under.laws ch.might arise out of the same underlying facts as a claim for breach of contract therefore,the trustee was on inquiry notice to investigate the extent of the asset.moreover,the trustee,having actual knowledge of the contents of the draft complaint,was able to complete his investigation into the value of the claims before making the decision to abandon the claims from the estate.therefore,all of drew ii claims against donarumo were properly scheduled under a and were abandoned by operation of law under c when the corporate bankruptcy case was closed.
c.the personal bankruptcy abandonment 
donarumo and murray supply challenge the lower courts determinations that the state court claims held by the personal bankruptcy estate that were not specifically named in the notice of intention to abandon were in fact abandoned under a.we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.spenlinhauer,at.
section a provides that a fter notice and a hearing,the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.a.however,a hearing is unnecessary if no party in interest requests one.id.in this case,the trustee filed a notice of intention to abandon in the personal bankruptcy case on november.no parties in interest objected or requested a hearing,and the bankruptcy court approved the notice on november.
donarumo and murray supply argue that only the claims specifically named in the reasons for abandonment section of the notice were abandoned under a.it is true that a trustee intent to abandon an asset must be clear and unequivocal.chartschlaa nationwide mut.ins.cir see also in re the sire plan,a ny clear manifestation of the trustee intent to abandon property will suffice.emphasis in original.but here,the notice stated the trustee clear intent to abandon a cause of action against andrew donarumo et while the trustee description of the contours of the cause of action in the reasons for abandonment section could have been crisper,his intent to abandon all the claims held by the personal bankruptcy estate was obvious despite only referring specifically to misrepresentation and other business related tort s in his reasons for abandonment,the trustee made clear that the cause of action involved multiple theories of recovery ar ising from the purchase of a business known as drew plumbing and heating.ii.as the bankruptcy court ably recited 
a s painful as the notice is to read,its meaning is unambiguous the estate holds claims against donarumo and perhaps others,arising from the purchase of a business that came to be known as drew plumbing and the trustee notices parties in interest of his intention to abandon those claims,based on his determination,made after investigation,that the claims have no or negligible value to the estate.
furlong i,at emphasis in original the lower courts were correct in finding that the trustee intent to abandon all state court claims under a was clear and unequivocal,and that all of the claims were therefore abandoned when the bankruptcy court approved the notice.
d.the automatic stay 
donarumo and murray supply challenge the holding below that the transfer of drew ii claims to the furlongs personally was not a violation of the automatic stay.again,we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.spenlinhauer,at.
to review,before drew ii filed for bankruptcy,it surrendered to its secured lender,key bank,its tangible and intangible assets.key bank then sold those assets to gem plumbing.because of the possibility that drew ii general intangibles included the claims against donarumo,gem plumbing assigned any rights in the claims back to the furlongs and drew ii.the furlongs,acting as directors at a meeting of the board of drew ii at which they were the only attendees,assigned drew ii interest in these claims back to themselves personally.
donarumo and murray supp
