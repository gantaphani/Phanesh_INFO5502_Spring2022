the parties in this action are involved in an inheritance dispute pertaining to the assets of the now deceased raymond loubier,as conveyed to various revocable and irrevocable trusts in his name and that of his wife noella loubier.two of the loubiers irrevocable trusts,as well as a contingent trust beneficiary,gervais loubier,invoke diversity jurisdiction to sue noella loubier and two of the loubiers revocable trusts for alleged breach of fiduciary duty.plaintiffs here appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut warren eginton,judge on march,dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in light of plaintiffs failure to demonstrate complete diversity.see.the district court diversity determination was based on its understanding that noella loubier,a florida citizen,is on both sides of the case caption because not only is she an individually named defendant and the trustee of the defendant revocable trusts,but also she was purportedly the trustee of the plaintiff raymond loubier irrevocable trust.
we need not here decide whether the presence of the same person,in two different capacities,on both sides of a case caption,defeats diversity because the challenged judgment here rests on a misapprehension as to the particular irrevocable trusts named as plaintiffs.plaintiffs bear some responsibility for confusion on this and other issues.nevertheless,it is useful at the outset to clarify the identity of the party trusts.
the irrevocable trust agreements attached to the complaint are dated february,and name roland loubier as their sole trustee irrevocable trust agreements.in an affidavit filed in support of dismissal,noella loubier stated that these irrevocable trust agreements were supplanted by the raymond loubier irrevocable trust agreement dated january,and the noella loubier irrevocable trust agreement dated august,for both of which she is named trustee.in opposing dismissal,plaintiffs asserted that the loubiers,and irrevocable trust agreements are distinct and that the intended party plaintiffs here are,indeed,the couple irrevocable trusts.for purposes of this appeal,defendants accept plaintiffs characterization of the irrevocable trust agreements as the intended and proper party plaintiffs,appellees br,and agree that the trustee of both these trusts is roland loubier,who appears to be a citizen of canada 
with the identity of the plaintiff trusts thus clarified,plaintiffs argue that they have established complete diversity because plaintiff gervais loubier is a citizen of connecticut the plaintiff trusts take the canadian citizenship of their trustee,roland loubier defendant noella loubier is a citizen of florida and the defendant revocable trusts of which she is the trustee take her florida citizenship.defendants disagree.they argue that the party trusts citizenship is properly identified not only by their trustees but also by their beneficiaries,which here results in florida and connecticut citizens being on both sides of the case caption,as noella loubier and gervais loubier are direct or contingent beneficiaries of all four party trusts.
we consider the question of trust citizenship in light of the supreme court recent decision in americold realty trust conagra foods,holding that,for diversity purposes,real estate investment trust reit organized under maryland law for benefit of its shareholders takes its citizenship from all those shareholders.while americold does not speak directly to the circumstances of this case,it does distinguish traditional trusts establishing only fiduciary relationships and having no legal identity distinct from their trustees,from the variety of unincorporated artificial entities to which states have applied the trust label,but which have little in common with traditional trusts.see id.at.the reit at issue in americold was one of the latter entities.by contrast,the party trusts here derive from trust agreements establishing only traditional fiduciary relationships.further,the trusts here at issue are not distinct legal entities under the relevant florida state law.we conclude that legal proceedings involving such traditional trusts are effectively brought by or against their trustees and,thus,it is the trustees citizenship,not that of beneficiaries,that matters for purposes of diversity.
applying this legal conclusion to the record on appeal,we can not confidently resolve the question of diversity because the citizenship of roland loubier,trustee of both plaintiff trusts,is not clearly established.in an affidavit filed in the district court,roland loubier provides his canadian address,but nowhere states that he is,in fact,a citizen of canada,much less that,in his capacity as trustee,he wishes to pursue this action.the omission is significant because if roland loubier were a united states citizen domiciled abroad,diversity would be defeated.see herrick scs commc ns,cir.united states citizens domiciled abroad are neither citizens of any state of the united states nor citizens or subjects of a foreign state,so that a does not provide that the courts have diversity jurisdiction over a suit to which such persons are parties.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the case must be remanded for plaintiffs to furnish proper allegations,either in an amended complaint or by affidavit,as to the citizenship of roland loubier,the sole trustee of the irrevocable trusts.
accordingly,we vacate the judgment of dismissal because it rests on a misapprehension as to the identity of the plaintiff irrevocable trusts,and we remand this case to the district court for it to reconsider subject matter jurisdiction in light of this opinion.
background 
a.the plaintiff irrevocable trust agreements 
on february,florida citizens raymond and noella loubier respectively signed the plaintiff irrevocable trust agreements bearing their names.both agreements identify raymond loubier brother roland loubier as sole trustee.
in their initial complaint,plaintiffs alleged that the purpose of the irrevocable trust agreements was to compensate raymond loubier brothers,roland,paul,reginald,laurient,martin,and gervais for their material and essential contribution to the successful family lumber and construction business built in florida.compl.the irrevocable trust agreements do provide for raymond and noella loubier,during their lifetimes,to make gifts,but set forth no obligation to do so and identify no intended donees.
attorney memoranda dated march,and sent respectively to raymond and noella loubier,and to trustee roland loubier,memorialize a further purpose of the irrevocable trust agreements the transfer of raymond and noella loubier insurance policies to the trustee so that,upon their deaths,proceeds can be paid to beneficiaries with minimal tax consequences.
each of the loubiers irrevocable trust agreements names the other spouse as primary beneficiary,with the trustee directed to make payments to that spouse according to the terms of separate trusts a family trust and a marital trust.only upon the death of both spouses,does each irrevocable trust agreement instruct the trustee to make distributions of any remaining property entrusted to him under that agreement to some persons if then living in stated percentages.plaintiff gervais loubier is named as one of these contingent beneficiaries,but his death after the filing of this appeal and while noella loubier remains alive may have ended that status 
b.the defendant revocable trust agreements 
on december,some two months before entering into the aforementioned irrevocable trust agreements,raymond and noella loubier each signed revocable trust agreements naming him or herself as both grantor and trustee of the agreement bearing his or her name,and naming his or her surviving spouse as successor trustee in the event of the grantor death or inability to serve revocable trust agreements in the event the spouse can not serve as successor trustee,each grantor appoints roland loubier and first union national bank to serve jointly as successor.at present,noella loubier serves as trustee of both revocable trust agreements.
while the record contains no contemporaneous legal memoranda as to the purpose of these revocable trust agreements,their terms suggest the loubiers intent to convey a significant amount of their assets to themselves in trust.thus,each revocable trust agreement instructs the trustee to distribute to the respective grantor the net income from property transferred to the trustee under the agreement to preserve the grantor right to use real property placed in the trust as his or her permanent residence to use transferred assets for the grantor benefit in the event of his or her hospitalization,disability,need for assisted living,or incapacity and to collect assets of the grantor upon,and to pay expenses associated with,the grantor death.each revocable trust agreement also instructs the trustee to use separate trust entities,specifically,a credit shelter trust and a marital trust,to make distributions to a surviving spouse so as to minimize tax obligations.only upon the death of both spouses does each revocable trust agreement instruct the successor trustee to make distributions to the same persons and in the same percentages as identified in the subsequent irrevocable trust agreements.thus,until his own death,gervais loubier was a contingent beneficiary of the defendant as well as the plaintiff trusts.
c.the instant action 
on august,this action was filed in the name of gervais loubier and the plaintiff trusts against noella loubier and the defendant trusts for which she serves as trustee.the original complaint alleges that noella loubier provided gervais loubier a purported accounting of the defendant raymond loubier revocable trust that reported total assets of million,which on information and belief is some million dollars less than it should be.compl.the complaint further alleged that noella loubier has amassed and retained for herself all the assets of said plaintiff trusts to the detriment of the plaintiffs.id.compl.
plaintiffs do not repeat these allegations in their amended complaint.there,they allege simply that,as trustee of the defendant trusts,noella loubier owes the plaintiff presumably gervais loubier a fiduciary duty to account that gervais loubier has demanded an accounting,which noella loubier has refused and that moneys may be due gervais loubier,the plaintiff trusts,and the beneficiaries of those trusts,the amount of which can not be determined without an accounting.see id.at 
thus,plaintiffs sought to compel an accounting of the defendant revocable trusts,payment to plaintiffs and trust beneficiaries of amounts that the accounting showed were due to them,and appointment of the trustee of the plaintiff trusts as receiver for assets of the defendant trusts held by noella loubier.see id.at 
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint under fed.civ.b,b,for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted dismissal on the latter ground,assuming,as already noted,that the and irrevocable trust agreements supplied or referenced by defendants,which name noella loubier as trustee,were the operative plaintiff trusts,and concluding therefrom that a t least one of the plaintiff trusts shares florida citizenship with defendants,thereby defeating complete diversity.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under fed.civ.b,we review a district court factual findings for clear error,see cortlandt recovery hellas,cir,and its legal conclusions de novo,see haber united states,cir.in so doing,we accept the complaint material allegations as true,and we draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.see mantena johnson,cir.we may also consider all extrinsic evidence proffered by the parties to the district court in support of their jurisdictional positions.see carter healthport,llc,cir.
to establish subject matter jurisdiction under,as implicated here,plaintiffs bear the burden of making a preponderance showing,inter alia,of complete diversity,all plaintiffs must be citizens of states diverse from those of all defendants.pennsylvania pub.sch.emps.ret.morgan stanley,cir.quoting exxon mobil allapattah.there is no question that the named individual parties are of diverse citizenship.when the complaint was filed,plaintiff gervais loubier was a citizen of connecticut and defendant noella loubier was a citizen of florida.thus,whether plaintiffs have demonstrated complete diversity depends on the citizenship of the party trusts.
b.the identity of the plaintiff trusts 
as earlier observed,the parties agree that the district court diversity ruling rests on a clear error of fact because the operative plaintiff trusts are those reflected in raymond and noella loubier irrevocable trust agreements,not their or agreements.in reviewing the challenged dismissal on this appeal,therefore,we look to the irrevocable trust agreements and to their trustee,roland loubier,in deciding whether plaintiffs have established diversity jurisdiction.
trust citizenship 
supreme court precedent 
despite over two centuries of federal litigation involving trusts,the method for determining a trust citizenship is long unsettled and the subject of much debate.zoroastrian ctr.of metro.washington,rustam guiv found.of,cir.while this court has not conclusively decided how trust citizenship should be determined for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,three supreme court decisions are relevant to our task here navarro savings association lee,carden arkoma associates,and americold realty trust conagra foods.
in navarro,plaintiffs were trustees of a business trust organized under massachusetts law.see navarro sav.ass lee,at.the trust declaration authorized the trustees to hold title to real estate investments for the benefit of trust shareholders.see id.it further gave the trustees exclusive authority over this property,as well as over decisions to invest or to lend trust funds.see id.it specifically authorized the trustees to sue and to be sued either in the name of the trust or in their own names as trustees.see id.in their own names,the trustees sued navarro savings association for breach of a loan agreement that the trustees had entered into for the benefit of the trust.see id.the question before the supreme court was whether the trustees of a business trust may invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts on the basis of their own citizenship which differed from that of the texas defendant rather than that of the trust beneficial shareholders a number of whom were texas citizens.id.at.
the supreme court concluded that the citizenship of the named plaintiff trustees,and not that of the trust shareholders,controlled the diversity assessment in navarro.see id.at.in so ruling,the supreme court reasoned that the plaintiff trustees were the real parties in interest to the controversy based on their possession of certain customary powers to hold,manage,and dispose of assets,for the benefit of others.id.at 
plaintiffs here argue that the trustees of the party trusts exercise comparable powers and,thus,even though plaintiffs sued in the names of the trusts rather than the trustees,it is the trustees citizenship that should determine whether there is diversity jurisdiction.
ten years after navarro,in another diversity case,the supreme court considered how to determine the citizenship of a different artificial entity created by state law a limited partnership.see carden arkoma,at.a majority specifically declined to extend to limited partnerships the rule treating corporations as citizens of their states of incorporation.see id.at.it further declined to determine a limited partnership citizenship by looking only to general,not limited,partners on the ground that only the former exercised control over the business and its related litigation.see id.at.rather,the court adhered to the rule that diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the artificial entity depends on the citizenship of all the members.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
insofar as arkoma associates relied on navarro to urge otherwise,the court was dismissive,observing that navarro had nothing to do with the citizenship of the trust at issue.id.at.rather,it was a suit by the trustees in their own names,id.at,and thus presented the quite separate question of whether these trustees,who were undoubted citizens,natural persons were the real parties to the controversy,id.at.
defendants rely on carden to argue that,for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,the citizenship of any unincorporated entity that sues or is sued in its own name necessarily takes on the citizenship of all its members,which,in the case of trusts,is the citizenship of all named beneficiaries,both vested and contingent.
courts applying navarro and carden to the question of a trust citizenship for diversity purposes have reached different conclusions.the seventh circuit,as well as the fifth,ruled that t rusts take the citizenship of the trustees rather than of the beneficiaries.indiana gas home ins,cir.see also mullins testamerica,cir.stating that district court had applied correct tests to determine citizenship of various entities,citing navarro for principle that citizenship of a trust is that of its trustee.by contrast,the third circuit,after considering navarro and carden,ruled that the citizenship of both the trustee and the beneficiary should control in determining the citizenship of a trust.emerald inv rs tr.gaunt parsippany partners,cir.
most recently,the supreme court itself discussed carden and navarro in considering,for diversity purposes,how to determine the citizenship of a real estate investment trust,an inanimate creature of maryland law.americold realty tr.conagra foods,at.in a unanimous decision,the court concluded that one looked to the citizenship of the reit shareholders,as they were the members of that particular legal entity.see id.at.
the reasoning informing this conclusion warrants attention.in americold,the supreme court observed that it had originally recognized only human beings to be citizens for jurisdictional purposes.see id.at.thus,if a mere legal entity were sued,the relevant citizens for purposes of diversity were its members,or the real persons who come into court in the entity name.id.quoting bank of united states deveaux,cranch.the court later carved a limited exception for corporations,which congress codified to allow corporations to be considered citizens of their states of incorporation or principal places of business.see c.neither congress nor the court,however,had ever expanded this grant of citizenship to include other artificial entities,such as companies or limited partnerships.americold realty tr.conagra foods,at.for such entities,the court had adhered to its rule that diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the entity depends on the citizenship of all its members.id.quoting carden arkoma,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court acknowledged that it had never expressly defined the term members,but observed that it had equated a legal entity members with its owners or the several persons composing such association.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the court had identified,with reference to state law,the members of a company as its shareholders,the members of a partnership as its partners,and the members of a union as the workers affiliated with it.id.
applying these principles to the reit at issue in americold,the court concluded that,as an unincorporated entity organized under maryland law,the reit possessed the citizenship of its members.see id.at.maryland law effectively defined those members as the reit shareholders.see id.citing.assns.code ann.c,stating that reit is unincorporated business trust or association in which property is held and managed for the benefit and profit of any person who may become a shareholder.indeed,other provisions of maryland law appeared to place reit shareholders in the same position as the shareholders of a company or the partners of a limited partnership.id.
rejecting an argument that navarro savings association lee,at,compelled the conclusion that anything called a trust possesses the citizenship of its trustees alone,the supreme court reiterated carden pronouncement that navarro had nothing to do with the citizenship of a trust.americold realty tr.conagra foods,at alteration in original quoting carden arkoma,at.rather,navarro reaffirmed a separate rule that when a trustee files a lawsuit in her name,her jurisdictional citizenship is the state to which she belongs as is true of any natural person.id.emphasis in original.
at the same time,however,the court acknowledged that not all trusts were akin to the reit before it.traditionally,a trust was not considered a distinct legal entity,but a fiduciary relationship between multiple people.id such a relationship was not a thing that could be haled into court rather,legal proceedings involving a trust were brought by or against the trustees in their own name.id.thus,the court stated,f or a traditional trust,there is no need to determine its membership,as would be true if the trust,as an entity,were sued.id.
as our sister circuits have observed,the last quoted statement in americold may generate as many questions as it answers.zoroastrian ctr.rustam guiv,at see wang by through wong new mighty,cir.does it mean that there is never a need to determine the membership of a traditional trust because its citizenship is always that of its trustee or,does it mean that every time a trust is sued in its own name,its citizenship is the citizenship of all its members who are the members of a traditional trust that,as here,identifies both vested and contingent beneficiaries see zoroastrian ctr.rustam guiv,at posing similar questions.
while the supreme court did not speak directly to these matters in americold,it followed its discussion of traditional trusts with the observation that state laws now apply the trust label to a variety of unincorporated entities such as the reit there at issue that have little in common with traditional trusts.americold realty tr.conagra foods,at.where state law applies a trust label to a separate legal entity that itself can sue or be sued,that trust is subject to the rule that it possesses the citizenship of all of its members.id.internal quotation mark omitted.
from this reasoning,we conclude that the rule reiterated by the supreme court in americold and carden ascribing to an unincorporated entity the citizenship of all its members may apply to any number of trusts recognized in law as distinct juridical entities.but it does not apply to a traditional trust that establishes only a fiduciary relationship and that can not sue or be sued in its own right.the distinction is evident in decisions from other circuits.see wang by through wong new mighty,at cir.w e believe americold would not apply the carden test to a traditional trust,as it is not an entity with juridical status.rtp llc orix real estate capital,cir.concluding that retirement funds organized as trusts under state law but allowed to sue and to be sued in their own names have citizenships of their members.a number of district courts,including some within this circuit,have similarly read americold to support the conclusion that a traditional trust citizenship remains that of its trustee 
neither side here disputes that the party trusts both those named as plaintiffs and those named as defendants are traditional common law trusts,which created fiduciary relationships for purposes of estate planning.see appellants supp.br.appellees supp.br.the terms of these trusts reinforce this conclusion.unlike the business trusts in navarro,the party trusts nowhere authorize suits in the name of either the trust or the trustees.see navarro sav.ass lee,at.nor do the party trusts here pertain to shareholders who hold ownership interests in trust property and who have votes in the trust by virtue of their shares of beneficial interest,americold realty tr.conagra foods,at internal quotation marks omitted.the party trusts here have vested and contingent beneficiaries with no present ownership interest in trust property and no power over the trusts administration,disbursements,or investments.navarro sav.ass lee,at,blackmun,dissenting noting that shareho
