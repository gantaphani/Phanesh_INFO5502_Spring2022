plaintiffs,black and hispanic registered voters in albany county,sue the county and the county board of elections collectively defendants in the united states district court for the northern district of new york lawrence kahn,judge for enacting a redistricting plan for the albany county legislature local law c in response to the united states census that allegedly dilutes black and hispanic voting strength in violation of section of the voting rights act vra,by failing to provide for five districts mmds.plaintiffs here appeal from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction barring defendants from implementing local law c with respect to elections held in september and november of.see pope cnty.of albany,cv lek drh,wl.for the reasons stated herein,we conclude that the appeal is not moot,even though the challenged elections have taken place.nevertheless,it is without merit because the district court acted within its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs failed,on the record presented in support of their preliminary injunction motion,to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the third factor of a vote dilution claim identified in thornburg gingles,d,bloc voting by the white majority sufficient to defeat minority voters preferred candidate.at the same time,we identify a concern with the district court apparent demand for more than a simple majority of minority group members of voting age within the proposed districts to satisfy the first gingles factor.because the district court will have to apply the gingles analysis at trial in ultimately resolving this case,we clarify the law applicable to the first factor at the same time that we affirm the district court denial of preliminary relief.
factual background 
redistricting of the albany county legislature 
the albany county legislature consists of representatives elected every four years from districts.see albany county charter.after each decennial national census,the county legislature appoints a reapportionment commission charged with revising district lines to account for shifts in population.see id.
the county past redistricting efforts have routinely triggered litigation.a challenge to the redistricting plan adopted after the census,which provided for only one district in which blacks would constitute a majority of the voting age population vap,resulted in the county entering into a consent judgment that prevented implementation of the plan and provided for the establishment of three mmds in each of which blacks and hispanics together constituted at least of the vap.see consent decree,naacp albany,cv cgc,ecf.when,following the census,the county enacted a redistricting plan that maintained three mmds,the district court enjoined implementation,concluding that section required the county to create a fourth mmd.see arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,d see also arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,d,stating that county plan flagrantly violated the rights of minority voters.to the extent the district court there did not think that it could order special elections based on the revised plan containing four mmds,this court reversed and itself ordered such elections.see arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,cir.
after the census,the county enacted the redistricting plan challenged in this lawsuit,which maintains four mmds.in doing so,the county followed the recommendation of its redistricting commission,which had retained a redistricting expert,john merrill,to prepare a plan based on the new census information.the commission held public hearings,at which minority groups urged the creation of a fifth mmd.one such group,the arbor hill environmental justice corporation,submitted a proposed redistricting plan to that effect ahej plan.
merrill advised the commission that,although he attempted to create a fifth mmd,the task was impossible because of the dispersion of the minority population,which he treated as including both blacks and hispanics.see infra at,discussing issues presented by choice of minority group.merrill deemed the ahej plan unsatisfactory because,in his view,it violated a number of redistricting principles and constituted racial gerrymandering accordingly,on may,the commission adopted a final redistricting plan proposed by merrill that retained four mmds.the legislature adopted the plan as local law c on may.
motion for preliminary injunction 
plaintiffs filed this section challenge to local law c on june,and on july,they moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent defendants from conducting the petition process,gathering signatures for elections,holding and conducting any further primary or general elections,or implementing or certifying elections in the districts under the current scheme implemented in or those created by local law c for any term of office commencing january.notice of mot.at,pope cnty.of albany,cv,ecf.plaintiffs maintained that they were likely to succeed on their claim of minority vote dilution whether the relevant minority population aggregated blacks and hispanics or was limited to blacks alone.after evidentiary hearings and written submissions,the district court denied a preliminary injunction on august.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal and sought an expedited briefing schedule,which was granted,with oral argument heard on december.
in the interim,primary and general elections for the county legislature on the basis of local law c were held on september,and november,respectively.on november,defendants moved to dismiss the appeal as moot.on november,plaintiffs moved in this court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal to prevent defendants from conducting elections or related processes,or qualifying certifying individuals elected in the november,elections for albany county legislature to take office.appellant mot.for prelim.inj.pending appeal at,pope cnty.of albany,cv cir,ecf.on december,this court summarily denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.
ii.discussion 
because the question implicates our jurisdiction,we first address defendants motion to dismiss the appeal as moot in light of the fact that the very elections that plaintiffs sought preliminarily to enjoin have now been conducted.the occurrence of the action sought to be enjoined normally moots the request for preliminary injunctive relief because this court has no effective relief to offer once the action has occurred.moore consol.edison of,cir sotomayor,internal quotation marks omitted.this principle does not apply,however,when we do not lack the ability to offer effective relief because we can feasibly restore the status quo.id.at emphasis in original.this conclusion is a natural,if not inevitable,extension of the well established principle that where a defendant with notice in an injunction proceeding completes the acts sought to be enjoined the court may by mandatory injunction restore the status quo.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,defendants unquestionably had notice that plaintiffs were seeking to enjoin the elections.indeed,the parties were engaged in an appeal from the denial of such relief when defendants proceeded with the elections.see id.rejecting mootness challenge where district court denied preliminary injunction that sought to prevent plaintiff termination and plaintiff was then terminated before appeal was heard.we do not fault defendants actions in this respect no court order barred them from proceeding with the elections.we note only that defendants were on notice that plaintiffs were still pursuing preliminary injunctive relief.thus,we will not dismiss the case as moot if we are satisfied that,should plaintiffs succeed on this appeal,it would be possible to restore the status quo.
in considering that question,we are mindful of precedent recognizing that i t is within the scope of a federal court equity powers to order a governmental body to hold special elections to redress violations of the vra.arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,at.implicit in the power to order special elections is the authority to void elections conducted in violation of the vra.it was not necessary to authorize such relief in arbor hill because the district court had enjoined elections under the challenged plan before we ordered special elections.see id.nevertheless,arbor hill cites a case from a sister circuit holding that the equity power to order special elections applies even when the original election has already taken place.see bell southwell,cir holding that district court has power to void and order new elections for violations of vra and constitution.other courts have similarly ruled.see stewart taylor,cir stating that,despite holding of challenged election,court could order new election if plaintiff motion for preliminary injunction has merit hamer campbell,cir h aving concluded that the election should have been enjoined,we now must set it aside in order to grant appellants full relief in the same manner as if the said election had been enjoined.internal quotation marks omitted.we agree with these cases,and thus conclude that this appeal is not moot because,if plaintiffs were to succeed on the merits,it would be possible for the court to restore the status quo by vacating the election 
courts may understandably hesitate to void elections that have already been conducted as a form of preliminary equitable relief,preferring to take such action only upon a final determination that plaintiffs are entitled to permanent relief.that,however,is an argument for consolidating preliminary injunction proceedings with a trial on the merits where possible,see.a,or for denying a preliminary injunction as a matter of equitable discretion,see winter natural res.def.council,d.it does not render the preliminary injunction motion,or the appeal from a denial of such a motion,moot.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d recognizing distinction between court power to order effective relief and court discretion to do so.accordingly,we deny defendants motion to dismiss the appeal as moot,and we proceed to discuss the merits.
b.the preliminary injunction motion 
standard of review 
where,as here,a party seeks a preliminary injunction against government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory scheme,a moving party must demonstrate that he is likely to succeed on the merits of the underlying claim,he will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief,and the public interest weighs in favor of granting the injunction.see oneida nation of cuomo,cir we review the denial of a preliminary injunction motion deferentially for abuse of discretion,which we will identify only when the district court decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.see id.on this appeal,we focus on the district court determination that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of their section claim,a matter that implicates both questions of law and fact.
analyzing section claims by reference to the gingles factors 
section of the voting rights act,as amended,states in relevant part as follows 
a no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,practice,or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color 
b a violation of subsection a of this section is established if,based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the state or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered provided,that nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.
see also id.f extending protection to language minority groups.
the supreme court has recognized that a redistricting scheme may violate section by impermissibly diluting the minority vote.see thornburg gingles.gingles instructs that a viable section claim of vote dilution depends on plaintiffs preliminary showing of three factors that the relevant minority is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district,that the relevant minority is politically cohesive,and that the majority votes sufficiently in a bloc to enable it in the absence of special circumstances usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.id.at.although the court in gingles applied these factors to a challenged districting plan,it has since applied the same factors to claims of vote dilution under districting plans,such as the one at issue in this case.see league of united latin am.citizens lulac perry,d.
if a plaintiff satisfies the three preliminary gingles factors,he must then satisfy the ultimate section inquiry by showing from the totality of the circumstances,that members of the identified racial group have less opportunity than do other members of the electorate to elect a candidate of their choice.id.at.
the district court determination that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate likely success in establishing the gingles factors 
in denying a preliminary injunction of the application of local law c,the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate likely success on all three preliminary gingles factors.insofar as plaintiffs had attempted to carry their burden by defining the relevant minority community to include blacks and hispanics,the district court found the record evidence insufficient to establish the political cohesiveness of these two groups,the second gingles factor analyzing plaintiffs motion by reference to a minority group community denominated by the department of justice doj as non hispanic black,the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to show that group to be a sufficiently large percentage of the vap in five mmds to satisfy the first gingles factor in reaching this conclusion,the district court acknowledged that the proposed redistricting plans showed a doj non hispanic black vap exceeding in more than five mmds nevertheless,it concluded that more than the bare majority reflected in some of these mmds was necessary to satisfy the first gingles factor.finally,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of bloc voting by the white majority population in albany county to satisfy the third gingles factor.
we identify legal error in the district court demand for plaintiffs to show more than a simple majority of the relevant minority group at the first step of gingles analysis.at the same time,we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in denying plaintiffs a preliminary injunction based on their failure to establish majority bloc voting.
a.the first gingles factor 
before the district court,defendants did not dispute the minority vap percentages shown in the five mmds proposed in the ahej plan and plaintiffs illustrative plan.rather,defendants argued that the bare majority doj non hispanic black vaps reflected in the two plans failed to satisfy the sufficiently large requirement of the first gingles factor.in support,they relied on the testimony of plaintiffs expert,baodong liu,a professor of political science at the university of utah,who testified that in the academic world,a dominant black district is defined as one in which blacks constitute at least of the vap.liu,hr g tr.at.a defendants also pointed to the briefs of plaintiffs in the arbor hill litigation challenging albany county redistricting following the census,which questioned a remedial plan creating bare districts in light of factors,such as lower voter turnout and registration rates in the minority communities at issue,which would render it impossible for minorities to elect candidates of their choice.see pls.objections to report recommendation re remedial redistricting plan at,arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass cnty.of albany,cv nam drh,ecf.
the district court agreed that a barebones percent doj non hispanic black vap,as indicated for proposed mmd under the ahej plan,was insufficient to satisfy the first gingles factor,particularly where plaintiff s own expert testified that a percent minority population is required for a district to be considered dominant.pope cnty.of albany,wl,at.while the district court acknowledged that the plurality opinion in bartlett strickland,d,signaled that a bare majority could satisfy the first gingles factor,see id.at,the district court concluded that the opinion was and,in any event,irrelevant,as it pertained to crossover districts,which were not at issue in this case,pope cnty.of albany,wl,at.we disagree and here clarify that no is necessary for plaintiffs to satisfy the first gingles factor.
in so ruling,we note that the first gingles factor is only the initial step in a larger inquiry that ultimately asks whether the totality of the circumstances evidences an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by minority voters that prevents them from elect ing their preferred candidates,thornburg gingles,at,and,if so,how to devis e a sound remedy for that inequality,johnson de grandy,d.the relative size of a minority group majority in a district may well be among the totality of circumstances that can inform the ultimate determination of vote dilution and the appropriate remedy.but it is simply the fact,not the size,of a minority group majority presence in a proposed district that permits a plaintiff to satisfy the first of gingles preliminary requirements.
the first gingles factor asks only whether the relevant minority group is sufficiently large to constitute a majority of the vap.id.at.a majority is commonly understood as anything exceeding.see webster third new international dictionary defining majority as a number greater than half of a total.as the supreme court has explained,this initial inquiry serves a useful role by identifying,in broad terms,when a minority group has at least the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice.thornburg gingles,at.emphasis in original.without such a potential,the minority group can not claim to have been injured by that structure or practice.id.thus,a simple majority rule usefully serves at the outset to screen out cases in which there is no point in undertaking a full section analysis.toward that end,it asks a preliminary question it does not attempt to answer the ultimate one.
defendants nevertheless maintain that the district court permissibly demanded a showing to satisfy the first gingles factor because a minority group that constitutes only a simple majority of the vap may not realistically have the potential to elect representatives of its choice,particularly where minority voter registration rates and turnout are low.such concerns may well warrant careful consideration when a court reviews the totality of the circumstances in deciding the ultimate gingles inquiry.see id.at.holding that list of typical factors relevant to assessing totality of circumstances is not comprehensive and that such inquiry requires searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality internal quotation marks omitted accord naacp city of niagara falls,cir see also johnson de grandy,at.stating that district court should analyze totality of circumstances without isolating any arguably relevant facts from the act of judgment.the concerns may also inform the appropriate remedy for a section violation.see dickinson.state election,cir observing that determination that is not necessary at liability stage is distinct from court ability to consider,at the remedial stage,what type of remedy is possible based on minority voter registration and rates emphasis in original accord bone shirt hazeltine,cir see also ketchum byrne,cir identifying error in district court failure at remedial stage to provide for in light of minority group lower registration and turnout rates the first gingles factor,however,does not contemplate such a holistic review of the total evidence.the ultimate end of the first gingles factor is simply to prove that a solution is possible,and not necessarily to present the final solution to the problem.bone shirt hazeltine,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the first gingles question is straightforward and statistical does the identified minority group form at least a simple majority of the relevant population in the proposed district 
in urging us to conclude otherwise,defendants emphasize that the supreme court has described the first gingles factor as requiring a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.johnson de grandy,at.emphasis added accord lulac perry,at.we are not persuaded that the highlighted language transforms the first gingles factor as defendants urge.we understand supreme court references to a sufficiently large minority to be reiterating,not departing from,gingles observation that a minority group is sufficiently large when it constitute s a majority.thornburg gingles,at.we do not understand these cases,or any other precedent,to require plaintiffs to show a to satisfy the first gingles factor.indeed,the reasoning of the plurality opinion in bartlett strickland,d,even if not controlling,persuades us that it would be inappropriate to recognize such a requirement here.
in bartlett,the supreme court considered whether section required the creation of a district in which the identified minority group,though not a majority,was sufficiently large that,when coupled with reliable white crossover votes,it would be capable of electing the representatives of its choice.the plurality opinion authored by justice kennedy,who also wrote those parts of the lulac decision commanding a majority espoused a rule that required the minority to show that it was at least of the vap in the proposed district.in explaining its reasoning,the plurality provides one of the fullest discussions of the purpose of the first gingles factor and,in the process,indicates that the factor demands no more than a simple majority to proceed with further section analysis 
t he rule relies on an objective,numerical test do minorities make up more than percent of the population in the relevant geographic area where an election district could be drawn in which minority voters form a majority but such a district is not drawn,or where a district is cracked by assigning some voters elsewhere,then assuming the other gingles factors are also satisfied denial of the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice is a present and discernible wrong not an arbitrary invention,the rule has its foundation in principles of democratic governance.the special significance,in the democratic process,of a majority means it is a special wrong when a minority group has percent or more of the voting population and could constitute a compact voting majority but,despite racially polarized bloc voting,that group is not put into a district.
those of our sister circuits to have considered the question have agreed that nothing more than a simple majority is necessary to satisfy the first gingles factor.see bone shirt hazeltine,at cir.rejecting need to show status westwego citizens for better gov t city of westwego,cir concluding that vap is sufficient dickinson.state election,at cir.concluding that vap is sufficient,and rejecting need for at threshold stage this precedent reinforces our own conclusion that the first gingles factor can be satisfied by showing that an identified minority group forms a simple majority of the relevant population of a proposed district.
both the ahej plan and illustrative plan show doj non hispanic blacks to constitute a majority in five proposed districts for representatives to the county legislature.see supra at thus,plaintiffs should not have been denied injunctive relief on this ground 
b.the third gingles factor 
to satisfy the third gingles factor,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it in the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running unopposed usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.thornburg gingles,at.accord lulac perry,at.in reviewing the district court determination that plaintiffs failed to show a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of this factor to warrant preliminary injunctive relief,we apply de novo review to its identification and application of law,but we review factual determinations only for clear error.naacp city of niagara falls,at.here the latter review predominates because the law,which the district court correctly identified,recognizes the need for some flexibility.as the supreme court has observed,no simple doctrinal test applies to the third gingles factor because racial bloc voting can vary according to a variety of factual circumstances.thornburg gingles,at.the factual circumstance that here prompted the district court to conclude that plaintiffs failed to carry their preliminary injunction burden was unexplained omissions from the electoral data provided to their expert witness,liu.
in reaching his conclusion that albany county exhibited racial polarization in biracial elections from to,liu analyzed fourteen elections from that time frame twelve elections and two elections.operating on the assumption that an election was racially polarized if a majority of black voters,but only a minority of voters,supported the black candidate liu determined that nine of the twelve elections exhibited racial polarization without explaining how he defined racial polarization for elections,liu reported that,in the precincts he could analyze,in,two black candidates in a field of six obtained of the black vote and of the white vote while in,two black candidates in a field of six obtained of the black vote and of the white vote 
defendants did not employ competing expert testimony to challenge liu opinion.rather,they pointed to his failure to consider a number of biracial county elections won by black candidates in the period at the preliminary injunction hearing before the district court,liu seemed generally unaware of these elections,testifying that he had relied on election data provided by aaron mair,the executive director of the arbor hill environmental justice corporation,who submitted his own affidavit in support of plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.nothing in the record explains what criteria determined the election data provided to liu.liu,however,agreed that his analysis would be improved by more data and that the omitted data were relevant.
on this record,the district court found that it was not persuaded that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the gingles bloc voting factor because liu formed his racial polarization opinion without considering several countywide and citywide elections that he acknowledged provided relevant data.the court considered the omissions significant because it found that w hile the arbor hill decision correctly concluded that whites in albany county had voted as a bloc before and during,there has clearly been a change in the voting patterns of white residents of the county in the last eight years.pope cnty.of albany,wl,at.the court observed that,whereas no minority candidate had ever been nominated,much less elected,to public office in the county through,in the years thereafter,black candidates had won a number of countywide and local offices,and barack obama won a majority of albany county votes in the general presidential election.see id 
in challenging the district court determination that they failed to demonstrate likely success on the third gingles factor,plaintiffs essentially fault the court for not according more weight to their expert opinion.the question of what weight to accord expert opinion is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the factfinder,and we will not second guess that decision on appeal absent a basis in the record to think that discretion has been abused,which is not this case.see united states yousef,cir reviewing weight that district court assigned to expert testimony for abuse of discretion.a factfinder may certainly consider the bases for an expert opinion and may accord the opinion less,or even no,weight if the record suggests that the bases are defective,incomplete,or questionable.see naacp city of niagara falls,at concluding that district court was entitled to find plaintiffs expert unpersuasive because her analysis covered only portion of relevant timeframe and she relied heavily on interviews with plaintiffs.to the extent plaintiffs suggest that defendants bore the burden to offer contradictory expert testimony,we disagree.it is plaintiffs burden to establish the gingles factors,see thornburg gingles,at,and plaintiffs failed to satisfy that burden here,where the district court justifiably declined to rely on their expert,see naacp city of niagara falls,at.
to be sure,in the context of election challenges,the law does not require that expert opinions be supported by an exhaustive analysis of elections within the relevant period.the number of elections that must be studied in order to determine whether voting is polarized will vary according to pertinent circumstances.thornburg gingles,at.indeed,flexibility is particularly warranted when comprehensive data are not available.see id.t he fact that statistics from only one or a few elections are available for examination does not foreclose a vote dilution claim.further,even when omitted data are available,a court may properly consider whether they pertain to exogenous elections or the ones specifically at issue.see goosby town,cir concluding that exogenous elections are less probative than elections involving the specific office that is the subject of the litigation internal quotation marks omitted.
nevertheless,a factfinder ability to excuse omitted data in considering an expert opinion does not mean that it is compelled to credit the opinion or to find that it demonstrates the sufficient likelihood of success on the third gingles factor to support a preliminary injunction.in making a factual assessment of bloc voting on a limited record,the trial court could properly consider not only that exogenous election data were omitted from an expert analysis,but also the content of the data,as well as the reasons for their omission.here,the omitted data,showing the success of black candidates in various elections conducted in albany county during the relevant period,may have been more favorable to defendants than the data provided to liu for his analysis.further,the record provides no insights as to why these data were not provided to liu,while data for similar elections were.
we do not predict what liu opinion would be if he were to include the omitted data in his analysis.much less do we predict whether plaintiffs will be able to prove bloc voting or the other elements of a section claim when they make a full evidentiary presentation to the district court on final,rather than preliminary,presentation of their case.evidence of black candidates electoral successes may be probative of a general willingness of white voters to vote for black candidates.abrams johnson,d internal quotation marks omitted.but such evidence does not necessarily negate a finding of bloc voting,particularly if elections are shown usually to be polarized or the success of minority candidates in particular elections can be explained by special circumstances,such as the absence of an opponent or incumbency.thornburg gingles,at.further,where,as here,a section challenge is to a redistricting plan,a court considering exogenous elections does so mindful that the ultimate inquiry into the existence of vote dilution caused by submergence is district specific.id.at.faulting district court for aggregating racial polarization numbers across several independently challenged multimember districts.these matters,however,warrant no further discussion here they are for the district court to consider in any subsequent proceedings.
we here conclude only that the district court acted within its discretion
