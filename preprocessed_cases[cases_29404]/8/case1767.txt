this is an appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cote,which dismissed the actions of certain bondholders appellants of worldcom,as.the question presented is whether the filing of a complaint asserting a class action tolls the statute of limitations for putative class members who file individual suits asserting the same claims prior to the class certification decision.
the appellants are public and private pension funds,which purchased bonds of worldcom.in these suits brought against the underwriters of the bonds under section of the securities act of,the appellants allege that the registration statements covering the bonds they purchased contained false and misleading information.the statute of limitations for such actions requires that claims be brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.these complaints initially named as defendants a number of including intesa bci and caboto holdings sim collectively,caboto who are the appellees.the complaints were later amended to add the caboto defendants.the assertion of claims against caboto in these actions did not occur until more than one year after the appellants were put on inquiry notice of the misinformation in the registration statements.in the meantime,however,and prior to the expiration of the appellants limitations period,other purchasers of the worldcom bonds had filed timely class action suits under section against caboto purporting to represent appellants as members of the class.in the district court,responding to caboto motion to dismiss the suits for untimeliness,the appellants argued that the filing of these class actions had tolled the statute of limitations as to their claims under the doctrine announced in american pipe construction utah,d t he commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class id.at.the district court rejected this argument because the appellants had filed their individual suits before the class suits on their behalf had been certified.the district court held that tolling under american pipe is unavailable to class members who,like the appellants,file individual suits before the class certification decision.the court therefore found the appellants suits to be untimely and dismissed them.we disagree with the district court.as we understand the rule of american pipe,it provides that the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations for all members of the asserted class,regardless of whether they file an individual action before resolution of the question whether the purported class will be certified.
background 
the district court summarized the origins of this complex litigation 
for many years,worldcom grew by acquisitions.by,it had acquired more than sixty companies in transactions valued at over billion in early,however,its attempt to acquire sprint collapsed.during this period of expansion,worldcom had used accounting devices to inflate its reported earnings.senior worldcom management instructed personnel in the company controller office on a quarterly basis to falsify worldcom books to reduce worldcom reported costs and thereby to increase its reported earnings.when the pace of acquisitions slowed,it added new strategies to disguise a decline in its revenues.in,however,the scheme collapsed.
in re worldcom.sec,d.
in february,worldcom reduced its revenue and earnings forecasts for the year,and reduced them again on april.shortly thereafter,the first investor class action lawsuit against worldcom was filed on april.on june,worldcom admitted publicly that it had previously issued false and misleading financial statements.worldcom admitted it had overstated earnings and had falsely reported ordinary costs as capital expenditures.soon after this public disclosure,worldcom filed for bankruptcy.once worldcom admission became public,numerous class action lawsuits were filed in various federal courts around the country on behalf of purchasers of worldcom securities.in august the judicial panel on litigation consolidated the federal court class actions before judge cote in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.
in the same period,numerous individual actions were filed by holders of worldcom securities,primarily in state courts.after worldcom public disclosures,between july and october,over public and private pension funds,all represented by the law firm of milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach llp,filed individual actions asserting claims relating to their purchase of worldcom bonds.these suits alleged claims under the securities act of,but not under the exchange act of.this choice was apparently intended to prevent removal of the actions to federal court.federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over exchange act claims,see,and any claim joined to an exchange act claim may also be removed under.by contrast,the securities act grants state and federal courts concurrent jurisdiction and generally bars the removal of actions to federal court.see a.
notwithstanding this strategy,the appellants actions were removed to federal court under a,which permits removal from state courts of actions falling within the federal courts bankruptcy jurisdiction.the appellants challenged the removal,but the district court concluded that their cases were removable because they were related to the worldcom bankruptcy,in re worldcom.sec,a decision later affirmed on appeal,cal.pub.employees ret.worldcom,cir.the appellants actions were thus consolidated with the class actions in may.
the first of these class action suits was filed by one group of appellants,the state of alaska department of revenue and the alaska state pension investment board the alaska appellants,in state court in alaska on april.their complaint alleged that the alaska appellants suffered substantial losses arising out of their purchases of bonds from worldcom august,may,and may offerings.the complaint named as defendants a number of the underwriters of those bonds on september,a month after the removal of their suit to the district court for the southern district of new york,the alaska appellants amended their complaint,adding additional underwriters the additional underwriters including defendants.the caboto defendants are the sole appellees in this appeal.
the amended complaint alleged that caboto,as well as other underwriters,violated section of the securities act which imposes liability on underwriters of securities when the registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omit s to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading a.the alaska appellants alleged that the registration statements and prospectuses for the worldcom bond offerings contained false and misleading statements.though the amended complaint described at length the fraud committed by worldcom and its affiliates,the alaska appellants expressly specified that their section claims were not based on fraud,but rather on negligence and strict liability for registration statements containing untrue statements of material fact.
on october,the district court certified a class action involving securities claims against worldcom.the named class action plaintiffs included groups that had purchased bonds during the may and may bond offerings,but not the august bond offering.the class action complaint asserted section claims against underwriters of the bond offerings,including caboto.
the underwriter defendants in the alaska appellants action moved to dismiss based,inter alia,on statute of limitations grounds.the district court permitted all the other appellants to oppose the motion through a joint amicus brief.the court noted that once it had decided the motion in the alaska appellants case,the parties in the other actions would be allowed to argue whether the resolution of that motion should govern their cases.
the underwriter defendants based their argument on section of the securities act,which provides 
no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under section section of this title unless brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence in no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under section section of this title more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public 
thus,a suit alleging that a securities underwriter violated section must be filed a within one year of the date that the plaintiff was on actual notice or inquiry notice of the violation,and b within three years of the date that the security was offered to the public.the underwriter defendants argued that the claims in the alaska appellants original complaint,as well as claims added in the amended complaint,were barred by the time limit,the time limit,or both.
in response,the alaska appellants and the other appellants,through their amicus brief argued that their claims should be governed by the longer statutes of limitations provided for in the act,rather than the shorter ones described in section of the securities act.the act provides for limitations periods for private securities cases that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance b.however,the district court held that the alaska appellants could not benefit from these longer limitations periods,because they had expressly disavowed relying on allegations of fraud or intentional misconduct,basing their section claims entirely on theories of negligence and strict liability.moreover,the court found that the act language and legislative history confirmed that its limitations periods were not available in section claims such as those asserted by the alaska appellants.
having found that the securities act one and statutes of limitations applied to the alaska appellants claims,the district court held that any claims based on the august bond offering had expired in august and were the district court next turned to the section claims based on the may and may bond offerings.the securities act required that these claims be brought within one year after the alaska appellants were on inquiry notice of the inaccuracies in the registration statements.the alaska appellants initial complaint was brought on april.upon examination of the public disclosures of worldcom,the court ruled that the underwriters had failed to demonstrate as a matter of law that the alaska appellants were on inquiry notice as of april,year and a day before the original complaint.
however,the court noted that claims against the additional underwriter defendants,including caboto,were asserted for the first time in the amended complaint on september.worldcom had revealed much of its financial misconduct on june,when it publicly restated its earnings and expenses.therefore,the court held,the alaska appellants were on inquiry notice of their section claims as of that date at the latest and their claims against the additional underwriters were filed past the deadline,which expired on june,one year after appellants were first on inquiry notice regarding worldcom financial misconduct.those claims would have to be dismissed unless the statute of limitations was tolled by virtue of the class actions asserted against the additional underwriter defendants.
the alaska appellants argued that,under the doctrine of american pipe,their claims were tolled by the filing of a worldcom class action on april.in american pipe,the supreme court held that the filing of a class suit tolled the statute of limitations for class members who sought to intervene after the class certification motion was denied for failure to demonstrate numerosity.at.in later cases,the court extended its ruling to class members who opted out after the certification motion was granted,see eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,and to class members who filed separate suits after class certification was denied,see crown,cork seal parker,d.the alaska appellants argued that their suits should also benefit from american pipe tolling,pointing to language in these opinions,which articulates the principle in broad terms.see,id.at.the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class quoting american pipe,at.the earliest federal worldcom class actions were filed on april,and several others were filed soon thereafter.if the filing of these class action suits tolled the securities act statutes of limitations,then the claims against the additional underwriters by entities asserted to be class members would still be viable,notwithstanding the fact that they were filed more than a year after the plaintiffs were put on inquiry notice.
the district court ruled that the alaska appellants could not benefit from american pipe tolling.the court reasoned that the justification for the doctrine was to avoid the filing of numerous suits by individual class members as a safeguard to preserve their option of proceeding by individual action.with the benefit of american pipe tolling,class members could wait until after certification was resolved before deciding whether to file their individual suits.according to the district court reasoning,class members such the alaska appellants who filed individual suits before the certification decision were not entitled to have their claims tolled,because such individual suits were precisely what the american pipe tolling doctrine sought to avoid.
the alaska appellants argued that unless claims like theirs qualified for american pipe tolling,parties who intend to file their own suits will simply forbear doing so until it is time to opt out of the class.the district court responded that such a delay would have beneficial effects 
the parties and courts will not be burdened by separate lawsuits which,in any event,may evaporate once a class has been certified.at the point in a litigation when a decision on class certification is made,investors usually are in a far better position to evaluate whether they wish to proceed with their own lawsuit,or to join a class,if one has been certified.
the court concluded that plaintiffs who choose,as is their right,to pursue separate litigation may not enjoy the benefits of that separate litigation without bearing its burdens,including the burden of filing suit within the applicable statute of limitations.
because the district court held that the filing of the worldcom class actions did not toll the statute of limitations as to the alaska appellants claims,those claims expired a year after the alaska appellants were on inquiry notice of the falsities in worldcom registration the latest,a year after worldcom public disclosures on june.the claims in the amended complaint against the additional underwriters,which was filed in september,were untimely.the court dismissed with prejudice all the alaska appellants claims against the additional underwriters.
after the district court issued its opinion on november,the underwriters in the other appellant actions as well as some additional suits not filed by milberg weiss moved to dismiss based largely on the grounds of the district court ruling.the appellants opposed the motions to dismiss,and the alaska appellants moved the court to reconsider certain aspects of its opinion.the district court again rejected the argument that american pipe tolling should apply to the appellants claims against the additional underwriters.after rejecting other arguments which are not relevant for present purposes,the district court dismissed with prejudice the appellants claims against the additional underwriters under the securities act statute of limitations.
the district court opinion was issued on january.on july,the court ordered the dismissal with prejudice of most of the appellants section claims,including all section claims against the additional underwriters.in its orders of dismissal,the court noted 
i f any plaintiff files a motion to dismiss its lawsuit voluntarily by the end of the opt out period for the worldcom consolidated class action,the plaintiff shall be
