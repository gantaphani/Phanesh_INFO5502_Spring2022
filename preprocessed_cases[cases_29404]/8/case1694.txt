this appeal arises out of the efforts of a major argentine telecommunications company,telecom argentina,to renegotiate its financial obligations with multinational investors in the wake of a national economic crisis,and the challenge by one investor,appellant here,to the restructuring plan.appellant the argo fund argo appeals from a judgment,entered november,by the united states district court for the southern district of new york buchwald,affirming a february,order of the bankruptcy court lifland,that confirmed a petition by the board of directors of telecom argentina,telecom for recognition of an ancillary foreign proceeding pursuant to former section of the bankruptcy code.see,repealed on april,repeal effective october,section.we hold that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in confirming the petition recognizing the restructuring plan and extending comity to the argentine proceedings based on its finding that those proceedings did not violate public policy considerations manifest in the trust indenture act of,b,the best interests of the creditor test,a,or the requirement in the bankruptcy code,a.we further conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying additional discovery or expert testimony.accordingly,we affirm the judgments below.
background 
in late,argentina entered a deep recession.as economic conditions worsened,argentina devalued its currency and permitted it to float freely after years of being pegged to the dollar at a fixed rate.see michelle wallin matt moffett,argentina says it is devaluing its peso by,wall,at.during this time,argentina also promulgated laws that converted the rates of services charged to customers and due to telecom into pesos,which had significantly declined in value.see sara silver,telecom argentina defaults on bn of debt repayments,fin.times,at.in addition,the government prohibited increases in public service rates or indexing of tariffs to foreign currencies.as a result,telecom was paid by customers in rapidly devaluing pesos,was prohibited from adjusting its rates,yet was required to pay its existing foreign financial debt obligations in foreign currency.
telecom liquidity crisis 
the confluence of these events triggered a liquidity crisis for telecom,which held approximately billion in outstanding unsecured debt old debt.on april,after consulting with its financial advisors,telecom publicly informed investors that it would suspend principal payments on all of its old debt.see id.telecom announced the suspension of its interest payments on the old debt shortly thereafter,on june.
from approximately june through january,telecom negotiated with its creditors through an ad hoc committee in an attempt to restructure the old debt by consent,but failed to finalize a mutually acceptable proposal.on january,telecom announced its own restructuring proposal and its intention to conduct the restructuring as an acuerdo preventivo extrajudicial ape under argentina insolvency law.see insolvency and bankruptcy law public translation insolvency law.the laws governing an ape were revised in,largely in response to the argentine economic crisis as revised,the ape permits a debtor that suspends its payments or has financial difficulties to seek court approval of a privately negotiated,restructuring plan and thereby make the plan binding on all creditors.insolvency law.over the next several months,in consultation with its creditors,telecom made several amendments to the proposed ape plan and finalized its solicitation statement seeking creditor consent.the final proposal provided creditors with three options 
option a new notes due the series a notes,to be issued in an amount equal to the principal face amount of the outstanding notes,plus an adjustment for a portion of the unpaid interest or 
option b new notes due the series b notes,which were to have a shorter maturity and higher interest rate,but which were to be issued at a discount of approximately to the principal face amount and adjustment for a portion of the unpaid interest.creditors selecting option b agreed to have up to of their debt allocated into the cash option described below.or 
option c a cash payment in equivalent dollars at a price not greater than nor less than,to be determined pursuant to a modified dutch auction.
at the expiration of the ape solicitation period,telecom announced that it had received the consent of the holders of in principal face amount of the outstanding notes,or of the number of noteholders.
ape approval in argentine court and cancellation of most of the old debt 
telecom submitted the proposed ape plan to an argentine commercial court for approval on october.pursuant to the court order,telecom held a noteholders meeting after providing the required notice at which all noteholders participating in person or by proxy cast ballots in favor of the plan.argo,a creditor of telecom that now owns over million in telecom notes did not participate.
the argentine court accepted the ape as having been validly approved by the requisite majorities under argentine law.creditors were then given the opportunity to file objections to the plan,and four objections were raised argo again did not participate in the objection process.the argentine court rejected the objections and approved the ape plan by order of may.it concluded t aking into consideration the restructuring sought as a means of turning around the business crisis,the elements provided to the case sic by the debtor and those required by the court,such proposal does not appear to be abusive,fraudulent or discriminatory in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.
while telecom was conducting the court approval process and prior to closing on the restructuring,argo contacted bank,the indenture trustee for the old debt,and instructed it not to exchange argo notes.bank agreed not to cancel or transfer argo notes,but stated that its agreement is subject to actions that it may be legally required to take pursuant to or under force of law.in the course of its discussions with telecom,bank indicated that it would not take any action to cancel the old debt held by creditors unless it received an order from a court directing it to do so.telecom asked bank to cancel the remaining old debt for creditors in accordance with the ape,but bank refused.the closing occurred on august.approximately million in old debt held by creditors was not cancelled and was placed in a trust.
proceedings in the united states 
pursuant to authorization by its board of directors,telecom filed a verified petition the petition commencing,on behalf of telecom,a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding pursuant to of the bankruptcy code,repealed by,tit.viii,stat.the petition sought a judgment declaring that the argentine approval order and the ape should be given full force and effect in the united states,should be binding on all creditors and their agents,and should result in the cancellation of the old debt.
argo answered the petition and moved to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court pursuant to d arguing that resolution of the petition would require a determination on the effect of argo rights under the trust indenture act of,b tia.the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,denied argo motion on november,finding that the case neither satisfied the criteria for mandatory withdrawal nor warranted discretionary withdrawal.see in re bd.of dirs.of telecom argentina,civ,wl.
assured of its jurisdiction over the matter,the bankruptcy court resumed proceedings on the petition.on november,it granted telecom motion in limine to prevent the introduction of evidence regarding telecom financial eligibility to file an ape.the bankruptcy court then held a trial on december,during which the parties introduced the testimony of various experts regarding the argentine insolvency law.
on february,bankruptcy judge burton lifland issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and issued an order granting telecom petition.judge lifland concluded that the ape proceeding qualified as a foreign proceeding and that the telecom ape was worthy of recognition under,having satisfied the factors enumerated in c.see in re bd.of dirs.of telecom argentina,wl.
argo appealed,and the united states district court for the southern district of new york buchwald,affirmed the bankruptcy court in a memorandum and order dated november.the district court found that the bankruptcy court did not err in denying argo objections to the ape on res judicata grounds,concluding that argo could have raised its objections in argentina courts.the district court also rejected argo assertion that the ape proceedings violated public policy considerations manifest in the tia and a,of the bankruptcy code,and it affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that comity was appropriate in this case.in re bd.of dirs.of telecom argentina,civ,wl.argo timely filed an appeal with this court.
discussion 
when a district court sits as an appellate court reviewing a judgment of the bankruptcy court,the district court decisions are subject to plenary review.see in re smith,cir.we review independently the factual findings and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court,accepting its findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous and reviewing its conclusions of law de novo.id.in a case involving a petition for recognition of an ancillary foreign proceeding,we review the bankruptcy court analysis of the c factors for abuse of discretion.see in re treco,cir.to the extent that our decision turns on questions of statutory interpretation,however,our review is de novo.id.
section and recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings 
american courts have long recognized the particular need to extend comity to foreign bankruptcy proceedings.victrix,salen dry cargo,cir.congress enacted as part of the bankruptcy reform act of to formalize a process by which foreign debtors could bind creditors and prevent piecemeal distribution of assets.see id.at see also treco,at the purpose of the section is to provide a statutory mechanism through which united states courts may defer to and facilitate foreign insolvency proceedings.although was repealed by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,tit.viii,stat,and replaced by the addition of a more comprehensive framework in chapter to the bankruptcy code controls this case because telecom filed its petition in bankruptcy court prior to the repeal effective date 
section authorizes a foreign representative to commence a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding by filing a petition in bankruptcy court.a.the bankruptcy court may issue a wide range of relief in connection with such ancillary cases,including enjoin ing the commencement or continuation of an action against a debtor with respect to property involved in such foreign proceeding,the enforcement of any judgment against the debtor with respect to such property,and other appropriate relief.id.b see also in re koreag,controle et revision,cir a bankruptcy court is given broad latitude in fashioning an appropriate remedy in a proceeding.argo does not challenge telecom eligibility to file the petition through its board of directors.the only question at issue is whether the bankruptcy court properly analyzed the factors that govern whether to confirm a petition.
in evaluating a petition,the court shall be guided by what will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of the debtor estate,consistent with six factors enumerated in the statute.c.those factors are just treatment of all claimholders protection for claimholders against prejudice and inconvenience in claims processing prevention of preferential or fraudulent dispositions of property distribution of proceeds substantially in the order prescribed by bankruptcy law comity and if appropriate,an opportunity for a fresh start if the foreign proceeding concerns an individual.id.courts are to conduct a balancing of the se statutory factors.treco,at.argo argues that the bankruptcy court erroneously confirmed telecom petition by misanalyzing two of the c treatment of all creditors and comity 
just treatment of creditors 
argo contends that the ape process does not provide for just treatment of creditors because it allows for only limited objections and limited recourse against a ape.the just treatment factor is satisfied upon a showing that the applicable law provides for a comprehensive procedure for the orderly and equitable distribution of the debtor assets among all of its creditors.treco,at internal quotation marks omitted see also collier on bankruptcy ed.usually,an ancillary petition furthers the goals of just treatment of all creditors by preventing piecemeal dismemberment and by centralizing administration of the debtor affairs and assets.instances in which a court has held that the foreign proceeding does not satisfy this factor include when the proceeding fails to provide creditors access to information and an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner,which are f undamental requisites of due process,in re hourani,or when the proceeding would not recognize a creditor as a claimholder,see in re papeleras reunidas,by reason of its not having been given notice of the spanish proceeding,adams was not recognized as a creditor,thus depriving it of the opportunity to participate in the proceeding,prejudicial to its rights.
here,the ape plan provided for an orderly,centralized administration of telecom debt restructuring.argo had notice of the ape proceedings throughout the telecom filing of an initial registration statement with the sec describing the ape proposal to distributing of the final solicitation statement to convening a noteholders meeting pursuant to an order of the argentine court to publishing notices of approval by the argentine court informing creditors of their right to object to approval of the ape.as further evidence that argo was put on notice of this process,argo sent several letters to,notably,without first raising its issues with telecom or the argentine its disagreement with and its refusal to be bound by the ape.throughout,argo had the opportunity to object to the terms of the proposed plan,to vote on the plan,and then to submit to the parties dispute about the scope of permissible objections to the argentine court.in addition,article of the insolvency law prohibits courts from approving an abusive plan in the context of acuerdo preventivo proceedings.both parties experts testified that argentine courts apply this prohibition in the context of an ape proceeding,although there is some uncertainty about whether courts are required or simply permitted to conduct an abusiveness inquiry in any event,the argentine court in this proceeding did consider whether the plan was abusive,fraudulent,or discriminatory.it ruled that the ape was not,and did so only after directing that creditors should get an additional opportunity to select among their consideration options after the ape was approved.based on this evidence,the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by finding that this ape proceeding comported with due process and ensured just treatment of creditors.
c omity is the ultimate consideration in determining whether to provide relief under,although it does not automatically override the other specified factors.treco,at.the supreme court has defined comity as the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative,executive or judicial acts of another nation,having due regard both to international duty and convenience,and to the rights of its own citizens,or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.hilton guyot.comity is generally appropriate where the foreign proceedings do not violate the laws or public policy of the united states and if the foreign court abides by fundamental standards of procedural fairness.finanz ag zurich banco economico,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
argo argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting the petition because the ape proceeding violates public policy and therefore is not entitled to comity.argo identifies three provisions in the bankruptcy code that it asserts are inconsistent with the ape proceeding protection of bondholders rights under b of the tia the best interests of the creditor requirement under a and the requirement under a.
trust indenture act 
the trust indenture act protects the holder of a bond issued under a qualified indenture from impairment of its rights.it provides that the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.b.as argo acknowledges in its brief,however,o f course,the tia can not prevent the reorganization of a debtor under bankruptcy laws.indeed,i t is that section b could not have been intended to impair the capacity of a debtor and its creditors to restructure debt in the context of bankruptcy,and t he cases have uniformly recognized that reorganization proceedings in chapter are not within the purview of tia section b.in re delta air lines,aff see also in re bd.of dirs.of multicanal,multicanal i observing that a creditor conceded,as it must,that the rights of holders to principal and interest on bonds issued under a indenture can be impaired by bankruptcy proceedings.because,as argo concedes,tia protected bonds are subject to restructuring under the united states bankruptcy law,and because section is part of our bankruptcy law,a bankruptcy court may grant enforcement of foreign insolvency proceedings that restructure tia protected bonds so long as recognition of those proceedings is otherwise valid under section such a holding would turn the principle of comity on its head and would fail to promote a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties particularly necessary in bankruptcy proceedings.hilton,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
best interests of the creditor and good faith 
to avoid the preceding conclusion,argo asserts that the bankruptcy code provides creditors at least two avenues for challenging a debtor efforts to skirt the mandatory provisions of section b of the tia the best interests of the creditor analysis,see a,and the requirement,see id.a.in essence,argo suggests that nonconsensual reorganization under bankruptcy law is permissible notwithstanding tia b because of these protections in their absence,approval of the reorganization would be improper.argo then argues that argentine law does not provide these protections,and therefore the ape is not entitled to comity.
section a,commonly known as the best interest of creditors requirement,establishes that a creditor must receive no less in a reorganization than it would in liquidation.see kane,cir.argo position is that unless the foreign proceeding provides for an equivalent best interests analysis for creditors,the foreign reorganization is not entitled to comity.
comity,however,does not require that foreign proceedings afford a creditor identical protections as under bankruptcy law.see allstate life ins.linter group,cir explaining that there is no requirement that australian liquidation proceedings be identical to united states bankruptcy proceedings to afford comity see also in re bd.of dirs.of multicanal,multicanal ii there is no requirement that a foreign proceeding incorporate the conditions to confirmation set forth in of the bankruptcy code.specifically,we agree with the conclusion of the bankruptcy court in in re garcia avila,that the absence of a best interests test does not prevent recognition of ancillary foreign proceedings under.id.at.argo argument amounts to a claim that the court should not grant comity because creditors may receive a smaller distribution on their unsecured claim in the foreign jurisdiction than they would receive under united states law.id.at.but so long as the other c factors are satisfied,the statute does not require that the amount of a distribution in a foreign insolvency proceeding be equal to the hypothetical amount the creditor would have received in a proceeding under law 
in this case,although telecom was not required to prepare a liquidation analysis,which a requires in a domestic proceeding,the ape provided creditors with options to receive from to of the outstanding principal face amount of their claims,plus an adjustment factor for unpaid interest.telecom expert testified that this was the best consideration i have ever seen in an ape.the particular circumstances of this case and the terms of the restructuring plan clearly support the conclusion that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting argo contention that a should prohibit a grant of comity.
argo additional contention that the proceedings were not undertaken in good faith and would therefore fail to satisfy one of the prerequisites for confirmation of a chapter plan,see a,likewise fails.under a,a plan will be found in good faith if it was proposed with honesty and good intentions and with a basis for expecting that a reorganization can be effected.in re koelbl,cir internal quotations omitted see also kane,at affirming confirmation of a chapter plan where the company honestly believed that it was in need of reorganization and that the plan was negotiated and proposed with the intention of accomplishing a successful reorganization.a finding of good faith will not be overturned unless the opponent of the plan can show that the finding was clearly erroneous.koelbl,at.
argo claims that telecom ape proceeding was conducted in bad faith because telecom could have paid all of its debts in full,and thus,is using the ape law not to promote a necessary restructuring but,instead,to enrich its shareholders.the bankruptcy court refused to permit argo to present expert testimony on telecom financial health at the time of the ape.it noted that the argentine court found that telecom met the financial eligibility requirements to file an ape and that finding was not contested by argo in the argentine court and may not be collaterally attacked by argo in this court.we need not decide whether the bankruptcy court correctly held that argo objections to the ape based on telecom financial health were barred by res judicata because the bankruptcy court nonetheless considered telecom financial status at the time of the proposed restructuring,such that it could make a finding of good faith.the court noted that telecom faced a severe liquidity crisis that triggered the initiation of restructuring efforts,along with the suspension of principal and interest payments,in.the court also found that the insolvency law does not require a party to be insolvent before commencing ape proceedings it is enough that the debtor is experiencing general financial or economic difficulties.the record attests to the financial difficulty that telecom experienced as the result of the argentine economic crisis and that prompted its restructuring efforts the insolvency law permits a debtor to restructure its obligations in such circumstances,so long as it receives the requisite consent of its creditors and satisfies the other conditions for ape approval.tellingly,the ape met with overwhelming approval by telecom creditors.argo has offered no evidence that telecom abused the ape process or entered it in a bad faith attempt to press a debt restructuring it knew was unnecessary.accordingly,the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that telecom proposed the ape in good faith and that confirmation of telecom petition would not undermine the public policy considerations in a.
in sum,we conclude,based on the specific facts of this case and in light of all the circumstances,see treco,at,that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in confirming telecom petition and recognizing the ape.we reach this conclusion mindful that review must be guided by what will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of insolvency proceedings.c.as previously noted,argo did not attempt to raise any objections to the proposed ape before the argentine court.argo challenge to the ape in the united states,after refusing to participate even by objection in the argentine proceedings and after telecom closed on the ape,is contrary to our longstanding recognition that foreign courts have an interest in conducting insolvency proceedings concernin
