this is the second time the plaintiffs have brought the same claims before the federal courts.this time,they characterize the claims as sounding in tort rather than sounding in contract,as they had claimed earlier.this they can not do.
in,lopez medina l m brought suit against a number of insurers,claiming that the insurers were liable for l m breach of contract claims against a company,patriot air,llc patriot air,that had an insurance policy with those insurers.in,the district court dismissed the case on the basis that the insurance policy did not provide coverage for contract claims.lopez medina marsh usa,d.this court affirmed.lópez medina marsh usa,cir.
l m and its owner now bring claims arising out of the same set of underlying facts.the district court dismissed the action on the ground of res judicata.medina padilla piedmont aviation,cv,wl.we affirm.
the background facts and procedural history of this case are recounted in detail in our previous opinion.lópez medina,at.we briefly recount the facts underlying this appeal.
on june,l m filed a diversity complaint in the district of puerto rico against a number of for patriot air the complaint alleged that l m had entered into a passenger aircraft charter agreement with patriot air and that patriot air had breached that agreement in june and july.but patriot air had filed for bankruptcy in september,and l m did not name patriot air as a defendant.rather,the complaint sought recovery from patriot air insurers under puerto rico direct action statute,laws ann.tit,which allows third parties to bring an action against an insurer for claims covered under an insurance policy.
on march,the district court dismissed l m complaint.lopez medina,d at.the district court held that the relevant insurance policy clearly and unambiguously covers only tort claims.id.at.l m claims did not fall under the scope of the insurance policy because of l m admi ssion that the complaint is premised only on a breach of contract claim not involving any liability for torts.id.
on march,l m filed a motion to alter or amend judgment.l m argued that the district court erred in understanding its complaint as advancing only a breach of contract action and claimed that it was also seeking concomitant tort damages.
the district court denied the motion.lopez medina marsh usa,cv,wl.the district court noted that the complaint does not once allege a tort violation and is entirely based on the claim that the alleged breach of contract is a covered insurable risk under the insurance policies.id.at.
on january,this court affirmed.lópez medina,at.we first determined that t here can be no doubt that l m allegations here sound in contract.id.at.we agreed with the district court that recovery by l m depended on whether the relevant insurance policy language,which usually covers only tort claims,also provides coverage for claims in an underlying action arising out of and related to a contract between the parties.id.at.this was a question of first impression in our circuit,which we answered by concluding that the insurance policy express terms provide no coverage for l m claims.id.at.
on january,heriberto medina padilla and l m,undaunted,filed the complaint in this action.medina padilla,who was not a plaintiff in the first lawsuit,was a travel agent and the sole owner and principal of l m.the complaint sought recovery in tort for patriot air negligent refusal and withholding of transportation arising from the same series of events that underlay the previous suit breach of contract claims.
usaui and usaig moved to dismiss on the grounds of res judicata and statute of limitations.on march,the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata.medina padilla,wl,at.
this appeal followed.
an affirmative defense such as res judicata may be raised in a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b when the facts establishing the defense are clear on the face of the plaintiff pleadings.see santana castro toledo dávila,cir nisselson lernout,cir.where a motion to dismiss is premised on res judicata,we may take into account,in addition to the facts in the complaint,the record in the original action.andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir.our review is de novo.garcía monagas de arellano,cir.
under semtek international lockheed martin,federal common law governs the effect of a dismissal by a federal court sitting in diversity,d.the appropriate rule under federal common law is the law that would be applied by state courts in the state in which the federal diversity court sits,unless that rule would be incompatible with federal interests,id.at see also hatch trail king,cir.with no argument made that puerto rico law is incompatible with federal interests,we proceed in applying puerto rico law 
under puerto rico statutory definition of res judicata,it is necessary that,between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked,there be the most perfect identity between the things,causes,and persons of the litigants,and their capacity as such.laws ann.tit.this definition encompasses both claim preclusion and issue preclusion,albeit with slightly different requirements for each.fin.vergara nuñez,cir.
a party asserting claim preclusion under puerto rico law must establish three elements i there exists a prior judgment on the merits that is final and unappealable ii the prior and current actions share a perfect identity of both thing and cause and iii the prior and current actions share a perfect identity of the parties and the capacities in which they acted.garcía monagas,at.
all three elements are met here.first,the prior district court decision,affirmed by this court,is a final judgment on the merits.
second,there is a perfect identity of thing and cause.two actions share a perfect identity of thing if they involve the same object or matter.garcía monagas,at quoting lausell marxuach díaz de yáñez,offic.trans.two actions share a perfect identity of cause if they flow from the same principal ground or origin,id.citing lausell marxuach,offic.trans.at,or they derive from a common nucleus of operative facts,id.quoting silva city of new bedford,cir.these requirements are met.the complaint in this case and the complaint in the prior action are based on the same factual predicates.a mere difference in the legal theories on which two causes of action are grounded does not destroy the identity of thing or cause that otherwise exists between two suits arising out of a common nucleus of operative fact.fin,at.
third,there is perfect identity of the parties.under puerto rico law,two actions share a perfect identity of the parties if either the parties in the current action were also parties in the prior action or the parties in the current action are in privity with the parties in the prior action.garcía monagas,at citing laws ann.tit.the prior suit was brought by l m this suit is brought by l m and medina padilla,the sole owner and principal of l m who was not a named party in the prior suit.but l m does not contest that it and medina padilla are in privity under the general rule that where one party acts for or stands in the place of another in relation to a particular subject matter,those parties are in privity for purposes of the puerto rico preclusion statute.fin,at.
rather than contesting that any of those three prongs are met,l m argues that its suit should be permitted to proceed based on two supposed exceptions to res judicata.
first,l m argues that the defendants took inconsistent positions during the prior litigation that prevented the prior action from being fully and fairly litigated.but the district court in the prior action,correctly,as we held,rejected l m contract claim on the merits and rejected on the merits its argument that a tort cause of action had also been pleaded.lopez medina,d at.nothing about the defendants alleged inconsistent procedural conduct calls the fairness of those decisions into doubt 
second,l m argues that our decision changed the applicable law so as to make available a tort cause of action that had not been available when it initiated the prior lawsuit.that
