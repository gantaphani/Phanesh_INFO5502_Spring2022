there are two questions on this appeal where the issue before us is the propriety of the dismissal of plaintiff amended complaint.the first question asks whether a prisoner claim of an alleged deprivation of medical services must be administratively exhausted before relief may be sought in federal court.the answer to that question hinges on whether the action of which the inmate complains is properly classified as a single,momentary example,an individualized retaliatory action against him or a particularized instance of excessive which case no exhaustion is required.yet,if the circumstances complained of affect everyone in the prison example,food,clothing,housing,recreational facilities,that is,those things inmates of a prison share in there must be administrative exhaustion before bringing suit in federal court.
the second question is one of procedure whether a district court confronted with a plaintiff failure fully to exhaust administrative remedies may stay the case until such exhaustion is complete,or whether the court must dismiss the case without prejudice to its later reinstitution.we hold in this case for the first time that where exhaustion is required,failure to do so must result in dismissal,notwithstanding efforts by the to pursue administrative remedies while simultaneously seeking relief in federal court.
background 
plaintiff christopher neal commenced this suit on april,pursuant to supp.v,in the united states district court for the western district of new york siragusa,against defendants glenn goord,commissioner of the new york state department of correctional services,walter kelly,superintendent of attica correctional facility,and certain attica personnel including sergeants buehler and hirsch,officers storres,barker and hansen,and takos and laskowski.neal filed an amended complaint six weeks later.at the time of his pleadings,neal was an inmate at new york state attica correctional facility,having been transferred there from another state prison,shawangunk correctional facility,on march.
the following facts are taken from the amended complaint and its attachments.while at shawangunk,plaintiff was injured in an incident on january.although he received medication for his injuries upon arriving at attica,neal repeatedly requested a stronger prescription because of allegedly severe lower back pain.those requests were ignored or denied.on april and,he asked for physical therapy,which was not ordered for him until nearly two weeks later on may.neal also spoke with takos and told him that he needed special boots and sneakers.he further complained about his back pain,whereupon takos conducted a short examination through the bars of plaintiff cell.the doctor said he would order an,but no was ever taken.neal further alleged in his amended complaint that defendants failed to protect him from a former shawangunk officer,refused his request for a transfer based on his fear of retaliation by that officer,and also failed to assist him in obtaining alternative meals,legal materials,religious items and clean clothing that he had requested.
attached as exhibits to the amended complaint were numerous documents indicating that neal had filed grievances with the inmate grievance program.while these grievances touched upon a wide variety of issues,the ones relevant to this appeal addressed neal request for a change in prescriptions,his need for special boots,his problems with severe back pain,his request for legal materials,and the institution failure to provide clean sheets when his one set was in the laundry.plaintiff also wrote several letters.in particular,he wrote defendant goord with respect to a physical threat made by the former shawangunk officer,and he wrote deputy commissioner george bartlett,defendant kelly,and lucien leclaire whose official position is not identified about his failure to receive alternative meals since arriving at attica.
the district court,having previously granted plaintiff request to proceed in forma pauperis,conducted a sua sponte review of the amended complaint pursuant to and supp.v.it determined that because plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing his original complaint in april his claims could not go forward.the amended complaint was thereby dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a supp.v.judgment was entered on august,and plaintiff filed an appeal on august.
plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on august.attached as exhibits were various decisions from the central office review committee review committee,which renders final decisions on inmate grievances.in the only decision pertinent to this appeal,the review committee had accepted in part plaintiff grievance pertaining to his request for physical therapy.the district court treated the second amended complaint as a motion for reconsideration and denied it in a september,order for the same reason as had been given before,that is,because plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing the original complaint.we affirm.
i merits of the dismissal 
we apply a de novo standard of review to sua sponte dismissals made pursuant to e or,or.marvin goord,cir per curiam giano goord,cir.
whether plaintiff inadequate medical treatment claims relate to a prison condition subject to exhaustion 
congress,in enacting the prison litigation reform act of act,title viii,stat,carved out an exception to the general rule that exhaustion of state remedies is not a prerequisite to filing suit under.see nussle willette,cir,cert.granted sub nom.porter nussle,d june.the act amended a so that it now provides 
no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
the act does not define prison conditions as that term is used in this section.we have observed that t he plain language of prison conditions suggests those aspects of prison life affecting the entire prison population,such as the food,medical care,recreational facilities and the like.lawrence goord,cir per curiam emphasis added accord nussle,at quoting carter kiernan,civ,wl,at,which stated that t he ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of the phrase prison conditions refers to such things as medical treatment jenkins haubert,cir noting that the phrase conditions of confinement has a plain meaning,which encompasses all conditions under which a prisoner is confined,including deprivation of medical care.the seventh circuit,in squarely addressing the issue,found that complaints about medical treatment in prison are complaints about prison conditions.perez.dep t of,cir.
our case law requires inmates to exhaust administrative remedies under a when the action affecting the prisoner was dictated by prison policy or reflected a practice affecting the entire inmate population.see marvin,at.based on these precedents,the district court correctly applied the exhaustion requirement.plaintiff essentially complains of poor medical treatment.he wanted stronger medicine,but did not receive it he wanted physical therapy sooner than it was prescribed.takos examined him through the bars of his cell and never ordered the promised.we consider these allegations to be ordinary garden variety complaints about prison conditions.
plaintiff nevertheless contends that the facts of his claims are more akin to the retaliatory conduct and excessive force claims considered in lawrence and nussle.in each of those cases,we determined that the exhaustion requirement did not apply.lawrence,at retaliation nussle,at excessive force.as explained in lawrence,t he underlying principles requiring notice to administrators and allowing policy makers to change their not served when a practice is aimed at one specific inmate rather than the prison population as a whole.at.
the district court did not have the benefit of our views in lawrence and nussle because it rendered judgment before those cases were decided.in other cases where we have reviewed district court decisions issued prior to lawrence and nussle,we have
