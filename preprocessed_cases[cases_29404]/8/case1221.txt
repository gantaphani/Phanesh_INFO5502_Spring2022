this appeal presents the issue of whether a district court,under the all writs act,a,and the anti injunction act,has the authority to enjoin a party from litigating in state court issues arising out of a consent decree which settled a civil action brought against the party in federal court by the united states.appellant joseph manne settled an environmental enforcement action brought against him by the united states through a consent decree providing,inter alia,that manne would pay the government an amount equal to the fair market value of a parcel of real property owned by manne.under the decree,an independent appraiser was engaged to determine the property fair market value.after the appraiser issued a report,manne unsuccessfully challenged the appraised value in federal court.manne then filed an action in new york supreme court,asserting claims against the appraiser for,among others,fraud and negligent misrepresentation.on application by the government,the district court enjoined the state court proceedings.we hold that the anti injunction act,which permits a federal court to enjoin a state proceeding in certain limited circumstances,including where an injunction is necessary in aid of the federal court jurisdiction,does not permit the district court in this case to enjoin manne state court suit.accordingly,we vacate the injunction of the district court.
background 
in october,after receiving reports of contaminated wells in east fishkill,dutchess county,new york,the environmental protection agency epa and the new york state department of environmental conservation identified as the primary source of the contamination a septic tank at a site in east fishkill owned by jacob manne,appellant joseph manne father epa later discovered a buried acid waste pit on the site that contained lead,perchloroethene,and other hazardous substances.
in february,after incurring significant costs in cleaning up and removing contaminated soil from the site,epa forwarded a notice of potential liability and request for information informing jacob manne that epa considered him a potentially liable party for the response costs incurred in the cleanup.following jacob manne death,the united states brought an action against appellant joseph manne,in his capacity as trustee of the jacob manne irrevocable trust the trust,a trust created and funded by jacob manne,and against steven schurkman,in his capacity as representative for the estate of jacob manne.the united states alleged that shortly after receiving the notice,jacob manne had created the trust,appointed schurkman as trustee,and fraudulently transferred cash and real property into the trust.these assets were subsequently transferred to joseph manne,the trust principal beneficiary.
the united states sought reimbursement of approximately million in response costs incurred under sections and of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of,and,for cleanup activities undertaken at the site.according to the amended complaint,the site was used during the and by manne,a company owned by jacob manne that was engaged in the cleaning and repairing of computer chip racks.manne,work generated toxic waste materials,including tetrachloroethene,trichloroethene,lead,nitric acid,and sulfuric acid,all of which were stored at the site.the united states also sought to void as fraudulent conveyances the transfers of cash and real property from jacob manne to the trust and to compel the return of those assets to jacob manne estate to satisfy the estate liabilities to the united states.
in,the parties reached a settlement,embodied in a consent decree which the district court approved in july.under the terms of the consent decree,agreed to pay the united states an amount equal to the appraised value of certain property which had been transferred by jacob manne into the trust the property the appraised value of the property was to be determined by an appraiser selected by the parties.pursuant to the consent decree,the united states would provide a list of at least three appraisers,from which defendants would choose one.the united states would then retain the appraiser to prepare an appraisal report of the property within six months of the date the appraiser was selected.the parties agreed that t he appraised value of the property as determined by the selected appraiser shall be unreviewable by any party to this consent decree or by the court.consent decree.
in exchange for payment of the property appraised value,the united states provided defendants with a covenant not to sue or to take administrative action against manne and nd pursuant to.a,regarding the contaminated site.defendants also received protection from contribution actions arising out of the contamination.see f.schurkman,manne,and nd,in turn,covenanted not to sue the united states,or its contractors or employees,with respect to the contaminated site or this consent decree.consent decree.
the parties expressly contemplated the approval and enforcement of the consent decree by the district court 
the united states and settling defendants agree,and this court by entering this consent decree finds,that this consent decree has been negotiated by the parties in good faith,that settlement of this matter will avoid prolonged and complicated litigation between the parties,and that this consent decree is fair,reasonable,and in the public interest.
id.i c.the consent decree provided that t his court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter for the purpose of interpreting and enforcing the terms of this consent decree,id,and that manne and nd shall not challenge the terms of this consent decree or this court jurisdiction to enter and enforce this consent decree,id.following a period of public notice and comment on the consent decree,during which no public comments were received,the district court approved and entered the consent decree.
in august,the united states provided the names of three appraisers to defendants,who selected dewan schott appraisal associates,llc dewan schott.following a visit to the property,during which representatives from dewan schott were accompanied by attorneys for manne and the united states,the appraiser submitted an appraisal report.the report noted that the appraiser took various steps in developing a valuation opinion of the property,including researching the regional market for industrial real estate,specifically market information relating to recent sales and listings of industrial properties with similar characteristics located around the i and corridors interviewing real estate brokers with experience in the regional market studying information relating to nearby groundwater contamination to understand its potential impact on the property fair market value and employing various methods of property valuation.the appraisers concluded that the appraised value of the property as a whole as of october,the date of the inspection,was.
the appraisers certified that the statements of fact in the report were true and correct,that the appraisers were unbiased with respect to the property and the parties involved,and that compensation for preparation of the report was not contingent upon reaching a predetermined result.the appraisers represented that the report was prepared in accordance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice uspap,the code of professional ethics,and the standards of professional appraisal practice of the appraisal institute.on january,in accordance with the terms of the consent decree,the district court entered judgment against joseph manne,in his capacity as the representative of the estate of jacob manne,and nd,in the amount of plus interest.
in july,despite the consent decree provision that the property appraised value shall be unreviewable,manne filed a motion seeking to modify or vacate the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,based on objections to the appraisal report.manne sought a new appraisal,arguing that the dewan schott appraisal was deficient in that the appraiser failed to state and justify certain extraordinary assumptions made in the report,including its use of sales of comparable parcels in orange county as a proxy for sales in dutchess county,where the property is located,and the report determination that development of the property would not be subject to substantial permitting requirements.manne also argued that the appraiser failed to factor certain unique features into the appraised value,including anticipated opposition to development by citizen environmental groups construction obstacles posed by a water course running through the property and regulatory complications caused by the property proximity to the taconic parkway,the appalachian trail,and the presence of rare plant and animal species.in support of his request for relief,manne submitted two expert reports one,by a law firm,opined that any attempt to develop the property would be hindered by substantial regulatory hurdles and the other,by an appraiser,concluded that the appraisal report completed by dewan schott failed to conform to uspap standards.
the district court denied the motion on the basis that the consent decree explicitly provided that the appraised value shall be unreviewable.the court noted that the consent decree had been negotiated at arms length and that there was no allegation that the appraisal was procured by fraud.rather,manne objections to the appraisal report were,at bottom,criticisms of the appraisal methods employed by dewan schott.this court affirmed the denial of manne motion.see united states manne,fed.app x cir.
after manne appealed the district court denial of his rule b motion but before this court affirmed that order,manne and nd brought an action in new york supreme court against dewan schott and two members of that firm asserting claims for negligent misrepresentation,gross negligence,and fraud arising out of the preparation of the appraisal report.the complaint allegations of deficiencies in the report were similar to,and indeed,nearly identical to those made in support of manne rule b motion in federal district court.manne and nd sought damages of at least the difference between the appraised amount as determined by dewan schott and the amount proffered by manne as a reasonable appraisal value.the complaint made no mention of the district court denial of manne rule b motion or of the appeal then pending before this court.
by letter dated may,the united states notified the district court of the filing of the state court action.the united states requested that the district court exercise its jurisdiction over the enforcement of the consent decree and enjoin the state court proceeding pursuant to its authority under the all writs act,a.the united states argued that such an injunction was not precluded by the anti injunction act,which provides that a federal court may not enjoin proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.the united states argued that a district court injunction of the state court proceeding was not barred for two reasons.pursuant to the consent decree provision that the district court retained jurisdiction over th e matter for the purpose of interpreting and enforcing the terms of this consent decree,the district court could enjoin manne and nd state court action from proceeding on the grounds that doing so is necessary in aid of the district court jurisdiction and to protect or effectuate the district court judgment.
the district court rejected the government argument that the issuance of an injunction was permitted under the relitigation exception to the anti injunction act,which permits a federal court to enjoin state proceedings where necessary to protect or effectuate its judgments.citing smith bayer,d,the district court held that the relitigation exception did not apply because the specific allegations made by manne in the state court complaint that the appraisers negligently or fraudulently prepared the appraisal had not been raised in the rule b proceedings in federal court.the government has expressly declined to challenge this aspect of the district court ruling on appeal.see appellee br.
however,finding that the state court action in my view clearly interferes with this court exclusive jurisdiction over the consent decree,the district court held that an injunction was permitted under the in aid of jurisdiction exception.the court noted that the consent decree granted to the district court jurisdiction over the interpretation and enforcement of the consent decree.the court opined that manne,after striking out in this court,brought the state court suit asserting claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation against the appraiser,thus seeking review of the adequacy of the appraiser methods.such a review,the court noted,is clearly disallowed by the consent decree provision that the appraisal shall be unreviewable.the court continued 
and whether one dresses it up as mistake or as negligence or as gross negligence or even fraud,it the same,which is,it asking a state court to do what this court should be doing,which is interpreting and applying and enforcing the consent decree,which includes issues having to do with the appraisal,and,of course,the court will apply the consent decree that the parties negotiated with counsel and the court so ordered back nearly two years ago.
special app x.in the district court view,any judgment issued in the state court suit that awarded money to manne would in effect challenge or redo the appraisal and would frustrate the consent decree and would be inconsistent with the court exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of the consent decree.id.at.the district court thus granted the government request for an injunction and issued an order enjoin ing defendants from litigating issues related to the consent decree in any court other than the southern district of new york.special app x.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court injunction against the state court action was proper under the all writs act,and the anti injunction act.the all writs act grants federal courts authority to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.this statute must be read in tandem with the anti injunction act,which tempers the potency of the all writs act by limiting the circumstances under which a federal court may enjoin state court proceedings.the anti injunction act,enacted in its original form as part of the judiciary act of,provides,as noted above,that a federal court may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.emphasis added.we review the district court issuance of an injunction under the all writs act for abuse of discretion.united states int l of teamsters,cir.we review de novo the court interpretation of consent decrees,and of the all writs act and the anti injunction act.id.
given the explicit wording of the anti injunction act and the fundamental principle of a dual system of courts,a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy.atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.since the anti injunction act prohibitory provision rests on the fundamental constitutional independence of the states and their courts,the exceptions should not be enlarged by loose statutory construction.id.at.proceedings in state courts,thus,should normally be allowed to continue unimpaired by intervention of the lower federal courts,with relief from error,if any,through the state appellate courts and ultimately the supreme court.id.
in this case,the district court having held that an injunction was permitted under the in aid of jurisdiction exception to the anti injunction act,and the united states having expressly declined to challenge the court ruling with respect to the relitigation exception,our
