much of our court recent docket has been consumed with poor,often pro se,immigrants who lack,but hope to obtain,legal status.the current case addresses a differently situated immigrant with parallel aspirations.ganga mantena,a relatively affluent and skilled computer programmer,legally arrived in the united states on an b visa and pursued status adjustment to permanent residency,colloquially known as a green card.mantena pursuit occurred with benefit of counsel and,by the time of this appeal,of knowledgeable amici curiae as well.
shortly after her arrival,mantena original petitioning employer filed an alien labor certification for mantena with the department of labor,followed by an i immigrant petition for alien worker with the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis,in accordance with the relevant provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina.pursuant to the ina,mantena then filed for adjustment of status to obtain a green card.mantena subsequently took advantage of recent federal legislation intended to increase the job flexibility of workers,the portability provisions of the american competitiveness in the century act of,j and a a iv.these provisions allow an individual to change jobs or employers while preserving the validity of not only the individual application for adjustment of status but also the underlying immigrant visa petition and alien labor certification filed by the earlier employer.
understandably,mantena remained sanguine about her adjustment process.it turned out,however,that there were serious problems in the visa petition,filed by the employer for whom she no longer worked,that underlay the green card application.this employer pleaded guilty to mail fraud in connection with an immigration petition filed on behalf of a different employee.uscis subsequently decided to initiate the revocation of all petitions filed by the employer,asserting that all such petitions might be fraudulent.but neither mantena nor her new employer was informed of any of this.
by the time mantena heard of her original employer immigrant petition revocation,her green card application had been automatically denied.indeed,it was this denial that purportedly gave her notice of the i revocation.multiple appeals and legal challenges later,her case is now before us.
mantena case illustrates the importance of notifying affected parties of material changes in their proceedings and statuses and of giving them an opportunity to respond.this is true for any legal proceeding,but is a particular and continuing concern for immigrants throughout the multistep administrative process.the questions before us are,however,whether such notification is required by law and,if it is,where jurisdiction lies and who has standing to enforce that requirement.
the district court dismissed mantena statutory and regulatory notice claims on jurisdictional grounds.it dismissed her constitutional due process claim for failure to identify a protected interest.we disagree with respect to jurisdiction over these claims and we envision no problems regarding mantena standing to bring her claims.we also conclude that timely notice,the lack of which occurred because of unintended cracks between new congressional legislation and old regulations,is required by the amended statutory scheme.accordingly,we decline to address the constitutional claim.we remand for supplemental briefing to establish more precisely which parties,in addition to the original petitioner of the immigrant visa,are entitled to notice pertaining to a visa petition revocation.
background 
statutory scheme 
the ina allows for a certain number of immigrants to receive permanent residency through employer sponsorship.for an immigrant who is already in the united states,there is a process for receiving permanent residency.first,the department of labor dol must issue an alien labor certification to the immigrant employer.this certification states that the labor market can absorb the immigrant without affecting other workers wages.see a a i.second,uscis must approve the employer immigrant visa petition form i.see a f a.third,the immigrant must obtain approval of her own application for adjustment of status.a n.
this final step can not take place until a permanent residency visa is available for the immigrant.a.because there are limits on the number of such visas in each category and from each country,immigrants must often wait many years for a permanent residency visa,especially if they are from a country,like india,that sends a large number of immigrants to the united states.see dep t of state,bureau of consular affairs,visa bulletin.the immigrant place in line is set by the date that her alien labor certification was granted her priority date.e.if her i is approved,the alien becomes a lawful permanent resident and obtains a green card.as noted above,both a valid alien labor certification and a granted i petition are prerequisites for an i application to be granted.
originally,the alien labor certification and i petition were only valid while the applicant worked for the employer that had petitioned for and obtained both forms.the american competitiveness in the century act of ac,stat,however,created more flexibility for prospective immigrants.it included,among other provisions,portability provisions that state that if an individual application for adjustment of status has remained unadjudicated for days,the immigrant visa petition on her behalf will remain valid if she changes jobs or employers,so long as the job is in the same or a similar occupational classification as her original job.j ac c.the alien labor certification similarly remains valid for such an individual.a a iv ac c.
in essence,congress amendment of the ina with ac job flexibility portability provisions made clear that the adjustment of status process was no longer tied to a single employer during the time that the alien waits for a permanent residency visa to become available.under ac,the employer who takes steps one and two,the alien labor certification and petition for an immigrant visa,can differ from her employer at step three,when the immigrant is granted adjustment of status and a green card 
plaintiff ganga mantena is a citizen of india who first entered the united states in on an b visa petition filed by an initial employer.in,she left that initial employer and joined vision systems group,vsg,which obtained a new b visa on mantena behalf and agreed to sponsor her for a green card.
vsg obtained an alien labor certification for mantena in early and its petition on her behalf was also approved later that year.in july,mantena filed an i application for adjustment of status to permanent residency.because of the large number of permanent residency visa petitions for immigrants from india,her application was not reviewed for many years 
at the end of,two years after filing her,mantena availed herself of the ac portability provisions.there is no dispute that,at the time,mantena met both statutory criteria for portability.she had an unadjudicated i for the required amount of time,and her new job paralleled her old job.mantena sent a letter to uscis notifying the agency of her change in employment and requesting a continuation of her i processing.she also included a letter from her successor employer,cnc consulting,entitled request to substitute successor employer pursuant to section c of ac.this letter documented that mantena position with cnc was similar to her position with vsg and that her i had been pending for more than days.
nearly a year after mantena left vsg for her new job,the president of vsg pleaded guilty to mail fraud in connection with an immigration petition filed on behalf of a different vsg employee.as a consequence,uscis,believing that all vsg petitions may be fraudulent,initiated the revocation of all petitions filed by vsg and its associated entities app.
on june,uscis sent a notice of intent to revoke noir mantena i petition to vsg.the notice stated that vsg admission to fraud cast doubt on the reliability of information contained in vsg filings.uscis gave vsg thirty days in which to submit evidence in support of the i petition and in opposition to the revocation.
the noir was sent only to vsg,which mantena alleges was no longer in business at the time.in any event,the company neither responded nor informed mantena of the noir.and,on october,uscis revoked mantena i petition.mantena,who by this point had not worked for vsg for three years,was given no notice of the revocation.
because the approval of the i petition filed on mantena behalf was no longer considered valid,uscis denied mantena i application on november.this appears to be the first mantena heard of any problems in its i denial,uscis explained that the approval of the i visa petition has been revoked on the basis of fraud and misrepresentation.app.
administrative appeals 
mantena filed multiple motions seeking to have the i denial reopened and reconsidered and the i revocation reversed.on the final motion,uscis rendered a comprehensive decision denying the motion 
in its denial,uscis first rejected mantena attempts to reopen the revocation of the i petition.citing a iii b,which states that the beneficiary of a visa petition is not an affected party for the petition,uscis maintained that mantena,as such a beneficiary,does not have standing to reopen the i revocation,nor does the portability amendments create such a standing or transfer the petitioner rights to mantena.app.emphasis added.
relying on b i,uscis further rejected mantena contention that uscis was obligated to give her notice of the adverse information underlying the i revocation before rejecting mantena i adjustment application.uscis took the position that because vsg,the affected party,was advised of the adverse information,the notification requirements of b were met.
district court 
mantena filed this lawsuit in the southern district of new york challenging both uscis revocation of the approved i petition and the subsequent denial of her i application.these actions,she asserted,violated the agency own regulations and deprived her of constitutional due process rights she also sought attorney fees.the government moved to dismiss mantena complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as to the i denial.b,and moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c on the remaining claims.
the district court dismissed mantena nonconstitutional claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,acting sua sponte with respect to her i claim.the district court also granted judgment on the pleadings against mantena on her due process claim and on her claim for fees.
mantena filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
when this court reviews the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo,accepting all material facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.liranzo united states,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.id.quoting aurecchione schoolman transp,cir.we review de novo a district court dismissal of a suit pursuant to a motion for judgment on the pleadings.see king am.airlines,cir burnette carothers,cir.in deciding a rule c motion,we apply the same standard as that applicable to a motion under rule b,accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.burnette,at.
at the outset of our review are two questions whether the ina statutory provisions,a b i ii,preclude judicial review of claims alleging procedural deficiencies by uscis in decisionmaking made pursuant to the secretary statutory discretion and although the district court dismissed this lawsuit based on question without reaching this issue,whether mantena has standing to bring these procedural claims.
subject matter jurisdiction 
the ina strips district courts of jurisdiction over several defined categories of immigration decisions,among them,with certain exceptions,any decision or action of the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the secretary of homeland security.a b ii.the district court interpreted this provision to apply to all aspects of the revocation of the i immigrant petition and the denial of the i application,including the procedures by which those decisions are made.
as discussed below,we hold that the district court was in error.although the statute strips jurisdiction over a substantive discretionary decision,section does not strip jurisdiction over procedural challenges.and,as mantena contends,uscis erred procedurally as it a violated its own regulations by providing insufficient notice of the revocation to vsg the initial petitioner and b failed to give notice of the revocation either to her or to her new employer.
the district court held that revocation of an employment visa petition such as occurred here is in the discretion of the secretary of homeland security,thereby stripping the court of jurisdiction.the revocation statute,provides the secretary of homeland security may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any i petition examining this language,we have stated,in dicta,that the substance of the decision that there should be a revocation is committed to the discretion of the secretary.firstland int l,cir most of our sister circuits,with only the ninth circuit disagreeing,have held that the statute confers discretion to the secretary.see karpeeva dep t of homeland sec.citizenship immigration servs.ex rel.dhs sec y,app x,cir accord green napolitano,f d,cir abdelwahab frazier,cir ghanem upchurch,cir jilin pharm.usa,chertoff,cir el khader monica,cir.but see ana,way,cir finding restrictions on the secretary discretion.
but the actual issue here is a different one.regardless of whether the substantive revocation decision is shielded from judicial review,no party has provided authority to suggest that the procedure surrounding the substantive decision is similarly shielded.we hold that it is not,particularly where the procedural requirements are codified in statute or in regulations.
it is an abecedarian principle of administrative law that agencies must comply with their own regulations.manguriu lynch,cir.this principle is applicable in the context of proceedings to revoke a visa petition.id.accordingly,our court has held that compliance with regulations establishing procedural requirements is not within the discretion of the attorney general,so the ina provision does not apply.sharkey quarantillo,cir.similarly,the eleventh circuit,also considering an i revocation,has noted that if uscis failed to follow the correct procedure in revoking the i petitions,that failure was not within uscis discretion.kurapati bureau of citizenship immigration,cir.section a b ii thus does not prevent judicial review of the conduct of the administrative proceedings.id 
indeed,our own decision in firstland stands for the principle that the secretary may well not have complete discretion over the procedure for making a decision,even if the substantive decision falls within his discretion.in that case,we addressed a statutory provision that required notice before a revocation could occur.that notice requirement bound the discretion of the attorney general revocation decision a lthough the substance of the decision that there should be a revocation is committed to the discretion of the attorney general mandatory notice requirements must be met in order for the revocation to be effective,and courts retain jurisdiction to review whether those requirements have been met.firstland,at emphasis added.
the government urges us not to follow firstland and kurapati because mantena does not identify a statute or regulation that explicitly supports her right to notice.given that absence,the government contends,the process must be discretionary.this argument is unavailing.first,it ignores the fact that mantena challenges the sufficiency of notice to vsg,a notice that is explicitly required by regulation.moreover,and more important,a court can not determine whether uscis complied with the procedural requirements of the applicable regulations and statutes without determining what these statutes and regulations require.and it is precisely a determination of what the relevant statutes and regulations mandate that mantena seeks.
it follows that,even if no notice requirements were ultimately found to exist,the district court would still have been wrong to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the proper course,under such circumstances,would be to find subject matter jurisdiction and then as the government also argues find that the plaintiff had no right to the asserted procedural safeguards,and,therefore,had provided no claim upon which relief could be granted 
finally,the government argues that the repeal of the particular statutory notice requirement at issue in firstland indicates a congressional intent to leave all procedures in the discretion of the secretary.in,congress did in fact remove a particular notice requirement obliging uscis to provide notice of revocation to specific alien beneficiaries of immigrant visa petitions before those aliens commenced their journey to the united states.see intelligence reform terrorism prevention act of,stat,c.but the deletion of this specific statutory notice requirement applicable only to a subgroup of revocations can not be read as evincing an intent to abrogate all other notice requirements.
if congress wishes to grant the secretary full discretion to use whatever procedures he wishes,including arbitrary ones,it must say so explicitly.it can not simply assume that courts will read the abrogation of a particular notice requirement as making a much broader and dramatic change by implication.see furlong shalala,cir noting the rebuttable presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action.
we therefore conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to determine whether uscis complied with those procedural requirements,including notice,that were mandated before it could revoke mantena employer i petition.we appreciate the possibility that even had whatever notice was required been given,mantena fate might have been the same,and that,at that point,the substance of the revocation might be exempt from judicial review.but we hold that such a possibility does not change the procedural requirements of the revocation or mantena ability to challenge,in federal court,whether those requirements were met.
the district court dismissal,on subject matter jurisdiction grounds,of mantena claims pertaining to her i is similarly misguided.even the government concedes on appeal that the district court had jurisdiction to review mantena i claims.gov t brief.the discretionary power to deny an i application,rooted in,clearly lies within the language of a b.this reads n o court shall have jurisdiction to review i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section of this title a b i.yet,again,as in the i case,and for analogous reasons,although the substantive revocation power is shielded from judicial review,the same can not be said of the procedural requirements that led to the revocation.
the government vigorously contests mantena standing to address the sufficiency of the notice that was given to vsg,mantena former employer.since the district court dismissed the case pursuant to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,it did not reach the question of standing.in the interest of judicial economy on remand,however,we reach the issue and hold that mantena has article iii and prudential,as well as statutory,standing to raise her claims in the federal courts.
to have article iii standing,mantena must demonstrate an that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant and that can likely be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife.
mantena pled an that would be traceable to failed notice.the revocation of mantena employer i petition and subsequent automatic denial of her i application ended mantena multiyear attempt to secure a green card.if vsg was the only party entitled to notice of mantena i revocation,then even inadequate notice to vsg would have foreclosed any opportunity for mantena to be notified and to provide evidence to uscis in opposition to the revocation of vsg i petition.similarly,if mantena or perhaps her successor employer had been notified of the impending revocation,she would have had an alternative means to be aware of and challenge the pending revocation,regardless of whether vsg notice was adequate.but neither mantena nor cnc were notified.it follows that mantena suffered an,from a holding that only vsg had a right to notice.
as for redressability,even if uscis ultimately decides not to grant mantena a green card,the lost opportunity is itself a concrete a favorable decision would redress it.patel citizenship immigration,cir.see also abboud,cir this lost opportunity represents a concrete injury to abboud that is traceable to uscis conduct and remediable by a favorable decision in this case.shalom pentecostal church acting sec y dep t of homeland,cir finding constitutional and statutory standing to challenge i revocation and noting that redressability,in the context of proceedings should be based on the availability of relief at a given step,rather than the likelihood of achieving the ultimate goal.
prudential standing may impose two additional limitations to the constitutional requirements the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights and the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.lexmark int l,static control components,internal quotation mark omitted 
the continued viability of these prudential standing factors,has,however,been questioned.in passing,the supreme court has recently said that a court can not limit a cause of action that congress has created merely because prudence dictates.id.at.but because mantena satisfies the two traditional requirements of prudential standing,we need not address the continued viability of these requirements.mantena claims can not be considered generalized grievances nor is the bar on a litigant raising another person legal rights implicated.again,had mantena or her successor employer been notified of the impending revocation,a court might have rightfully expressed concern regarding mantena raising another person vsg legal rights.but this concern is inapplicable here.
the government argues,apart from constitutional and prudential standing,that the regulations also deprive mantena of standing in federal court.at the end of mantena administrative appeals,in its final decision to mantena,uscis wrote that a s the beneficiary,you are not an affected party in that matter of the i revocation and do not have standing to reopen it,nor does create such a standing or transfer the petitioner rights to you.app.uscis based its conclusion on the following regulation 
for purposes of this section and and of this part,affected party in addition to the service means the person or entity with legal standing in a proceeding.it does not include the beneficiary of a visa petition.
significantly,however,this regulation was promulgated a decade prior to congress passing of ac in.see appeals,precedents,certifications and motions,may.and the federal register notice from explains the beneficiary exclusion from the definition of party by noting that a visa petition proceeding has long been a proceeding between the petitioner and the service.id.at.consequently,it declares that t he beneficiary of the petition does not have any standing in such a proceeding.id.the federal register then cites to a bia decision,matter of sano,which points back to the aforementioned regulatory framework.brief for american immigration council and american immigration lawyers association as amici curiae.
notably,this whole administrative structure appears currently to be up for review.the administrative appeals office of uscis recently issued a call for amicus briefing to further study the application of a iii b.see uscis admin.appeals office aao,request for amicus brief posted april,specifically,the aao seeks briefing,in light of lexmark,on whether the beneficiaries of certain immigrant visa petitions have standing to participate in the administrative adjudication process,including standing to appeal to the aao.id.
in any event,the fact that mantena may not have satisfied uscis definition of legal standing before the agency does not mean she does not have standing to bring this lawsuit in federal court.as one of our sister circuits has concluded,the regulatory definition of affected party does not preclude the beneficiary from having standing in the district court,as it relates to who has the ability to challenge the administrative denial of a petition.kurapati,at 
we agree.what is determinative is that mantena falls within the zone of interests protected by the statute,which conveys congress intent to grant individuals such as mantena the right to sue under the statute in federal court.the text of the ina leaves no doubt that the interests of visa petition applicants are directly related to the purposes of the ina.shalom,at.t he portability provisions j and a a iv likewise reflect a congressional intent to protect the interests of qualified aliens.patel citizenship immigration,cir.it follows that to the extent that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear such arguments,qualified aliens have standing to bring these arguments to our courts.
the district court,having dismissed mantena statutory and regulatory claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,did not address the merits of her contention that she,or her current employer,should have been given notice of the government intention to review the validity of vsg i petition.since we have concluded,instead,that jurisdiction exists in the federal courts to hear mantena claims,and that she has standing in our courts to raise her claims,we must now turn to the substance of these claims.mantena maintains that notice is needed both as a statutory and constitutional requirement.because we find below that the ina,as amended by ac,requires some form of such notice for beneficiaries,at least as to those aliens who have notified uscis of their change in employment,we need not and hence will not address her constitutional arguments.since defining the exact contours of the statutory requirement would,however,benefit from further briefing and perhaps factfinding,we will remand to the district court for consideration in the first instance of these contours,and also to determine whether further remand to the aao is appropriate in this regard.karedes ackerley.cir.
the regulations governing i revocation require two forms of notice before a revocation such as mantena can occur.they first mandate that r evocation of the approval of a petition be made only on notice to the petitioner or,who must be given the opportunity to offer evidence in support of the petition or and in opposition to the grounds alleged for revocation of the approval.b.second,after revocation,uscis shall provide the petitioner with a written notification of the decision that explains the specific reasons for the revocation.c.when a pre porting requirements clearly ran only to the alien original and only employer,the filer of the petition.
in that world,an employee would have needed a new immigrant visa petition i by a new employer for any new employment to serve as the basis for adjustment of status.the petitioner of the i had to remain the alien employer until the alien adjustment of status application was decided and would therefore maintain a relationship with the petition beneficiary the alien all the way through the adjudication of the i.this situation left employees essentially tethered to particular jobs for the duration of uscis processing,which were marked by long delays.but it also meant that notice to the original employer would adequately serve to inform the alien employee.
the statutory portability provisions,j and a a iv,changed all this.in a porting world,no such relationship between the alien and the original employer necessarily exists,as mantena case so aptly demonstrates.mantena had not been employed with vsg for years when notice of intent to revoke was issued upon that allegedly defunct company.the question at issue is therefore how to read the notice regulations in light of the statutorily permitted indeed encouraged changed relationship of a employee to the original petitioner.
congress manifestly envisioned,and hoped to promote,the development of these supplanting interests through its portability amendments to the ina.to make its intent clear,congress explicitly titled one of the portability provisions job flexibility for long delayed applicants for adjustment of status to permanent residence.j.
the job flexibility that congress encouraged was designed to benefit not only the employee,but also employers.by virtue of the portability provisions,employers who hoped to attract foreign national employees by sponsoring them to become permanent residents based on a permanent job offer could avoid bureaucratic delay.under the statute,as congress recognized,such employers would be able to attract skilled workers with aspirations of permanent residency by relying on a prior employer filings.see,in the information age,when skilled workers are at a premium,america faces a serious dilemma when employers find that they can not grow,innovate,and compete in global markets without increased access to skilled personnel.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of lofgren noting that ac does things that are important in reforming the permanent side of the immigration system which is almost broken because of bureaucratic delay and allows for portability of h status as well as portability of i and labor certifications brief for american immigration council and american immigration lawyers association as amici curiae.
given portability,however,the alien employees and the successor employers who take advantage of earlier filings by other employers are frequently the only parties with any interests in the originally filed labor certifications and i petitions.by employing mantena,cnc had,in a crucial sense,adopted vsg i petition.the revocation of vsg i petition mattered little if anything to vsg,which no longer employed mantena and might not even remain in existence.it may well have mattered crucially to cnc.
in such a world,who then is the proper recipient of the notice mandated by the regulations we believe it can not be a party who no longer has any interest in the matter.because the portability provisions altered the parties who have an interest in opposing the revocation of a ported i petition,we believe that the regulations must be read to require notice to the real parties in interest.that is,the regulations,which were originally written to inform the parties in interest,only parse today if mantena or cnc is entitled to notice of intent to revoke.
relying solely on notice to vsg effectively precluded mantena from being notified until it was too late to act,until her adjustment of status application was consequentially denied.more broadly,limiting the notice to the original petitioner precludes the new employer,the one who has,under the portability provisions,been allowed to adopt the original i petition,from asserting its interest in the matter.and this runs directly against the aim of the statutory amendments.by placing beneficiaries and successor employers in a position of either blind faith in the original petitioner goodwill and due diligence or a forced and continued relationship with the and perhaps antagonistic original petitioner,such a scheme would completely undermine the aims of job flexibility that those amendments sought to create.king burwell,interpreting a statutory scheme to avoid problems that congress designed the act to avoid berman llc,cir deferring to an sec regulation endeavoring to harmonize statutory provisions that are in tension.
the government counters that the ac porting regime does not alter the notice requirements in any way.the regulations are unchanged textually,and the government points to the regulation defining affected party,a iii b,which expressly excludes a beneficiary as an affected party.but the government makes no argument as to why the notice regulation and the affected party regulations should be read in conjunction.in other words,the fact that the alien employee is not an affected party under that regulation does not necessarily mean that the alien employee is not a beneficiary of the notice requirements.much more important,the government argument does not consider the possibility that the new employer,after the adoption of the statutory portability provisions of ac,must,contextually,be treated as the affected party at least for purposes of notice.
the affected party regulation is a remnant of the regime,and,we believe,it must be read as such.the regulation,promulgated ten years prior to ac,noted that a visa petition proceeding has long been a proceeding between the petitioner and the service.appeals,precedents,certifications and motions,may.ac,however,allows beneficiaries to sever ties from the original petitioner and move to new employment,with their new employers relying on the original petitioner i.mantena and her new employer were permitted to and in fact relied on the i petition of mantena former employer,who no longer had ties to mantena.because mantena new employer was permitted to adopt the i petition made by her prior employer,it only makes sense that the subsequent employer be treated as the de facto petitioner and thus entitled to adequate notice in cases of visa petition revocations.this should especially be the case here,where mantena and her successor employer wrote to uscis explicitly seeking to substitute the new employer for vsg 
we need not,however,go so far today.we only hold here that uscis acted inconsistently with the statutory portability provisions of ac by providing notice of an intent to revoke neither i to an alien beneficiary who has availed herself of the portability provisions to move to a successor employer nor ii to the successor employer,who is not the original i petitioner,but who,as contemplated by ac,has in effect adopted the original i petition.and,in so holding,we recognize that,in some contexts,these beneficiary and successor employer entities may be one and the same,since uscis permits beneficiaries to port to.
we leave open,for the moment,the precise way to read the notice regulations in the light of ac.that is,the question of who is entitled to notice,whether the beneficiary or the successor employer,we leave to the district court to decide in the first instance on remand to the district court,we encourage supplemental briefing regarding the precise statutory origins and requirements of the regulations establishing the noir in i revocation proceedings,particularly with regard to both the administrative procedure act and ina.such a more thorough briefing can shed further light on how to read the regulation so that it best comports with the notice requirements implicit in,but nonetheless mandated by,ac.
in doing this,the district court may consider remanding to the aao for it to address the question in the light of its particular expertise in the matter.see lugo holder,cir remanding to the bia where the court would benefit from the administrative body precedential opinion and expertise ay holder,cir per curiam remanding to the bia to address statutory question in light of the administrative body expertise.
constitutional claim 
because we believe that the statutory scheme requires notice of the revocation to parties beyond the original petitioner,we need not consider whether,despite the doubts cast by many courts on the liberty and property interests implicated in an immigrant visa,a lack of notice would violate the constitutional procedural due process requirements.our reading of the effect of the portability provisions allows us to avoid addressing this potentially problematic constitutional question.
conclusion 
mantena immigration ordeal highlights the barriers that,fifteen years after the passage of legislation,still impede congress intent to provide flexibility to workers seeking immigrant status and to those employers seeking to hire such skilled workers.for the reasons set forth above,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.this panel retains jurisdiction of the case for purposes of any future appeals.
the government,in its brief,imprecisely describes the process as applying when a united states employer seeks to permanently employ a and then proceeds to characterize the first step as when the employer must apply for an alien labor certification.gov t brief emphasis added.as described above,after ac,the implication that the employer is necessarily one entity throughout the entire process no longer holds true.

vsg fraudulent conduct similarly constitutes the genesis of a case working its way through our sister circuit and raising the same issue of a beneficiary original i revocation notice rights.musunuru holder,d.the district court in musunuru found,as we do here,that uscis procedural compliance was subject to judicial review,even if the substantive revocation was not,and that the alien possessed both article iii and prudential standing.it concluded,however,that employee beneficiaries,including employees,are not entitled to notice.id.at.musunuru appeal is currently before the seventh circuit.
while it is not clear from the record when she first heard of the revocation,mantena asserts that she learned of the i revocation only by filing a freedom of information act foia request on february.
in doing so,uscis acknowledged that an earlier dismissal,based on mantena neither provid ing new evidence,provid ing precedent decisions to consider,nor establish ing that the decision was incorrect based upon the evidence of record at the time,administrative record,was not entirely correct,app.
mantena actually began this suit before uscis responded to her final motion to reopen which had challenged uscis earlier denial.after receiving uscis final decision,she filed an amended complaint,which is before us.
at the time of firstland,the discretion lay with the attorney general,but it now lies with the secretary of homeland security.
in contrast,the eighth circuit has for some time seemingly taken the position that where the statute places the substance of a decision in the attorney general discretion,regulations or agency practice will not make the decision reviewable.rajasekaran hazuda,cir internal quotation mark omitted quoting abdelwahab frazier,cir.accordingly,in rajasekaran,the eighth circuit has very recently held that a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider whether uscis failed to comply with regulatory procedural requirements prior to revoking a beneficiary i visa petition.rajasekaran,at.
the government further argues that the statute inclusion of the words or action,not just decision,indicates congressional intent to remove jurisdiction over all questions arising from a discretionary decision,both procedural and substantive.this reading,however,runs counter to the approach we took in firstland,to which we adhere today.
in lexmark,the supreme court removed a third requirement from the standing analysis that the plaintiff fall within the of a statute.the court defined the zone of interests test as a merits question concerning the definition of the cause of action,id.at,and not a standing issue.

the third circuit has also indicated its unwillingness to assume that the regulatory definition precludes standing in federal court.shalom,at stating that e ven assuming that a iii b applies outside the context of administrative proceedings,plaintiff still had standing in an article iii court emphasis added.however,in shalom,the third circuit found that the particular plaintiff fell outside the purview of the regulatory exclusion,obviating the need to take a stronger stance on the excl
