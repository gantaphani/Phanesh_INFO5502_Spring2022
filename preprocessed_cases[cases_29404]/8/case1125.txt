a statute of limitations creates a time limit for suing in a civil case,based on the date when the claim accrued.by contrast,a statute of repose puts an outer limit on the right to bring a civil action,measured not from the date on which the claim accrues but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant in essence an absolute bar on a defendant temporal liability.
this appeal concerns the latter,relatively rare species of limitations period specifically,the principal questions presented are the following what statute of repose applies to section a of the securities exchange act of the act,a,and when does that statute of repose begin to run 
in conjunction with securities and exchange commission sec rule,a,section a prohibits solicitation made by means of any proxy statement containing any statement which is false or misleading with respect to any material fact.section a do es not expressly provide a private right of action,but t he supreme court has recognized an implied private right of action for injury caused by its violation.because the private right of action in section a is implied and not express,it is no surprise that a statute of repose is not to be found in its text.w e are therefore faced with the awkward task of discerning the limitations period that congress intended courts to apply to a cause of action it really never knew existed.
we have taken up this task before,some years ago.in ceres partners gel associates,cir,we concluded that the implied private rights of action in section were analogous to the express private rights of action in sections f and a of the act,f a in large part because these actions share common goals we then borrowed the statutes of repose applicable to sections f and a at the time,and applied them to section 
approximately years after we decided ceres,however,congress passed the sarbanes oxley act of sox,stat.section b of sox,now codified at b,extended to five years the statute of repose applicable to certain private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance.section b thus necessitates a reexamination of our holding in ceres.because in that case we borrowed the statutes of repose then applicable to sections f and a and applied them to section,we must determine whether sections f,a,or a provide private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance,to which a statute of repose would now apply.
we hold that sections f and a do indeed provide private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance,to which a statute of repose now applies by virtue of the enactment of sox,but that section a does not provide such a private right of action.accordingly,borrowing the statute of repose applicable to sections f and a and applying it to section is no longer appropriate,because doing so would frustrate,rather than effect,congress objectives in enacting the securities laws.
we therefore hold that the same statutes of repose we applied to section in ceres,the statutes of repose that,until congress passed sox,applied to sections f and a still apply to section a today.we further hold that,like all statutes of repose,the statutes of repose applicable to section a begin to run on the date of the defendant last culpable act or omission.
primarily for these reasons,we affirm the march,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lorna schofield,judge,dismissing the section a claim asserted by dekalb county pension fund dekalb as by the applicable statutes of repose,and dismissing dekalb claim under section a of the act,a,for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
background 
on october,globalsantafe gsf,an offshore oil and gas drilling contractor,and transocean transocean,one of the largest international providers of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas,jointly disseminated a proxy statement concerning a proposed merger between the companies the proxy statement included numerous representations regarding transocean compliance with various environmental laws,its training and safety programs,and its equipment maintenance,among other subjects gsf shareholders,including dekalb,approved the merger at a november,shareholder meeting pursuant to the merger terms,dekalb exchanged each of its gsf shares for transocean shares and a cash payment 
at the time of the merger,transocean owned various offshore rigs throughout the world including the deepwater horizon,which exploded on april,causing the worst oil spill in history.in the wake of the deepwater horizon disaster,transocean stock lost more than half of its value 
on september,bricklayers and masons local union,ohio pension fund bricklayers filed a complaint against transocean,as well as robert long and jon marshall,the chief executive officers of transocean and gsf,respectively,at the time of the merger bricklayers alleged that the proxy statement disseminated in advance of the merger contained false and material statements and omissions regarding transocean dangerously lax safety protocols for oil drilling and reoccurring issues with its blowout preventer technology,in violation of section a 
dekalb made its first appearance in the action on december,when it filed a motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff the district court subsequently appointed as lead plaintiff the dekalb bricklayers group,which dekalb and bricklayers had formed together in light of their respective financial stakes in the litigation and their mutual dedication to the prosecution of the action on behalf of the named class.
on april,the dekalb bricklayers group filed an amended complaint,in which it asserted violations of section a,rule,and section a section a establishes secondary liability for every person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person directly liable under the act to state a claim of control person liability under section a,a plaintiff must show,inter alia,a primary violation by the controlled person.
on march,the district court dismissed bricklayers from the action for lack of standing,finding that it had failed to proffer any facts showing that it was eligible to vote on the merger or that it retained its transocean stock after the deepwater horizon disaster this dismissal left dekalb as the sole lead plaintiff.dekalb filed a second amended complaint on april,in which it again asserted section a,rule,and section a claims 
on august,filed a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss dekalb section a claim on the ground that it was by the applicable statutes of repose,which motion the district court granted on march,in granting the motion,the district court borrowed the statutes of repose that applied to sections f and a before the passage of sox and applied them to dekalb section a claim,but did not address whether sox had extended section f or section a statutes of repose to five years,apparently assuming that it had not the district court did,however,reject dekalb argument that b applies directly to section a the district court also held that the applicable statutes of repose began to run on october,the date on which gsf and transocean jointly disseminated the allegedly false and misleading proxy statement that the statutes of repose therefore required dekalb to have filed its section a claim before october,and that dekalb section a claim was consequently,inasmuch as dekalb did not even appear in the action until december,approximately two months after the deadline had passed the district court also held that,because a section a claim is necessarily predicated on a primary violation of securities law,the dismissal of dekalb section a claim necessarily mean t the dismissal of dekalb section claim as well.dekalb timely appealed 
discussion 
we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,accepting as true the factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff favor.
i.the three year statutes of repose that applied to sections f and a before the passage of sox continue to apply to section a 
before turning to the question of whether b applies to sections f,a,or a,it will be helpful to briefly describe our decision in ceres,given its importance to our inquiry.
in ceres,the plaintiff alleged violations of section b,b,section d,d,and section e,e,all of the act,as well as sec rule,b as in this case,the plaintiff brought those claims pursuant to implied private rights of action the two questions presented on appeal were whether those claims should be governed by a uniform federal limitary period,instead of whatever statute of repose applied to the most analogous state statute and if so,what that period should be answering the first question in the affirmative,we moved to the second 
we began by explaining that the act provides for a number of private actions,including those under sections f and a,and that the goal of these sections,as for section b,is to ensure full disclosure,to prohibit conduct recognized as manipulative and deceptive,and to give the sec the authority to take steps to counter other conduct having the same effect.thus,the actions available under the act share common goals.we then observed that the express private rights of action found in sections f and a,for which a statute of repose was provided,are closely related to the right of action implied under section b and rule,and that there is also a permissible overlap between actions under section b and those under section of the securities act of the act,to which a statute of repose also applied finally,because sections d and e of the act are similarly provisions designed to ensure that security holders receive full disclosure,they substantially overlap sections and a and rule as well accordingly,we concluded that since congress has provided in sections f and a express rights of action that so substantially overlap the rights of action implied under sections b and,and has provided a limitations period with respect to those express rights,the specified period provides a far more appropriate analogy than do state statutes devoted to different types of claims.
thus,to summarize,we analogized the implied private rights of action in sections b and of the act to the express private rights of action in sections f and a of the act and section of the act,on the basis of the common goals that these actions share.we then borrowed the statutes of repose applicable to the express private rights of action and applied them to the implied private rights of action.notably,however,we did not take a position regarding to which of the express rights of action the implied rights of action were most similar.that is,we did not decide whether sections b and were more like section f,section a,or section.of course,there was no need for us to do so at the time,sections f,a,and all had statutes of repose.
it also bears mentioning that the supreme court expressed its approval of ceres in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d.in lampf,the supreme court took up the question of which statute of repose is applicable to a private suit brought pursuant to section b and rule just as we had in ceres,the court looked to sections f and a for its answer,as those sections target the precise dangers that are the focus of section b.according to the court,all three sections were intended to facilitate a central goal to protect investors against manipulation of stock prices through regulation of transactions upon securities exchanges and in markets,and to impose regular reporting requirements on companies whose stock is listed on national securities exchanges.additionally,the court noted that,i n adopting the act,congress also amended the limitations provision of the act,adopting a statute of repose for each cause of action contained therein.
thus,the court found,there can be no doubt that the se contemporaneously enacted express remedial provisions represent a federal statute of repose actually designed to accommodate a balance of interests very similar to that at stake in section b and rule the court therefore agree d with every court of appeals that ha d been called upon to apply a federal statute of limitations to a section b claim that the express causes of action contained in the and acts provide the appropriate statute of repose,and the court cited ceres in support of that conclusion 
section b applies to section f 
we now turn to the question of whether b applies to section f.although neither the supreme court nor we have previously addressed this issue,several lower courts have suggested that it does these decisions are sound.while it is true that b did not expressly repeal the limitations period in section f,an implied repeal will be found where provisions in two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict.this standard accurately describes the relationship between b and section f.
as noted,b applies to a private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance.in view of this language,we agree with the third and fourth circuits that,at a minimum,congress clearly intended it to apply to claims requiring proof of fraudulent intent.a claim arising under section f,the statutory provision that governs securities price manipulation claims,is exactly that,as it contain s requirements of both manipulative motive and willfulness.thus,the statutes of repose contained in b and section f both purport to apply to section f,but prescribe different periods of time.as such,they are in irreconcilable conflict,and the later statute to the extent of the conflict therefore constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one.
relying primarily on a single sentence from a senate judiciary committee report,other lower courts have suggested that b was not intended to conflict with existing limitations periods for any express private rights of action under the federal securities laws such as section f,but was instead intended to apply only to express private rights of action lacking limitations periods or to implied private rights of action such as section b as the supreme court has repeatedly held,however,the authoritative statement is the statutory text,not the legislative history or any other extrinsic material.in fact,the court has cast a wary eye on the specific type of report on which these decisions were based 
j udicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports,which are not themselves subject to the requirements of article i,may give unrepresentative committee members or,worse yet,unelected staffers and lobbyists both the power and the incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text 
what is more,the particular report in question seems to be especially unreliable.the specific sentence therefrom on which these lower courts relied was preceded by the following introduction 
we believe current law likely provides an adequate length of time in which people who have been defrauded can file suit regrettably,the sponsors of the original senate version of the bill prevailed in their effort to extend the current statute of repose,and we would like to clarify our understanding of the intended parameters of that extension 
in other words,the sentence that formed the basis for these decisions appears to have been drafted by those senators who lost the battle to prevent b passage,and therefore may have been engaging in the type of strategic manipulations of legislative history against which the supreme court has warned,in an effort to curtail the effect of legislation they disfavored 
further,even if legislative history were driving our determination,there would be plenty of other evidence to counterbalance this language we need not,however,resort to any such evidence.c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.here,as discussed above,b speaks for itself by its terms,it applies to private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance,not some subset thereof 
section b applies to section a 
we next consider whether b applies to section a another issue that we have not previously addressed,and on which lower courts in our circuit have also split this question is more difficult to resolve,because unlike section f,section a does not require a plaintiff to plead or prove scienter but it does not necessarily follow that section a is not a private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance.
section b does not define fraud.as a result,we look to its meaning,because i t is a settled principle of interpretation that,absent other indication,congress intends to incorporate the meaning of the terms it uses.
the eighth edition of black law dictionary which is the edition published closest in time to the passage of defines fraud in pertinent part as follows.a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment.a misrepresentation made recklessly without belief in its truth to induce another person to act.the question,then,is whether section a involves a claim of a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment,or involves a claim of a misrepresentation made recklessly without belief in its truth to induce another person to act.focusing in particular on the second of these two formulations,we conclude that it does.
on its face,section a unquestionably involves a claim of a misrepresentation made to induce another person to act.and the supreme court has strongly indicated that,in order for a plaintiff to recover under section a,such a misrepresentation also must have been made recklessly without belief in its truth,at the very least.
in ernst ernst hochfelder,d,the court stated that section a contains a condition requiring something more than negligence,and that its legislative history suggests something more than negligence on the part of the defendant is required for recovery.relying on this language,we noted in ross robins,cir,that a party may not be held liable under section b unless he acted with scienter.it may well be that a similar requirement attaches to section liability.the supreme court used even stronger language in musick,peeler garrett employers insurance of wausau,d,in which it stated that section a involve s defendants who have violated the securities law with scienter contrasted section a with sections and of the act,and section of the act,which do not require scienter in all instances and described section a as prohibiting an intentional tort.
in light of the court statement that section a requires scienter,it is useful to define that term.for purposes of the securities laws,the supreme court has defined it as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.this definition corresponds almost exactly to b references to deceit,manipulation,and fraud.moreover,the supreme court has explained that the intent motivating section a is to deter fraud and manipulative practices in the securities markets,and we have explained that one of section a goals is to prohibit conduct recognized as manipulative and deceptive language that,like the definition of scienter,matches b references to fraud,manipulation and deceit.
we also think it significant that section a imposes liability unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading.the presence of this defense means that,as a practical matter,section a actions will generally involve proof of a defendant state of mind,and recovery will be permitted only where a defendant acted,at a minimum,recklessly.congress inclusion of this defense thus further demonstrates that it intended section a to reach only fraudulent misrepresentations,rather than negligent or innocent ones 
lastly,we have explicitly stated that section a create s a private right of action for various types of fraud,and we have described a violation of section a as fraud on at least one other occasion 
taken together,these factors lead us to join the fifth circuit in concluding that,like section f,section a is governed by b,the provision that codifies section b of sox a plaintiff asserting a section a claim is,in essence,asserting a fraud claim a fraud claim with respect to which the defendant,and not the plaintiff,uncharacteristically bears the burden of proof regarding scienter,but a fraud claim no less 
section b does not apply to section a 
the import of the foregoing analysis is that the landscape has fundamentally changed since we decided ceres.to recapitulate,in ceres,our primary points of reference for determining which statute of repose applies to section were the statutes of repose that applied to sections f and a before the passage of sox.but b has since extended those statutes of repose to five years 
thus,if we were to take the same analytical approach that we took in ceres to the question before us today,borrow the statutes of repose applicable to sections f and a the statute of repose applicable to section a would be five years.but this would be an absurd result,undeniably contrary to clearly expressed congressional intent,and would frustrate,rather than effect,congress objectives in enacting the securities laws.we would,essentially,be applying b to section a,albeit indirectly.and yet,congress has specified that b applies only to private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance,which section a does not 
confronted,then,with one of the inevitable difficult problems regarding the interplay of the act express and implied remedies that we predicted such a complex scheme of regulation would spawn,we resort to a simpler methodology.
we assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.thus,we presume that,when congress passed sox,it was aware of two features of the judicial background against which it was legislat ing ceres and many similar decisions borrowing the statutes of repose then applicable to sections f and a and applying them to section a and myriad decisions holding that l iability can be imposed under section a for negligently drafting a proxy statement.put differently,congress must have known that,by extending only the statute of repose applicable to private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance,the statutes of repose applicable to section a would remain intact.and from this knowledge,we conclude that congress affirmatively intended to preserve them we therefore hold that the same statutes of repose that we applied to section in ceres which are the statutes of repose that,until congress passed sox,applied to sections f and a still apply to section a today.
ii.the three year statutes of repose applicable to section a begin to run on the date of the defendant last culpable act or omission 
having concluded that section a repose period is not affected by b,we must now determine when that period begins to run.
the statute of repose previously applicable to section f stated that n o action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section,unless brought within three years after such violation,while the statute of repose previously applicable to section a stated that n o action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within three years after such cause of action accrued.in the case before us,dekalb argues that,because of this difference in language,we must choose between the two standards,and urges us to pick section a accrual standard rather than section f violation standard according to dekalb,its section a claim is timely under the accrual standard,because it accrued on april,the date the deepwater horizon disaster revealed that transocean had systematically violated numerous health,safety and environmental laws on the deepwater horizon drilling rig and on a basis.
dekalb cites lampf,arguing that it requires us to determine which section is most analogous to section a and then to apply that section repose language to section a.we are not persua
