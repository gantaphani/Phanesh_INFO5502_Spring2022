in this appeal from a dismissal of a defamation suit,we address whether rule of the federal rules of civil procedure requires a public figure to plead in a plausible way that defendants acted with actual malice.we conclude that it does.we therefore affirm the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york oetken,dismissing plaintiff peter paul biro complaint on the ground that he failed to plead sufficient facts to give rise to a plausible inference of actual malice.we dispose of biro remaining arguments on appeal in a separate summary order filed simultaneously with this opinion 
background 
this defamation suit involves a july article the article written by journalist david grann and published by the new yorker the article focused on biro,a controversial figure known in the art world for using fingerprint analysis to authenticate art in an effort to insert a measure of objectivity into a previously subjective process.the article raised questions about the trustworthiness of biro methods and his authentication of paintings.among other things,the article contained interviews of various individuals critical of biro,and it suggested that biro stood to profit from some of his more dubious authentications.to say the least,we agree with the district court observation that t here is little question that a reader may walk away from the article with a negative impression of biro.biro condé nast biro i,d.
the article was subsequently republished or referenced by various other defendants collectively,the republishers,including louise blouin media lbm in an interview published on its website the global fine art registry far and theresa franks in a series of online posts about biro ongoing defamation litigation paddy johnson on an art blog and the yale university press yup in a book it published that referred generally to a purported forensics expert without naming biro.
biro sued grann,condé nast,and advance collectively,the new yorker defendants as well as the republishers for defamation.biro generally alleged that each of the new yorker defendants either knew or believed or had reason to believe that many of the statements of fact in the article were false or inaccurate,and nonetheless published them,and that they acted with actual malice,or in reckless disregard of the truth,or both.biro sought to buttress his allegation of actual malice by further alleging that the new yorker defendants,among other things,failed to investigate and determine the validity of the allegedly defamatory statements relied on anonymous and biased sources and ignore d the many other works of art which plaintiff has worked with over the years,as well as his many satisfied clients.biro also alleged that grann had defamatory propensities.
turning to the republishers,biro generally alleged that lbm,far,franks,johnson,and yup acted with actual malice in that they knew or should have known that many of the statements of fact in the article were false,and that they published the statements notwithstanding that knowledge.in addition,biro alleged that lbm fail ed to remove the interview for one month johnson did not retract the alleged defamatory statements yup chose to publish the language notwithstanding that plaintiff had already sued others for defamation arising from the article and far and franks published the statements with ill will and malicious and evil intent to harm biro 
the district court held that biro had adequately alleged an actionable defamatory false statement of fact,or false implication,with respect to four sections of the article.biro i,d at.but the district court ultimately dismissed both the claims against the new yorker defendants related to those sections and the claims against the majority of the republishers on the ground that biro,as a public figure,failed to plead sufficient facts to give rise to a plausible inference of actual malice.see biro conde nast biro ii,d,biro conde nast biro iii,cv jpo,wl,at.in doing so,the district court relied on iqbal instruction that,where a particular state of mind is an element of a claim,rule requires that it be plausibly pleaded and supported by factual allegations.biro ii,d at citing ashcroft iqbal,see also atsi commc ns,shaar fund,f d,cir.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b or a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule c,accepting as true the factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff favor.see difolco msnbc cable,cir graziano pataki,cir.to survive either motion,a complaint must contain enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,see difolco,f d at rule b graziano,at rule c.a claim is plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.iqbal,at.but naked assertions or conclusory statements are not enough.id.quotation marks omitted.these federal pleading rules and standards,including the supreme court interpretation of rule,prevail in all civil actions,id.at quoting,including diversity litigation,see hanna plumer,cnty.of erie,colgan air,cir applying rule plausibility standard in an action based on diversity jurisdiction.
public figures who seek damages for defamatory statements must show that the statements were made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard as to their falsity.see,times sullivan,public officials curtis publ g butts,public figures lerman flynt distrib,cir public figures.in urging us to hold that he did not have to allege facts sufficient to render his allegations of actual malice plausible,biro notes that rule b allows malice to be alleged generally.b,and points to the district court observation that neither the supreme court nor the second circuit has precisely articulated the effect of iqbal and twombly on defamation cases,biro ii,d at.both observations may be true,but iqbal makes clear that,rule b language notwithstanding,rule plausibility standard applies to pleading intent.at.there,the supreme court held that rule b requires particularity when pleading fraud or mistake,while allowing malice,intent,knowledge,and other conditions of a person mind to be alleged generally,but does not give a plaintiff license to evade the less rigid though still operative strictures of rule.id.quotation marks omitted.it follows that malice must be alleged plausibly in accordance with rule.our sister circuits that have considered the issue agree.see,pippen nbcuniversal media,llc,cir states of mind may be pleaded generally,but a plaintiff still must point to details sufficient to render a claim plausible.mayfield ass for stock car auto racing,cir m alice must still be alleged in accordance with rule a plausible claim for relief must be articulated.schatz republican state leadership,cir t o make out a plausible malice claim,a plaintiff must still lay out enough facts from which malice might reasonably be inferred.in any event,we have long made clear that d efamation actions are,for procedural purposes,to be treated no differently from other actions,yiamouyiannis consumers union,cir,and biro fails to offer a persuasive reason why the pleading standard should differ in defamation cases generally or in the malice inquiry specifically.
biro relies on our decision in church of scientology international behar,in which we explained that resolution of the actual malice inquir y typically requires discovery,cir,to argue that it is impossible without discovery for a plaintiff to plead facts demonstrating that the claim of actual malice is plausible.we disagree.the hurdles to plausibly pleading actual malice,though significant given the first amendment interests at stake,are by no means insurmountable.see robert sack,sack on defamation at ed.it can hardly be ruled out that plaintiffs counsel will develop extrajudicial means of obtaining sufficient facts to plead actual malice with the degree of specificity required by iqbal and twombly,enabling the plaintiff to prevail on a
