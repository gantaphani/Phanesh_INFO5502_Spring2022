these cases call on us to clarify when prisoners are eligible to proceed in forma pauperis ifp.over the past several years,jos√© arzuaga,who is currently incarcerated at the corrigan correctional center in connecticut,filed three separate actions against prison officials under.although the district court initially granted arzuaga motion to proceed ifp,the district court later revoked arzuaga ifp status because arzuaga had received approximately in social security benefits that he had not reported to the district court.after arzuaga subsequently failed to pay the filing fees,the district court dismissed all three actions,prompting these appeals.
as the appellees now seem to concede,arzuaga social security benefits did not provide a basis for revoking his ifp status because the no social security benefits for prisoners act of barred arzuaga from accessing those benefits while incarcerated.see a b ii.we write primarily to address the appellees contention that the revocation of arzuaga ifp status should nonetheless be affirmed on alternative grounds.in may,after the three complaints were filed,arzuaga received a separate deposit of into his prisoner trust account and spent that money on consumer goods rather than filing fees.the appellees contend that by failing to apply these funds to filing fees,arzuaga made himself ineligible for ifp status.
we conclude that arzuaga complied with the provisions of the ifp statute even though he did not use the additional he received to pay filing fees.we also conclude that,contrary to an earlier order of this court dismissing one of arzuaga appeals as untimely,all three appeals were timely.accordingly,we exercise our authority to recall the mandate sua sponte in the dismissed appeal and reinstate that appeal.and because the district court erred by revoking arzuaga ifp status,we vacate the district court dismissals of all three actions,and remand these cases for further proceedings.
background 
between and,arzuaga filed three separate section actions against various prison employees.see arzuaga quiros,case cv,filed july,arzuaga i arzuaga faucher,case cv,filed may,arzuaga ii arzuaga cieboter,case cv,filed may,arzuaga iii.in all three cases,arzuaga moved for,and was granted,permission to proceed ifp.see arzuaga i docs,arzuaga ii docs,arzuaga iii docs.
in march,the defendants in arzuaga i and arzuaga iii separately moved to dismiss those cases pursuant to e a,arguing that arzuaga allegations of poverty were untrue because in january he had been awarded over in social security benefits.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga iii doc.in response,arzuaga contended that he did not have access to these benefits while incarcerated.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga iii doc.arzuaga also moved to amend his ifp motion in all three actions to reflect the social security benefits,and affirm that he possessed in his prisoner trust account.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga ii doc.arzuaga iii doc.
the district court denied the motions to dismiss,finding that arzuaga had not acted in bad faith by failing to disclose the social security benefits.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga iii doc.the district court also concluded,however,that those benefits allowed arzuaga to pay the filing fees,and thereby rendered him ineligible to proceed ifp.the district court therefore revoked arzuaga ifp status in all three cases,and ordered arzuaga to pay the filing fees or face dismissal of his actions.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga ii doc.arzuaga iii doc.arzuaga did not pay the filing fees.on october,the district court entered a text order dismissing arzuaga iii.arzuaga iii doc.similarly,on october,the district court entered text orders dismissing arzuaga i and arzuaga ii.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga ii doc.
arzuaga appealed all three dismissals by delivering notices of appeal to prison authorities on,at the latest,december,arzuaga then moved in the district court to proceed ifp on appeal.arzuaga i doc.arzuaga ii doc.arzuaga iii doc.in moving to proceed ifp on appeal,arzuaga cited,apparently for the first time,the no social security benefits for prisoner act of nssbpa,stat,which prohibits prisoners from accessing retroactive social security benefits.see x a b ii b a.after receiving supplemental briefing on this issue,the district court agreed with arzuaga that the nssbpa barred him from accessing his social security benefits,and thus could not make him ineligible for ifp status.see arzuaga i doc.arzuaga ii doc.
nonetheless,the district court denied arzuaga ifp status on appeal and held that its prior revocation of arzuaga ifp status in all three actions was justified on an alternative ground.on april and may,shortly after arzuaga sought leave to amend his ifp motions arzuaga received deposits totaling into his prisoner trust account.arzuaga did not inform the district court of these deposits,and instead spent to purchase a beard trimmer,a television,and a digital antenna.the district court stated that it did not consider these purchases to be necessities of life.see id.at quoting potnick eastern state hospital,cir for the proposition that no party applying for leave to proceed in forma pauperis must be made to choose between abandoning a potentially meritorious claim or foregoing the necessities of life.the district court therefore concluded that it would have revoked arzuaga in forma pauperis status apart from any issue relating to social security benefits.id.at.
for these same reasons,the district court also certified that arzuaga appeals were not not taken in good faith under a.although the district court acknowledged that its prior revocation of arzuaga ifp status was based on the social security benefits,rather than arzuaga receipt of the in april and may,the district court nonetheless concluded that arzuaga appeals were futile because an appellate court may affirm on any ground in the record.id.at 
arzuaga then moved in this court for ifp status on appeal.as to arzuaga i and arzuaga ii,a motions panel of this court granted arzuaga motions to proceed ifp on appeal.as to arzuaga iii,however,the motions panel concluded sua sponte that the appeal was untimely because the notice of appeal had been filed more than days after the district court dismissal of that action.the motions panel therefore dismissed arzuaga iii for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
ii.jurisdiction 
before turning to the merits of these appeals,we address the appellees contention that the arzuaga i and arzuaga ii appeals were also untimely,depriving us of appellate jurisdiction.generally,a notice of appeal in a civil case with no federal parties must be filed within days of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.fed.a.however,when a district court enters an order dismissing an action and fails to set out the judgment in a separate document,the day period to appeal begins to run days from the entry of the dispositive order.see.c fed.a see also perez ac roosevelt food,cir.this separate document must be separate from any judicial memorandum or opinion and must be labeled a judgment.silivanch celebrity cruises,cir.
here,the district court dismissed both arzuaga i and arzuaga ii by text orders entered on october.the district court,however,never entered either judgment in a separate document.under rule c,then,the day periods for appeals did not begin running until days after the dismissal of these actions,on march,so arzuaga notices of appeal were due by april.arzuaga certified that he delivered his notices of appeal to prison authorities on december,at the latest,and under the prison mailbox rule,his notices are considered filed on that date.see houston lack.these two appeals are thus timely.
this conclusion also requires us to revisit our dismissal of the arzuaga iii appeal as untimely.the district court dismissed arzuaga iii in a text order on october,but again did not enter a separate judgment.under rule c,arzuaga appeals period therefore did not begin to run until march,making his notice of appeal due by april.and as with arzuaga i and arzuaga ii,the arzuaga iii appeal was filed as of the date arzuaga delivered his notice of appeal to prison authorities,no later than december.contrary to our earlier conclusion,then,arzuaga iii was n
