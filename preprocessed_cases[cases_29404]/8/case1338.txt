claimant alon wallach appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,lewis kaplan,judge,ordering the forfeiture to plaintiff united states,pursuant to a,of certain devices,to wit,the twenty miljam ied jammers the jammers,owned by wallach and a company of which he was the majority shareholder and chief executive officer ceo.the district court dismissed wallach claim challenging the requested forfeiture,ruling that wallach lacked standing to interpose such a challenge because,following the dismissal of criminal charges against him,he had,inter alia,stipulated that he would not contest such a forfeiture.on appeal,wallach contends that the court erred in dismissing his claim,arguing principally that the stipulation he signed was void on the grounds that it was signed under duress and without consideration.for the reasons that follow,we disagree and affirm the judgment of the district court.

on march,wallach was arrested by agents of the department of homeland security,immigration and customs enforcement ice,and charged with attempting and conspiring to export items listed on the usml,to wit the jammers,without a license or other written authorization from the state department,in violation of b and.the criminal complaint,filed against him in the united states district court for the southern district of new york march complaint or criminal complaint,alleged that wallach and wireless had provided components to a company in new jersey nj company for the manufacture of the jammers and that the jammers were expected to be sold to nato,which had signed a purchase order for the jammers in february.see march complaint b c.it alleged that ddtc,in march,had denied the nj company an export license for the jammers on the ground that they could interfere with existing equipment being used by united states forces in afghanistan.see id.b.
the criminal complaint alleged that,after ddtc refused to grant the necessary export license to the nj company,wallach urged the nj company owner who was an ice confidential source cs to transfer the jammers to wallach possession so that wallach could sell them to a third party outside of the united states.see id.a,c.it alleged that wallach told the cs that wallach was willing to sell the miljam ied jammers to any third party who was willing to buy them.id.c.

c.the cs advised wallach that he should get an export license before shipping the miljam ied jammers overseas,and discussed the fact that an export license required the exporter to designate an end user.wallach proposed that he fabricate the name of the end user or simply mislabel the equipment as a civilian product.
wallach advised that the end users of the twenty miljam ied jammers in question might be in iraq,and that he had numerous customers in the middle east region.the cs asked wallach why he did not get an export license.wallach responded that he could not get one.
wallach asked the cs why he the cs did not sell the miljam ied jammers to overseas customers.the cs responded that he the cs could not get an export license.wallach then stated that this was why his customers came to him for the miljam ied jammers.
march complaint c e.
after the meetings on march between wallach and the cs,wallach was arrested.several days later,ice agents seized the jammers from the nj company warehouse.
the stipulation and the dismissal of the criminal complaint 
on july,on motion of the government,the criminal complaint against wallach was dismissed,without prejudice.on july,wallach and wireless entered into an agreement with the government that provided,in pertinent part,as follows 
whereas,on or about march,alon wallach wallach was arrested by special agents of the united states department of homeland security,immigration and customs enforcement ice,and thereafter charged in a criminal complaint,united states alon wallach,mag.criminal complaint,which was dismissed without prejudice on or about july,
whereas,on or about march,twenty miljam ied jammers the jammers were obtained by ice from the new jersey premises of integrated security solutions,llc,in connection with the investigation that gave rise to the criminal complaint 
whereas,wallach is the chief executive officer and majority owner of wireless avionics,
whereas,wallach and wireless avionics represent and agree that wallach and wireless avionics are the sole owners of the jammers by virtue of the assignment and release agreement dated march,entered into between integrated security solutions,llc and wireless avionics 
whereas,wallach and wireless avionics agree that they will not contest the forfeiture of the jammers to the united states.
it is hereby stipulated and agreed

wallach and wireless avionics are hereby barred from asserting any claim against the government,ice agents and employees of the government and ice in connection with wallach arrest on march,the acquisition possession of the jammers,including but not limited to any claim that there was no probable cause for his arrest no proper basis for the acquisition of the jammers by ice.
wallach and wireless avionics further agree to hold harmless the government,ice and any and all of the government ice agents and employees from any and all claims arising from any acts,incidents,or occurrences in connection with the acquisition possession of the jammers,including but not limited to any claims of ownership of the jammers.
this stipulation and release constitutes the complete agreement between the parties hereto and may not be amended except by written consent thereof.
stipulation and release dated july,stipulation,whereas and emphases added.the stipulation was executed by wallach on behalf of himself and wireless and by wallach defense attorney.
b.the forfeiture proceedings 
in october,the government filed its verified complaint in the present civil forfeiture action october complaint or forfeiture complaint,seeking a decree that the jammers seized by ice from the premises of the nj company on or about july,were forfeited to the united states pursuant to a.that section provides in pertinent part,as follows 
whenever an attempt is made to export or ship from or take out of the united states any articles in violation of law,the secretary of the treasury,or any person duly authorized for the purpose by the president,may seize and detain such articles all articles seized pursuant to this subsection shall be forfeited.
a emphasis added.
the forfeiture complaint alleged that the jammers had been seized in connection with the investigation that led to the criminal complaint against wallach alleging that he had attempted and conspired to export the jammers from the united states without having obtained from the state department a license or other written authorization for such export.see october complaint.the forfeiture complaint alleged that the criminal complaint had been dismissed without prejudice on july,and that on july,wallach and wireless entered into the stipulation,agreeing to the forfeiture of the jammers.see october complaint.
wallach filed a claim opposing the requested forfeiture.see statement of interest or right dated november,interest statement answer to civil complaint for forfeiture in rem dated december,answer or wallach answer.wallach asserted,inter alia,that ied jammers we re not listed in any usml category,and certainly not with miljam model number interest statement at emphases in original see answer at,first affirmative defense he argued that there was a misclassification that is a result of the misinterpretations of many people answer at,first affirmative defense and he contended that t he property should be returned to its lawful owner that did nothing wrong interest statement at.
wallach also challenged the validity of his stipulation.he asserted that 
t he stipulation agreement attached to this civil forfeiture complaint was signed by me under duress and is therefore void.i was held in the against my will without my passport when the criminal complaint was dismissed,after months of house arrest,and had no other choice but to sign it or risk another baseless charge.
see answer.his answer asserted also that the stipulation should not be considered valid because it had not been authorized by wireless directors and shareholders because the stipulation agreement is entirely one sided,giving no consideration whatsoever to wallach wireless avionics in return for the release of the defendant property and because wallach signed under extreme duress in order to prevent the failure of his business and to protect his marriage,his home,and his family.answer.wallach stated that he had been 
informed by his lawyer that the government would expect some kind of consideration for their loss of face in dismissing the criminal case outright.further he said to wallach that he should consider himself lucky to be extricated from his legal ordeal without a trial all this notwithstanding that wallach was completely innocent.since the government was still looking into the jammers issue,wallach lawyer convinced wallach that if he did not sign a stipulation agreement,the government would find another pretext for charging him with a civil charge that would in all likelihood keep wallach in the for additional months with incurrence of additional legal costs in the order of in legal fees.
in opposition to wallach claim,the government,pursuant to rule g of the supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions hereinafter forfeiture action rules,filed a motion to strike or for summary judgment on the ground that the stipulation deprived wallach of the legal interest in the jammers he needs under article iii of the constitution to contest the forfeiture of the jammers.memorandum of law of plaintiff united states of america in support of its motion to strike or for summary judgment government memorandum at.those rules provide,in pertinent part,that in a forfeiture action in rem arising from a federal statute,a claimant who establishes standing to contest forfeiture may move to dismiss the action,forfeiture action rule g b i emphasis added,and that the government may move to strike a claim or answer at any time before trial on the ground that the claimant lacks standing,id.rule g c i b.the government motion to strike may be in the form of one for summary judgment,see id.rule g c ii b and the motion must be decided before any motion by the claimant to dismiss the action,id.rule g c ii a.
the government attached to its motion,inter alia,the july,stipulation and quoted principally the fifth whereas paragraph and the paragraphs numbered and see part.above,in which wallach and wireless agreed that they would not assert any claim against the government in connection with the acquisition or possession of the jammers and agreed not to contest forfeiture of the jammers to the government.the government argued that the stipulation thus 
deprived wallach of the legal interest in the jammers he needs under article iii of the constitution to contest the forfeiture of the jammers.wallach should not now be allowed to set aside the agreement he signed with the government because he has had a change of heart.
government memorandum at.
in addition,the government attached to its motion an email sent by wallach to assistant united states attorney ausa david massey on september,wallach email.in that email,wallach sought massey help in obtaining papers and documents he need ed wallach email,in order to a have the ddtc mistake with respect to usml classification of his jammers correct ed id,and b pursue a civil suit against the cs see,id.noting that the stipulation he signed did not bar him from suing the cs or the cs companies see id,wallach discussed that stipulation,in part,as follows 
lev dassin,the acting district sic attorney of the southern district of new york signed a stipulation and release agreement with me,days after the case was dismissed.i did not have to sign it,and in fact i was practically free when i did sign.even if i would have signed,i could have left back home,and you should have even given me my jammers.this retroactive confiscation of the jammers was also illegal and a blow under the belt,but i agreed to it as well.
according to my attorney advice,i signed it after all,in order to get out of the in peace 
wallach email emphases added.and although accusing the government of acting negligently or maliciously in prosecuting him on the basis of information from the cs see,id,wallach stated,i have no intentions to put anyone from your department or ice in a difficult situation,and i will honor what i signed id.emphasis added.
thus,the government argued that wallach not only had waived any right to challenge forfeiture when he signed the stipulation in july,but also had reaffirmed that waiver,confirming the voluntary and counseled nature of his action,in his email to the government in september.the government therefore contended that 
wallach can not establish standing to contest the forfeiture because he abandoned his possessory and ownership interest in the jammers when he agreed not to contest the forfeiture nor can wallach show any injury to himself because he agreed to abandon his interest in the jammers the court should,therefore,strike wallach claim or grant the government summary judgment.
government memorandum at.
the government submitted a local civil rule statement of undisputed material facts in support of summary judgment,setting out,inter alia,the above statements by wallach.the government also gave wallach,as a pro se litigant,notice of the nature of a motion for summary judgment and the effect of failing to make a proper response,see vital interfaith medical center,cir.
wallach opposed the government motion,submitting,inter alia,a claimant opposition to plaintiff motion to strike or for summary judgment,dated february,wallach opposition memorandum,and a supporting affidavit dated february,affidavit or wallach aff.in these papers,aside from outlining the background of his commercial efforts and the controversy between him and the companies with which he had been dealing see wallach aff,and describing the course of the criminal case see id,wallach principally reiterated his contention that he had signed the stipulation under duress see,id.c,wallach opposition memorandum at.in response to the government rule statement,wallach admitted that he had signed the stipulation and that he had sent the email attached to the government moving papers but he argued that his statements were either made under duress or taken out of context.as to the basis for his claim of duress,wallach stated that the electronic monitoring bracelet he had been required to wear while on bail was not removed until hours after he signed the stipulation and that his travel documents were not returned until six days after the dismissal of the criminal complaint.see wallach opposition memorandum at.he also contended that the stipulation was and that it was not valid because it had not been reviewed or sanctioned by any court.id.at.
the government,in reply,argued that wallach arguments were meritless.it pointed out that when the stipulation was signed,there was no court action pending,and there was thus no requirement that that agreement be reviewed or approved by any court.see reply memorandum of law of plaintiff united states of america in support of its motion to strike or for summary judgment government reply memorandum at.the government also argued that there was no evidence suggesting that the electronic monitoring bracelet or wallach travel documents had been used to coerce wallach to sign the stipulation.further,citing new york law see id.at,the government argued that in order for a claimant to prevail on a claim of duress,the contract he claims was coerced must be but here was not repudiated promptly see id.at.here,far from repudiating his stipulation promptly,the government argued,wallach sent an unsolicited email to ausa massey two months after he signed the stipulation stating that wallach did not have to sign it,that he was practically free when he signed it,that he agreed to sign because his counsel advised him to sign,and that he would honor what he signed government reply memorandum at,thereby affirming that there had been no duress.
in an order dated march,the district court granted t he government motion substantially for the reasons set forth in its moving and reply papers.final judgment was entered on march,declaring the jammers forfeited to the united states.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,wallach does not contend that he had standing to oppose the requested forfeiture if the stipulation he signed is enforceable.rather,he pursues his principal contentions that the stipulation should be ruled void either on the ground of lack of consideration see,wallach brief on appeal at the stipulation agreement is completely single sided and gives nothing to wallach except his freedom,or on the ground of duress see,id.at the evidence of the case demonstrate s that the prosecution abused its leverage and imbalance of powers to coerce wallach to sign an agreement he would never have signed voluntarily without such pressure.reviewing de novo the legal issues as to standing,contract enforceability,and the sufficiency of proffered evidence,we reject wallach contentions for the reasons that follow.
preliminarily,we note our agreement with the government contention that the enforceability of the stipulation should be determined with reference to state law,and in particular the law of new york,where the stipulation was signed by the government and where the criminal case centering on the jammers had been pending.there is no federal statute governing such agreements,and t here is no federal general common law,myers.fdic,quoting erie tompkins.c ases in which judicial creation of a special federal rule would be justified are few and restricted,atherton fdic,quoting myers,at which was quoting wheeldin wheeler,and cases involving the enforceability of individually negotiated agreements are not among them.wallach has neither opposed the application of new york law nor proposed a federal principle that would differ from new york law.
wallach challenges to the enforceability of the stipulation 
the alleged lack of consideration 
wallach contention that the stipulation is void for lack of consideration is meritless.we note in passing that wallach attached to his brief on appeal a document that he says was a second email sent to ausa massey on october,which does not appear to be part of the record in the district court in which wallach accused the government of seriously violating the understandings and the stipulation agreement that the government signed with me and my attorney after my criminal case was dismissed.were we to consider that document,we would be forced to conclude that wallach accusation that the government was not performing its obligations under the stipulation revealed that there had in fact been consideration for wallach signing the stipulation.however,we need not be concerned with the matter of whether there was consideration,because new york general obligations law provides that 
a written instrument which purports to be a total or partial release of all claims or a total or partial release of any particular claim shall not be invalid because of the absence of consideration 
oblig.law mckinney.
all of the prerequisites for application of this section are clearly met in the stipulation.in that written document which was titled stipulation and release wallach expressly agree d that he would not contest the forfeiture of the jammers to the united states stipulation,fifth whereas he expressly agree d not to contest the administrative or judicial forfeiture of the jammers to the united states id.and he agreed to be barred from asserting any claim against the government in connection with the acquisition possession of the jammers id.these provisions unambiguously released any right wallach may have had to oppose forfeiture of the jammers to the government.and wallach has acknowledged that the stipulation and release agreement sent to him by the government call ed for his total renouncement of ownership of the jammers.wallach aff.emphasis in original.
as a matter of new york law,therefore,no consideration for wallach agreement to this release was needed and thus,if consideration was absent,its absence did not make the stipulation invalid.
the claim of duress 
wallach contention that the stipulation is void on the ground that he entered into it under duress is also untenable.
the law is well settled that stipulations of settlement are judicially favored and may not lightly be set aside in general,repudiation of an agreement on the ground that it was procured by duress requires a showing of both a wrongful threat and the effect of precluding the exercise of free will
