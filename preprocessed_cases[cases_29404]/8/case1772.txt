this appeal primarily concerns the issue of the appealability of an order remanding a removed action to state court.specifically,we must decide whether we have appellate jurisdiction to review a remand order based on the conclusion that joinder of a plaintiff destroyed subject matter jurisdiction and the ruling that permitted joinder of a plaintiff after removal.the,j h marsh mclennan,marsh,appeals from the january,order of the district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,district judge,permitting joinder of a nondiverse plaintiff and remanding the case to the state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the,andrew price price,champlain enterprises champlain,and other individuals,have moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that d bars appellate review of the remand order.applying the supreme court recent opinion in powerex reliant energy services,d,we agree that section d bars appellate review of the remand order,and we also conclude that the collateral order doctrine does not authorize review of the district court joinder ruling.we therefore dismiss the appeal.
background 
the district court opinion recites the following undisputed facts.see price marsh usa,cv,wl,at.
this action arises out of a directors and officers liability insurance policy issued by the defendant,chubb custom insurance chubb to champlain,a new york corporation.defendant marsh,also a new york corporation,was champlain insurance broker and helped procure the policy for champlain.champlain filed a claim under the policy in connection with an employee lawsuit,but chubb denied the claim.in response,champlain filed an action for coverage against chubb in the district court for the northern district of new york,but the action was dismissed.
after the unsuccessful action against chubb,champlain purported to assign any claims it had against marsh,the insurance broker,to price,champlain president.price was a resident of vermont.price then filed an action against marsh in vermont superior court alleging that marsh had breached the applicable standard of care of a prudent insurance broker by failing to use reasonable care and diligence in the procurement of c overage with prior acts.marsh removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.marsh later filed a complaint against chubb.
several years later,price filed a motion to amend the complaint to join champlain as a plaintiff.at the same time,marsh filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that the assignment of champlain claims to price was invalid.see id.at.ruling first on the motion for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the assignment was invalid under vermont law because,among other reasons,price had not given any consideration for the assignment.see id.at.
turning then to the joinder motion,the district court ruled that,in light of the assignment invalidity,joinder of champlain as a plaintiff was necessary for the action to proceed.applying rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the court decided to allow champlain joinder because price moved to amend promptly after recognizing a serious challenge to the assignment and thus did not cause inordinate delay,the defendants would not suffer any prejudice because the claims against them would remain the same,any delay caused by amendment and remand would be inconsequential,and the assignment invalidity meant that amendment would not be futile.see id.at.marsh had also argued that joinder should be denied because any attempt by a plaintiff to amend his pleading to destroy diversity is subject to scrutiny in addition to that imposed by rule a.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,after reviewing factors similar to those recited above,the court rejected this argument.see id.
because both champlain and marsh had their principal places of business in new york,the district court then proceeded to assess the jurisdictional consequences of granting the motion to join champlain as a plaintiff.citing kn energy,d,the court observed that,o rdinarily,subject matter jurisdiction and the determination of whether diversity of citizenship exists are made at the outset of the case and govern regardless of subsequent changes in parties.price,wl,at.however,the court distinguished on two grounds.first,involved substitution of a plaintiff under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the substituted plaintiff had no interest in the action at the time of its commencement by contrast,champlain was not joined under rule and had an interest in the claims at issue well before price even filed suit.see id.
second,the court relied on the indispensability exception to,developed by a number of other courts,which provides that joinder of a nondiverse party destroys diversity when the joined party was indispensable to the action at its commencement.see id.citing,salt lake tribune publishing v.at t,cir.applying this exception,the district court reasoned that champlain was an indispensable party because at its core this dispute was,and currently remains,a controversy between champlain and marsh.id.at.accordingly,it held that champlain joinder destroyed subject matter jurisdiction,and it remanded the action to the state court.see id.
discussion 
on appeal,marsh contends that the district court was obliged to dismiss the action under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure for failure to join an indispensable party,instead of permitting joinder and remanding the action to state court for lack of diversity jurisdiction.the have moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that d bars appellate review of the district court remand order.marsh seeks to avoid application of section d primarily on the theory that this provision does not preclude review of a remand order when a district court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because of events occurring after removal.marsh also contends that we can review the district court joinder ruling under the collateral order doctrine.we reject both of marsh arguments.
d precludes review of the district court remand order 
two statutory provisions govern our analysis of our jurisdiction to review this appeal.c provides in relevant part 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
the second provision,section d,states,with one exception not pertinent here,that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.although section d could be read expansively to apply to all remand orders,the supreme court has held that it must be read in conjunction with section c,meaning that section d prohibits review only of those remand orders based on the grounds specified in section c.see,quackenbush allstate insurance,d remand order reviewable by court of appeals thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d remand order based on heavy docket reviewable by court of appeals.thus,section d prohibits appellate review when a district court remands based on a defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction presented in a timely remand motion or a determination that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.shapiro logistec usa,cir see also spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir section d bars appellate review of remand orders based on any ground recognized in section c,such as perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
the district court remanded this action after concluding that the joinder of champlain destroyed diversity jurisdiction and thereby precluded the court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the action.although the court remand order appears to place it within the coverage of the plain language of section c,marsh makes two arguments in an attempt to take the remand order outside the scope of section c and thereby avoid the limitation on appellate review set forth in section d.
first,marsh intimates that the district court could not
