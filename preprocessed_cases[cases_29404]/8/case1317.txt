the question presented is whether plaintiff disability advocates,dai a private nonprofit organization contracted to provide services to new york state protection and advocacy p a system under the protection and advocacy for individuals with mental illness act paimi,et has standing to sue various state agencies and officials on behalf of certain individuals with mental illness residing in new york city for an alleged violation of the integration mandate of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,and section of the rehabilitation act.
we conclude that because dai does not have the indicia of membership required of nonmembership organizations for associational standing,see hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d,dai fails to satisfy the standing requirements under article iii of the united states constitution as interpreted by the supreme court.
because dai lacks standing,we must also decide whether the intervention of the united states which occurred after the determination of liability by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nicholas garaufis,judge but before the imposition of a remedy was sufficient to cure the jurisdictional defect that would have barred the district court from hearing the suit as originally brought.we hold that in the circumstances presented here it was not sufficient.we therefore vacate the march,judgment and remedial order of the district court and dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction.
background 
a.the paimi 
in,congress enacted in order to ensure that the rights of individuals with mental illness are protected and to assist states to establish and operate a protection and advocacy system for individuals with mental illness which will protect and advocate the rights of such individuals through activities to ensure the enforcement of the constitution and federal and state statutes.b,b a in line with these objectives,paimi conditions certain federal funding for states on the establishment of protection and advocacy p a systems.a.the designated p a system may be either an independent state agency or a private entity.u.a,incorporated by reference in.in turn,p a systems are authorized to pursue legal,and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are receiving care or treatment in the state.a b.
new york has designated the commission on quality of care and advocacy for persons with disabilities cqcapd as the state p a system for persons with mental illness pursuant to paimi.see mental hyg.law p u.in,cqcapd entered into a contract with dai as permitted by and new york mental hygiene law i see disability advocates,pataki,cv ngg,zucker aff,docket,zucker aff.that contract designates dai as an authorized paimi agency and authorizes dai to provide protection and advocacy services to individuals with mental illness throughout the state.id.
procedural history 
on july,dai initiated this action by filing suit against the governor of the state of new york,the new york state department of health,the new york state department of mental health,and the commissioners of those two agencies collectively,the state or defendants on behalf of its constituents individuals with mental illness as defined under,who reside,or might one day reside,in specified adult homes in new york city compl.dai alleged that the mental health system run by the state violated the integration mandate of title ii of the ada,and section of the rehabilitation act,which requires the provision of mental health services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.cfr d see olmstead ex rel.zimring,d holding that the provision of mental health services in an institutionalized setting when the recipients are capable and willing to live in a manner more fully integrated into the community constitutes a violation of title ii of the ada,provided that such integration can be reasonably accommodated.dai sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would require the state to shift residents and funds away from impacted sic adult homes to residential programs and to end t he state practice of knowingly placing and maintaining individuals with serious mental illness in impacted sic adult homes.compl.
after discovery,the state brought a motion for summary judgment challenging,among other things,dai standing to sue on behalf of its constituents under paimi and article iii of the united states constitution.the district court denied the motion for summary judgment and rejected the standing argument,concluding that dai had statutory standing pursuant to a b and satisfied the minimum requirements of constitutional standing under article iii.disability advocates,paterson,d,dai i.the case then proceeded to trial.
following a bench trial,the district court concluded that i n carrying out their administration of new york mental health service system,d efendants have denied thousands of individuals with mental illness in new york city the opportunity to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.disability advocates,paterson,d,dai ii.accordingly,in a september,memorandum setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court determined that dai had adequately proven that d efendants discriminated against dai constituents in violation of the integration mandate of the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act.id.the court announced its intention to enter the appropriate injunctive remedy following further briefing.id.
on october,more than six years after the complaint was filed,the united states moved to intervene at the remedial stage of the litigation pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure united states motion to intervene,docket.noting that the united states m otion comes very late in the litigation process,the district court nevertheless determined that intervention would not prejudice the original parties or unduly delay the proceedings concerning the appropriate injunctive remedy to be imposed.disability advocates,paterson,cv,wl,at.accordingly,the court granted the united states motion.id.at 
on march,the district court rejected the state proposed remedial plan as unreasonable and inadequate,disability advocates,paterson,cv,wl,at,and entered a judgment and remedial order adopting dai proposed remedy with minor modifications,see judgment and remedial order,docket.among other things,the remedy fashioned by the district court required the state to ensure that,within four years of the entry of the district court order,
a all current adult home residents who desire placement in supported housing have been afforded such placement if qualified,b all future adult home residents who desire placement in supported housing are promptly afforded such placement if qualified,and c no individual with mental illness who is qualified for supported housing is offered placement in an adult home unless,after being fully informed,he or she declines the opportunity to receive services in supported housing.
id.at emphasis supplied over the objection of defendants,the district court ordered that a monitor oversee the state compliance with the injunctive relief imposed by the district court.id.at.by order dated february,this court granted a stay of the remedial order pending the outcome of this appeal.
c.this appeal 
defendants appeal from the march,judgment and remedial order of the district court.on appeal,they argue,among other things,that the district court erred in concluding that dai had constitutional standing to pursue this litigation.state br.because standing is the threshold question in every federal case and raises an issue with respect to the court jurisdiction,we turn first to that claim.denney deutsche bank ag,cir quoting warth seldin,d and because we conclude that dai lacked standing and that the intervention of the united states was insufficient to cure that jurisdictional defect,we dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction.
discussion 
standard of review 
whether a plaintiff has standing to sue is a question of law,which we review de novo.see,carver city of new york,cir.
associational standing 
what constitutes the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing is firmly established.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the limitation on the federal judicial power under the united states constitution to cases and controversies,const.art.iii,requires that the party invoking federal jurisdiction demonstrate,which is a concrete and particularized harm to a legally protected interest causation in the form of a fairly traceable connection between the asserted and the alleged actions of the defendant and redressability,or a likelihood that the injury can be remedied by the requested relief.huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche llp,cir quoting lujan,at.
when an association asserts standing solely as the representative of its members,it must allege that its members,or any one of them,are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.warth seldin,d.this requirement was further elaborated in hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d,in which the supreme court announced the current test for associational standing.under hunt,
an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
at.two decades after hunt,the supreme court clarified that the first two of these requirements are constitutional limitations,whereas the third requirement is a prudential limitation that may be abrogated by congress.united food commercial workers union local brown,d.
the hunt court concluded that the washington state apple advertising commission a state agency charged by statute with the promotion and protection of the state apple industry on behalf of apple growers and dealers was not a membership organization,but it nevertheless satisfied the first prong of the associational standing test because in a very real sense the commission represent ed the state growers and dealers and provide d the means by which they express ed their collective views and protect ed their collective interests.id.at.furthermore,the apple growers and dealers alone elect ed the members of the commission they alone could serve on the commission they alone finance d its activities,including the costs of litigating hunt,through assessments levied upon them.id.
in sum,the supreme court reasoned that,although the commission did not have members in the traditional sense,its constituency possessed all the indicia of membership.id.we have therefore recognized that assuming the other criteria for associational standing are met organizations may sue in a representative capacity when they function effectively as a membership organization.in re holocaust victim assets,cir.
on the threshold jurisdictional question of standing,the only dispute is whether dai which is not a membership organization satisfies the first prong of the test for associational standing under hunt.defendants argue that dai can not meet this requirement that its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right because dai constituents lack two key indicia of membership representation and control.in turn,dai and the united states contend that hunt does not render representation and control the only indicia of membership sufficient to create members out of constituents for purposes of associational standing.
pursuant to paimi,p a systems must ensure that they are responsive to the needs of the community they were created to represent.accordingly,the governing board of all p a systems must be composed of members who broadly represent or are knowledgeable about the needs of the clients served by the system such members are defined to include individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services and family members of such individuals.c b.in addition,a p a system must 
establish an advisory council which shall include individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services,and family members of such individuals,and at least percent the membership of which shall be comprised of individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services or who are family members of such individuals and which shall be chaired by an individual who has received or who is receiving mental health services or is a family member of such an individual.
id.a.finally,paimi also requires that p a systems establish a grievance procedure for clients or prospective clients to assure that individuals with mental illness have full access to the services of the system.id.a.
whether these protections are sufficient to connote the indicia of membership required for associational standing under hunt has not heretofore been addressed in this circuit.some,but not all,courts of appeals to address the question have concluded that they are sufficient.see or.advocacy ctr.mink,cir concluding that the constituents of oregon p a system possess many indicia of to satisfy the purposes that undergird the concept of associational standing that the organization is sufficiently identified with and subject to the influence of those it seeks to represent as to have a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.quoting vil.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d doe stincer,cir concluding that the requirements under ensure that m uch like members of a traditional association,the constituents of the p a system possess the means to influence the priorities and activities the system undertakes but see ass for retarded citizens of dall.dall.cnty.mental health mental retardation ctr.bd.of,cir concluding that texas p a system bore no relationship to a traditional membership group,because most of its clients are unable to participate in and guide the organization efforts.prot.advocacy,carnahan,cir concluding same with respect to missouri p a system.
we need not and do not decide which of our sister circuits has the better of this argument,because dai is not a p a system but a contractor to the system,see notes,ante,designated to provide protection and advocacy services under paimi.zucker aff.this distinction is critical to the question of whether dai has associational standing because the sole basis cited in both stincer eleventh circuit and mink ninth circuit for finding that p a systems have associational standing to sue on behalf of individuals with mental illness is that affords individuals with mental illness and their families and representatives the requisite indicia of membership in the administration of the system.
the district court did not consider whether dai is subject to any of the statutory requirements under such that it might satisfy the constitutional requirements for standing under hunt.more importantly,however,dai does not claim that its constituents have a sufficiently active affiliation with the organization.hunt,at recognizing that the apple growers and dealers alone elect the members of the commission they alone may serve on the commission and they alone finance its activities.tellingly,there is scant evidence in the record that the individuals with mental illness whom dai purports to represent have the power to elect its directors,make budget decisions,or influence dai activities or litigation strategies.for instance,the record does not contain the contract between cqcapd and dai.nor does it contain agendas,minutes,or other evidence regarding the quarterly meetings between dai and cqcapd advisory council names and descriptions of the members of the advisory council or ways that individuals with mental illness convey information,requests,or inquiries to the advisory council.finally,the record does not establish that dai ever notified its constituents or any of their legal guardians that it was filing this suit purportedly on their behalf.accordingly,dai has failed to satisfy its burden of establishing the elements of its purported associational standing.lujan,at.
