defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,as well as the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,b,and to strike certain allegations pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f.
finding that plaintiff was on inquiry notice more than two years before filing suit,the district court concluded that the claims were and granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
this lawsuit follows on the heels of a investigation by the attorney general of the state of new york attorney general and the securities and exchange commission sec into the practices of morgan stanley securities analysts.in april the attorney general issued his findings and conclusion that morgan stanley used its stock analysts research as a tool to win investment banking business.morgan stanley analysts performed investment banking functions and were compensated based on their effectiveness in securing investment banking business for the firm as a result,it is alleged,they faced a major conflict of interest and failed to produce the objective research reports that morgan stanley claimed to give its customers.based on these findings,the attorney general,sec,national association of securities dealers nasd,new york stock exchange nyse and state regulators filed claims against morgan stanley for violations of nasd and nyse rules.the firm settled these claims on april,for million in penalties and restitution.
classes of investors have filed numerous lawsuits against morgan stanley and other financial institutions alleging securities fraud based on the conflicts uncovered by the agency investigations.see,fogarazzo lehman,d demarco lehman,d in re worldcom.sec,d in re merrill lynch.research reports sec,d in re worldcom.sec,in re merrill lynch.research reports sec,d pfeiffer goldman,sachs,civ,wl july,in re merrill lynch.research reports sec,d.but there is an important distinction between the sandip shah lawsuit and the others.
in the other lawsuits,the plaintiffs invested in the securities of a publicly traded a party to the reliance on overly sanguine recommendations of the defendant securities broker and suffered a loss when the value of the corporation stock decreased.here,by contrast,the plaintiff owned stock in the defendant securities broker,morgan stanley,itself and allegedly suffered a loss when morgan stanley improper business practices came to light and the value of its own stock decreased.the nature of the fraud alleged is thus different whereas the usual claim is that defendants made false and misleading statements in overrating particular securities,shah contends that morgan stanley fraud lay in its statements showcasing its analysts and their reports as unbiased and objective.
we set forth the facts asserted in the complaint and assume their truth for purposes of evaluating a motion to dismiss.see.b conley gibson,d a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.
in the equity research business,morgan stanley stock analysts provide individual and corporate clients with ratings and recommendations regarding the securities of publicly traded companies.throughout the class period,the firm analysts rated publicly traded stocks according to an ostensibly objective ratings system 
like other prominent financial institutions,morgan stanley also provides investment banking services.in its capacity as an investment bank,the firm helps its corporate clients to acquire financing,primarily through the issuance of securities,and during the class period often served as the lead underwriter in its clients securities offerings.morgan stanley was particularly active as a lead underwriter during the boom of the late,when wall street securities firms were presented with myriad opportunities for lucrative investment banking business.during this period morgan stanley and other firms competed to underwrite and issue the initial public offerings ipos of stock in the new technology companies because the ipos themselves generated banking fees for morgan stanley and promised future investment banking business through secondary stock offerings,loans and other corporate financing transactions,as well as mergers and acquisitions.
under nasd and nyse regulations,a chinese wall was required to prevent the conflicts of interest that could obviously result when a firm analyzes and recommends the very securities it has itself issued or underwritten.indeed,morgan stanley continuously published statements regarding its stock rating system,the quality of its research,its high ethical standards and compliance with the industry rules and regulations,the awards that the firm and its analysts had received,and standard disclaimers regarding the firm dual roles.see shah stanley,civ,wl,at.
years before the beginning of the class period,the financial press were reporting that t he recommendations by underwriter analysts show significant evidence of bias and possible conflict of interest,roger lowenstein,today analyst often wears two hats,wall,may,at,and that t he pressure on analysts is growing because t he chinese wall that existed at most brokerage houses between analysts and investment bankers has broken down,john hechinger,analysts may hate to say sell,but a few companies do hear it,wall,at,available at internal quotation marks omitted.
such reports were not confined to generalities.mary meeker was specifically named,and her ethically questionable practices described,in articles featured in the new yorker as well as in financial publications like fortune.see,john cassidy,the woman in the bubble,the new yorker,april may,at erick schonfeld,the high price of research caveat investor stock and research analysts covering are as independent as you think,fortune,march,at peter elkind,where mary meeker went wrong,fortune,may,at elkind.for example,fortune named meeker as one of a group of wall street analysts who were increasingly deriv ing a portion of their compensation,directly or indirectly,from the companies they cover.schonfeld,at.that,fortune reported,helps put pressure on the quality of their work and encourages them to become more like cheerleaders than independent observers.id.at.
after years of such reporting from the financial press,the attorney general announced his investigation of morgan stanley in april.see shah,wl,at.morgan stanley stock immediately dropped in value by.see id.at.less than a month later,when the sec ordered that morgan stanley turn over documents relating to conflicts of interest,the firm stock dropped another.see id.in april,the attorney general published its findings and conclusions in connection with the million settlement.see id.
shah filed suit on july,on behalf of a putative class of those who purchased morgan stanley common stock between july,and april.shah brought claims under sections b and a of the securities and exchange act of,b and a,and sec rule,as modified by the pslra,a,et.
under rule,it is unlawful t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances in which they were made,not misleading.b.
