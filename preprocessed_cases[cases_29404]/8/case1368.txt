in this tax refund suit,altria group,claims in depreciation,interest,and transaction cost deductions for the tax years and.the claimed deductions result from altria participation in nine leveraged lease transactions with entities.in each transaction,altria leased a strategic asset from a entity immediately leased back the asset for a shorter sublease term and provided the entity a multimillion dollar accommodation fee for entering the transaction and a purchase option to terminate altria residual interest at the end of the sublease term.the government described these transactions as tax shelters or more precisely,as attempts by altria to purchase unused tax deductions and transfer money from the public fisc to itself.
after an trial before the district court for the southern district of new york holwell,the jury found that altria was not entitled to the claimed tax deductions.applying the substance over form doctrine,the jury rejected altria contention that it retained a genuine ownership or leasehold interest in the assets and therefore was entitled to the tax deductions.the district court denied altria motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial and entered judgment for the government.altria appeals,arguing,inter alia,that the district court erred in instructing the jury regarding the substance over form doctrine.

this appeal concerns tax deductions that altria claimed in and,and which the internal revenue service irs disallowed.altria claimed the tax deductions after entering into nine leasing transactions,four of which the parties agreed to focus on at trial.of these four transactions,three fit the structure of a silo transaction and one fits the structure of a lilo transaction.see generally,robert wood steven hollingworth,silos and lilos demystified,tax notes,defining and describing silos and lilos maxim shvedov,cong.research,crs report for congress tax implications of silos,qtes,and other leasing transactions with tax exempt entities,available at last visited july,same.altria silo and lilo transactions share three common features,described briefly below lease and leaseback debt financing and rent and options at sublease termination.
in the four representative silo and lilo transactions,altria,a taxable entity,entered into a primary or head lease with a entity,such as a government agency or foreign entity,for an interest in a facility.the facilities included a georgia hydroelectric facility a new york rail yard a netherlands waste treatment plant and a florida electrical plant.in the three silo transactions,the lease terms extended beyond the facility remaining useful life,allowing altria to assert that the transactions were sales for tax purposes.in the other transaction the lilo transaction the lease term spanned less than of the remaining useful life of the asset,allowing altria to assert that the transaction was a lease,not a sale.
the entities could not themselves benefit from tax deductions derived from utilization of these assets.altria,however,as a profitable taxable entity,could benefit from tax deductions resulting from use of those assets.therefore,both altria and the entities would benefit from a transaction in which altria was treated as the owner or lessee of the facility taking full tax deductions and paying the entity an accommodation fee the entity was able to continue free,uninterrupted use of its facility and both parties economic risk of loss was minimized.
to allow the entities to continue using the facilities,altria immediately leased back each facility to the entity,using a sublease.each sublease had a shorter term than altria corresponding head lease,but as discussed below at the end of the sublease period the entity could repurchase the facility terminating altria head lease using no funds of its own but exclusively funds that altria had placed in escrow for that purpose.during the sublease periods,each party had full operational control over the facility and was required to pay all insurance,maintenance,improvement,repair,and regulatory costs.as altria described in a presentation at a worldwide altria conference 
although altria has the title and is the owner of the asset,
the lessee bears all the costs and risks of ownership during the lease term.
the financing for each of altria silo and lilo transactions principally entailed a the head lease rent owed by altria b the sublease rent owed by the entity c the debt service obligations incurred by altria to pay the head lease rent and d an accommodation fee paid by altria to the entity.
to pay its head lease rent,altria borrowed about of the needed money through a nonrecourse loan.for the rest,altria contributed its own cash.for each transaction,altria paid the entire amount due under the head lease which included the amount needed by the entity to repurchase the facility at the conclusion of its sublease in a single upfront payment.reisinger comm r,cir requiring depreciable interest in property at time deduction is claimed.according to each silo or lilo agreement,those funds were not given to the entity,but were placed in two accounts defeasance accounts in which a undertaker held the necessary funds and made payments when due under the agreements.see wells fargo united states,fed.cl,providing overview of defeasance.
for each transaction,altria created a debt defeasance account and an equity defeasance account.each debt defeasance account contained the money altria borrowed for the transaction.each equity defeasance account contained part of the cash altria contributed for the transaction.altria gave the rest of its cash contribution directly to the entity as an accommodation fee for purporting to lease or sell its depreciable or amortizable asset.altria claimed tax deductions totaling million in and.it paid accommodation fees of over million to its counterparties,giving the hydroelectric facility owner million,the rail yard owner million,the electrical plant owner million,and the waste treatment plant owner million.
the undertaker of each debt defeasance account was responsible for using the funds to pay the entity rent on its sublease.however,the debt undertaker did not pay the sublease rent directly to altria,but to altria lender to satisfy altria debt service obligations on its nonrecourse loan.the sublease rent and the debt service obligations were set to match,in timing and amount,with very few exceptions.thus,in each transaction the funds were transferred in a loop from the lender,to altria the nonrecourse loan,to the entity to pay the head lease rent,to the debt undertaker to pay the sublease rent,and then back to the lender to pay the debt service obligations.because the debt undertaker and the lender were affiliates,the actual funds never even left the bank for the duration of the transaction.moreover,the entities could not control or access the funds in the debt defeasance account.
for each equity defeasance account,the cash contributed by altria was invested in treasury securities,in an apparent attempt to give the transaction a veneer of economic substance.david hariton,sorting out the tangle of economic substance,tax,noting it is always possible to produce a profit simply by including equity in a transaction.altria prevented the entities from accessing or exercising any control over the accounts during the sublease term.even after their subleases ended,the entities had no entitlement to withdraw the funds,as discussed below.
at the end of each sublease term,the silo and lilo agreements provided the entities with a unilateral option to re purchase the facilities at issue,thus terminating altria remaining head lease interest.the agreements set the exercise price at a fixed amount,determined at the start of the transaction,equal to or greater than the property projected fair market value at the end of the sublease term.the purchase option was fully funded by the treasury securities in the equity defeasance account,which would increase in value during the sublease term to precisely the purchase option price.if the entity exercised the purchase option,the funds in the equity defeasance account would flow in a loop,like the funds in the debt defeasance account from altria,to the undertaker,back to altria.
under the silo and lilo agreements,if the entity did not exercise its purchase option,altria had three general options force the entity to renew the sublease or enter into a service contract enter into a replacement sublease with a third party or take possession of the leased property.the options were designed to allow the entity to retain control of the asset,while reducing altria risk of economic loss.
this structure differs from a traditional leveraged lease in a number of ways.because of the nature of the assets at issue,a rail yard for a metro system,there was no viable secondary market for the facilities.see altria,united states,d,noting that the jury heard evidence that in each transaction,altria and its counterparty effectively entered into a bilateral monopoly in which the asset price after the transaction closing would be determined by factors.further,in each transaction altria invested in assets of strategic importance to the entity business operations,to ensure that the party would exercise the purchase option at the end of the sublease term.in addition,the parties sublease rent and purchase options were fully defeased,so the transactions created no additional liquidity for altria beyond the tax benefits.id.at.lastly,the transactions had the effect of creating tax benefits that altria purchased for an accommodation fee,rather than the effect of transferring a tax benefit between taxpayers that paid comparable tax rates.id.noting relevance of this fact under supreme court case law.
altria was aware that for tax purposes it needed to maintain a genuine ownership or leasehold interest in the facilities.thus,altria obtained financial appraisals for each of the silo and lilo transactions.at least one appraisal was not completed until years after the transaction,and none were shared with the entities before the transactions.each appraisal concluded that the entity would not exercise its purchase option at the end of the sublease period and altria would choose to enter into a replacement sublease with a third party.
strikingly,altria reached the opposite conclusions internally.altria internal memoranda concluded that each entity would exercise its purchase option at sublease termination in order to regain control of the leasehold interest and even if it did not,altria would require the entity to renew the sublease at rates that will give altria its economic return by transferring the funds in the equity defeasance account to altria.that is,altria would not exercise its options to find a replacement lessee or take possession if the entity declined to exercise its purchase option.and for good reason if altria could benefit from bringing in a replacement sublessee or taking possession of the leased asset because of the asset high resale value,then the entity,if rational,would exercise its unilateral,purchase option to obtain those benefits for itself.if economic conditions were not so beneficial at the end of the sublease,altria nevertheless could force the entity to renew the sublease at a predefined price,covered by the funds in the equity defeasance account.
given these two scenarios,both covered by funds in the equity defeasance account,and both continuing the party control of the facility,altria memoranda stated that the risks of the transactions were nominal and would not expose altria to any residual value risk.despite the fundamental inconsistency between altria internal memoranda and the appraisals it obtained,no one at altria questioned this difference.this was not an oversight t he principal purpose of the appraisals,one witness testified,was to support altria tax position.
other documents confirmed this purpose.at a worldwide altria conference,altria described the silo and lilo transactions 
the name of the game here is to use dollars that would otherwise have been remitted to the federal government and instead invest the proceeds in additional income producing assets.
altria counterparties agreed.in a board presentation before the altria transaction,the hydroelectric facility owner stated that the purpose of the transaction was to t ransfer tax benefits accelerated depreciation or accelerated rental expense to the investor.this owner described the transaction as a sale for tax purposes involving tax benefits sold to equity investors,because tax benefits are not beneficial to us.similarly,the rail yard owner described the altria transaction as a tax benefit transfer and the electrical plant owner stated that its objective was to obtain a cash benefit through the mon e tization of tax benefits.
for tax years and,altria claimed various tax deductions arising from its silo and lilo transactions.altria claimed depreciation deductions with respect to the facilities at issue in the silo transactions,see a rental expense deductions for the facility at issue in the lilo transaction,see id.a,a amortization deductions with respect to transaction costs,see id.and interest deductions with respect to the nonrecourse loans,see id.
the irs denied altria claims for tax deductions,assessing income tax deficiencies.on july,altria filed amended tax returns and paid the assessed deficiencies.as relevant here,altria requested tax refunds of for and for.on august,the irs disallowed altria claims for tax refunds.altria had the right to appeal the decision to the tax court,where a judge would decide the appeal.see.instead,altria filed suit on october,in the district court for the southern district of new york,pursuant to,where either party could opt for a jury,see a.in its answer to altria complaint,the government requested a jury trial.
in march,both parties moved for summary judgment.after oral argument,the district court denied both motions.the district court found that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the practical effect of the transactions defeasance structure,the level of financial risk that altria assumed,and whether there was any legitimate business purpose for entering into the transactions.
the case proceeded to a jury trial,over eleven days in june and july.after the close of evidence,the district court instructed the jury to analyze altria four representative transactions under two common law disallowance methods the substance over form doctrine and the economic substance doctrine.following deliberation,the jury found that both doctrines barred altria tax refund claims.on march,the district court denied altria motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.see altria,d at.after the district court entered judgment,altria timely appealed.
the extent to which taxpayers may minimize their taxes by choosing one form for a transaction rather than another has preoccupied lawyers and administrators since the inception of the federal income tax.marvin chirelstein,learned hand contribution to the law of tax avoidance,yale.as judge learned hand observed decades ago,a ny one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible he is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the treasury.helvering gregory,cir,aff.
however,even if a transaction form matches the dictionary definitions of each term used in the statutory definition of the tax provision,it does not follow that congress meant to cover such a transaction and allow it a tax benefit.id.instead,the question for determination is whether what was done,apart from the tax motive,was the thing which the statute intended.knetsch united states,quoting gregory,at gregory,at asking whether what was done here,was what was intended by the statute.
this principle may be summarized by the statement that i n tax law,substance rather than form determines tax consequences.raymond united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in applying this doctrine of substance over form,the supreme court has looked to the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than to the particular form the parties employed.frank lyon united states.the supreme court has never regarded the simple expedient of drawing up papers,as controlling for tax purposes when the objective economic realities are to the contrary.id.at citation omitted.to permit the true nature of a transaction to be disguised by mere formalisms,which exist solely to alter tax liabilities,would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of congress.comm r court holding.
under section a of the internal revenue code,congress allows,as a depreciation deduction 
a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion,wear and tear including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence

of property held for the production of income.

where two parties purport to transfer an interest in an asset,courts may disregard the purported transfer,for federal tax purposes,where the transferor continues to retain many of the benefits and burdens of ownership.bailey comm r,cir citing cases see also united states regan,cir t he generally accepted rule is that for federal income tax purposes,the owner of property must possess meaningful burdens and benefits of ownership.internal quotation marks omitted bb t united states,cir a true lease for tax purposes requires a demonstration that the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of the traditional lessor status.quoting frank lyon,at.
thus,altria was not eligible for depreciation deductions with respect to the litigated transactions unless it obtained,in substance,a genuine ownership interest in the facilities at issue.whether altria obtained such an interest is determined by the substance and economic realities of the transaction that gave rise to the asserted interest.see helvering lazarus.because an income tax deduction is a matter of legislative grace the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer.knight comm r,internal quotation marks omitted.
for arrangements,this court has relied on the supreme court decision in frank lyon united states,as t he touchstone in determining whether the form of an agreement should govern for tax purposes.newman comm r,cir.in frank lyon,the supreme court expressly declined to identify particular factors that would determine the substance and economic realities of the transaction.frank lyon,at.rather,the supreme court stated that the significant and genuine attributes of the traditional lessor status in any particular case will necessarily depend upon its facts.id.at.in frank lyon,the supreme court acknowledged that the facts of this case stand in contrast to many others in which the form of the transaction actually created tax advantages that,for one reason or another,could not have been enjoyed had the transaction taken another form.id.at favorably citing sun oil comm r,cir,which denied tax deductions arising from a purported of land between taxpayer and trust.
here,altria was required to prove that it had the benefits and burdens of owning or leasing the facilities at issue in the four representative transactions.see knight,at.given frank lyon command that this question in any particular case will necessarily depend on its facts,at,the district court rightly rejected altria attempt to supplant frank lyon inclusive test with five exclusive factors drawn from a nonbinding revenue guideline,used by the irs for advance ruling purposes,proc.see also frank lyon,at observing that revenue procedure was not intended to be definitive.
instead,the district court instructed the jury to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances and stated that the factors the jury may consider include,but are not limited to control over the facility equity investment in the facility cash flows between the parties whether the transaction was motivated by legitimate business purposes,or solely by a desire to create tax benefits regulatory realities whether the facility had an expected useful life beyond the leaseback that altria could benefit from whether it was reasonable to expect that the facility would have meaningful value at the end of the leaseback that altria could benefit from and whether altria had the potential to benefit from an increase in the facility value and suffer a loss of its equity investment in the facility as a result of a decrease in the facility value.altria,d at reprinting in full the factors the district court included in its jury instructions.the district court emphasize d that no single factor is determinative and stated that i n the end,the question is whether altria retained significant and genuine attributes of traditional owner or lessor status.
altria challenges four aspects of the district court jury instructions that differed from altria proposed instructions.the first three challenges concern the factors a jury may use to determine whether,in substance,a taxpayer established a genuine ownership or leasehold interests in an asset.the fourth challenge concerns the district court instruction regarding altria claim for interest expense deductions with respect to the nonrecourse loans it used to finance the challenged transactions.

first,altria challenges the district court instruction that the jury may consider the likelihood that the lessee would exercise its purchase option in determining whether altria retained genuine ownership or leasehold interests in the leased assets.altria,d at.in particular,the district court instructed the jury that they may consider the likelihood that the lessee would exercise its purchase option when determining w hether,at the time the transaction began the facility had an expected useful life beyond the leaseback that altria could benefit from it was reasonable to expect that the facility would have meaningful value at the end of the leaseback that altria could benefit from and altria had the potential to benefit from an increase in the facility value and suffer a loss of its equity investment in the facility as a result of a decrease in the facility value.id.
altria contends that the instruction regarding the likelihood that the lessee would exercise its purchase option allowed the jury to disregard altria residual stake in the leased assets certainly the most important factor in determining a lessor status if it believed simply that there was a likelihood that the lessee would exercise its purchase option.altria argues that a purchase option may negate the residual value factors of ownership in only two circumstances when a purchase option is certain or virtually certain to be exercised,as of the closing date of the transaction or when the purchase price is set at a nominal or bargain level below fair market value.
we disagree.as the district court aptly noted,altria argument misunderstands the government theory of the case,which was that 
there were a number of scenarios,including,but not limited to,those where the lessee exercised its purchase option,in which altria would never take possession of the assets.the cumulative effect of these scenarios,according to the government,was that altria only acquired a speculative possibility of assuming the traditional benefits and burdens of ownership.
