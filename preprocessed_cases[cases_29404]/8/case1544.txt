this appeal is but the latest chapter in a lengthy dispute over the payment of state and local taxes by the oneida indian nation of new york the oin.the supreme court most recently addressed the oin tax obligations in city of sherrill,oneida indian nation of,d sherrill.the court rejected the oin contention that parcels of lands allegedly within the boundaries of an indian reservation once occupied by the oneidas,which were sold to during the early century and bought back by the oin on the open market in the,thereby came under the sovereign dominion of the oin and were therefore exempt from municipal taxation the oin nonetheless now seeks to enjoin the madison and oneida counties the counties from foreclosing on this property for nonpayment of county taxes.on for summary judgment brought in both of the cases that are consolidated on this appeal,the district court ruled in favor of the oin.see oneida indian nation oneida county,d,oneida county oneida indian nation of madison county,d,madison county.we affirm on the ground that the oin is immune from suit under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity.the remedy of foreclosure is therefore not available to the counties.
the community,band of mohican indians stockbridge filed a motion to intervene in oneida county pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,with the goal of obtaining dismissal of that action to the extent that the land at issue was found to overlap with stockbridge purported reservation.the district court rejected stockbridge motion,finding that stockbridge could not demonstrate an interest in the oneida county litigation.see d at.we conclude that this was not an abuse of discretion.
background 
the history of the land at issue here and transactions affecting it has been set forth at some length in several other opinions of this and other courts.see,sherrill,at oneida indian nation of city of sherrill,cir oneida indian nation of,rev,sherrill,d oneida indian nation of city of sherrill,d,aff in part,vacated and remanded in part,oneida indian nation of,rev,sherrill,d.we recite only those facts that we think are necessary for an understanding of our resolution of this appeal.
the oin land 
the oin is a federally recognized indian tribe that is directly descended from the oneida indian nation oneida nation the oneida nation lands once encompassed some six million acres in what is now central new york state.in,pursuant to the treaty of fort schuyler between the oneida nation and the state of new york,the nation ceded title to nearly all of its land to the state,retaining a reservation of only approximately acres.sherrill,at.
in,congress passed the first indian trade and intercourse act.see act of july,ch,stat.nonintercourse act.the nonintercourse act,which remains substantially in force today,bars the sale of tribal land without federal government acquiescence.sherrill,at.in spite of the provisions of the act,towards the end of the century and at the beginning of the century,the oneida nation sold substantial portions of the remaining reservation land to new york state and to private parties without the federal supervision that the act required.see id.at oneida indian nation of,at.see also united states oneida nation of,concluding that the federal government owed a fiduciary duty to protect members of the oneida nation in connection with their land dealings with new york state between and.that land was subsequently sold to in transactions.see oneida indian nation of city of sherrill,d at.by,the oneida nation had sold all but acres of the reservation that had been created by the treaty of fort schuyler.see sherrill,at.by,that number had dwindled to acres.id.at.
beginning in,descendants of members of the oneida nation pursued federal litigation against local governments in new york in an effort to assert that certain of new york state purchases of reservation land during the late and early centuries had been in violation of the nonintercourse act,and therefore had not terminated the oneidas right to possess the land.see id.at summarizing cases.in the,oin tribe members also began to purchase,through transactions,land that had once been a part of the oneida nation reservation.see oneida indian nation of,at.
the supreme court decision in sherrill 
at issue in sherrill were parcels of land in the city of sherrill located in oneida county,new york that had originally been part of the oneida nation reservation as established by the treaty of fort schuyler,but that had been transferred by the oneida nation to one of its members in,and then in sold by that person to a.sherrill,at.the oin these parcels on the open market in and.id.in sherrill,the oin asserted that these properties were exempt from taxation,arguing 
that because the court in oneida county,oneida indian nation of,d recognized the oneidas aboriginal title to their ancient reservation land and because the tribe has now acquired the specific parcels involved in this suit in the open market,it has unified fee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels.
id.at.based on that contention,the oin had brought suit in the united states district court for the northern district of new york seeking injunctive and declaratory relief that would require recognition of its present and future sovereign immunity from local taxation on the land.id.at.we agreed on the basis that land in indian country is not subject to state taxation absent express congressional authorization.oneida indian nation of,at citing,inter alia,worcester state of,pet,white mountain apache tribe bracker,d,and montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d.
the supreme court reversed.it reject ed the unification theory of oin and the united states and h e ld that standards of federal indian law and federal equity practice preclude d the tribe from rekindling embers of sovereignty that long ago grew cold.sherrill,at.noting that justifiable expectations,grounded in two centuries of new york exercise of regulatory jurisdiction,until recently uncontested by oin,merit heavy weight,id.at,the court concluded 
t he distance from to the present day,the oneidas long delay in seeking equitable relief against new york or its local units,and developments in the city of sherrill spanning several generations,evoke the doctrines of laches,acquiescence,and impossibility,and render inequitable the piecemeal shift in governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.
madison county actions 
madison county has regularly assessed taxes with respect to the parcels of land in the county that were purchased by the oin in the that are claimed to lie within the boundaries of the reservation described in the treaty of fort schuyler.see madison county,d at.each year in which the oin failed to pay property taxes,madison county would initiate foreclosure proceedings against the parcels as part of its yearly foreclosure actions in state court.madison county would then abandon the foreclosure proceedings against the parcels,in anticipation of a resolution of the taxability question in sherrill,when it became clear that the sherrill litigation would continue for another year.id.madison county initiated and then abandoned foreclosure proceedings in this manner in each year until,when this court effectively separated the madison county litigation from the sherrill litigation and remanded it to the district court for further proceedings,see oneida indian nation of,at.
on november,the county instituted a foreclosure action with respect to such property in new york state court.madison county,d at.this time,however,the county did not abandon these foreclosure proceedings as it has done in previous years.a petition and notice of foreclosure was mailed to the owners of property that the county was seeking foreclosure upon for of taxes,including the oin,on december,and was published in december and january.id.it specified march,as the last day for redemption of these properties id.the supreme court decided sherrill on march,just two days before this final day of redemption.id.on april,madison county moved for summary judgment in the state court foreclosure action.id.in the instant federal proceedings,however,which had been pending in the district court following this court remand in,the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the state foreclosure proceedings.see oneida indian nation of madison county,d.
oneida county actions 
oneida county follows a property tax foreclosure procedure that is different from madison county.pursuant to county law,the county arranges for and advertises a tax auction for the sale of any property on which taxes,which are uniformly due on january,are delinquent by six months or more.see oneida county,d at.the tax sale is held on the last business day of december.id.the delinquent taxpayer then has three years to redeem the property,and an additional thirty days following receipt of a final notice before redemption.id.at.this process was adhered to with respect to all parcels located within both oneida county and,allegedly,the reservation boundaries established by the treaty of fort schuyler.during the summer and early autumn of,final notices before redemption were delivered to the oin regarding of those parcels.id.at.on october,the oin sought and received a restraining order preventing further foreclosure efforts against any of the parcels,pending this outcome of this litigation.see id.
stockbridge 
stockbridge seeks to intervene in these proceedings based on its contention that land parcels two in oneida county and fifty in madison county are part of an undiminished reservation of the stockbridge band rather than the oneidas.there is litigation pending addressing this claim in the northern district of new york.see state of new york,n.stockbridge argues that the treaty of fort schuyler set aside a permanent reservation for the stockbridge band,separate from a surrounding acre tract reserved for the oneidas.
district court proceedings 
in both of the cases consolidated on appeal,the district court concluded that the remedy of foreclosure was not available to the counties on four independent grounds the nonintercourse act renders the oin properties inalienable and therefore not subject to foreclosure,see madison county,d at oneida county,d at tribal sovereign immunity bars suit against the oin,see madison county,d at oneida county,d at the due process clause of the fifth amendment was violated by the counties failure to give the oin adequate notice of the expiration of the redemption period,see madison county,d at oneida county,d at and the land in question is exempt from taxation under new york state law,see madison county,d at oneida county,d at.
the district court denied stockbridge motion to intervene in oneida county on the ground that stockbridge could not demonstrate sufficient interest in the litigation.see d at.
the counties appeal from the grant of summary judgment against them.stockbridge appeals from the district court denial of its motion to intervene.the state of new york appears as amicus curiae in support of the counties,urging us to reverse the decision of the district court.upon order of this court,the united states also submitted a brief as amicus curiae.in that brief,the united states urges us to affirm on the ground that the oin tribal sovereign immunity bars the counties efforts to foreclose on land.
since this court heard oral argument in this matter,there have been several developments that affect the practical implications of this court decision on madison and oneida counties.while these developments do not render moot any of the issues before this court on appeal,we think it useful to describe them briefly.
in a record of decision issued on may,in response to the oin application,the department of the interior determined that it would take acres of the land at issue in this appeal into trust,pursuant to and part.see department of the interior,record of decision,may,record of decision.notice of this decision was published in the federal register on may.this land will no longer be subject to state or local taxation.as a result,only approximately of the acres of property originally at issue in this case will remain subject to state and local taxation in the future.
in connection with the land trust,in order to satisfy the trust regulations,the oin has posted letters of credit securing the payment of all taxes,penalties,and interest determined by the courts to be due on the land at issue and has agreed to supplement or replace those letters to secure payment of any additional penalties and interest that may accrue while litigation concerning the trust decision is pending.record of decision at.these letters cover substantially all taxes,penalties,and interest assessed on all of the property at issue in this case,including those parcels that the department of the interior has decided not to take into trust.accordingly,notwithstanding this court decision on this appeal,it appears that the counties will receive back payment of all taxes,penalties,and interest due on the property at issue in this lawsuit.despite this development and the practical implications it has for the parties in this case,we reiterate that it does not render moot any of the issues raised on nor affect our consideration of this appeal.

ii.tribal sovereign immunity 
a.the distinction between sovereign authority over reservation lands and sovereign immunity from suit 
the counties assert that the supreme court decision in sherrill requires reversal here because the sherrill court ruled that the land in question is not sovereign tribal land,and it is therefore subject to taxation.the counties interpret sherrill to hold that the oin can not assert sovereign immunity to prevent a foreclosure action on such land.
we think that this argument improperly conflates two distinct doctrines tribal sovereign authority over reservation lands and tribal sovereign immunity from suit.the freedom from state taxation,in the broader context of immunity from state regulation,which is addressed in sherrill,arises from a tribe sovereign authority over its reservation lands.this sovereign authority was examined by the supreme court as early as 
from the commencement of our government,congress has passed acts to regulate trade and intercourse with the indians which treat them as nations,respect their rights,and manifest a firm purpose to afford that protection which treaties stipulate.all these acts manifestly consider the several indian nations as distinct political communities,having territorial boundaries,within which their authority is exclusive 
worcester state of,pet.marshall,abrogated on other grounds as recognized by nevada hicks,d remarking that the indians right to make their own laws and be governed by them does not exclude all state regulatory authority on the reservation.the conceptual clarity of chief justice marshall view in worcester has given way to more individualized treatment of particular treaties and specific federal statutes.mescalero apache tribe jones,d.
but the supreme court has categorical ly maintained that a bsent cession of jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting it,a state is without power to tax reservation lands and reservation indians.county of yakima confederated tribes and bands of yakima indian nation,d internal quotation marks omitted.this principle has been traced in later supreme court decisions to worcester and other cases of its era.see,id.at mescalero,at montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d.
when the supreme court held in sherrill that the oin could not rekindl e embers of sovereignty that long ago grew cold,at,the sovereignty to which it was referring was of the sort described in worcester and its progeny.indeed,the decision of this court that sherrill reversed had focused on this indian sovereignty doctrine,oneida indian nation of,at internal quotation marks omitted,that had emerged from worcester and other century cases,see id.at.the supreme court applied this doctrine to the facts at hand in sherrill when rejecting the oin prayer for relief.
that doctrine is different,however,from the doctrine of tribal immunity from suit.while the tax exemption of reservation land arises from a tribe exercise of sovereignty over such land,and is therefore closely tied to the question of whether the specific parcel at issue is indian reservation land,cass county,leech lake band of chippewa indians,d,a tribe immunity from suit is independent of its lands see kiowa tribe of,d o ur cases have sustained tribal immunity from suit without drawing a distinction based on where the tribal activities occurred.
the doctrine of tribal immunity from suit has a distinctive history in the supreme court.as the court explained in kiowa 
though the doctrine of tribal immunity from suit is settled law and controls this case,we note that it developed almost by accident.the doctrine is said by some of our own opinions to rest on the court opinion in turner united states.though turner is indeed cited as authority for the immunity,examination shows it simply does not stand for that proposition.
turner passing reference to immunity,however,did become an explicit holding that tribes had immunity from suit.we so held in united states fidelity guar,saying these indian nations are exempt from suit without congressional authorization.id.at citing turner,supra,at.as sovereigns or quasi sovereigns,the indian nations enjoyed immunity from judicial attack absent consent to be sued.later cases,albeit with little analysis,reiterated the doctrine.
the doctrine of tribal immunity came under attack a few years ago in.tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of,d we retained the doctrine,however,on the theory that congress had failed to abrogate it 
there are considerations that might suggest a need to abrogate tribal immunity,at least as an overarching rule.respondent does not ask us to repudiate the principle outright,but suggests instead that we confine it to reservations or to noncommercial activities.we decline to draw this distinction in this case,as we defer to the role congress may wish to exercise in this important judgment.
congress has acted against the background of our decisions.it has restricted tribal immunity from suit in limited circumstances.and in other statutes it has declared an intention not to alter it.
congress has occasionally authorized limited classes of suits against indian tribes and has always been at liberty to dispense with such tribal immunity or to limit it.potawatomi,supra,at.it has not yet done so.
at citations omitted.
the kiowa court highlighted the separate and independent natures of the doctrines of tribal immunity from taxation and other powers of the state,and tribal immunity from suit that controls the case at bar 
we have recognized that a state may have authority to tax or regulate tribal activities occurring within the state but outside indian country.to say substantive state laws apply to conduct,however,is not to say that a tribe no longer enjoys immunity from suit.in potawatomi,for example,we reaffirmed that while oklahoma may tax cigarette sales by a tribe store to nonmembers,the tribe enjoys immunity from a suit to collect unpaid state taxes.there is a difference between the right to demand compliance with state laws and the means available to enforce them.
id.at.citations omitted.
while the doctrine of tribal sovereign authority over land has undergone considerable evolution in the supreme court in response to changed circumstances,mcclanahan state tax comm of,d,the doctrine of tribal immunity from suit has not.the kiowa court indicated in the portion of the opinion set forth above that it looks to congress for any such change.
in light of this history,we do not read sherrill as implicitly abrogating the oin immunity from suit.no such statement of abrogation was made by the sherrill court,nor does the opinion call into question the kiowa court approach,that any such abrogation should be left to congress.sherrill dealt with the right to demand compliance with state laws.kiowa,at.it did not address the means available to enforce those laws.id.
application to the case at bar 
we are left then with the rule stated in kiowa as a matter of federal law,an indian tribe is subject to suit only where congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.id.at.we therefore agree with the district court that the remedy of foreclosure is not available to the counties unless and until congress authorizes such suits or the oin consents to such suits.because neither of these events has occurred,the foreclosure actions are barred by the oin immunity from suit.
the counties argue that the notion that they may tax but not foreclose is inconsistent and contradictory.to be sure,the result is reminiscent of words of the nursery rhyme 
mother,may i go out to swim yes,my darling daughter hang your clothes on a hickory limb,and do go near the water 
or,as the counties more soberly assert,such a rule eviscerates sherrill,making that essential right of government to tax properties meaningless.appellants br.at.
but a similar argument was rejected by the supreme court in potawatomi there,the court held that oklahoma had the authority to tax certain cigarette sales made at the tribe convenience store.potawatomi,at.the court also ruled that the tribe immunity from suit prevented the state from bringing suit to collect unpaid taxes.the court reconciled these two rulings thus 
oklahoma complains that,in effect,decisions such as moe confederated salish and kootenai tribes of flathead reservation,d,and washington confederated tribes of colville reservation,d,authorizing taxation in certain circumstances give them a right without any remedy.there is no doubt that sovereign immunity bars the state from pursuing the most efficient remedy,but we are not persuaded that it lacks any adequate alternatives.we have never held that individual agents or officers of a tribe are not liable for damages in actions brought by the state states may also enter into agreements with the tribes to adopt a mutually satisfactory regime for the collection of this sort of tax.and if oklahoma and other states similarly situated find that none of these alternatives produce the revenues to which they are entitled,they may of course seek appropriate legislation from congress.
at citations omitted.
individual tribal members and tribal officers in their official capacity remain susceptible to suits for damages and injunctive relief.see puyallup tribe,dep t of game of state of,d w hether or not the tribe itself may be sued in a state court without its consent or that of congress,a suit to enjoin violations of state law by individual tribal members is permissible.they may therefore be enjoined from violations of state law.but if such enforcement mechanisms fail and if no agreement can be reached between the counties and the oin,the counties ultimate recourse will be to congress,as we understand the supreme court to have instructed.
because we affirm on the ground that the foreclosure actions are barred by the oin sovereign immunity from suit,we need not and do not reach the other three rationales relied upon by the district court.
iii.abstention 
the counties argue that the district court erred as a matter of law in refusing to abstain from interfering with the counties tax foreclosure process.appellants br.at.we evaluate a district court determination not to abstain de novo,because it implicates the court subject matter jurisdiction.hartford courant pellegrino,cir.we agree with the district court,see madison county,d at,that abstention is not appropriate here.
the counties abstention argument appears to be based on,which states that t he district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.as the counties note,though,in moe confederated salish and kootenai tribes
