background 
leftridge,an african american,commenced the present action in july,alleging that,while driving in connecticut in october,he had been stopped by trooper and charged with a traffic violation,the complaint alleged that that charge was false and that the trooper actions were motivated by leftridge race,in violation of,inter alia,the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.
in august,leftridge moved for the appointment of counsel to represent him.the district court denied the motion,concluding that the plaintiff position does not seem likely to be of substance and that the legal issues are not complex and the plaintiff has demonstrated in his filings that he is able to investigate the facts of the case and present them to the court.order dated october.
defendants moved to dismiss leftridge complaint on the grounds,inter alia,that they were entitled to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.before responding to the motion,leftridge moved in may for reconsideration of the district court denial of his motion for the appointment of counsel.he stated that he lacked knowledge of the law,was not experienced in or competent to understand the litigation process,and was stressed and frustrated with the case.the court denied reconsideration.see order dated june.in july,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint on eleventh amendment grounds insofar as it asserted claims against the state agencies,but denied the motion to dismiss insofar as the complaint asserted claims against trooper in his individual capacity.see order dated july.
leftridge immediately renewed his motion for appointment of counsel.he stated that he was undergoing stress and that he was not competent to proceed because of his lack of experience and legal knowledge.the court denied the motion,stating that leftridge ha d not provided any basis upon which the court should reconsider its previous orders.order dated august.leftridge,despite having indicated that he could not litigate his claims without the assistance of counsel,proceeded with the case pro se,making numerous motions with respect to,inter alia,discovery matters,his desire to amend the complaint,and a potential default judgment against the trooper.
in february,leftridge again moved for the appointment of counsel,stating that he had an anxiety and stress disorder and that his doctor had advised that he should not be representing himself.the district court promptly denied the motion,stating that the court earlier ruling remains in effect,and directing leftridge to follow instructions previously given by the court as to the time by which and the manner in which pretrial discovery was to be completed,so that motions for summary judgment could be filed.order dated february.leftridge then submitted a february,letter to the court from his psychologist,who stated in pertinent part as follows 
i have been treating vernon leftridge since october.i have advised leftridge on multiple occasions that his serving as his own attorney has been causing him inordinate anxiety and stress.consequently,i have recommended to him that he pursue hiring an attorney.he has informed me that you need my verification of such,in order to appoint him counsel or to grant him the time to seek legal counsel.
following its receipt of this letter,the district court entered a further order stating as follows 
the plaintiff filed an exhibit in which his psychologist confirms that the plaintiff is experiencing anxiety and stress as a result of representing himself in this case.the court has previously declined to appoint counsel for the plaintiff because his position does not seem likely to be of substance.that ruling remains in effect,but it does not prevent the plaintiff from hiring counsel on his own.if the plaintiff wishes to pursue this case,he may attempt to hire counsel by,and that attorney may then pursue the plaintiff claims.given the present circumstances,the case should be administratively closed without prejudice to reopening by an attorney for the plaintiff the clerk is directed to administratively close this file.
order dated february,february order emphases added.the february order also terminated other motions by leftridge that had been pending.id.
on june,as the june deadline for him to retain counsel approached,leftridge moved for,inter alia,an extension of time in order to enable him to raise funds to be able to retain a specified attorney.the court den ied the motion for extension of time,as the plaintiff has failed to establish that an attorney is on the verge of filing an appearance for him.order dated june,june order.
in the meantime,on june,leftridge also filed a motion to reopen the case notwithstanding his not having retained counsel.he also indicated that he would continue to attempt to raise the money needed to retain counsel.the district court denied the motion to reopen,stating that the court already ruled on the issue in the june order denying an extension of time to obtain counsel.order dated july,july order.
leftridge filed a notice of appeal,contending that the judgment entered on july,den ied him the right to reopen his case as a pro.he thereafter filed additional motions in the district court,again asking the district court to reopen his case or extend his time to retain an attorney.those motions were denied on the ground that they provided no new information.see order dated july,order dated july,july order.the latter order also noted that leftridge had already filed a notice of appeal as to the court decision not to reopen the case.july order.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,leftridge argues principally that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen his case to allow him to proceed pro se when he could not afford to retain an attorney.he also contends that the court abused its discretion in denying several of his other motions.defendants,while noting that the district court did not enter a judgment in this case,urge us to affirm the closure of the case on the ground that it was properly dismissed for lack of prosecution or for failure to comply with court orders.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that despite the lack of a judgment,we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal pursuant to and we conclude that the district court refusal to reopen the case because of leftridge failure to retain an attorney constituted an abuse of discretion.
