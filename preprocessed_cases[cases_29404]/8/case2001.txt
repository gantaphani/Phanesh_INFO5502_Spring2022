this appeal arises from the involuntary dismissal of plaintiff walter drake plaintiff or relator civil action against a government defense contractor,defendant norden systems,now known as nsi,norden,and its corporate parent,defendant united technologies corporation united technologies.drake,a norden accountant,brought his action on behalf of the united states alleging that the defendants had made false claims for payment and otherwise defrauded the government in violation of the false claims act.the allegations of the complaint,if they are proven,do not paint a pretty picture.
when drake deadline for amending his complaint,the united states district court for the district of connecticut burns,dismissed the action for failure to prosecute.drake appeals the judgment of dismissal,entered february,as well as the order on which it was based and a subsequent order denying his motion to be relieved from the judgment.
we do not doubt a district judge authority to dismiss actions based on a plaintiff failure to prosecute.such authority is of ancient origin.dismissal for want of prosecution could be imposed under the english common law if a plaintiff suffer ed three terms to elapse without moving forward in the cause.william blackstone,commentaries.chicago press.today the district court authority is expressly recognized in federal rule of civil procedure b.see link wabash,d.indeed,the involuntary dismissal is an important tool for preventing undue delays and avoiding docket congestion.see id.at.but it is also one of the harshest sanctions at a trial court disposal,since it usually extinguishes the plaintiff cause of action and denies plaintiff his day in court.as a result,it is reserved for use only in the most extreme circumstances.
while we agree with the district court that drake delay was inexcusably long,we do not agree that the circumstances were sufficiently egregious or that drake actions were so contumacious as to warrant dismissal of his entire complaint.thus,we hold it was an abuse of the district court discretion to dismiss plaintiff complaint.

drake complaint 
plaintiff commenced his qui tam action on june,alleging that he had uncovered a number of false claims act violations committed by defendants.he filed the complaint under seal in accordance with the above procedures.the government investigated the matter for three years and,finally,on june,declined to intervene.the complaint was then unsealed,served on defendants norden and united technologies,and later amended twice.drake filed his second amended complaint on december.
he based his claims on billing and accounting practices that he uncovered as supervisor of facilities accounting in norden finance department.plaintiff claims are divided into four against norden alone,one against united technologies alone,and one against norden and united technologies together.
count asserts norden violated a and a by knowingly presenting the united states with false claims for payment and backing up these claims with false records or statements.according to drake,these claims,records,and statements were contained in the following categories of documents that norden transmitted to the government progress bills,certificates of indirect cost rates,disclosure statements,contracts,and present responsibility reports.drake alleges norden claims were false because they included a unallowable property tax costs,b the depreciation costs of assets that either did not exist,had been sold or written off,or were unrelated to government contracts,c the depreciation costs of assets that were not capitalized according to norden written policy,and d certain costs that were inaccurately categorized as relating to research and development.
count asserts norden violated a and a by making false statements to conceal an obligation to repay money to the united states.count makes the same assertion against united technologies.as with the statements alleged in count,drake alleges the false statements on which counts and are based were contained in progress bills,certificates of indirect cost rates,disclosure statements,contracts,and present responsibility reports.
count asserts norden and united technologies conspired,in violation of a,to defraud the united states by getting a false claim allowed or paid.according to drake,this occurred after he brought norden improper accounting practices to united technologies attention.instead of rectifying the situation,united technologies allegedly entered into an unlawful understanding and agreement with norden to conceal the misconduct and allow norden to continue defrauding the government.
district court august,ruling 
on january,defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted and for failure to plead fraud with sufficient specificity.before the district court ruled on this motion,however,it stayed the case for six months in order to await a supreme court ruling in another case deciding whether false claims act relators have standing.once the supreme court answered that question in the affirmative,see.agency of natural,at,the trial court proceeded to consider defendants motion to dismiss,and rendered its decision on august.
with respect to the claims against norden in counts and,the court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.it held that only the progress bills constituted claims for the purpose of subsection a,and that only the progress bills and certificates of indirect cost rates constituted records or statements for the purposes of subsections a and a.to the extent that the a,a,a claims relied on these documents,the court denied the motion to dismiss.to the extent the claims relied on other,disclosure statements,contracts,and present responsibility reports the district court dismissed these claims with prejudice.
it also held that drake allegations of norden improper research and development charges were insufficiently specific to support his causes of action.to the extent that drake a,a,a claims relied on these charges,the trial court dismissed those claims without prejudice.other than above specified,it held counts and adequately stated claims against norden for violations of a,a a.
the trial court dismissed entirely drake count claim against united technologies for violations of a,and his count claim against both defendants for violations of a.it dismissed the former with prejudice,because it held that united technologies had no monetary obligations to the government to begin with,making it impossible for that defendant to have violated a since a imposes liability for making a false statement to avoid an obligation to pay money to the government.the court dismissed count without prejudice because it held this claim was pleaded with insufficient specificity.
in sum,the district court disposed of the numerous allegations in plaintiff complaint in three different ways,as follows it dismissed with prejudice the a,a a claims against norden to the extent that they relied on disclosure statements,contracts,and present responsibility reports,and the a claim against united technologies in its entirety.it dismissed without prejudice the a,a a claims against norden to the extent that they relied on the insufficiently specific allegations of research and development charges,and the a claim against both defendants in its entirety.finally,the district court left standing the a,a,a claims against norden to the extent that these claims relied on progress bills and certificates of indirect cost rates and to the extent that they did not rely on the allegations of research and development charges.
by dismissing some of drake claims without prejudice,the court left open the possibility that plaintiff could replead them with greater specificity.at the end of its decision,the district court wrote relator shall file within days a final amended complaint to conform the pleadings to this ruling within the confines of.c.
events leading to involuntary dismissal 
for some reason,drake did not file this final amended complaint within days.according to drake brief on appeal,this was an inexcusable mistake on the part of drake of which drake was unaware.
on july,months after the district court ruled on motions for partial summary judgment that the parties had previously filed.it denied drake motion,but granted defendants motion.defendants had attacked drake a,a a claims to the extent that they relied on allegations of norden failing to follow its own written policy on the capitalization of fixed assets.defendants argued,and the court agreed,that these allegations would not make out a violation of the false claims act even were they true.the court therefore dismissed drake claims to the extent that they relied on these allegations.at the same time,it made clear that plaintiff still had other viable claims.it noted that drake had not amended his complaint within days as required by its previous direction,but it did not indicate what the consequences to plaintiff of that failure would be.
on january,the district court clerk sent notice to drake that there had been no action taken in the case for six months,and that the case was therefore subject to dismissal under the court local rules of procedure unless drake submitted a satisfactory explanation for his delay within days.drake counsel responded within days by filing a third amended complaint and explaining that the delay had been caused by the complexity of the claims,the large amount of discovery and motions,and scheduling conflicts.
defendants then moved to strike the third amended complaint and dismiss the case for failure to prosecute under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted that motion on february,and entered judgment for defendants two days later drake moved to amend or alter the judgment for relief from the judgment,and the district court denied this motion on june.from the order of dismissal and the order denying reconsideration,plaintiff appeals.
discussion 
we review a dismissal for failure to prosecute under the abuse of discretion standard.see minnette time warner,cir.we may find that the district court abused its discretion if its decision was based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.wynder mcmahon,cir.further,although the dismissal of a complaint is discretionary for a trial judge,we are not faced with a case in which the trial court discretionary actions are based on its observations in the courtroom or its superior opportunity to get a feel of the case.cone.pulp paper.maurice rosenberg,appellate review of trial court discretion.in this case,the appellate record contains all the materials upon which the district court decision hinged.thus,we need not blindly defer to the trial court choice.
we have in fact fashioned guiding rules that limit a trial court discretion in this context,see peart city of new york,cir,out of recognition,as noted,that dismissal for failure to prosecute is a harsh remedy to be utilized only in extreme situations.minnette,at.in particular,we review the trial court decision by examining whether the plaintiff failure to prosecute caused a delay of significant duration plaintiff was given notice that further delay would result in dismissal defendant was likely to be prejudiced by further delay the need to alleviate court calendar congestion was carefully balanced against plaintiff right to an opportunity for a day in court and the trial court adequately assessed the efficacy of lesser sanctions.see,martens thomann,cir shannon,cir.no one factor is dispositive,and ultimately we must review the dismissal in light of the record as a whole.see peart,at.
i the five factors 
the first factor to be examined breaks down into two parts whether the failures to prosecute were those of the plaintiff,and whether these failures were of significant duration.see martens,at.the district court answered both questions in the affirmative,and we agree with its assessment.
drake effectively concedes that there was no excuse for his counsel delay,but he emphasizes that it was nonetheless his counsel rather than he himself who was at fault.this apportionment of blame between counsel and client,however,is best considered when we get to the fifth of lesser sanctions.see dodson runyon,cir.the question we must ask with respect to duration is simply whether or not the delay was caused by plaintiff side as a whole.framed in this way,we agree with the district court that drake side was at fault.
we also agree that plaintiff delay was significant.indeed,this length of time is comparable to,if not longer than,delays that have supported dismissals in other cases.see chira lockheed aircraft,cir delay accord lyell theatre loews,cir noting that delays supporting dismissals have ranged from a matter of months to a period of years.if duration were the only factor,we would have no hesitation in affirming the district court dismissal.
the notice factor,in contrast,cuts against dismissal.the question we must answer here is whether drake received notice that further delays would result in dismissal,martens,at.he did not.
the only actual notice drake received was the court clerk warning that the case would be dismissed unless drake submitted a satisfactory explanation for his delay within days.relator responded by submitting not only an explanation,but also the final amended complaint within that time.nonetheless,his case was dismissed.while the district court questioned,in a footnote,whether the final amended complaint fully complied with the august,ruling,it did not base its decision on plaintiff past delay,or on any defects in his final amended complaint.
this was not,then,notice that drake case would be dismissed if there was further delay.rather,this was notice that relator case would be dismissed as a result of the past delay.apparently the only thing plaintiff could have done differently to save his case after receiving the notice would have been to provide a better explanation for the past delay.simply ending the delay by filing the final amended complaint obviously was not enough.
defendants argue that,regardless of the clerk warning,drake was on notice that he was risking dismissal through delay based on one of the district of connecticut local rules of civil procedure.during the period in question,local rule a read as follows
