industrial risk insurers iri the subrogee of,amicus silverstein properties,silverstein brought,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,a claim of gross negligence against,inter alia,citigroup and citigroup global market holdings,together,citigroup.upon reviewing the parties submissions,the district court dismissed iri complaint pursuant to rule b.see indus.risk insurers port auth.of,et,d.
iri now appeals from that judgment and,in addition,iri has moved for partial vacatur of the district court opinion and order.for the reasons stated below,while we affirm the judgment of the district court,we remand iri motion for partial vacatur to the district court,to allow that court to consider that motion in the first instance.
background 
citigroup was the largest tenant in world trade center wtc,a office tower that had stood adjacent to the twin towers of the world trade center.on september,as a result of the attacks on the nearby twin towers,wtc caught fire.for the next seven hours,wtc burned wildly,until the building ultimately collapsed to the ground.iri had provided property insurance to silverstein for wtc,and in the wake of this damage,has paid in excess of million in property loss to silverstein.
i.the industrial risk insurers action 
in the present case,iri charged citigroup with gross negligence.citigroup,as wtc largest tenant,assertedly chose to design,construct,and install a generator system in wtc,which pumped fuel through the entire building at all times.iri claims that this generator system was unreasonably dangerous,and that,while citigroup alleged gross negligence did not cause the initial combustion in wtc,it directly led to an aggravation of fire damage and the ultimate collapse of the building.as noted above,the district court dismissed iri complaint pursuant to rule b.
on appeal,iri argues that the district court improperly concluded,as a matter of law,that citigroup conduct was not gross negligence that the district court erred in holding that new york subrogation waiver doctrine precluded iri from asserting a claim sounding in gross negligence and that the district court erred in applying the doctrine of assumption of risk to bar iri gross negligence claim.
iri submitted its appellant brief to this court on may.before citigroup had submitted its appellee brief,however,our court decided paul fire marine ins.universal builders supply,cir holding that a waiver of subrogation clause bars a claim of gross negligence under new york law.citigroup then filed its appellee brief on june,in which it paul required us to affirm the district court subrogation waiver holding.
the district court decision with respect to the waiver of subrogation clause is independent of the district court other two bases for granting the motion to,that citigroup conduct,as a matter of law,was not gross negligence,and that the assumption of risk doctrine would bar iri gross negligence claim even if that claim were otherwise meritorious.accordingly,given requires us to affirm the judgment of the district is unnecessary,and hence would be improper,for us to consider the alternative grounds relied on by the district court.
iri recognized as much,and,since it feared that the district court by no means unassailable holding on assumption of risk might have collateral estoppel effects in other litigation arising out of september,iri moved for partial vacatur of the district court decision on the assumption of risk issue citigroup consented to iri motion.
this court,by order dated may,ruled that iri motion seeking partial vacatur was more accurately an amendment to its appellate brief thus,it should be heard,after full briefing by both parties,by the panel deciding the appeal.indus.risk insurers port auth.of,et,cir.may,unpublished order.we treated iri motion in this manner because iri has not formally abandoned its appeal.
ii.the aegis action 
in a completely separate lawsuit in which both amec construction management,amec and silverstein are parties,the assumption of risk issue was raised.see aegis ins,world trade center,in re property damage and business loss litigation,d aegis.in the aegis action,aegis insurance services aegis,the subrogee of consolidated edison,brought a gross negligence claim against citigroup,on the theory that citigroup was negligent in designing,constructing,installing,and maintaining its generator system in wtc.silverstein and citigroup were both parties to the aegis action,but amec initially was not.silverstein,however,impleaded amec as a defendant.
on march,judge hellerstein dismissed silverstein claims for two,independent,reasons that amec owed no duty to silverstein because there was no contractual privity or its functional equivalent between the parties,id.at,and that,as judge hellerstein had previously held in the industrial risk insurers action,silverstein assumed the risks associated with the citigroup fuel system,id.at.
iii.the motions to intervene in the industrial risk insurers action 
shortly before judge hellerstein issued his ruling dismissing silverstein claims against amec in the aegis case,amec learned of iri motion for partial vacatur in the industrial risk insurers case.amec sought to intervene,because,
if vacatur was granted,it would cast a cloud of disapproval on judge hellerstein assumption of risk holding,perhaps influencing his consideration of amec then pending motion to dismiss in the aegis action.additionally,amec was concerned that,because iri and citigroup no longer had any real stake in the assumption of risk issue on appeal,the arguments in favor of judge hellerstein ruling on that question might not be adequately presented to this court by the parties to the appeal in the iri action 
brief for amec construction management,as amicus curiae at,indus.risk insurers port auth.of,et,cir.june.soon thereafter,silverstein also moved to intervene.
after amec and silverstein had moved to intervene in the industrial risk insurers case,judge hellerstein issued his ruling in the aegis action.because judge hellerstein offered two independent grounds for dismissing silverstein claims against lack of contractual duty,and assumption of now concedes that any influence that vacatur might have had prospectively on judge hellerstein decision is no longer a concern for amec.amec amicus brief at.
iv.this court may,order 
on may,this court issued an order denying amec and silverstein motions to intervene in the industrial risk insurers case,but inviting them to file amicus briefs and participate in oral argument.we also noted that since we could affirm the district court judgment in the industrial risk insurers case on its paul holding alone,there was no need for us to review judge hellerstein assumption of risk holding in this appeal.indus.risk insurers port auth.of,et,cir.may,unpublished order.accordingly,the only issue still in active dispute today is whether to grant iri motion for partial vacatur.
discussion 
having carefully considered the parties arguments,we now affirm the judgment of the district court,doing so solely on the basis of its subrogation waiver holding,and turn to whether iri motion for partial vacatur should be granted.we have recognized that a party who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling,but is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce in the judgment.major league baseball,pacific trading cards,cir quoting bancorp mortgage bonner mall,d.at the same time,we have acknowledged that vacatur should be regarded as an extraordinary remedy because judicial precedents have social value.id.
amec argues,in its amicus brief to us,that iri should not be entitled to partial vacatur of the district court opinion because,a lthough it is clear,in light of this court ruling in paul,that iri appeal stood virtually no chance of success,nevertheless the paul decision in and of itself did not moot iri appeal,as that decision did not require iri to abandon its own appeal.amec amicus brief at footnote omitted.this argument misconstrues iri position.iri motion for partial vacatur was effectively an amendment to its appellate brief it was not a
