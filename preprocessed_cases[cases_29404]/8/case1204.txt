this appeal primarily concerns a narrow issue of federal procedural law and an equally narrow issue of new york procedural law.the federal law issue is whether a real party defendant in interest that owns and operates a entity that was improperly sued in state court may remove a diversity case to federal court without filing an appearance in the state court prior to attempting removal.the state law issue is whether new york rule tolling a limitations period because of a plaintiff insanity,mckinney,applies to the facts of this case.these issues arise on an appeal by plaintiff appellant maria la russo,as attorney in fact for her son,matthew de lucia,from the march,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york edgardo ramos,district judge.the judgment,entered after the district court denied la russo challenge to removal,granted a motion by defendant appellee george university,sgu to dismiss because la russo complaint was.see la russo george university school of medicine,d.the complaint asserted medical malpractice,breach of contract,and negligence claims based on alleged failures by george university school of medicine sgu med.or the school to appropriately treat de lucia mental illness.
we conclude that the case was properly removed and that the complaint was properly dismissed as.we therefore affirm.
background 
the following facts are based primarily on la russo complaint,which we assume to be true for purposes of this appeal.see,goldstein pataki,cir.
la russo son,de lucia,was formerly a student at sgu med.in grenada.prior to his attending the school,la russo and her son attended an information session at which school staff assured attendees that there would be medical facilities and treatment available for students on the grenada campus,including medical evacuation if needed.complaint.they were also provided with a publication entitled george university school of medicine think beyond,which stated 
university health services uhs maintains modern clinic facilities with scheduled and hours from am to pm,monday through friday.additionally,there is daily hour coverage by physicians and physician assistants to provide students with emergency care when the clinic is closed.medical emergencies in grenada are referred to grenada general hospital or augustine clinic university health services facilitates with air evacuation,if indicated,on both campuses.
in january,de lucia received a letter of admission from the school.enclosed with the letter was a handbook from the office of the dean of students that stated,the office of the dean of students advocates on behalf of students to help you make the best use of the services available both on and off campus.any student with mental or physical disabilities is provided a wide range of support services.id.
de lucia began attending the school in august.in the spring of,he visited with his faculty advisor,jacqueline stanley.de lucia arrived at the meeting looking disheveled and dressed in sweat pants despite the hot climate and asked to see the dean regarding academic issues.stanley told de lucia he could not see the dean due to his attire and encouraged him instead to go to the beach and take a vacation.stanley did not advise de lucia to visit the counseling department,speak with the dean of students,or see any medical or mental health professional who would have been able to counsel him and provide medical treatment and medication as necessary.id.
de lucia went on a sailing trip in may of.upon his return,he was suffering from mental illness.he wandered aimlessly on and off the school campus,and was disoriented and sickly.id.other students alerted school officials to de lucia condition.in response,school security officers picked up de lucia in the middle of the and escorted him to mount gay hospital in grenada,an institution la russo claims had a bad reputation,maintained deplorable and unsafe conditions,and did not administer appropriate care.id.
school staff failed to inform de lucia parents about his admission to the hospital and failed to provide an informative response to his parents messages.id.on may,after being notified of de lucia admission to the hospital by fellow students,de lucia father traveled to the hospital where he found his son in an outdoor cell lying on a concrete floor without a mattress,naked except for boxer shorts that were hanging down.id.de lucia was incoherent due to overdosing of haldol and other drugs,id,and was experiencing muscle weakness,muscle tremors,dilated eyes,drowsiness,and dry mouth and lips due to his overmedication and a lack of adequate hydration,id.his body was covered with insect bites and a noxious odor of urine and feces permeated his person.id.de lucia parents obtained his release from mount gay hospital on may,and he returned to the united states the following day.
de lucia returned to the school twice in attempts to complete his medical education.on both occasions,however,he became ill and returned to the united states.since his return to the united states,de lucia has required medical treatment to ameliorate conditions that were prior to his admission to mount gay hospital.
la russo lawsuit.la russo initiated a lawsuit in new york supreme court by filing a notice and summons.she alleged that sgu med.engaged in psychiatric malpractice,breached its contract with de lucia,and was negligent.la russo claims were based on the school response to de lucia mental health difficulties while he was a student at the school.her psychiatric malpractice claim stems from the school fail ure to refer de lucia to counseling or other medical treatment and,though aware of his condition,its fail ure to intervene and provide de lucia with proper psychiatric and medical treatment.id.
la russo also alleges a breach of contract claim.she alleges that a contract was formed between the school and de lucia when the school offered a variety of educational and related services to de lucia and de lucia agreed to,and did,pay tuition in exchange for those services.id.further,she alleges that the school breached the contract when,instead of providing medical treatment by physicians and physician assistants at the school facilities,appropriate emergency care,or emergency evacuation,the school failed to provide proper medical treatment id.
finally,la russo alleges that the defendants owed both herself and de lucia a duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence in safeguarding de lucia,and ensuring that no unnecessary harm befell him.id.she alleges that the school employees agents,including stanley,negligently failed to use due care handling de lucia mental illness.id.she also alleges that the school breached its duty to properly train its employees to recognize and properly address a student need for psychological services a student psychological crisis.id.
la russo lawsuit was filed on november.the notice and summons named george university school of medicine as the sole defendant and was amended to add ten doe defendants.la russo served a copy of the summons and notice on the new york secretary of state,mailed a copy by certified mail to sgu med.in grenada,and also served the summons and notice on george university,llc,but not sgu.
on march,la russo sought an order to show cause seeking permission to file a supplemental summons adding sgu,sgu llc,uss llc,and stanley as defendants,and seeking a ruling that the claims against the additional defendants related back to the time the initial summons was filed.the order to show cause was issued on march.on april,one day before the order to show cause was returnable,sgu,asserting that it was the entity that owns and operates the named defendant in the caption,filed a notice of removal to the district court.
la russo moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that because sgu had never formally intervened in the action or been joined as a defendant,removal was improper.the district court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the defendants motion to dismiss under rule b because the medical malpractice claim was and the contract and negligence claims were duplicative of the malpractice claim.
discussion 
la russo first contends that sgu had no authority to remove this case to the district court.she argues that if sgu believed that sgu med.lacked capacity to be sued,it should have moved to dismiss the case in state court.la russo further contends that under new york general associations law,she may sue sgu med.as an unincorporated association.sgu replies that where,as here,a legally entity is named as a defendant,the only logical defendant vested with authority to remove is the real defendant in interest,which here is sgu.
initially we note that la russo attempt to sue sgu med.was ineffective.rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides,with an exception not relevant to this case that state law governs whether a party has the capacity to be sued.b capacity to sue or be sued is determined as follows for all other parties other than an individual or corporation,by the law of the state where the court is located.under new york law,an action against an unincorporated association can be brought only against the president or treasurer.ass ns law mckinney.see,fairfield lease empire employees sunshine club,the fatal defect in the plaintiff contention is that this action,if it is to be maintained,must be against the president of the association.league of mutual taxi owners united const.workers,local,defendant is described in the complaint as an unincorporated association as such,it is not considered a legal entity,but section of the general associations law provides for the maintenance of actions against the president or treasurer of the association.la russo did not sue either the president or the treasurer of sgu med.sgu med.itself was not an entity with capacity to be sued under state law 
we next turn to the issue whether sgu was entitled to remove the case to the district court.sgu asserts it was entitled to remove because,as the owner and operator of the entity that la russo attempted to sue,it is the real defendant in interest.br.for sgu at.although the quoted phrase appears to describe accurately the status of sgu in this litigation,we pause to consider it because it does not appear in the federal rules of civil procedure,including rule,or in the removal statute.
rule a,captioned,real party in interest,provides an action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.a.in terms,the rule appears to apply to the party initiating an action,not a defendant resisting a claim.that is the view of a leading treatise.by its very nature,rule a applies only to those who are asserting a claim and thus is of most importance with regard to plaintiffs,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed,and flatly declares,rule a is limited to plaintiffs,id.
the phrase real party defendant in interest appears to have entered federal jurisprudence in in the syllabus to an opinion ruling that the wife of an executor was the real party defendant in interest whose assets would be diminished by the lawsuit.see witters sowles.the phrase has been used mostly by district courts,occasionally by courts of appeals,and once by the supreme court,see lumbermen mutual casualty elbert.
the first decision to use the phrase in the context of a challenged removal is the opinion of district judge charles haight,in aslett crosfield electronics,civ,wl.crosfield electronics removed to the district court a case filed in a state court against an entity identified as crosfield electronics,the plaintiff sought a remand to the state court on the ground that removal could be achieved only by the party named as a defendant in the complaint,crosfield electronics.affidavits established that crosfield electronics,was a trade name of crosfield electronics and had no legal existence or the capacity to be sued.
acknowledging that a permits the defendant to remove a case over which a district court has jurisdiction,judge haight declined to read the defendant as the entity named as a defendant in the complaint,and instead read the phrase to mean the real party defendant in interest.aslett,wl,at.as he explained,removal can not be denied to this defendant merely because plaintiff improperly sued its fictitious trade name.id.removal by the real party defendant in interest was subsequently approved by other district courts.see hillberry wal mart stores east,no.cv h,wl,named defendant was entity pioneer exploration,kansas gas service,wl,named defendant existed only to license trade name.
the real party defendant in interest is not only entitled to remove,but,if it seeks removal,it must act promptly because the day interval in which it is permitted to do so,see b,begins when it is on notice that the wrong company defendant has been named.hillberry,wl,at see ware wyndham worldwide,civ,wl,at june,day interval started when real defendant accepted service of complaint,although complaint named entity.
the unstated premise of all of these decisions,with which we fully agree,is that the concept of a real party defendant in interest is not only entirely valid,it is an important aspect of removal jurisprudence,despite the absence of the phrase from rule or elsewhere in the federal rules of civil procedure.
we next consider la russo contention that even if sgu was entitled to remove,it failed to do so properly because it had not entered an appearance in the state court.la russo makes this claim obliquely by pointing out that in all of the removal cases discussed above,the removing defendant had filed an appearance in the state court.the argument lacks merit.nothing in sections or requires a removing defendant to have appeared in the state court proceeding prior to removal.nor is there merit in la russo claim that removal was improper because sgu was not served.service of process upon a removing defendant is not a prerequisite to removal.see delgado shell oil,cir city of ann arbor employees retirement system gecht,no.c,wl,at.
next,we consider la russo claim that,even if sgu properly removed,the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction.contrary to her claim,diversity jurisdiction was not destroyed by the listing of sgu,alleged to be a new york resident,as a named defendant.as a entity that can not be sued,its being named as a purported defendant does not destroy diversity jurisdiction.furthermore,e ven if a named defendant is a citizen,however,it is appropriate for a federal court to dismiss such a defendant and retain diversity jurisdiction if the complaint shows there is no possibility that the plaintiff can establish any cause of action against that defendant.tillman reynolds tobacco,cir.nor is there merit in la russo claim that diversity jurisdiction is lacking because sgu is owned by george university,llc,a delaware corporation that plaintiff alleged has a business presence in new york.diversity jurisdiction depends on the citizenship of a corporate defendant with capacity to be sued,see c,not the citizenship of the corporate defendant corporate owner.
ii.timeliness and the insanity toll 
the district court concluded that la russo claim was timebarred because the two and year limitations period for the medical malpractice claim,see a mckinney,expired on november,one day before the summons was filed.see dist,d at.the court deemed the limitations period to start when de lucia malpractice accrued,which was may,the day de lucia was brought to mount gay hospital.see id.however,provides,if a person entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy or insanity at the time the cause of action accrues,and if the time otherwise limited is less than three years,the time shall be extended by the period of disability.la russo does not dispute that she filed her claims after the limitations period of two and years for her malpractice claim had run.she argues that the statute of limitations should be tolled because of de lucia insanity for at least two days,apparently referring to may and,the day de lucia was brought to mount gay hospital and the next day when his father observed his condition at the hospital.two days of de lucia insanity would have extended the limitations period to november,in which event the summons,filed on nove
