appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york pollack,quashing its deposition subpoena of dennis friedman,friedman,an attorney who previously served as counsel during merger negotiations to a corporation of which the are former directors.the former directors are being sued by in the united states district court for the district of delaware for breach of their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger and have raised a defense based on friedman advice.although no longer serving as a formal adviser to the former directors,friedman is a partner at the law firm now representing them in the delaware litigation.the district court ruled,relying on the rule set forth in shelton american motors,cir,that must exhaust all practical alternative means of obtaining the information sought from friedman before it would consider allowing the proposed deposition and ordered to proceed first by written interrogatories.we conclude that the regime of the federal rules of civil procedure requires a more flexible approach to attorney depositions than the rigid shelton rule,which improperly guided the district court exercise of discretion in quashing the subpoena,but we need not rule definitively on the matter,because we have recently been advised that friedman has consented to the deposition,thereby rendering this appeal moot.
background 
the liquidation trust of hechinger investment company of delaware,and the,former members of the company board of directors,are currently involved in securities litigation in the united states district court for the district of delaware.that litigation concerns the defendants actions in connection with the merger of hechinger investment company hechinger and another home improvement company,builder square.the combined companies declared bankruptcy approximately two years after the merger.plaintiff an unsecured creditors committee subsequently brought the underlying delaware lawsuit,claiming inter alia that hechinger former directors breached their fiduciary duties to the company creditors by approving the merger.the directors have asserted affirmative defenses in the lawsuit based on the business judgment rule and their reliance on the advice of their counsel,friedman,during the merger negotiations.according to defendants,at the time hechinger board was considering the builder square merger,friedman then of chadbourne parke llp advised them about their fiduciary obligations and the business judgment rule.friedman representation of hechinger ended after the merger,and he subsequently moved to gibson dunn crutcher gdc,the law firm serving as trial counsel for the defendants in the pending delaware litigation.friedman is not a litigator and is not counsel of record either in the court below or in the underlying action.
on october,plaintiff served friedman with a deposition subpoena,issued in the southern district of new york,seeking his testimony concerning the nature and substance of his advice to the defendants in connection with the square merger.having deposed all of the available former hechinger directors,plaintiff claims that the directors had either conflicting or no recollections of whether friedman specifically directed the board to consider the interests of hechinger creditors in evaluating the merits of the proposed merger.plaintiff therefore argues that deposing friedman is necessary.friedman and the hechinger defendants moved to quash the subpoena on october.
after a hearing on november,the district court initially held the motion to quash in abeyance pending a good faith showing by plaintiff of the propriety of the intended inquiries to the particular proposed witness,order.the district court instructed plaintiff to show by proposed interrogatories covering the desired deposition that legally proper inquiries exist under the circumstances to ground the request for deposing the and that the attempted deposition is not an abusive procedure under all the facts and circumstances involved herein,including the identity of the proposed witness,as attorney.id.the plaintiff responded by submitting a list of subjects about which it wished to question friedman,instead of the required interrogatories.the district court thereafter quashed the subpoena by order dated december.
in its december,order,the district court first held that the proposed deposition was not barred by privilege because plaintiff,as bankruptcy trustee,could waive the privilege with respect to both defendants communications with friedman and his attorney work product in re subpoena issued to friedman.the district court went on to find that friedman advice was both relevant and possibly crucial to the plaintiff preparation of its case and noted that the only way to find out the attorney advice may be to inquire directly of the attorney.id.at.nevertheless,the district court determined that the proposed deposition was barred under the rule set forth in shelton american motors,cir hereinafter shelton,holding that parties seeking to depose opposing trial counsel must show that no other means exist to obtain the information sought than to depose opposing counsel.id.at.relying on other district courts adoption of the eighth circuit decision in shelton,the district court ruled that a party seeking to depose opposing counsel must demonstrate that the proposed deposition is the only practical means of obtaining the information and that o ther methods,such as written interrogatories,should first be employed.friedman,at quoting pereira united jersey bank,civ,civ,wl,at,quoting west peninsular title palm beach county.consequently,despite finding that it is not unreasonable for the trust to seek to depose friedman,the district court found that plaintiff list of broad inquiries did not show that an oral deposition was the only practical means of obtaining the information it sought and ordered plaintiff to proceed by written interrogatories.id.
plaintiff appealed from the december,order,and defendants moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order was not sufficiently final to provide this court with jurisdiction because it left open the possibility that the district court might,at some later point,permit the plaintiff to depose friedman.a panel of this court denied the motion and ordered the appeal expedited.june,order denying defendants motion to dismiss the appeal.
