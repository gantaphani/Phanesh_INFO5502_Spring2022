background 
when an appeal comes to us after a jury verdict,we view the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.kosmynka polaris,cir.we recite the facts underlying this appeal in accordance with that principle.
on july,fidelity issued a general commercial liability insurance policy to jasam.the policy was renewed annually until fidelity cancelled it on april.jasam had been incorporated some two weeks before the policy issued,on july,for the purpose of purchasing and then operating a shopping center 
on may,jasam principal,jacob rad,incorporated crotona as a vehicle for purchasing land in the bronx.shortly thereafter,in june or july,crotona purchased the land.at that time,the land was vacant.
on august,rad sent a telecopy to surre,jasam insurance broker,requesting that properties owned by crotona be added to the coverage provided by jasam liability policy.surre then completed a binder form on its own letterhead,dated august,that referenced the insurance policy jasam had held with fidelity since.it purported to add to that policy the crotona properties as well as the crotona entity itself as an additional named insured.it listed an effective date of august,but no expiration date.it stated 
the company fidelity accepting this risk acknowledges itself bound by terms,conditions and limitations of the policy of the insurance in current use by the company for the kind of insurance specifically ordered on this binder from the effective date and hour specified therein unless previously cancelled as hereinafter provided,this binder shall terminate upon acceptance by the insured of a policy as ordered herein.this binder may be cancelled at any time by the insured or by the broker or agent who placed the risk by notice to the company this binder may be cancelled by the company by written notice to the insured and to the agent or broker who placed the risk stating when,not before noon of the fifth business day following the date of mailing,such cancellation shall be effective.a premium charge at the rates and in compliance with the rules in use by the company when this binder becomes effective will be made for the time this binder is in effect if no policy of insurance in place hereof is issued and accepted by the insured.
binder,plaintiff trial exhibit,at fidelity neither disputes nor concedes the authenticity of this document or the date,if any,on which it was delivered to jasam.
the relationship between fidelity and surre was established,in part,by an agency agreement to which both companies were parties,a version of which was executed on april.addenda to the agreement were executed at later dates,all of which were prior to the date of the binder at issue in this lawsuit.the agency agreement stated,among other things,that surre had the authority,on behalf of fidelity and related companies 
to accept applications for insurance to bind the company on coverages and to issue,endorse,provide certificates of insurance and cancel contracts of insurance all subject to the letter of authority and subject to the underwriting rules and requirements of the company and 
to pay claims within the specific authority granted by the company.
agency agreement,plaintiff trial exhibit,at.the boundaries of this authority were described in an attached general letter of authority,in which fidelity granted surre a uthority to bind coverage on acceptable risks for coverages filed and written by the company subject to fidelity normal rules,guidelines and underwriting standards,id.at,but,with respect to commercial liability insurance of the sort held by jasam,limited this authority to incurring a maximum risk of.binders issued by surre were to conform to certain requirements 
binders must refer to the standard applicable coverage form being bound,the term of binder,the limits of liability,the name and address of insured,the property covered and the location of risk.the binder must be received by the company in writing within three working days of the inception date of said coverage.no back dating of coverage is allowed.binders are not to exceed days in length.if coverage is needed for a longer period of time,the policy should be issued.
the agency agreement also imposed a variety of related responsibilities on surre 
surre agrees to promptly report all claims and deliver all relevant claims information involving coverages placed with the company to provide reliable underwriting information and to submit written binders to the company within three working days of coverage inception.
the parties dispute when surre notified fidelity of the binder it issued to jasam for crotona.surre asserts that it did so on august,immediately after receiving jasam request,and that it did so again on december,and once again on august.fidelity maintains that it received no notice of the binder nor any request for insurance related to crotona until the latter date,august.
in late,several months after crotona purchased the properties in question,and after august,the date of the binder form,jasam began building residences on the crotona properties.on january,defendant jose rodriguez was injured while working on the construction site.on july,rodriguez filed a lawsuit against jasam related to this injury.on august,jasam notified surre of rodriguez action.eight days later,on august,surre forwarded jasam claim to fidelity,which fidelity received.
fidelity did not itself issue an endorsement for crotona or the crotona properties until august,well after rodriguez was injured.at surre request,however,fidelity this coverage to august,the same day that surre stated that it received jasam request for insurance for crotona and the effective date shown on the surre binder form.
some seven months later,in april,fidelity sent a notice of cancellation of insurance,notifying surre that it was cancelling jasam general liability insurance policy based on material misrepresentation of exposures.cancellation notice,plaintiff trial exhibit,at.fidelity explained that the policy covered only vacant land and not construction sites for building new dwellings.id.at.the cancellation was to be effective april.
district court proceedings 
in december,fidelity filed a complaint in the district court that,as amended in october,sought a declaration that it owed no duty to defend or indemnify jasam or crotona in the underlying action brought by rodriguez a judgment rescinding jasam insurance policy and an award of damages for the cost of defending jasam and crotona in the underlying action.in the alternative,fidelity sought indemnification from surre.
the district court conducted a jury trial that concluded on june,the jury answered a special verdict form provided by the court that included the following interrogatories did jasam make any material misrepresentation in connection with the request for coverage of the crotona properties and did jasam engage in fraudulent concealment in connection with the request for coverage of the crotona properties analogous questions were also posed with respect to crotona.
while the jury was deliberating,it submitted a written query to the district court having problem with question.if we consider as date to consider misrepresentation or,answers to questions will possibly differ.which date should we consider when answering the district court responded i will not help you much.consider both dates.consider august,consider august,consider one date or both.it up to you.
after completing its deliberations,the jury answered yes to both the material misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment questions,and as to both jasam and crotona.on the special verdict form,the jury indicated that the following statements were material misrepresentations misstatement as to the true nature of jasam business and misstatement as to the use of the land to be insured.the jury also determined that the information that had been fraudulently concealed by both jasam and crotona included all of the options included in the special verdict form failure to advise of the true nature of jasam or crotona business failure to advise that the land to be insured was a construction site and failure to advise fidelity about the rodrigue z lawsuit.
separately,the jury indicated on the special verdict form that surre breach ed its contract with fidelity surre was not negligent in its dealings with jasam with respect to the crotona properties and surre was not negligent in its dealings with crotona with respect to the crotona properties.
based on the jury findings,the district court issued a judgment declaring that fidelity had properly cancelled the insurance policies at issue,that fidelity had no duty to defend or indemnify jasam or crotona with respect to the rodriguez lawsuit,and that jasam and crotona were liable to fidelity for the stipulated costs it had already expended in the rodriguez litigation.the court also declared that surre had no liability to jasam or crotona for the resulting absence of insurance coverage.
the defendants appeal.
discussion 
special verdict form 
the defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by,among other things,failing to specify in its special verdict form the correct date on which the veracity of jasam statements was to be judged.we agree that the district court erred in this regard and that we must therefore vacate the judgment.
the formulation of special verdict questions rests in the discretion of the trial judge,and therefore our review is confined to inquiring whether the trial court submission of the issues in the form of these questions constituted an abuse of discretion.we will reverse a judgment entered upon answers to questions which mislead and confuse the jury or which inaccurately frame the issues to be resolved by the jury.

under new york law an insurer may rescind an insurance policy if it was issued in reliance on material misrepresentations.republic ins.masters,mates pilots pension plan,cir process plants beneficial life ins,dep t per curiam,aff on the opinion below,see also ins.law.a misrepresentation in an application for insurance is defined as a false statement as to past or present fact,made to the insurer by,or by the authority of,the applicant for insurance or the prospective insured,at or before the making of the insurance contract as an inducement to the making thereof.ins.law a.a policy may also be rescinded by the insurer if the insured fraudulently concealed from or misrepresented a material fact to the insurer at the time the policy was issued.city of johnstown bankers standard ins,cir.
the special verdict form identified three facts alleged by fidelity to be material and to have been misrepresented or fraudulently concealed by jasam that the crotona properties were construction sites that jasam was a general contractor and that rodriguez had filed a personal injury lawsuit against jasam and crotona.there is little question that these conditions or events had all existed or occurred by july,when the last of the three became true rodriguez filed his personal injury lawsuit.representations to the contrary after that date would have been false failure to disclose those facts could have provided the basis for rescission based on fraudulent concealment.the parties do not agree,however,that any such representations or concealments were made on or after july.and the district court declined to tell the jury,either in its special verdict form interrogatories or after receiving a written query from the jury,what date to consider for these purposes.
to resolve this question,we look to new york insurance law a,which directs us to examine statements made by,or by the authority of,the applicant for insurance and to do so as of the point in time at or before the making of the insurance contract.id.fidelity argues that the date that must be used is august,when,it asserts,it first received notice from surre of jasam request for insurance coverage for crotona and the crotona properties,and when it issued in return the endorsement for these additional risks.that is,in fidelity view,surre acted by authority of jasam when it requested insurance coverage on august.the insurance contract was made on that date,irrespective of when jasam may have requested insurance from surre,and irrespective of what jasam may have represented to surre when it made that request.
fidelity identifies no evidence that jasam itself made representations of any sort on august.fidelity relies entirely on statements made by surre at the time and on the general rule that an insurance broker is regarded as agent for the insured,riedman agency,meaott constr,dep t,appeal dismissed,and the principle that an agent frauds or misrepresentations are imputed to the principal if made within the scope of the agent authority,see,dyke peck,dep t adler helman,dep t.
in light of the agency agreement between fidelity and surre,however,fidelity reliance on these principles is misplaced.although an insurance broker is generally considered to be an agent of the insured,a broker will be held to have acted as the insurer agent where there is some evidence of action on the insurer part,or facts from which a general authority to represent the insurer may be inferred.rendeiro ins,dep t quoting bennion allstate ins,dep t citations omitted.the agency agreement explicitly authorized surre,as fidelity agent,to accept applications for insurance and to bind fidelity on coverages.agency agreement,plaintiff trial exhibit,at.and the policy issued by fidelity provided that written notice by or on behalf of any claimant to any of our agents in new york state will be the same as notice to fidelity.fidelity insurance policy,plaintiff trial exhibit,at.these clear delegations of authority amply establish surre authority to represent fidelity in these specific roles.aside from the relationship,overridden in this respect by contract,fidelity has not identified any evidence that surre did not possess this explicitly delegated authority.see warnock capital hermitage ins,dep t concluding that insured is entitled to coverage based on binder as a matter of law in light of evidence indicating that insurer and broker course of conduct demonstrated that broker maintained apparent authority to issue a binder on behalf of insurer.to the extent surre acted within the scope of this agency agreement,moreover,surre knowledge of jasam business,properties,and claims must be imputed to fidelity,even if that knowledge was untimely communicated by surre to fidelity.see,seward park hous.cohen,dep t the general rule is that knowledge acquired by an agent acting within the scope of his agency is imputed to his principal and the latter is bound by such knowledge although the information
