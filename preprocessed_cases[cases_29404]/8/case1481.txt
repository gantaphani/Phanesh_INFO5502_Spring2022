gamal hanna,nivine elsharouny,subhash naik,and the estate of paulette appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge,dismissing,with prejudice,their complaint against scott and the city of new york.plaintiffs brought suit for employment discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et under under the new york state human rights law,exec.law et and under the new york city human rights law,city admin.code et.additionally,plaintiffs advanced claims that they suffered retaliation for filing discrimination claims,were deprived of due process of law in violation of,and were denied wages that were owed to them in violation of new york labor law et labor law claims.
the district court held that plaintiffs had abandoned their due process and retaliation claims.furthermore,the court granted summary judgment to defendants on the state and federal discrimination claims as well as the labor law claims.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge all of these rulings,excepting the retaliation claim,as well as certain evidentiary decisions made by the court below.we affirm the district court in all respects save for its dismissal of plaintiffs labor law claims we remand for consideration of whether it would be appropriate to construe defendants motion for summary judgment as a motion to amend the answer to assert an affirmative defense for the first time.
background 
plaintiffs are current or former employees of the controlled substance analysis section of the new york city police department crime laboratory crime lab.all four were born abroad hanna and elsharouny in egypt,naik in india,and hamilton in jamaica.almost all employees in the crime lab are criminalists,ranging in assignment levels from.generally,all supervisory duties are supposed to be performed by criminalists iv.
despite being only criminalists iii,plaintiffs all were given supervisory responsibilities for a substantial period of time.although these increased responsibilities were not accompanied by improved salary,benefits,or formal title,plaintiffs were referred to as criminalists within the crime lab.
in,two new criminalist iv positions were created within the controlled substance section.defendant,who was the immediate supervisor of that section,was tasked with filling these vacancies.in accordance with the custom and practice of the crime lab,no general announcement was made to advertise these vacancies and did not conduct any interviews.in his affidavit,claimed that his top choice for the job was vito criminalist that casella had turned him down.instead,hired matthew johnson and thomas hickey,the only two white,males of the seven individuals then holding the informal,but apparently well established designation of criminalist,despite the fact that all four plaintiffs had considerably longer tenures as employees of the crime lab.
following the ascension of johnson and hickey,there remained only five people holding the position of criminalist in the crime four plaintiffs and casella.with johnson and hickey now filling formal supervisory roles,concluded that it was appropriate and feasible to eliminate the position of criminalist altogether so that all supervisory functions would be performed by criminalists iv only,as had been originally intended.plaintiffs were informed that they were being relieved of their supervisory functions,but their salary,benefits,and formal title remained unchanged.
shortly after these events,plaintiffs filed a complaint with the new york police department office of equal employment opportunity oeeo claiming that they had been denied promotions on the basis of their national origin.this claim was investigated and ultimately determined to be without merit due to the fact that johnson and hickey were found to have had generally better performance evaluations than each of the plaintiffs.in,plaintiffs filed charges of employment discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc contrary to the oeeo,the eeoc found at least that there was reason to believe a violation had occurred.
plaintiffs filed a complaint in new york state court in august.the case was removed to federal court,and plaintiffs twice amended their complaint,most recently in october.while this case was before the district court,another criminalist iv position became available in the controlled substances section of the crime lab.by this time,who had since been promoted to be deputy director of the crime lab,had decided to advertise vacancies internally and conduct formal interviews of all applicants.plaintiffs hanna,elsharouny,and naik all applied for this position,but none of them scored well enough during the initial interview to advance to the second round of interviews.thereafter,a white,male was selected for this promotion,as well.
defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims in november,and the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint on that basis in september.this appeal followed.
discussion 
evidentiary issues 
before considering the merits of plaintiffs claims,we must first consider what evidence was properly before the district court at the summary judgment stage.spiegel schulmann,cir it is well established that,in determining the appropriateness of a grant of summary judgment,this court,like the district court in awarding summary judgment,may rely only on admissible evidence.quotation marks omitted.here,plaintiffs argue that the district court erroneously excluded various items of evidence.each of these challenges is without merit.
first,we hold that the district court correctly excluded plaintiffs proffer of statement that,following the challenged promotions,managerial staff determined that involving more individuals in the promotion process might help prevent unsuccessful candidates from feeling as if they were unfairly passed over for promotion.such a statement plainly runs afoul of rule of the federal rules of evidence,which generally prohibits a plaintiff from introducing evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by the defendant in order to establish the defendant underlying liability.see lust sealy,cir observing that there is no reason to limit application of this rule to nonintentional torts 
next,plaintiffs complain that they should have been permitted to introduce a statement given to the oeeo by peter pizzola,boss,in which pizzola asserted that had told him casella was not supervisory material.this hearsay statement was rightly excluded from evidence as it is not subject to any of the hearsay exceptions cited by plaintiffs 
plaintiffs also challenge the district court refusal to consider the eeoc determinations that all four plaintiffs had been discriminated against based on national origin.the case law of our circuit is clear that the decision to consider eeoc findings is left to the sound discretion of the district court.paolitto brown,cir.in its opinion,the district court carefully explained its decision to exclude the eeoc determinations on the grounds that these findings a were conclusory,and b failed to address the defendants strongest evidence regarding plaintiffs inferior performance evaluations.defendants are unable to demonstrate any error on the part of the district court,much less an abuse of discretion.see generally sims blot,cir a district court has abuse d its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.quotation marks omitted.
finally,in separate affidavits,three of the plaintiffs allege that told them that he wanted to change the face of the criminalist position.the district court declined to consider this evidence because,in their prior deposition testimony,all three plaintiffs answered in the negative when asked if,or any other employee of the new york police department,had ever made any comments to them that could be interpreted as discriminatory.given this direct contradiction,the district court was right not to give weight to the later affidavits.mack united states,cir it is well se
