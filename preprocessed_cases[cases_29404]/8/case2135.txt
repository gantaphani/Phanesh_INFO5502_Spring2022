ridley whitaker appeals from two orders rendered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,scheindlin,denying the plaintiff motion to remand and dismissing the amended complaint.in the first order appealed,the district court denied the motion to remand on grounds that removal was timely under b,with jurisdiction in federal court proper under a.see whitaker fresno telsat,civ,wl.in concluding that removal was timely,the district court held that,in the wake of murphy brothers,michetti pipe stringing,d,the relevant event for triggering the thirty day removal clock under section b is the defendant receipt of the complaint,which,in this case,had been received within thirty days prior to removal.whitaker,wl,at.the principal question we must answer is whether the supreme court decision in murphy brothers requires a defendant receipt of the complaint for triggering the removal period.we conclude that it does not,and that the district court erred in so holding.the history and text of section b clearly make the defendant receipt of the initial pleading the relevant triggering event,which is any pleading and not necessarily the complaint containing sufficient information to enable the defendant to intelligently ascertain the basis for removal.because only the complaint in this case provided such information,we find no error with the district court ultimate conclusion that the notice of removal was timely filed.further,we find no error with the district court conclusion that jurisdiction was proper in federal court under a and accordingly,we affirm the order denying the motion to remand.
in the second order appealed,the district court dismissed the action pursuant to.b for want of personal jurisdiction.see whitaker fresno telsat,d.we find no error.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in connection with both orders.
background 
in november,fresno telsat,fti and fti principal shareholder,james simon,retained the,attorney ridley whitaker whitaker to represent fti in a california state court action for breach of fiduciary duty against fti partner and appellee herein,american telecasting,ati.fti and ati were partners in a california general partnership known as fresno mmds associates.in june of,whitaker hired the new york law firm of rosenthal,judell uchima rju to assist him with the case.
in february and march of,the parties proceeded to trial in california state court and,prior to judgment,fti retained attorney martin fletcher fletcher to negotiate a possible settlement with ati.fletcher subsequently settled the matter on behalf of fti with an agreement that characterized the settlement as a sale of substantially all of fti interest in the partnership to ati.whitaker objected to the agreement,claiming that the deal unfairly deprived him of legal fees in breach of his agreement with fti.the objection,however,fell on deaf ears.consequently,whitaker asserted a statutory charging lien under judiciary law against both his client,fti,and the settling defendant,ati.
on december,whitaker,a new york resident,commenced this action by filing a summons with notice,but no complaint,in the supreme court of the state of new york,new york county,seeking to enforce the charging lien and for a declaratory judgment regarding his rights and the rights of rju to share in the claimed legal fees.whitaker named as defendants fti and james simon both indiana residents,jas partners,a colorado business entity,ati a delaware corporation located in colorado,and certain john does identities and residence unknown.whitaker also named as a defendant his fellow new yorker,rju,but did not assert any claims against it.
on april,whitaker served the defendants by mail with copies of the summons with notice.on may,fti served whitaker with a demand for service of the complaint.on june,ati served whitaker with a demand for service of the complaint and,on july,whitaker responded by serving fti with the complaint.on july,whitaker served ati with the complaint and,on july,whitaker served ati with an amended summons and complaint the amended complaint.
on july,days after whitaker served fti with the complaint,fti,james simon and jas partners,the fti defendants removed the action from new york state supreme court to the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to a,with jurisdiction in federal court based upon diversity of citizenship.see a.on august,ati filed a consent to the notice of removal upon whitaker request.
a.the motion to remand 
on september,whitaker moved to remand the case back to state court,arguing that the removal was untimely because the defendants failed to file their notice of removal within thirty days of receiving the initial pleading under b,with the initial pleading being,allegedly,the summons with notice.further,whitaker maintained that,because both he and rju were new york residents,jurisdiction in federal court was improper under a on account of incomplete diversity.
on september,the district court denied the motion to remand,concluding that in accordance with murphy brothers,michetti pipe stringing,d,the initial pleading under b is the complaint which,in this case,had been served within the statutory period of thirty days prior to the date of removal.whitaker,wl,at.further,the district court observed in a footnote that,even under brothers case law,the summons with notice failed as the initial pleading because removability could not be ascertained from the face of that document.whitaker,wl,at.finally,the district court concluded that,because whitaker had not asserted any claims against rju,whitaker had fraudulently joined rju in an attempt to defeat federal diversity jurisdiction.id.at.consequently,the court dismissed the action against rju under.and,with the dismissal of the only party,concluded that federal jurisdiction was proper under a.id.on october,whitaker filed a notice of appeal.
b.the motion to dismiss 
on august,ati,as a delaware corporation located in colorado,moved pursuant to.b to dismiss the amended complaint for want of personal jurisdiction.as the record disclosed,ati is not incorporated,licensed or qualified to do business in new york.it has no offices,agents,employees,property,bank accounts or telephone listing in new york,and has not appointed an agent for service of process in new york.ati neither sells any products in new york nor does it otherwise transact any business in new york.
on december,the district court granted ati motion,concluding that whitaker failed to demonstrate any factual predicate authorizing jurisdiction over ati under the new york long arm statute,a,and that,in any event,compelling ati to litigate in new york would offend the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.whitaker fresno telsat,d.on january,whitaker moved for reargument and for reconsideration and,on february,the court denied the motion.whitaker subsequently settled his claims with respect to the fti defendants,and on march,the district court entered a consent order dismissing the action with prejudice as to all defendants except for ati and rju.on march,whitaker filed a notice of appeal,naming only ati and rju as the.
discussion 
imotion to remand 
whitaker argues that,in denying the motion to remand,the district court erred in interpreting murphy brothers to require that only the complaint can constitute the initial pleading under b erred by considering arguments in support of removal that were not raised in the notice of removal erred in concluding that the defendants could not ascertain removability from the face of the summons with notice and erred in concluding that whitaker had fraudulently joined rju.we consider each contention in order,reviewing the record de novo,shafii british airways,plc,cir a denial of a motion to remand is reviewed de novo,and with deference to the rule that the removal statute,like other jurisdictional statutes,is to be strictly construed.lupo human affairs int l,cir citing shamrock oil gas sheets.
the initial pleading and b 
whitaker first argues that the district court erroneously interpreted the supreme court decision in murphy brothers,michetti pipe stringing,d,as holding that only a complaint can constitute the initial pleading under b.see whitaker,wl at.we agree.
the federal removal statute,b,states in relevant part that 
the notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based,
id.emphasis added.prior to the supreme court decision in murphy brothers,several federal circuits,in interpreting the section b requirement that a defendant receive the initial pleading through service or otherwise held that receipt of the initial pleading alone triggered the running of the removal period,with formal service of process unnecessary.see murphy brothers,at.at citing reece stores,cir roe,cir.these courts,in emphasizing the plain meaning of section b,were of the opinion that the words receipt through service or otherwise opened the door to a universe of other means aside from service of process for putting a defendant in possession of the initial pleading,and that to construe the statute differently would be to render the phrase or otherwise meaningless.see,roe,at.other federal courts disagreed,however,and held that,notwithstanding the or otherwise language,formal service was indeed required to trigger the removal period.murphy brothers,at.at citing bowman weeks marine,baratt phoenix mut.life ins.
the supreme court addressed this split in authority in murphy brothers.there,a plaintiff filed a complaint in alabama state court and faxed a courtesy copy of the filed complaint to the defendant,but did not serve the complaint until fourteen days later when settlement negotiations failed.murphy brothers,at.at.some thirty days after service but days after receipt of the faxed copy,the defendant removed the case to federal district court.id.the plaintiff thereafter moved to remand the case back to state court on the grounds that the removal was untimely by fourteen days,arguing that the thirty day removal clock began to run when the defendant received a fax copy of the complaint.id.the district court disagreed and denied the motion,concluding that the removal was timely as,under section b,the removal period did not begin to run until the defendant was officially served.murphy brothers,at.at.on interlocutory appeal,the eleventh circuit reversed,concluding that,based on the plain meaning of the words,receipt through service or otherwise,the defendant receipt of the faxed copy of the complaint was sufficient to trigger the removal period.id.citing.
on petition for certiorari to the supreme court,the high court granted the petition and reversed,holding that,based on the history and text of section b,and the historic function of service of process as the official trigger for responsive action by a defendant,the commencement of the removal period could only be triggered by formal service of process,regardless of whether the statutory phrase or otherwise hints at some other proper means of receipt of the initial pleading.murphy brothers,at.at.in the view of the majority of the court,the words or otherwise were simply so indefinite as to be meaningless.murphy brothers,at.at.
because the initial pleading served in murphy brothers was a complaint,the court substituted the word complaint for the statutory term initial pleading in its analysis of section b.murphy brothers,at.at.the court did not define that statutory term to mean the complaint in all instances and did not address the issue presented here,that is,whether a pleading other than a complaint can constitute the initial pleading under section b for purposes of triggering the removal period.we now address this issue.
for decades,the federal district courts in new york have confronted this issue and reached conflicting results.some courts have held that only the complaint can constitute the initial pleading for purposes of removal under section b.see howell,underwriters.mfrs.traders trust hartford accident and indem.these courts have rejected the notion that a summons with notice can constitute the initial pleading because a the summons with notice is not defined as a pleading under b the notice has no legal effect under new york law except in cases of default and c the legislative history of section b appears to point to service of the complaint alone as the relevant event for triggering the removal period.see mfrs.traders trust.at.
to the contrary,other courts have held that a summons with notice validly filed under new york law constitute s an initial pleading if the summons contain s sufficient information to enable the defendant to intelligently ascertain the basis for removal.brooklyn hosp.ctr.diversified info,d,see also gucciardo reliance ins,d,negrin alza.civ,wl,richstone chubb colonial life,rosenthal life fitness,colon car rental,civ,wl,at june,universal motors group of companies,wilkerson,worthy schering.
in resolving this issue,we look first to the language of section b itself.aslanidis united states lines,cir a court should presume that a statute says what it means.if the words of the statute are unambiguous,judicial inquiry should end,and the law interpreted according to the plain meaning of its words.id.citing rubin united states,d.a court will not adopt a different construction absent clear legislative history contradicting the plain meaning of the words.united states holroyd,cir.
in examining the plain language of section b,we observe that the statute does not require the receipt of a complaint for triggering the removal period.rather,congress simply required that,for purposes of starting the thirty day clock,a defendant receive the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based.b.we perceive no ambiguity in these words.if congress meant to limit the triggering event to receipt of the complaint alone,it would have so stated.
we also find that the legislative history does not reflect a contrary intent.in,congress enacted section b in an attempt to insure adequate time to remove cases to federal court and,at the same time,establish a national,uniform for removal which previously varied from state to state.murphy brothers,at.at quoting,see also shamrock oil gas sheets.to accomplish this end,the statute originally required the removal petition to be filed within twenty days after commencement of the action or service of process,whichever was later.murphy brothers,at.at quoting act of june,stat,as amended,b.this rule,however,failed to insure an adequate and uniform removal period in states such as new york,where an action could be commenced by simply serving the document that,at that time,was not required to provide information from which a defendant could ascertain removability.see also wilkerson.at quoting,the civil practice of new york annotated,civil practice act.only the complaint provided such information and,because service of the summons commenced the action,the removal period could expire before the defendant received the complaint and could assess removability as an option.see murphy brothers,at.at quoting.
in order to make the statute fit the diverse procedural laws of the various states wilkerson.at quoting,reprinted in,cong.admin news,and insure adequate time for removal,congress in enacted the current version of section b murphy brothers,at.at.under the revision,congress forbade the removal period from commencing until the defendant received information from which removability could be ascertained,murphy brothers,at.at,by triggering the running of the clock on the defendant receipt of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based.b emphasis added.
the legislative history reflects a clear concern for ensuring that a defendant know what the suit is about before triggering the removal clock.murphy brothers,at.at quoting,code cong.admin.news at.that history does not,however,reflect any concern for limiting the term initial pleading to mean the complaint in all instances.while there is a discussion in the history rejecting the notion that a summons can constitute the initial pleading under new york law this discussion does not reflect the current state of new york law,which,since,has required the summons to provide notice stating the nature of the action and the relief is,information from which a defendant can ascertain removability.see brooklyn hosp,d at quoting b.because the summons with notice generally provides information from which a defendant can ascertain removability,this document is often consistent with the congressional conception of an initial pleading.id.at.further,although a summons with notice is not technically defined as a pleading under,and the notice has no legal effect in new york except in cases of default,we nevertheless conclude that it may constitute an initial pleading for purposes of the federal removal statute.see universal motors group of companies.at a court should look beyond the particular label which a local jurisdiction chooses to give the document and instead focus on whether the content of the document satisfies the conditions of the federal removal statute.citing ardison villa,cir.we therefore conclude that a summons with notice may serve as an initial pleading under section b.
arguments not raised in the notice of removal 
whitaker next argues that the district court erred in permitting ati to present arguments in support of removal that were not raised in the notice of removal.specifically,as set forth,supra,on july,the defendants removed the action to the district court by filing a notice of removal stating that jurisdiction was proper in federal court based upon diversity of citizenship under a.in response,on september,whitaker moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that removal was untimely because the defendants failed to file their notice of removal within thirty days of receiving the initial pleading under b,with the initial pleading being the summons with notice.in opposing the motion to remand,the defendants argued that,to the contrary,the removal petition was indeed timely filed as it had been filed within the statutory period of thirty days from the receipt of the complaint.in arguing that only the complaint could constitute the initial pleading,the defendants asserted that,among other things,the summons with notice failed as the initial pleading because removability could not be ascertained from its face.the district court agreed,but did not ground its decision to deny the motion to remand on this rationale.see whitaker,wl,at.whitaker now argues that,because ati failed to press in the notice of removal the argument that removability could not be ascertained from the face of the summons with notice,the argument is time barred as not having been set forth,in the first instance,in the notice of removal.we disagree.
the removal statute requires the notice of removal to contain a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.a.where the notice fails to state a proper basis for removal,a defendant generally will not be permitted to amend the notice after the close of the thirty day removal period.lupo,at.here,the notice of removal states that jurisdiction is proper in federal court based upon diversity of citizenship between the plaintiff and defendants and a matter in controversy exceed ing the sum of,exclusive of interest and costs.this is a proper basis for removal and,because the record does not indicate that ati or any of the other defendants ever sought to change that notice to reflect a different basis for removal,we reject whitaker strained contention that ati somehow amended it simply by responding to whitaker motion to remand.
the summons with notice and removability 
whitaker next argues that the district court erred in concluding that the defendants could not have ascertained removability from the face of the summons with notice.in this regard,whitaker maintains that,because the summons with notice clearly states an amount in controversy exceeding the required jurisdictional amount and identifies whitaker with offices in new york city,ati as a delaware corporation,and fti as an indiana corporation,any defendant with reasonable intelligence and with some investigation could have ascertained federal diversity jurisdiction and hence,removability,from the face of that document.
we disagree.a case is removable when the initial pleading enables the defendant to intelligently ascertain removability from the face of such pleading,so that in its petition for removal,the defendant can make a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal as required by a.richstone.at citing ardison villa,cir.a pleading enables a defendant to intelligently ascertain removability when it provides the necessary facts to support the removal petition.id.quoting rowe marder,aff,cir.in cases where removal is based upon diversity,the facts required to support the removal petition include the amount in controversy and the address of each party.see,day zimmer.while this standard requires a defendant to apply a reasonable amount of intelligence in ascertaining removability,it does not require a defendant to look beyond the initial pleading for facts giving rise to removability.see,rowe.at a defendant must be able to ascertain easily from the pleading the necessary facts to support his removal petition.internal quotation omitted see also foster mutual fire,marine inland ins,cir the relevant test is not what the defendants purportedly knew,but what the document said.
federal diversity jurisdiction and,hence,removability,could not have been ascertained from the face of whitaker summons with notice.while this document does state an amount in controversy of plus damages and costs,which is far in excess of the minimum required under a,and further identifies whitaker with offices in new york city,ati as a delaware corporation,and fti as an indiana corporation,it fails to identify the addresses of these defendants,and fails to identify the address of another named defendant.in particular,the summons with notice names rju as a defendant and seeks damages and equitable relief with respect to this entity,but does not disclose its address.this defect makes it impossible to assess whether there is complete diversity and,hence,a basis for removal.accordingly,we find no error with the district court conclusion that removability could not be ascertained from the face of that document.
because there is no dispute that removability could be ascertained from the face of the complaint,we conclude that the complaint constituted the initial pleading for purposes of removal under section b,and that its receipt by the defendants triggered the thirty day removal period.because the defendants filed their notice of removal within that thirty day period,we find no error with the district court ultimate conclusion that the removal was timely.
fraudulent joinder 
after concluding that the initial pleading under section b had to be the complaint and that,accordingly,the notice of removal was timely filed,the district court went on to consider whether jurisdiction in federal court was proper.see a only civil actions of which the district court has original jurisdiction may be removed.as set forth in the amended complaint,both the plaintiff,whitaker,and one of the defendants,rju,are identified as residents of new york.while identity of citizenship between a plaintiff and a defendant is sufficient to defeat federal diversity jurisdiction,see advani,underwriters at lloyds,cir,the district court nevertheless held that jurisdiction in federal court was proper.whitaker,wl,at.as the court reasoned,because whitaker did not assert any claims against rju,whitaker had fraudulently joined rju in an attempt to defeat federal diversity jurisdiction.id.consequently,the court dismissed the action against rju under.and,with the dismissal of the only party,concluded that federal jurisdiction was proper under a.id.
whitaker now argues that,because he sought a declaratory judgment under as to his rights and rju rights to share in any proceeds received by whitaker as a result of prosecuting his claims,the district court erred
