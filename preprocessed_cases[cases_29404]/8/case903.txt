this appeal challenges the district court denial of a preliminary injunction seeking what amounts to a freeze order although its proponents describe the requested relief as being in the nature of an equitable attachment.concluding,as we do,that the lower court correctly chose to employ the traditional standard for gauging the propriety of preliminary injunctive relief in this situation and proceeded to apply that standard faultlessly,we affirm the decision below.
background 
our starting point is the cast of characters.blinds to go,btg operates a slew of retail stores in north america a few of which are located in massachusetts.charlesbank equity fund ii,limited partnership charlesbank and harvard private capital holdings,hpch are affiliated entities that make and hold investments on behalf of the president and fellows of harvard college.
the litigation between these protagonists has its roots in a venture capital transaction.on december,hpch and btg entered into a preferred share purchase agreement the agreement.pursuant to the agreement,hpch made a capital investment and,in exchange,btg issued to hpch the entirety of a new class of stock,totaling preferred shares with conversion privileges.as a prophylactic device,btg insisted that hpch grant to the holders of btg common stock a right of first refusal.the provision embodying this safeguard,as amended and restated in a shareholders agreement,required that the holders of btg common stock be afforded the opportunity of first refusal in the event of any transfer of the preferred shares arising out of a third party offer to purchase the shares so long as the offeror was acting at arm length.
the agreement contained several other provisions.of particular pertinence here,hpch or its permitted assignee had the right to put all the preferred shares in specific time frames or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events.receipt of notice of the exercise of this option obligated btg to redeem the shares within sixty days at a per share price calculated in accordance with a formula delineated in btg corporate charter.a significant element of this formula was the ebitda,earnings before interest,income tax,depreciation and amortization as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,consistently applied for the immediately preceding twelve months.in order to secure the due performance of this obligation,btg granted to hpch a security interest in its existing and assets.
the relationship between hpch and btg proved uneventful through the end of the millennium.a precursor to discord surfaced in november of,when hpch transferred its preferred shares and appurtenant rights and interests under the agreement including its security interest in btg assets to charlesbank.although the shareholders agreement was still in effect,hpch consummated the transfer without first offering the preferred shares to the holders of btg common stock.charlesbank proceeded to exercise the put option in the first available window of opportunity,notifying btg on january,of its desire that the company redeem the preferred shares.under the terms of the agreement,the ebitda for the fiscal year ending on february,would apply to that redemption.
the calculation of the ebitda did not go smoothly.over the next few months,the figure diminished to a point well below what charlesbank had anticipated.this shrinkage in turn lowered the projected purchase price of the preferred shares.as these estimates slumped,charlesbank grew increasingly suspicious that btg was cooking the books.the transaction stalled.
on june,charlesbank took matters into its own hands.invoking federal diversity jurisdiction,see a,it sued btg in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts btg is a canadian corporation that maintains its principal place of business there and charlesbank is a massachusetts limited partnership.the complaint asserted claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.hpch a massachusetts charitable corporation headquartered in that state soon joined the fray as an additional plaintiff.the interests of the two plaintiffs are congruent and,from this point forward,we refer to them,collectively,as.
in october of,btg and the holders of its common stock countersued in a canadian court.they sought a declaration that btg did not owe any money to because the transfer of the preferred shares was unauthorized.btg posited that the transaction between charlesbank and hpch triggered the right of first refusal that hpch nonetheless disregarded that obligation and that,therefore,the shunned right of the holders of btg common stock to purchase the preferred shares vitiated the purported transfer and trumped charlesbank right to exercise the put option.in the alternative,btg asked for a judicial determination that it owed only for the preferred shares.
the canadian court of first instance dismissed the suit on the ground of forum non conveniens.that holding was affirmed on appeal,the canadian appellate tribunal agreed that massachusetts was a more convenient forum but the dismissal was vacated and the case stayed pending resolution of the action.thus,the battle between the parties shifted back to the federal district court.
primary allegation btg manipulated its finances and shrank the ebitda by posting a series of spurious reserves after the put option had been exercised.in view,these machinations artificially deflated the ebitda by nearly,from to just over and the projected purchase price for the preferred shares by roughly every reduction of in the ebitda translates,under the formula,into a reduction of approximately in the aggregate purchase price.btg denied allegations reiterated its claim that the right of first refusal should have been honored and urged that,in all events,its books fairly and accurately reflected the company finances.
a deals with the issuance of preliminary injunctions.on july,invoked that rule and moved for a preliminary injunction in the nature of an equitable attachment of the assets of the defendant.in practical effect,it sought to freeze a substantial amount of btg funds in order to secure eventual payment of the purchase price for the preferred shares.btg opposed the motion,and the district court summarily denied it.the court decision rested on two independently sufficient grounds.first,the court concluded that it lacked the authority to issue such an injunction under the supreme court landmark opinion in grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund,d.second,the court found that had failed to show irreparable harm and,thus,had not satisfied a necessary threshold requirement for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.after moving unsuccessfully for reconsideration,appealed.we now affirm.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
although the parties seem to be content that we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we are to test that hypothesis.when a colorable question exists,an appellate court has an unflagging obligation to inquire sua sponte into its own jurisdiction.see commonwealth of,cir.that is the situation here.
as a general rule,only final orders are immediately appealable.see id.citing.virtually every general rule admits of exceptions,however,and a statutory exception to this finality principle authorizes interlocutory review of orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.a.consequently,if the remedy that seeks is in the nature of an injunction,we have jurisdiction here and now to review an order denying that relief.
this question comes to the forefront because appears at times to argue that it is not seeking an injunction at all,but,rather,an equitable attachment.see,appellants br.at.for jurisdictional purposes,it matters whether the relief requested is more appropriately classified as an injunction or an attachment.while orders granting or denying injunctions are immediately appealable,the status of attachment orders is more problematic.
it is common ground least in the absence of special appellate courts lack jurisdiction to undertake interlocutory review of orders granting prejudgment attachments.see teradyne,mostek,cir see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.by like token,orders denying prejudgment attachments are not per se appealable when issued.see wright miller,supra,at.but such orders may be immediately appealable if they satisfy the requirements of the collateral order doctrine id.
the taxonomic problem is complicated here because original request for interim relief is not a model of clarity.while that request at times employs the vocabulary of injunctive relief,it at times suggests that what actually wants is an attachment albeit an attachment derived from the district court authority under rule.given this internal inconsistency,we must cut through the tangle of words and determine whether,functionally,is seeking an injunction or an attachment.morales feliciano rullan,cir explaining that a court must look to the practical effect of the order rather than its verbiage to determine if it is appealable under a accord cobell norton.
this court has noted several factors that should be considered in deciding whether a requested order is more akin to an injunction or an attachment.these factors include the present and future consequences of the constraint involved whether the order directs or restrains conduct of one of the parties and how the order was treated below by the district court and the parties.teradyne,at.
viewed through this prism,the order appealed from appears to be injunctive in nature.because virtually all of btg assets are located outside of massachusetts,the order,if granted,will operate by restraining btg conduct,commanding it to take certain actions and prohibiting it from taking others.this is the classic modus operandi of injunctive relief.see wright miller,supra,at defining injunctions as orders that require a party either to do or to refrain from doing some act.
this perception is reinforced by the fact that the parties and the district court treated motion as a motion for a preliminary injunction.although a reviewing court must look beyond the nomenclature that parties or trial judges employ and gauge the practical effect of a requested order,morales feliciano,at,earlier characterizations of the underlying motion are relevant to that determination,see teradyne,at.here,this factor tilts in favor of appellate jurisdiction.
the motion for reconsideration that filed in the district court dispels any lingering doubts.the motion papers make pellucid that wanted the court preliminarily to enjoin btg,its agents,officers,employees and all persons acting in concert with it,from spending,dissipating,transferring,selling,or otherwise disposing of,any of btg assets or cash up to the value of,other than in the ordinary course of business,without first paying the same amount to.this iteration shows that what really wanted was a freeze freeze orders directed at unspecified assets typically are in the nature of preliminary injunctions.see,ftc singer,cir noting that while an asset freeze can have an effect comparable to that of an attachment,it is not an attachment,but is an injunction.the freeze order that sought is no exception.
teradyne buttresses this reading of the record.in that case,the district court entered an order enjoining the defendant from disposing of worth of assets and requiring it to set that amount aside in an account to ensure satisfaction of any future judgment or arbitration award that might eventuate in an ongoing dispute between the parties.at.we held that such an order should be treated as an injunction,id.at,and the factors to which we attached weight are equally present here first,the requested relief in that case,as here,did not involve posting a bond or surrendering specified property,but,rather,contemplated compelling a party to act refrain from acting.id.at.second,there,as here,the district court and the parties treated the requested relief as a preliminary injunction.id.third,and finally,the teradyne court thought tying up a large chunk of funds pending the uncertain outcome of arbitration to be a significant constraint.id.that consideration is magnified here,as seeks to restrict the use of almost four times as much money pending the outcome of litigation.
because we find the relief requested here to be in the nature of an injunction,pure and simple,we need not probe the applicability of the collateral order doctrine.see supra note.it suffices to say that,after independent review of the record,we are confident that we have jurisdiction to hear and determine this interlocutory appeal.see a.
iii.standard of review 
we ordinarily review the grant or denial of a motion for preliminary injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.of warwick,baccarat,cir i.this is a deferential standard of review,and the deference that it entails is most appropriate with respect to issues of judgment and the balancing of conflicting factors.see cablevision of boston,pub.improvement comm n,cir.even then,however,appellate courts must be careful to ensure that deference does not mutate into blind allegiance.the trial court discretion is not unbridled and a buse occurs when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored,when an improper factor is relied upon,or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed,but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.indep.oil chem.workers of quincy,proctor gamble,cir.
we review the district court answers to abstract questions of law de novo.goya foods,wallack mgmt,cir,cert.denied,d.an error of law is,of course,always an abuse of discretion,cir.
iv.the merits 
before sorting through the thicket of competing arguments,we put to one issue that is not squarely presented.although this is a diversity case,motion explicitly invoked.a.as a result,the district court based its decision on that rule and,more generally,on federal equitable principles.in briefing this appeal,has eschewed any argument that the availability of injunctive relief should be determined,in the first instance,by reference to the tenet that the law of the forum state supplies the rule of decision in diversity cases.see generally erie tompkins.see also grupo mexicano,at.raising that possibility and reserving the question.we therefore deem any such claim waived.see teamsters union superline transp,cir describing as settled the principle that,with only a very narrow band of exceptions,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal clauson smith,cir similar.given this waiver,our decision necessarily hinges on principles of federal law.
framing the issue.
in some situations,federal courts possess general equitable power to issue prejudgment injunctions in the nature of freeze orders so as to ensure the adequacy of postjudgment remedies.see united states first city bank,d debeers consol.mines,united states.the fact that such an order may be within the raw power of a federal court does not end the inquiry,but simply sets the stage for two further queries.the logically antecedent question involves whether,categorically speaking,a particular case is of a type in which such an order may be issued.the second involves the proper legal standard to be employed in the exercise of that power.
the first of these questions is extremely complex.in grupo mexicano,the supreme court held that the district court had no authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing petitioners from disposing of their assets pending adjudication of respondents contract claim for money damages where no preexisting lien or equitable interest had been claimed.at.it is unclear whether grupo mexicano directly controls this case.on the one hand,its rationale favors the conclusion that the district court lacked the inherent authority to grant the relief that solicited.see,id.at.finding that federal courts ordinarily lack the equitable authority to issue prejudgment attachments in actions at law.on the other hand,the application of the grupo mexicano rationale here would entail an extension of the court holding.after all,it is at least arguable that the existence of a security interest such as possesses i
