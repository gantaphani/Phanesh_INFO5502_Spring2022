this appeal concerns the availability of subject matter jurisdiction for permissive counterclaims.it also demonstrates the normal utility of early decision of a motion for class certification.ford motor credit company ford credit appeals from the june,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lawrence mckenna,district judge dismissing for lack of jurisdiction its permissive counterclaims against three of the four and its conditional counterclaims against members of the putative class that the seek to certify.jones ford motor credit,wl june.we conclude that supplemental jurisdiction authorized by may be available for the permissive counterclaims,but that the district court discretion under subsection c should not be exercised in this case until a ruling on the plaintiffs motion for class certification.we therefore vacate and remand.
background 
joyce jones,martha edwards,lou cooper,and vincent jackson plaintiffs,individually and as class representatives,sued ford credit alleging racial discrimination under the equal credit opportunity act ecoa,et.they had purchased ford vehicles under ford credit financing plan.they alleged that the financing plan discriminated against.although the financing rate was primarily based on objective criteria,ford credit permitted its dealers to mark up the rate,using subjective criteria to assess charges.the plaintiffs alleged that the policy penalized customers with higher rates than those imposed on similarly situated caucasian customers.
in its answer,ford credit denied the charges of racial discrimination and also asserted counterclaims against jones,edwards,and cooper for the amounts of their unpaid car loans.ford credit alleged that jones was in default on her obligations under her contract for the purchase of a ford windstar,and that edwards and cooper were in default on payments for their joint purchase of a mercury cougar.additionally,in the event that a class was certified,ford credit asserted conditional counterclaims against any member of that class who was in default on a car loan from ford credit.the plaintiffs moved to dismiss ford credit counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.b,lack of personal jurisdiction.b,improper venue.b,and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.b.
the district court granted the plaintiffs motion and dismissed ford credit counterclaims,summarizing its reasons for doing so as follows d efendant counterclaims do not meet the standard for compulsory counterclaims,and pursuant to c,there are compelling reasons to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the counterclaims.jones,wl,at.
in reaching these conclusions,judge mckenna acknowledged some uncertainty.after determining that the counterclaims were permissive,he expressed doubt as to the jurisdictional consequence of that determination.on the one hand,he believed,as the plaintiffs maintain,that permissive counterclaims must be dismissed if they lack an independent basis of federal jurisdiction.on the other hand,he acknowledged,citing solow jenkins,wl,at,that there was some authority to suggest that the court should determine,based on the particular circumstances of the case,whether it ha d authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under a over a counterclaim,regardless of whether it was compulsory or permissive.jones,wl,at.
to resolve his uncertainty,judge mckenna initially ruled that the counterclaims,being permissive,must be dismissed for lack of an independent basis of federal jurisdiction.id.he then ruled that,if he was wrong and if supplemental jurisdiction under section was available,he would still dismiss the counterclaims in the exercise of the discretion subsection c gives district courts.id.without explicitly stating on which of the four subdivisions of subsection c he relied,judge mckenna gave the following reasons for declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction 
the claims and counterclaims arise out of the same occurrence only in the loosest terms there does not exist a logical relationship between the essential facts to be proven in the claim and those of the counterclaims.
a llowing defendant counterclaims to proceed in this forum might undermine the ecoa enforcement scheme by discouraging plaintiffs from bringing ecoa claims due to the fear of counterclaims.
t he interests of judicial economy will not be served by joining the claim and counterclaims in one suit because of what would most likely be a tremendous number of separate collection actions,each based on facts specific to the individual plaintiffs involved.
id.at.judge mckenna stated his belief that it would be unfair and inexpedient to require absent class members who resided outside of new york to litigate their debt collection actions in the southern district of new york and that there was no good reason to litigate the debt collection actions in a federal court.id.at.
on march,the district court entered judgment pursuant to.b in favor of the plaintiffs,dismissing ford credit counterclaims without prejudice.ford credit appeals from this decision.
discussion 
are ford credit counterclaims permissive 
a defines a compulsory counterclaim as 
any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party,if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court can not obtain jurisdiction.
such counterclaims are compulsory in the sense that if they are not raised,they are forfeited.see filtration minuteman international,cir.b defines a permissive counterclaim as any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim.
whether a counterclaim is compulsory or permissive turns on whether the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim,and this circuit has long considered this standard met when there is a logical relationship between the counterclaim and the main claim.see united states aquavella,cir although the logical relationship test does not require an absolute identity of factual backgrounds,id.internal citation omitted,the essential facts of the claims must be so logically connected that considerations of judicial economy and fairness dictate that all the issues be resolved in one lawsuit,at emphasis omitted quoting adam jacobs,cir see also harris steinem,cir united artists masterpiece productions,cir.
we agree with the district court that the debt collection counterclaims were permissive rather than compulsory.the plaintiffs ecoa claim centers on ford credit policy,based on subjective factors,which allegedly resulted in higher finance charges on their purchase contracts than on those of similarly situated white customers.ford credit debt collection counterclaims are related to those purchase contracts,but not to any particular clause or rate.rather,the debt collection counterclaims concern the individual plaintiffs after the contract price was set.thus,the relationship between the counterclaims and the ecoa claim is logical only in the sense that the sale,allegedly on discriminatory credit terms,was the but for cause of the.that is not the sort of relationship contemplated by our case law on compulsory counterclaims.the essential facts for proving the counterclaims and the ecoa claim are not so closely related that resolving both sets of issues in one lawsuit would yield judicial efficiency.indeed,ford credit does not even challenge the ruling that its counterclaims are permissive.
ii.is there jurisdiction over the permissive counterclaims 
for several decades federal courts have asserted that permissive counterclaims require an independent basis of jurisdiction,that the counterclaim must be maintainable in a federal district court on some jurisdictional basis that would have sufficed had it been brought in a separate action.the origin of this proposition,the questioning of it before the statutory authorization of supplemental jurisdiction in section,and the impact of that provision upon the proposition all merit careful consideration.
a origin of the independent basis doctrine.the first suggestion of the requirement of an independent basis for permissive counterclaims is believed to have appeared in marconi wireless telegraph of america national electric signaling,a case involving former equity rule.see thomas green,federal jurisdiction over counterclaims,nw.that rule distinguished in its two parts between what we would now call compulsory counterclaims arising out of the transaction which is the subject matter of the suit and what we would now call permissive counterclaims which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity.equity rule,quoted in moore new york cotton exchange.in moore,the supreme court ruled that the counterclaim in that case bore a sufficient relation to the underlying transaction under the first part of the equity rule to be properly within federal jurisdiction and explicitly declined to consider the point that,under the second branch of the rule,federal jurisdiction independent of the original bill must appear.id.
by,our court somewhat tentatively observed that i t seems to be accepted that a permissive counterclaim is not ancillary and requires independent grounds of jurisdiction.lesnik public industrials,cir citations omitted.we stated the proposition more forcefully two years later in glass sylvania industrial,cir,although our statement,like most of the language in the early cases concerning the proposition,was dictum.
our first holding that independent jurisdiction is required for a permissive counterclaim occurred in.see erie lackawanna,cir.six years later,the supreme court stated,if a counterclaim is compulsory,the federal court will have ancillary jurisdiction over it even though ordinarily it would be a matter for a state court,baker gold seal liquors,d emphasis added,apparently implying that ancillary jurisdiction is not available for a permissive counterclaim.
notably absent from this evolution of the case law is a reasoned explanation of why independent jurisdiction should be needed for permissive counterclaims.one early decision hinted at a reason by suggesting that the then restrictive rules concerning joinder of claims were applicable whether the claims were sought to be added by a plaintiff or a defendant.see electric boat lake torpedo boat.likely also influencing the emergence of the doctrine was concern that,because under rule all counterclaims that are not compulsory are permissive,requiring independent jurisdiction was necessary to prevent federal court adjudication of every conceivable counterclaim that a defendant might happen to have against a plaintiff,some of which might be totally inappropriate for federal jurisdiction.a wife federal law suit against her husband for a declaration of rights as a joint author,for example,ought not to be vehicle for his counterclaim seeking a divorce.perhaps lurking beneath the surface of the casual statements about an independent jurisdiction requirement was apprehension that some counterclaims lacking such a basis would extend the lawsuit beyond article iii limiting scope of cases and controversies.
b questioning the doctrine prior to section.the first challenge to the independent jurisdiction requirement appeared in professor green article in.see thomas green,federal jurisdiction over counterclaims,nw.he mounted a powerful argument against the doctrine,demonstrating how it emerged from unreasoned dicta into unexplained holdings and why it was an unwarranted deviation from the general principle that t wo court actions should not be encouraged where one will do.id.at footnote omitted.he particularly noted the incursion on the doctrine,well established even in when he wrote,that permitted some to be interposed against a plaintiff claim in the absence of independent jurisdiction.professor green questioned why a defendant who can present evidence of a that reduces a plaintiff judgment to zero should not be able to obtain a counterclaim judgment to which his evidence would entitle him in a separate action.id.at.
in,judge friendly,the acknowledged jurisdictional scholar of our court,changed his mind about the independent jurisdiction doctrine and reject ed the conventional learning,which he followed too readily in.united states,cir friendly,concurring judge friendly noted professor green persuasiveness the reasons why the conventional view is wrong are set out in detail in professor green article,and nothing would be gained by repetition.id.
in,the third circuit,in a thoughtful opinion by judge becker,rejected the view that independent jurisdiction is required for all permissive counterclaims.see ambromovage united mine workers,cir.considering whether jurisdiction was available for a,judge becker declined to uphold jurisdiction based on the previously recognized exception to the independent jurisdiction requirement and instead argued broadly for ancillary jurisdiction,with some exceptions over and permissive counterclaims that satisfy the test of sharing a common nucleus of operative fact,united mine workers gibbs,d,with the plaintiff underlying claim.ambromovage,at.we conclude that the determination that a counterclaim is permissive within the meaning of rule is not dispositive of the constitutional question whether there is federal jurisdiction over the counterclaim.id.at.
c the impact of section.the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction,which had been invoked to provide a jurisdictional basis for compulsory counterclaims,was given statutory undergirding when congress added section to title in.see judicial improvements act of,title iii,c,stat.the newly labeled supplemental jurisdiction explicitly extended federal courts authority to all other claims in a civil action so related to claims in the action within the district court original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.
the explicit extension to the limit of article iii of a federal court jurisdiction over all other claims sought to be litigated with an underlying claim within federal jurisdiction recast the jurisdictional basis of permissive counterclaims into constitutional terms after section,it is no longer sufficient for courts to assert,without any reason other than dicta or even holdings from the era of ancillary jurisdiction,that permissive counterclaims require independent jurisdiction.rising to the challenge,after enactment of section,in a case strikingly similar to our pending case,the seventh circuit vacated the dismissal of a permissive counterclaim and remanded for exercise of the discretion contemplated by section.channell citicorp national services,cir.channell involved a creditor counterclaims to collect debts in a class action alleging violations of the consumer leasing act.as judge easterbrook stated,now that congress has codified the supplemental jurisdiction in a,courts should use the language of the statute to define the extent of their powers.id.at.he viewed section s reach to the constitutional limits of article iii as requiring only a loose factual connection between the claims,id.internal quotation marks omitted,a standard that appears to be broader than the gibbs test of a common nucleus of operative facts,appropriate for permitting joinder of a plaintiff claim.in channell,he readily found the requisite loose connection to exist between the consumer leasing act claim and the debt collection counterclaim.id.at.
we share the view that section has displaced,rather than codified,whatever validity inhered in the earlier view that a permissive counterclaim requires independent jurisdiction in the sense of federal question or diversity jurisdiction.the issue in this case therefore becomes whether supplemental jurisdiction is available for ford credit counterclaims.
iii.application of section standards for supplemental jurisdiction 
whether or not the gibbs common nucleus standard provides the outer limit of an article iii case,and is therefore a requirement for entertaining a permissive counterclaim that otherwise lacks a jurisdictional basis,the
