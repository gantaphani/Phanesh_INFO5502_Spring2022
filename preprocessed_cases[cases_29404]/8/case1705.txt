in this appeal from the district court disposition of their motion for an award of attorney fees,plaintiffs,who prevailed in a suit brought under the voting rights act of vra,seek a recalculation of the amount that they may recoup.the known as the lodestar to which their attorneys are presumptively entitled is the product of hours worked and an hourly rate.plaintiffs argue that the district court applied an unnecessarily strict forum rule the district court,they contend,required them to show extraordinary special circumstances before it would use in its lodestar calculation an hourly rate greater than the hourly rate charged by attorneys in the district where the district court sits.
we agree that the district court may have applied the forum rule in too unyielding a fashion.we therefore clarify its proper application in this circuit while the district court should generally use the prevailing hourly rate in the district where it sits to calculate what has been called the lodestar what we think is more aptly termed the presumptively reasonable fee the district court may adjust this base hourly rate to account for a plaintiff reasonable decision to retain counsel,just as it may adjust the base hourly rate to account for other variables.
moreover,this dispute concerning the forum rule is but a symptom of a more serious illness our jurisprudence has become needlessly has come untethered from the free market it is meant to approximate.we therefore suggest that the district court consider,in setting the reasonable hourly rate it uses to calculate the lodestar,what a reasonable,paying client would be willing to pay,not just in deciding whether to use an hourly rate in its fee calculation.a plaintiff bringing suit under the voting rights act,pursuant to which fees can be recovered from the other side,has little incentive to negotiate a rate structure with his attorney prior to the litigation the district court must act later to ensure that the attorney does not recoup fees that the market would not otherwise bear.indeed,the district court unfortunately bears the burden of disciplining the market,stepping into the shoes of the reasonable,paying client,who wishes to pay the least amount necessary to litigate the case effectively.
bearing these background principles in mind,the district court should,in determining what a reasonable,paying client would be willing to pay,consider factors including,but not limited to,the complexity and difficulty of the case,the available expertise and capacity of the client other counsel if any,the resources required to prosecute the case effectively taking account of the resources being marshaled on the other side but not endorsing scorched earth tactics,the timing demands of the case,whether an attorney might have an interest independent of that of his client in achieving the ends of the litigation or might initiate the representation himself,whether an attorney might have initially acted pro bono such that a client might be aware that the attorney expected low or remuneration,and other returns such as reputation,that an attorney might expect from the representation 
although we clarify the application of the forum rule,we affirm the judgment of the district court in this case.it is clear that the district court would adhere to its fee award were we to vacate the district court judgment and remand for reconsideration.indeed,we believe that a reasonable,paying resident of albany would have made a greater effort to retain an attorney practicing in the northern district of new york,whether in syracuse,binghamton,utica,or kingston,than did plaintiffs.the rates charged by attorneys practicing in the southern district of new york would simply have been too high for a thrifty,hypothetical least in comparison to the rates charged by local attorneys,with which he would have been familiar.
background 
on april,plaintiffs filed a complaint against albany county and its board of elections albany defendants alleging that albany county legislative redistricting plan violated of the voting rights act of.see.on august,the district court for the northern district of new york mordue,judge enjoined albany county from conducting its scheduled november election pending adoption by the albany county legislature of a revised redistricting plan.
further proceedings below culminated in the district court rejection of plaintiffs request that it order albany county to hold a special election to take the place of the enjoined november election plaintiffs then appealed to this court.on january,we vacated the district court judgment and ordered the county to hold the special election on march.see arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,cir arbor hill i.
plaintiffs then moved in this court for an award of attorney fees under e.while we acknowledged the merit of the motion in principle,we remanded for a determination of the appropriate fee.see arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,cir arbor hill ii.we noted that plaintiffs had not demonstrated that special circumstances existed that would justify the use of higher rates than those prevailing in the northern district of new york in calculating that fee.arbor hill ii,at quoting in re agent orange prods.liab,cir.
during the course of this litigation,three entities have rendered legal services to the plaintiffs the albany law firm of derohannesian derohannesian d d,as local counsel the washington,lawyer committee for civil rights under law lccrul,selected for its voting rights expertise and the manhattan law firm of gibson,dunn crutcher gibson dunn,chosen because of the firm practice before the second circuit and the firm muscle,specifically,its ability to quickly prepare the appeal on an abbreviated briefing schedule.
gibson dunn sought in the district court to recoup attorney fees calculated on the basis of the hourly rate charged by most attorneys in the southern district of new york and the hourly rate usually charged by gibson dunn.the district court denied gibson dunn request that it adjust the hourly rate it would use to calculate the fees due from that prevalent in the northern district of new york.the district court explained,i t is undisputed that plaintiffs did not even attempt to contact attorneys or law firms in the northern district of new york outside of albany county insofar as obtaining representation in this matter.noting that it was plaintiffs obligation to submit factual support for their claim that there were no law firms in syracuse,binghamton,utica or kingston ready,willing or able to take their case,the district court held that plaintiffs had not adequately justified their request for higher fees.
in addition,the district court reduced the fee award proposed by gibson dunn in various other respects not relevant to this appeal.plaintiffs then timely appealed the fee award,challenging only the district court decision to award gibson dunn a fee based on the hourly rate commonly charged in the northern district.
i.a brief history of attorney fees awards 
courts in the united states have historically applied the american rule,under which each party is to bear its own costs of litigation,unmitigated by any exceptions.see alyeska pipeline servs.wilderness soc y,d.in,however,congress enacted the civil rights attorney fees awards act,which,like the provision of the vra at issue in this appeal,provided that prevailing parties could recoup reasonable attorney fee s.see b e in any action or proceeding to enforce the voting guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.
in the accompanying senate report,congress implicitly endorsed two existing methods of calculating the reasonable fee that were developed in the by the circuit courts.see hensley eckerhart,d.the first,developed by the third circuit,was the lodestar method.see lindy.builder,am.radiator standard sanitary,cir.the lodestar was the product of the attorney usual hourly rate and the number of hours worked.see id.at directing district courts to calculate the lodestar using the attorney normal billing rate see also city of burlington dague,d.after determining the lodestar,the district court could adjust it in setting the reasonable fee.see generally hensley,at.the most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.this calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate.emphasis added lindy,at.thus,the lodestar method involved two steps the lodestar calculation and adjustment of the lodestar based on considerations.
the second method,developed by the fifth circuit,was for district courts to consider twelve specified factors to establish a reasonable fee.see johnson.highway express,cir abrogated on other grounds by blanchard bergeron,d declining to limit fee award to amount stipulated in agreement.the johnson method differed from the lodestar method in that it contemplated a inquiry.
these two circuits had sought to channel the district court discretion in different ways.the lodestar method was consistent with the law firm practice of accounting for each billable hour.see lindy,at t he first inquiry of the court should be into the hours spent by the attorneys.see also gisbrecht barnhart,d as it became standard accounting practice to record hours spent on a client matter,attorneys increasingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was administratively convenient.when the lodestar did not accurately reflect the market,the district court retained authority to adjust the lodestar to ensure that the fee ultimately awarded was reasonable.by contrast,under the johnson method,the hours claimed or spent on a case were not the sole basis for determining a fee.johnson,at.rather than depending on market forces,the johnson method relied on the district court experience and judgment.see id.at t he trial judge expertise gained from past experience as a lawyer and his observation from the bench of lawyers at work become highly important id.at discussing the necessary balancing process.compare id.by this discussion we do not attempt to reduce the calculation of a reasonable fee to mathematical precision,with lindy,at.
in theory,therefore,a district court that adopted the lodestar method was expected to consider fewer variables than a district court utilizing the johnson method.in practice,however,both considered substantially the same set of at a different point in the process.a district court using the lodestar method would set the lodestar and then consider whether,in light of variables such as the difficulty of the case,it should adjust the lodestar before settling on the reasonable fee it was ultimately inclined to award.see,silberman bogle,cir baughman wilson freight forwarding,cir permitting the district court to multiply the lodestar by a contingency factor and accepting,in theory,that obtaining an exceptional result might justify a further upward departure from the lodestar.by contrast,a district court employing the johnson method would consider factors,such as the difficulty of the case,earlier in the process by weighing them in setting its tentative reasonable fee,from which there would seldom be a need to depart.see,in re first colonial of,cir outlining a process whereby first,the attorney seeking fees would document the hours devoted to the case second,the district court would consider the johnson factors and set a reasonable hourly rate and third,the district court would explain how it balanced the johnson factors to arrive at the reasonable hourly rate.
the supreme court adopted the lodestar method in principle,see hensley,at.blum stenson,d,without,however,fully abandoning the johnson method.rather than using the attorney own billing rate to calculate the lodestar and then examining the lodestar in light of variables to ensure that it was in fact a reasonable fee,as the third circuit had suggested,the supreme court instructed district courts to use a reasonable hourly it directed that district courts set in light of the johnson calculating what it continued to refer to as the lodestar.see hensley,at.the district court also may consider other factors identified in johnson though it should note that many of these factors usually are subsumed within the initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate.citation omitted emphasis added blum,at.the supreme court collapsed what had once been a inquiry into a inquiry it shifted district courts focus from the reasonableness of the lodestar to the reasonableness of the hourly rate used in calculating the lodestar,which in turn became the de facto reasonable fee.
but the supreme court emphasis on the third circuit economic model,see,missouri jenkins,d our cases have repeatedly stressed that attorney fees are to be based on market rates for the services rendered,and its simultaneous invocation of the equitable johnson factors at an early stage of the process,proved to be in tension,see blum,at.we recognize,of course,that determining an appropriate market rate for the services of a lawyer is inherently difficult since m arket prices are determined by supply and demand.while the third circuit had expected district courts to correct for market dysfunction,the supreme court now asked district court judges to hypothesize that market on the basis of their experience as lawyers within their districts and on the basis of affidavits provided by the parties.generally speaking,the rates an attorney routinely charges are those that the market will bear yet the supreme court required that the district courts conjure a different,reasonable hourly rate.
after hensley and blum,circuit courts struggled with the nettlesome interplay between the lodestar method and the johnson method.compare rutherford harris county,cir to decide an appropriate attorney fee award,the district court was first required to calculate a lodestar fee depending on the circumstances of the case and the johnson factors.the court was next obligated to consider whether the lodestar amount should be adjusted upward or downward,depending on the johnson factors.emphasis added,with murray weinberger,t he reasonable hourly rate which is incorporated into the lodestar figure generally reflects the reputation and ability of the attorney,the attorney experience,and the level of skill required for the particular case,and bebchick.area metro.transit comm n,of course,the actual rate that applicant counsel can command on the market is itself highly relevant proof of the prevailing community rate.
and the supreme court has not yet fully resolved the relationship between the two methods.in cases decided after hensley and blum,it has both suggested that district courts should use the johnson factors to adjust the lodestar,see,blanchard,at.stating that the district court should arrive at an initial estimate and then adjust this lodestar calculation by other factors see also id.the johnson factors may be relevant in adjusting the lodestar amount.pierce underwood,d brennan,concurring suggesting that factors might exist that would justify an enhancement of the lodestar,and reiterated its holding in hensley and blum that many of the johnson factors are subsumed within the initial calculation.valley citizens council for clean air,d.
our court has done little to resolve this confusion.compare kassim city of schenectady,cir affirming the district court authority to reduce the fee awarded to a prevailing plaintiff below the lodestar by reason of the plaintiff partial or limited success emphasis added,with luciano olsten,cir the product of the number of reasonable hours times a reasonable hourly rate,however,does not end the inquiry.there remain other considerations,based on the facts of the particular case,that may lead the district court to ultimately make an adjustment to the hourly structure.internal citations omitted,and mcdonald pension plan of the pension trust fund,cir lodestar calculated on the basis of prevailing rate specifically for erisa practitioners in this circuit emphasis added,and chambless masters,mates pilots pension plan,cir suggesting,in determining the lodestar,that smaller firms may be subject to their own prevailing market rate.
the net result of the jurisprudence here and in the supreme court is that the district courts must engage in an equitable inquiry of varying methodology while making a pretense of mathematical precision.see report of the third circuit task force,court awarded attorney fees,the lindy process creates a sense of mathematical precision that is unwarranted.the lodestar is no longer a lodestar in the true sense of the word a star that leads,webster third international dictionary.nor do courts use it in the way the term was first used by the third a base amount that is susceptible of ready adjustment rather,circuit court deference to the district court estimate of a reasonable hourly rate is a lodestar only in the sense that it is a guiding jurisprudential principle,see dague,at.the lodestar figure has,as its name suggests,become the guiding light of our jurisprudence.what the district courts in this circuit produce is in effect not a lodestar as originally conceived,but rather a presumptively reasonable fee.see id.holding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.the focus of the district courts is no longer on calculating a reasonable fee,but rather on setting a reasonable hourly rate,taking account of all variables.
the district court opinion,including the report and recommendation of magistrate judge david homer,with which the district court agreed after de novo review,reflects the general confusion surrounding the lodestar calculation.in places,the district court appears to envision a lodestar calculation process yet elsewhere it seems to contemplate undertaking the calculation in one step.likewise,at times,the district court emphasizes its role in approximating the workings of the market,but it also suggests some difference between rates paid by private retained clients and rates ordered by courts.
the meaning of the term lodestar has shifted over time,and its value as a metaphor has deteriorated to the point of unhelpfulness.this opinion abandons its use we think the better the one most consistent with attorney fees for the district court,in exercising its considerable discretion,to bear in mind all of the variables that we and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of attorney fees in setting a reasonable hourly rate.the reasonable hourly rate is the rate a paying client would be willing to pay.in determining what rate a paying client would be willing to pay,the district court should consider,among others,the johnson factors it should also bear in mind that a reasonable,paying client wishes to spend the minimum necessary to litigate the case effectively.the district court should also consider that such an individual might be able to negotiate with his or her attorneys,using their desire to obtain the reputational benefits that might accrue from being associated with the case.the district court should then use that reasonable hourly rate to calculate what can properly be termed the presumptively reasonable fee.
ii.the forum rule 
we turn now to the particular rule at issue in this case.it was against the muddled legal landscape we have just described that the second circuit promulgated what we will call the forum rule.the supreme court directed that district courts should use the prevailing hourly rate in the community in calculating the what we are now calling the presumptively reasonable fee.after blum,we explained that the community for purposes of this calculation is the district where the district court sits.see polk state dep t of corr,cir.
however,district indeed our succumbed to the general confusion surrounding the difference between a lodestar and a reasonable hourly rate.sometimes,they considered the variation between and rates in setting the hourly rate which they then used to calculate the presumptively reasonable fee but sometimes,they considered that variation only in deciding whether to adjust the presumptively reasonable fee after they had arrived at it on the basis of rates.compare polk,at t he rate prevailing in the appropriate community is only one of many factors bearing on determination of a fee award,with arbor hill ii,at intimating that a district court should permit plaintiffs to recover more than a fee calculated on the basis of the hourly rate usually charged by attorneys in the forum district only if plaintiffs could show that the case required special expertise beyond the competence of forum district law firms 
we now clarify that a district court may use an hourly some rate in between the rate sought and the rates charged by local calculating the presumptively reasonable fee if it is clear that a reasonable,paying client would have paid those higher rates.we presume,however,that a reasonable,paying client would in most cases hire counsel from within his district,or at least counsel whose rates are consistent with those charged locally.this presumption may be only in the unusual the party wishing the district court to use a higher rate demonstrates that his or her retention of an attorney was reasonable under the circumstances as they would be reckoned by a client paying the attorney bill.we believe that the district court assessment of the reasonableness of a prevailing party decision to retain counsel is best considered in setting the hourly than in deciding whether to adjust a presumptively reasonable three reasons.first,our holding comports with the holdings of several sister circuits and with the supreme court focus on reasonable hourly rates rather than reasonable fees.see,blum,at.emphasizing the importance of using the market rate in calculating attorney fees rum creek coal sales,caperton,cir in circumstances where it is reasonable to retain attorneys from other communities the rates in those communities may also be considered.maceira pagan,cir if a local attorney could perform the service,a private client,paying his own fees,would probably hire local counsel at the local,average rate.chrapliwy uniroyal,cir querying whether the choice of counsel was improvident.
second,in pierce underwood,a case interpreting the attorney fees provision of the equal access to justice act eaja,the supreme court hinted that in the broad spectrum of litigation,the difficulty of obtaining local counsel competent to prosecute a particular case is little more than a routine reason why market rates are what they are,d emphasis added.the supreme court distinguished that broad spectrum of litigation from the attorney fees provision of the eaja,which stipulates that fees shall be based upon prevailing market rates but shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved justifies a higher fee.d a ii see pierce,at.see generally healey leavitt,cir.
third and finally,our holding honors the supreme court emphasis on the need to use the approximate market rate for an attorney services in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee.see jenkins,at.the legal communities of today are increasingly interconnected.to define markets simply by geography is too simplistic.sometimes,legal markets may be defined by practice area.see ex rel.new york city dep t of,cir so long as the law provides for or permits fee awards based on geographic markets for services,a lawyer may be paid at different rates for otherwise indistinguishable services.on the other hand,many cases including many voting rights cases are intrinsically local,and the relevant legal market may be coextensive with or smaller than the district itself.by asking what a reasonable,paying client would do,a district court best approximates the workings of today market for legal services.see mathur bd.of trs.of,cir the realities of the legal community today mean that though some attorney probably could have represented the plaintiff,one factor or another prevented them from taking the case when he needed a lawyer.not incidentally,a reasonable,paying client might consider whether a lawyer is willing to offer h
