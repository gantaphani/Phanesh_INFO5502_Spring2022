background 
petitioner dardana,a cayman islands corporation,is the assignee of two awards rendered by a swedish arbitral tribunal against respondents yng and yukos for breach of contract.the contract at issue was executed in january between western atlas international western atlas and yng.western atlas is a delaware corporation operating principally in houston,texas.yng is an open joint stock company organized under russian law and a subsidiary of yukos under the contract,western atlas agreed to provide technical services to assist yng in developing its oil and gas prospects in siberia.in,with yng consent,western atlas assigned the contract to its subsidiary petroalliance services petroalliance,a limited liability company registered in cyprus with a business address in houston,texas.a dispute thereafter arose over nonpayment for petroalliance services.in december,petroalliance submitted its claim to arbitration in accordance with the contract.the contract provides that any dispute would be submitted for arbitration in stockholm under the arbitration rules of the stockholm chamber of commerce,and that swedish law governs the contract in the event of a dispute.
in the arbitration proceedings,petroalliance sought to recover from yng as well as from yng parent company yukos on the ground that yukos had assumed the contract.yng participated in the proceedings but yukos did not upon yng objection to consolidation of the two claims,the swedish arbitral panel conducted the arbitrations separately.in its first decision in may,the panel found yng in breach of its contractual obligations.it awarded petroalliance over million in damages plus over million in interest as of june and interest at the rate of per month thereafter in march,the same panel concluded that yukos had assumed the contract,including the obligation to arbitrate,under swedish law.it found that yng had no independent administration or control of its payments for services performed by petroalliance but was in financial terms run by and controlled by yukos and that yukos had held itself out as the contract party to petroalliance.the panel thus held yukos jointly and severally liable with yng for petroalliance damages.yng and yukos each sought in sweden to set aside the arbitral award rendered against it in february,the district court of stockholm rejected yng challenge to the arbitration and upheld the award yukos appeal is still pending before the stockholm court,but its request for an inhibition to suspend enforcement of the arbitral award was denied in june.
meanwhile,dardana ultimately succeeded to petroalliance interest in the two arbitral awards,and it sought to confirm and enforce the awards in a number of forums in june,dardana filed the instant petition to confirm the arbitral awards pursuant to the convention,codified in chapter two of the federal arbitration act faa at.dardana also moved by order to show cause for entry and enforcement of a final judgment under the federal rules of civil procedure and new york civil practice law and rules,apparently including the new york uniform foreign recognition act article,or any applicable federal or state statute.to that end,it requested an order allowing prejudgment discovery and attachment of assets.
in its papers,dardana alleged that yng and yukos had consented,or waived objection,to the jurisdiction of the district court by virtue of the contract.dardana also argued that respondents have had significant business dealings with the united states and new york based companies on a continuing and systemic basis for some years making it likely,if not highly probable,that there are significant assets information about the location of assets in this jurisdiction.
in october,yukos moved to dismiss dardana petition under.b for failure to state a claim on the basis that it was not a party to the contract and under.b for lack of personal jurisdiction.yukos also moved in the alternative for a stay of these proceedings pursuant to article vi of the convention.as already noted,yng did not appear before the district court,and yukos took no position on whether that award against yng should be confirmed.
the parties submitted affidavits and documentary evidence on yukos motion.most of the submissions dealt with whether yukos was a party to the contract and thus subject to the arbitral award under swedish or russian law.with regard to the issue of personal jurisdiction,yukos submitted a brief statement that it has no continuous,permanent or substantial activity in new york,and that it did not maintain an office or employees or own real property in new york.dardana responded that yukos conclusory statement had not answered dardana specific allegations,including that yukos had consented to jurisdiction through the contract,was conducting and soliciting business in new york and the united states through its agents,employed investment banks and other companies,planned to issue american depository receipts to trade its securities in the united states,concluded contracts with business entities in new york,and conducted petroleum transactions and maintained bank accounts and other credit facilities in new york and the united states.the district court did not order discovery or hold an evidentiary hearing or argument on any of these issues.
in a memorandum and order filed in september,the district court addressed only yukos motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court concluded that although the convention conferred federal subject matter jurisdiction over dardana petition to confirm the swedish arbitral awards,it did not confer personal jurisdiction over respondents.the court thus looked to the state long arm statute,to determine whether general jurisdiction could be asserted over the appearing respondent yukos after reviewing yukos alleged contacts with new york,the court concluded that,even if those contacts existed,dardana failed to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction.accordingly,the court dismissed the complaint against yukos.then,explaining that even in the absence of a motion from yng,the court must conduct an independent analysis of its jurisdiction over yng,the court found that the contacts between yng and new york were even more tenuous and sua sponte dismissed the petition against yng for lack of personal jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in this court,dardana challenges the district court ruling regarding the sufficiency of respondents alleged contacts with new york.dardana also argues that it should have been permitted to proceed,even if the district court were correct in its jurisdictional analysis,on grounds that the court did not address.dardana contends that respondents contractually consented,or waived objection,to jurisdiction in a court of dardana choosing and respondents nationwide contacts,grouped together,are sufficient to confer general ju
