regatos signed an account agreement with cbny in the agreement included the following language

d at quoting account agreement.regatos received account statements only on request.in regatos requested and received statements prior to the two wire transfers at issue.regatos did not request another statement until august,than days after the wire transfers in though additional bank statements had become available in the interim.immediately upon viewing his statement on august,regatos informed cbny that the two transfers at issue were unauthorized.on appeal,cbny does not contest this point.

discussion 
this appeal presents two issues of first impression in the interpretation of new york uniform commercial code article.first,this case presents the important question of whether the statute of repose created by section can be varied by agreement of the parties.second,this case raises the issue of whether article notice requirements can be least if the parties have so constructive notice.because each issue is a matter of first impression in new york and may be determinative of the appeal,we certify both to the new york court of appeals.
new york article in general 
electronic funds transfers,including the two transfers at issue in this case,are governed by article.see.although cbny attempts to argue that the transfers at issue are also governed by parallel provisions in article,the plain language of article belies cbny argument.section specifically provides that resort to principles of law or equity outside of article is not appropriate to create rights,duties and liabilities inconsistent with those stated in this article.
the applicable provisions of article for this case are sections,and.section is the core substantive provision governing a customer right to a refund from its bank for unauthorized transfers of funds 
if a receiving bank accepts a payment order issued in the name of its customer as sender which is a not authorized and not effective as the order of the customer under section,the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer.
id.thus,as required by section a,we look to section to determine whether the payment orders were authorized or effective.as noted above,the bank has waived any contention that the payment orders were authorized for our purposes they were not.the effectiveness of a payment order is defined by section,which provides that a payment order is effective if a the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders,and b the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure id.emphasis added.the jury in this case found that cbny had failed to prove that it had executed the transfers in compliance with the security procedure.id.
early on in the litigation,cbny raised a complete defense to liability tied to the account agreement.the bank contended that the account agreement restricted the period in which regatos could seek a refund to days from the issuance of a bank statement that identified the suspicious payment order,regardless of whether regatos actually received the statement.in light of the timing of regatos objection to the the same day as actual receipt of the bank statement but more than days from the first bank statement identifying the bank asserted that regatos was too late to seek a refund.although judge scheindlin recognized that this defense presented issues of first impression in new york law,she had no alternative but to decide these questions by resolving the summary judgment motion.judge scheindlin concluded that the statute prohibited a contractual shortening of the notice period and required actual notice to the customer of the improper transfer.thus the bank had to refund to regatos the principal lost in the transfers if the payment orders were not authorized or effective see regatos,d at.
on appeal,the bank raises a number of issues,some of which need not be addressed at this time.the two points relevant to the certification equation are contained in the legal questions that judge scheindlin resolved in regatos favor when she denied summary judgment.see generally regatos,d.the bank contends that even if the payments were not authorized or effective,its account agreement with regatos successfully limited regatos to a period in which to object to transfers from his account.the bank further contends that the period ran from the time that the first account statement reflecting an unauthorized transfer became available to regatos,despite the fact accordance with the account agreement hold mail did not actually see that account statement until months later,after regatos specifically requested it.
varying section statute of repose by agreement 
as noted above,when a transfer is neither authorized not contested here nor effective as the jury so found under section,the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer.but the right to a refund is not without limitation.section provides that i f the customer received notification reasonably identifying the relevant payment order,the customer is precluded from asserting that the bank is not entitled to retain the payment unless the customer notifies the bank of the customer objection to the payment within one year after the notification was received by the customer.id.the official comment to section notes that this section is in the nature of a statute of repose for objecting to debits made to the customer account.id.
the bank contends that this limitation on refunds can be and was reduced by the regatos account agreement to days from the date the bank statement first identified the transfers in question.thus,argues the bank,regatos demand was claim barred by his repose.regatos,not surprisingly,argues that regardless of whether the notice requirement entails actual or constructive notice of the transfers,the time limit can not be varied by agreement at all in his view,the right to a refund and the conditions that govern its assertion define the obligation of a receiving b
