in the course of deciding on a site for a new postal facility,joseph leonti,the plant manager of the portland,maine,united states postal service center,made statements about one of the sites that had been under consideration.the owner of the site,the davric maine corporation,felt that it and the site had been defamed.davric and the man who owns it,joseph ricci,filed suit in federal court against both the postal service and leonti for defamation and tortious interference under state law,and in addition claimed that a constitutional tort had been committed.
the district court dismissed the claims against the postal service on the ground that the postal service enjoys sovereign immunity from suit absent a waiver,and that its immunity had not been waived as to defamation or tortious interference claims.the court also dismissed the state law tort claims against the official on the ground that the official had been acting within the scope of his employment,and dismissed the constitutional tort claim for failure to state a claim.plaintiffs appeal.this case presents an interesting question of first impression about the relation and interaction between the postal reorganization act,et,and the federal tort claims act,b.we affirm the district court dismissal based on the conclusion that these acts,taken together,do not waive the postal service immunity for state defamation or tortious interference claims.we also affirm the dismissal of the claims against leonti.
for the purposes of a motion to dismiss,we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint.see day massachusetts air guard,cir duckworth pratt whitney,cir.the postal service in maine entered into a search for a new location for its processing and distribution center.one site under consideration was a parcel in scarborough downs owned by davric.the postal service entered into initial negotiations to purchase the site,but soon focused on a different site,one on rand road,as its preferred site.joseph ricci,the indirect owner of davric,and tony armstrong,davric real estate broker,became outspoken critics of the rand road site,charging that the site was environmentally sensitive and alleging other mischief behind the postal service preference for the rand road site.the postal service eventually rejected the rand road site.
after rejecting that site,the postal service again reviewed several possible sites,including the davric site,and ultimately announced a plan to move the center to lewiston rather than settling on the davric site.plaintiffs maintain that the davric site was preferable and that this rejection of the site was in retaliation for their outspoken opposition to the rand road site.
it is in the course of defending this decision that the alleged defamation took place.in a series of meetings with postal service employees to explain the site selection process,joseph leonti,the plant manger of the current distribution center,said that the davric site was environmentally contaminated and that its development posed serious wetlands problems.in one instance,leonti allegedly linked ricci and davric to organized crime,claiming that there were dead horses and bodies buried on the site,and maybe even jimmy hoffa could be buried there.plaintiffs say that all of these descriptions are untrue.these meetings also included presentation materials prepared in part by the postal service,allegedly defamatory as well.
plaintiffs then filed this suit contending that these false statements have diminished the value of davric property and will continue to do so,and that they have also caused substantial damages to ricci reputation.
sovereign immunity presents a threshold issue for davric suit for damages against the postal service.the postal service argues that under c of title,codifying the postal reorganization act,all tort claims against the postal service must be brought under the federal tort claims act.however,the postal service says,the ftca explicitly exempts most intentional torts,including defamation and tortious interference,from its waiver of sovereign immunity.see h.therefore,the postal service concludes,the defamation and interference claims must be dismissed.davric responds that the postal reorganization act general sue and be sued provision,see,governs all suits against the postal service not cognizable under the ftca,and since defamation suits are not cognizable under the ftca,they fall under the pra general waiver of sovereign immunity.
these contending constructions of the statutory scheme present a close question.the text of the individual sections does not present a clear answer,but the structure of the scheme argues against davric position.the legislative history of these provisions affords little guidance.absent evidence of congressional intent to have the postal service,a entity,held liable for intentional torts under state law,the exclusion from the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity controls.
enacted in,the pra established the postal service as a entity that was to compete on essentially level ground with private enterprise.to that end,provides that the postal service can sue and be sued,generally waiving the immunity from suit it would otherwise have as a public entity see.see also loeffler frank,d by launching the postal service into the commercial world and including a clause in its charter,congress has cast off the service cloak of sovereignty and given it the status of a private commercial enterprise.citing library of congress shaw,d.however,of the pra provides that tort suits brought against the postal service are governed by the provisions of the ftca see c see also a providing that claims against sue and be sued agencies must be brought through the ftca where cognizable under the ftca finally,lists exceptions to the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity,including the exemption of most state intentional torts see h.
the issue turns on how these provisions are characterized,that is,whether state intentional torts such as defamation fall within the scope of the ftca but are excepted from its waiver of sovereign immunity and so suit can not be brought under the pra,or whether they simply fall outside of its scope as a result of their exception and so suit under the pra is permissible.while murky on this point,the structure of the statutory scheme,taken altogether,suggests the former interpretation.
by its terms,c of the pra limits the scope of the more general waiver of sovereign immunity contained in.for state tort claims arising out of the activity of the postal service,c compels the application of the ftca and its attendant provisions.read in context,then,c of the pra is best understood to waive the immunity from suit that the postal service would otherwise enjoy as a federal entity only insofar as that immunity would have been waived under the ftca.such a reading accords with the language in a providing that for claims that fall within the purview of the ftca,claims against agencies are to be treated like a claim against any other federal agency.two distinct avenues for interpreting c both arrive at this conclusion.
first,the reference in pra c to chapter and all other provisions of title relating to tort claims can be read to incorporate the ftca in its entirety as the exclusive vehicle for bringing state tort claims against the postal service,including the ftca waiver of immunity from suit in b,its attendant procedural requirements,the exclusiveness of its remedy compelled by a,and its exceptions,as provided in.on this approach,the question becomes simply whether the claim presented is a state tort claim arising out of the activities of the postal service under c.if so,then the claim is governed by the ftca as a whole,including its exception of defamation and interference claims from its waiver of sovereign immunity.
davric argues that once the claim falls outside the scope of the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity,it then must fall back within the ambit of the pra more general waiver.the best basis in the statutory language for this claim is the introduction to the exceptions provision,which states that the provisions of the ftca shall not apply to defamation suits.see.if the ftca shall not apply to defamation claims,davric says,then defamation claims are not cognizable under the ftca and hence the general waiver of immunity in the pra applies.however,attention to the remainder of makes clear that this reading is not tenable.section b excepts any claim arising out of the loss,miscarriage,or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter from the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity.following davric proposed construction of the statutory scheme,this provision,b,would be rendered mere surplusage,as suits against the postal service for loss of postal matter could then simply be brought under the pra waiver of sovereign immunity rather than under the ftca.since this outcome is not conceivably within congress intent,davric suggested construction of the statutory scheme must be rejected,and the best reading of the statutory scheme affords the postal service with the protections afforded all other federal agencies by the exceptions to the ftca waiver of immunity,including the exception for state intentional tort claims.
alternatively,pra c can be read to incorporate each individual provision of title relating to state tort claims directly into the pra general waiver of sovereign immunity.on this approach,c compels the application of the exceptions provision,to tort claims arising out of the activity of the postal service.section c limits the scope of the general waiver of sovereign immunity in,and by this reference incorporates the exceptions provided in the ftca.hence,plaintiffs defamation and tortious interference claims must be dismissed,as they fall within these incorporated exceptions.
davric argues that prior interpretations of waivers by the supreme court compel a broader reading of the waiver of immunity in the pra.first,in loeffler,the supreme court held that sovereign immunity did not bar recovery of prejudgement interest against the postal service in a title vii action.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that the pra,including the provision in,reflected congress general design that the postal service be run more like a business than its predecessor.id.at.citation omitted.given that the purpose of such clauses is to enable such agencies to engage in commercial and business transactions on equal footing with the private sector,davric argues that courts ought to construe such clauses liberally and impose exceptions on their waiver reluctantly,in order to effectuate that purpose.see loeffler,at,citing federal housing admin.burr.
in meyer,d,the supreme court held that the predecessor of the fdic,an agency authorized to sue and be sued,could be sued in a bivens constitutional tort action.while recognizing that a of the ftca sought to put agencies on the same footing as other federal agencies with respect to claims which are cognizable under the ftca,id.at,the court concluded that constitutional torts were not cognizable under the ftca and therefore such an action against the fdic was not barred,id.at.again the court emphasized that clauses should be read broadly.id.at.davric argues that under the reasoning of meyer,and in light of the direction in meyer and loeffler to construe clauses such as broadly,the fact that defamation claims are excepted from the ftca should be interpreted to render them not cognizable under the ftca and therefore within the scope of the general waiver of the pra.
while davric is correct that both of these opinions contain language suggesting that clauses should be construed broadly to effectuate their purpose,a closer look at the reasoning of these opinions shows they do not aid davric.in each case where courts have allowed tort cases to proceed against agencies outside of the procedures and limitations of the ftca,the plaintiffs advanced federal federal constitutional torts or federal statutory torts see meyer,d federal constitutional tort global mail united states postal,cir claim under lanham act federal express united states postal,cir same united states q int l courier,cir same.
plaintiffs ask this court to extend this reasoning to those state common law torts excepted by,such as the defamation and interference claims they advance in this case.however,the reasoning of the supreme court in meyer is explicitly premised on the fact that the bivens claim presented in that action arose under federal rather than state law.meyer reasoned that the constitutional tort was not cognizable under the ftca because it did not fall within the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity in b,as that waiver was limited to claims where a private person would be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.meyer,at.the court has consistently held that this reference to the law of the place means the law of the state,which provides the source of substantive liability under the ftca.id.at.citing cases.since by definition federal law,not state law,provides the source of liability for a federal constitutional tort claim,it is not cognizable under the ftca and therefore the claim can fall within the general waiver.id.at.
davric argument fails.as the defamation and tortious interference claims davric advances clearly arise under the law of the,maine substantive law of tort are claims that are cognizable under the ftca.since the claims are cognizable under the ftca,all the requirements and limitations upon which the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity is conditioned apply.indeed,many of the cases relied upon by davric make clear that the ftca governs state tort claims against the postal service.see,loeffler,at.federal express,at global mail,at.hence the defamation and tortious interference claims must be dismissed.
section h of the ftca embodies an understandable policy against compelling the public fisc to bear the costs of intentional torts committed by public employees.the extent to which this policy rationale extends to agencies is not immediately evident.more importantly,however,that determination is properly one of legislative policy judgment.westfall erwin,d noting that congress is in the best position to provide guidance on complex questions of sovereign immunity.in the absence of any evidence that congress did not intend to afford,agencies the protection of the exemption from suit for state intentional torts,and in light of the judicial policy of construing waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly,we can not find that the statutory scheme indicates that the postal service has waived its immunity from suit for defamation or tortious interference claims.therefore,davric claims against the postal service were properly dismissed.
davric also appeals the dismissal of defendant joseph leonti.plaintiffs sued leonti individually on all three claims.the district court dismissed the defamation and tortious interference claims against leonti,substituting the united states as party defendant for leonti under the westfall act,see d,and dismissed the constitutional tort claim against leonti for failure to state a claim.plaintiffs appeal.
first,plaintiffs challenge the substitution of the united states for leonti on the defamation and tortious interference claims.the defendants moved to substitute the united states for leonti as a defendant pursuant to d,which provides that u pon certification by the attorney general that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose,the action shall be deemed an action against the united states and the united states shall be substituted as the party defendant.id.the motion was accompanied by a certification from the united states attorney that leonti was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the alleged incidents.the district court granted the motion as to the tortious interference and defamation claims though not as to the alleged constitutional torts,as they fall outside the scope of the ftca,substituted the united states,and dismissed the claims davric appeals,arguing that while the court recognized that the certification is provisional and subject to judicial review,the plaintiffs were unable to make the requisite factual show
