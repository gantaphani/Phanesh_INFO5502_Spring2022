background 
because this is an appeal from a dismissal under.b,we view the facts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to appellants.see faulkner beer,cir.
a the hiring of lmb and the dispute resolution and settlement agreement 
the complaint alleges that lmb conducted a meeting at which appellants and some individuals collectively,the claimants hired lmb to pursue employment discrimination claims against nextel,a delaware corporation.the retainer agreement with lmb,a new york law firm,was executed in new jersey.it is alleged that extravagant promises of recoveries against nextel were made at the meeting.the agreement specified a contingency fee to go to lmb.
the complaint alleges that lmb never intended to bring,and never brought,any discrimination actions against nextel.instead,lmb intended to follow a prior lmb practice of seeking direct payments,including payments as a legal consultant,from putative,in this case,nextel.on september,lmb and nextel met in new york and signed an agreement styled the dispute resolution and settlement agreement drsa.under the drsa,lmb was to be paid million if it persuaded the claimants to i drop all pending lawsuits and administrative complaints against nextel within two weeks excluding already filed worker compensation claims and ii sign within ten weeks individual agreements in which each claimant agreed to be bound by the drsa.the drsa was to become effective on the date upon which those conditions were met the effective date.the million was to be paid to lmb within days of that date.
the drsa set forth a dispute resolution process drp that was designated as the exclusive means of settlement for all claimants then represented by lmb.the first stage consisted of an interview and direct negotiation between nextel and each individual claimant.the second stage called for mediation of any unresolved claims.the third stage called for binding arbitration of any remaining unresolved claims.
the drsa provided that nextel would pay another million to lmb upon the resolution of half of the claimants claims and a final million upon resolution of the remaining claims.all claims had to be either resolved or submitted to binding arbitration within weeks of the effective date,or nextel would be entitled to withhold final payment from lmb and deduct for each month that claims remained to be resolved or submitted to arbitration.the drsa also stated that each claimant would agree to be represented by lmb throughout the drp,to be bound by the result of the drp and not to pursue any other relief in any other forum for any claim against nextel,to waive punitive damages and relief,to execute a general release as a prerequisite for receiving any award,and to adhere to a confidentiality agreement concerning the drsa.
lmb also promised not to accept any new clients with claims against nextel,not to refer any individual with claims against nextel to another lawyer or law firm,and not to accept compensation for any prior referrals.finally,the drsa provided that nextel would retain lmb as a legal consultant the consultancy agreement for a period of two years following the resolution of all claims for an additional consultancy fee of per month,or million,bringing the total value of the drsa to lmb to million.
b the individual agreements and settlements 
the complaint alleges that,in the weeks following the execution of the drsa,lmb approached the claimants to obtain signed individual agreements and pledges of good faith.in the individual agreement,the particular claimant had to state that he or she reviewed the drsa had the opportunity to discuss that agreement with lmb or any other counsel of his or her choosing and agree to comply fully with the terms of that agreement.with respect to the payment of legal fees,the individual agreements stated only that i acknowledge and understand that nextel has agreed to pay an amount of money to lmb to cover the attorneys fees and expenses,other than expert fees,that claimants might otherwise pay to lmb the pledges of good faith stated that,for purposes of keeping the drsa confidential,each claimant consented to selecting two representatives in my area to maintain a copy of the drsa.upon request to either of the area representatives,claimants will be allowed to review the drsa.
the six appellants,along with all but fourteen of the claimants,signed individual agreements and pledges of good faith.the complaint alleges that,notwithstanding the statements in the individual agreements and pledges of good faith,lmb did not allow the claimants to review the full drsa,but rather provided only the signature page of the drsa,the individual agreements,and a document entitled highlights of settlement agreement the highlights document.the highlights document outlined the major provisions of the drsa,including the drp,the requirement that claimants drop all pending lawsuits and complaints,the confidentiality requirement,and the consultancy agreement.the highlights document specifically stated that the consultancy agreement posed a conflict of interest for lmb,which the claimant agreed to waive by signing the individual agreement.with respect to the contractual payments to lmb,the highlights document stated only that nextel is paying each claimant attorneys fees,costs,and expenses other than expert witness fees in consideration for each claimant participating in the drp and honoring all of the conditions.the document did not make any mention of the amounts lmb was to be paid or the various conditions on those payments,as described above.
in february,lmb and nextel executed a second to the drsa to account for the fourteen claimants amendment.in amendment,lmb agreed that nextel would reduce lmb final payment from million to,a reduction of per claimant.the sum of was to remain in an escrow account until the end of the consultancy period,at which point it would be paid to lmb minus any amount nextel paid to defend,settle,or satisfy judgments in lawsuits by the fourteen claimants,up to for each claimant.between august and december,all six appellants settled their disputes with nextel through the drp for relief not specified in the complaint.
c the present action 
on october,appellants filed this action,both individually and as class representatives of the remaining claimants,against lmb and nextel in the superior court of new jersey,passaic county.based on diversity of citizenship,lmb and nextel removed the case to the district court for the district of new jersey,and then filed motions to dismiss the complaint.lmb also moved to change venue to the southern district of new york.the motion was granted and the case transferred to the southern district on september.
appellants complaint alleges that the drsa amounted to a conspiracy between lmb and nextel by which nextel secretly bought lmb loyalty through payment of the designated amounts.the complaint asserted a host of claims against lmb,including breach of fiduciary duty,commercial bribery,fraud,unjust enrichment,legal malpractice,breach of contract,unauthorized practice of law,conversion,and violation of the new jersey rico statute.the complaint also asserted claims against nextel for tortious interference with contract,commercial bribery,and aiding and abetting or conspiring with lmb in its breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,legal malpractice,and breach of contract.
on march,the district court granted appellees motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim against either lmb or nextel.the court applied new york choice of law rules and concluded that new york law governed the matter.the court held that,by signing the individual agreements and pledges of good faith,appellants confirmed as a matter of law that they had the opportunity to review the drsa.it concluded,therefore,that appellants failed to state a claim under new york law for breach of fiduciary duty or fraud because both claims rested on appellants allegations that lmb failed to disclose the drsa compensation agreement.with respect to appellants malpractice claim,the court found that the complaint did not contain any factual allegations regarding how lmb ineffectively or inadequately represented appellants during the drp.to the extent that the malpractice claims rested on the drsa compensation structure,the court found that appellants failed to state a claim because they did not allege that the money paid by nextel to lmb would otherwise have gone to appellants.the court found the remainder of appellants claims to be without merit.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants have briefed on appeal the dismissal of their claims of breach of fiduciary obligation,breach of contract,fraud,malpractice,and new jersey rico claims.we deal with those claims after a brief discussion of choice of law.
with regard to the choice of law issues,we review the district court choice of law de novo.abdullahi pfizer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the district court erroneously applied new york choice of law rules.in fact,new jersey choice of law rules apply because new jersey law would have governed had there been no change of venue.see van dusen barrack,see also abdullahi,at.new jersey applies a flexible analysis.rowe hoffman la roche.
the first step in the analysis is to determine whether a conflict exists between the laws of new york and new jersey.any such conflict is to be determined on an basis.
if there is no actual conflict,then the question is inconsequential,and the forum state here new york applies its own law to resolve the disputed issue.if there is an actual conflict,the second step seeks to determine the interest that each state has in resolving the specific issue in dispute.the court must identify the governmental policies underlying the law of each state and determine whether those policies are affected by each state contacts to the litigation and to the parties.we must apply the law of the state with the greatest interest in governing the particular issue.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the parties appear to agree that there is no difference between new york and new jersey law as to all of appellants claims,save for the new jersey rico claim we vacate and remand that claim for reconsideration in light of this opinion conclusion that new jersey choice of law rules apply and its discussion of the events giving rise to this action.
we turn now to the merits of the other claims briefed on appeal.we review the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim de novo faulkner,at.the court accepts all allegations in the complaint as true,drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.in order to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,a complaint must allege a plausible set of facts sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.operating local annuity trust fund smith barney fund mgmt.llc,cir quoting bell atl.twombly.
a fiduciary obligation 
the elements of a claim for breach of a fiduciary obligation are i the existence of a fiduciary duty ii a knowing breach of that duty and iii damages resulting therefrom.see barrett freifeld,dep t accord macdonell.
the existence of a fiduciary duty between lmb and appellants is beyond dispute.it is also plain that,if there was a breach,it could not have been due to negligence but rather,given the nature of the drsa and the complaint allegations,had to be knowing and intentional on lmb part.
appellants contend that lmb breached its fiduciary duty to the claimants by signing the drsa because the terms of the drsa created a conflict of interest between lmb and its claimant clients a conflict that was not consentable,that is,one that could not be obviated by procuring the clients consent.moreover,they allege that even if the conflicts were consentable,lmb failed to properly disclose them.appellants further argue that as a result of lmb undisclosed conflicts of interest,their settlement awards were unreasonably low and did not approximate the true value of the ir claims.lmb and nextel contend that any conflicts of interest created by the drsa were consentable and that,as a matter of law,appellants can not claim to have been unaware of the terms of the drsa in light of their signatures on the individual agreements,which stated that appellants had reviewed the drsa.we conclude that the conflicts were unconsentable.
the drsa created overriding and abiding conflicts of interest for lmb and thoroughly undermined its ability to deal fairly,honestly,and with undivided loyalty to appellants.elacqua physicians reciprocal insurers,dep t,quoting matter of cooperman.
the drsa on its face created enormous incentives on lmb part to obtain from each and every one of its clients waivers of important rights.if lmb were to cause all claimants to i waive their rights to jury trials and various kinds of monetary damages and relief,ii drop all existing legal or administrative proceedings,iii agree to submit all claims to the drp,and iv waive the right to hire new counsel during the drp,lmb would be paid million by nextel even though not a single claimant had recovered anything or even begun any of the drp steps.lmb had ten weeks to obtain these waivers.
the overriding nature of the conflict is underscored by the fact that,when fourteen of the clients failed to agree,nextel final,but,payment to lmb was reduced from million to,or per client.under the drsa,after obtaining the waivers,lmb would be paid million when half of the claimants claims were resolved through the drp,regardless of the individual outcomes.another million after amendment would be paid to lmb when the remaining claims were resolved,again without regard to individual outcomes.however,the million would be reduced on a sliding scale if less than all the claims were resolved within weeks from the effective date.to become entitled to the million,lmb would have to process over thirteen claims per week starting on the effective date,or over two claims per work day.
once all the claims were processed,lmb would formally go to work for nextel as a consultant for two years at million per year.lmb also promised in the drsa not to accept new clients with claims against nextel,not to refer any such client to another lawyer or firm,and not to accept compensation for any prior referral.
it can not be gainsaid that,viewed on its face alone,the drsa created an enormous conflict of interest between lmb and its clients.such a conflict is permissible only if waivable by a client through informed consent.see int l bus.machs,levin,cir filippi elmont union free sch.dist.bd.of,d.however,there may be circumstances in which a conflict is not consentable.see gsi commerce solutions,babycenter,cir centra,estrin,cir cohen strouch,civ,wl,at.for two reasons,this is such a case.
