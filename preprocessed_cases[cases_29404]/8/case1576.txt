this case calls upon us to determine whether an antitrust complaint alleging a conspiracy by major record labels to fix the prices and terms under which their music would be sold over the internet states a claim for violation of section of the sherman act under bell atlantic twombly.we hold that second consolidated amended complaint scac contains enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an agreement was made,id.at,and therefore states a claim.we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the scac contains the following factual allegations,which we must accept as true 
defendants produce,license and distribute music sold as digital files digital music online via the internet internet music and on compact discs cds.together,defendants emi,sony bmg music entertainment sony bmg,universal music group recordings,umg,and warner music group wmg,control over of digital music sold to end purchasers in the united states.
initially,defendants bertelsmann,bertelsmann,wmg,and emi agreed to launch a service called musicnet.defendants umg and sony corporation sony agreed to launch a service called duet,later renamed pressplay.all defendants signed distribution agreements with musicnet or pressplay and sold music directly to consumers over the internet through these ventures the joint ventures.both the joint ventures and the recording industry association of america riaa provided a forum and means through which defendants could communicate about pricing,terms,and use restrictions.
to obtain internet music from all major record labels,a consumer initially would have had to subscribe to both musicnet and pressplay,at a cost of approximately per year.both services required consumers to agree to unpopular digital rights management terms drms.for example,pressplay prohibited consumers from copying more than two songs from any particular artist onto a cd each month.music purchased from musicnet and pressplay would often expire unless repurchased a musicnet consumer would need to repurchase music each year and a pressplay consumer who unsubscribed would immediately lose access to all of the music he or she had purchased.musicnet and pressplay also did not allow consumers to transfer songs from their computers to portable digital music players like the ipod.one industry commentator observed that musicnet and pressplay did not offer reasonable prices,and one prominent computer industry magazine concluded that nobody in their right mind will want to use these services.scac.
moreover,the pricing of cds accounted for costs such as copying the compact discs producing the cd case,labels and packaging shipping,both to the distributor and then to record stores labor,such as shelving cds and staffing cash registers and damaged and unsold inventory.all of these costs were eliminated with internet music.scac.however,these dramatic cost reductions were not accompanied by dramatic price reductions for internet music,as would be expected in a competitive market.
eventually,defendants and the joint ventures began to sell internet music to consumers through entities they did not own or control.however,the entities could only sell defendants music if they contracted with musicnet to provide internet music for the same prices and with the same restrictions as musicnet itself or other musicnet licensees.if the licensee attempted to license music from another company,defendants forced them to pay penalties or terminated their licenses.in addition,each defendant was paid shares of the total revenue generated by a joint venture licensee,rather than on a per song basis,linking each defendant financial interest in the joint venture to the total sales of all labels rather than to its own market share.
defendants also used most favored nation clauses mfns in their licenses that had the effect of guaranteeing that the licensor who signed the clause received terms no less favorable than the terms offered to other licensors.defendants attempted to hide the mfns because they knew they would attract antitrust scrutiny.for example,emi and musicnet had a side letter agreement which assured that emi core terms would be no less favorable than bertelsmann and wmg.emi ceo rob glaser decided to put the mfn in a secret side letter because there are reasons why it would be bad idea to have mfn clauses in any,or certainly all,of these agreements.scac.umg also used mfn clauses in its license agreements.a january,article in the wall street journal confirmed that defendants used mfns,and,according to jonathan potter,the executive director of the digital music association,mfns are inherently and anticompetitive.scac.
edgar bronfman,the current ceo of wmg,explained pressplay pricing scheme as follows 
pressplay has what we call an affiliate model where we determine the price,and we offer a percentage of that price to the retailing partner the reason we chosen that,frankly,is because we are concerned that the continuing devaluation of music will proceed unabated unless we do something about it.
after services other than defendants joint ventures began to distribute defendants internet music,defendants agreed to a wholesale price floor of about cents per song,which they enforced in part through mfn agreements.the mfn agreements,signed by internet music retailers and defendants,specified that the retailers had to pay each defendant the same amount per song.whereas emusic,the most popular online music service selling internet music owned by independent labels,currently charges per song and places no restrictions on how purchasers can upload their music to digital music players like the ipod or burn to cds,defendants wholesale price is more than double,about per song.moreover,all defendants refuse to do business with emusic,the internet music retailer behind only the itunes store.
finally,the scac alleges that defendants price fixing is currently the subject of a pending investigation by the office of the new york state attorney general regarding wholesale prices charged for internet music a department of justice doj investigation into collusion and price fixing begun in march and a doj investigation into whether defendants misled doj about the formation and operation of musicnet and pressplay.
based on all of these factual allegations,plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a continuing conspiracy to restrain the availability and distribution of internet music,fix and maintain at artificially high and levels the prices at which they sold internet music and impose unreasonably restrictive terms in the purchase and use of internet music.scac.they also allege that they were injured by paying more for internet music and cds than they would have in the absence of an illegal agreement.
from december,through july,plaintiffs filed actions in various state and federal courts,alleging defendants had agreed to fix the price of digital music.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred and centralized actions to the southern district of new york,before judge loretta preska.in april,plaintiffs filed a first consolidated amended complaint.pursuant to the district court orders,defendants then provided plaintiffs with a letter summarizing the grounds on which they intended to move to dismiss the first consolidated amended complaint.plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint scac in june.the scac brought claims under section of the sherman act and state antitrust and unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes.it also brought state common law claims for unjust enrichment.on july,defendants moved to dismiss the scac,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
at oral argument,plaintiffs requested leave to amend paragraph of the scac to allege a parallel price increase.the proposed amendment alleged that 
by early,defendants sony bmg,music,umg and wmg direct costs had gone substantially down because each of these defendants digitization costs of the initial cataloging had been completed,technological improvements including increased computer processing power and speed had reduced the remaining costs of digitizing new releases,the return and store credit and other costs alleged in remained at zero or virtually zero despite substantially higher sales volumes,and the fixed costs of each of these defendants digital business per unit of sales volume had declined by approximately.nonetheless,these defendants then engaged in or about may in the parallel,highly unusual behavior of each raising prices from the cents per song level to at or about cents per song 
these parallel,highly unusual increases in prices when direct costs had substantially decreased,enforced by mfns,were similar to defendants causing,as alleged in,the joint ventures,via mfns and other means,to increase the prices of internet music during to to unreasonably high levels despite substantial reductions in the direct costs of internet music relative to cds.
third consolidated amendment complaint.
by memorandum and order dated october,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,holding that the complaint did not state a claim under bell atlantic twombly.the district court first found that plaintiffs did not challenge the existence or creation of the joint ventures,and the operation of the joint ventures therefore did not yield an inference of illegal agreement.at the same time,the district court held that plaintiffs bald allegation that the joint ventures were shams is conclusory and implausible.in re digital music antitrust,d.according to the district court,plaintiffs did not challenge the joint ventures explicit agreement,and any inference of subsequent agreement based on prior,unchallenged explicit agreement is unreasonable.id.at.the district court went on to hold that other circumstances alleged by plaintiffs were equivocal and did not justify the inference of agreement,and the imposition of the unpopular drms and pricing structure was not against defendants individual economic when viewed against the backdrop of widespread music piracy.id.at.finally,the district court denied plaintiffs motion to amend paragraph of the scac as futile.id.at.this appeal followed.

generally,w hile a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle ment to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.twombly,at internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original citations omitted.instead,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.id.citations omitted.what is required are enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.in the words of the supreme court most recent iteration of this standard,a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal.w here the facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,however,dismissal is appropriate.id.at.
under section of the sherman act,e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is illegal.the crucial question in a section case is therefore whether the challenged conduct stem s from independent decision or from an agreement,tacit or express.theatre,paramount film distrib.although parallel business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact finder may infer agreement,it does not itself constitute a violation of the sherman act,because it is consistent with conspiracy,but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.twombly,internal quotation marks omitted.
while for purposes of a summary judgment motion,a section plaintiff must offer evidence that tend s to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently,id.at citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,a plaintiff need only allege enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an agreement was made.id.at see also in re elevator antitrust,cir per curiam quoting twombly for the same proposition.
as the supreme court clarified in twombly 
asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.and,of course,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.
id.at footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,an allegation of parallel conduct coupled with only a bare assertion of conspiracy is not sufficient to state a section claim.id.instead,allegations of parallel conduct must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement,not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.id.at.examples of a parallel conduct allegation that would suffice under this standard include parallel behavior that would probably not result from chance,coincidence,independent responses to common stimuli,or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in twombly,plaintiffs brought a section claim centered around the market for local telephone service.in,a system of seven regional monopolies,called baby bells,was created,along with a separate,competitive market for telephone service from which the regional baby bells were excluded.id.at.in,congress withdrew approval for the regional baby bell monopolies in enacting the telecommunications act of,which required the baby bells to share their local networks with competitors called clecs,in exchange for authority to enter the service market.id.not surprisingly,the baby bells vigorously litigated their sharing obligations under the act.id.not satisfied with the baby bells efforts at sharing,the plaintiffs in twombly sued,alleging that the baby bells engaged in parallel conduct in their respective regions,including making unfair agreements with the clecs for access to baby bell networks,providing clecs inferior connections to those networks,and overcharging the clecs,all in order to inhibit the growth of clecs and prevent them from competing effectively with the baby bells.id.at.the complaint also alleged that the baby bells failure to compete with one another,coupled with a statement from one baby bell ceo that competing in the territory of another baby bell might be a good way to turn a quick dollar but that does make it right,supported the allegation that the baby bells entered into a conspiracy to prevent entry into their local markets and agreed to refrain from competing with one another.id.at.
the supreme court held that the ultimate conspiracy allegation was merely a legal conclusion resting on the prior allegations,id.at,and the actual factual allegations in the complaint were insufficient because they did not invest either the action or inaction alleged with a plausible suggestion of conspiracy.id.at.it was natural for each baby bell to resist the competition from the clecs that the act mandated,and nothing in the complaint intimates that the resistance to the clecs was anything more than the natural,unilateral reaction of each baby bell intent on keeping its regional dominance.id.at.as to the baby bells failure to encroach on each others territory,given that prior to the telecommunications act of monopoly was the norm,rather than the exception,a natural explanation for the noncompetition alleged is that the former monopolists were sitting tight,expecting their neighbors to do the same t he complaint itself gave reasons to believe that the baby bells would see their best interests in keeping to their old turf.id.at.
applying the language and reasoning of twombly to the facts of this case leads us to conclude respectfully that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a section claim.the present complaint succeeds where twombly failed because the complaint alleges specific facts sufficient to plausibly suggest that the parallel conduct alleged was the result of an agreement among the defendants.as discussed above,the complaint contains the following factual allegations of parallel conduct.first,defendants agreed to launch musicnet and pressplay,both of which charged unreasonably high prices and contained similar drms.second,none of the defendants dramatically reduced their prices for internet music as compared to cds,despite the fact that all defendants experienced dramatic cost reductions in producing internet music.third,when defendants began to sell internet music through entities they did not own or control,they maintained the same unreasonably high prices and drms as musicnet itself.fourth,defendants used mfns in their licenses that had the effect of guaranteeing that the licensor who signed the mfn received terms no less favorable than terms offered to other licensors.for example,both emi and umg used mfn clauses in their licensing agreements with musicnet.fifth,defendants used the mfns to enforce a wholesale price floor of about cents per song.sixth,all defendants refuse to do business with emusic,the internet music retailer.seventh,in or about may,all defendants raised wholesale prices from about per song to per song.this price increase was enforced by mfns 
more importantly,the following allegations,taken together,place the parallel conduct in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement,not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.twombly,at.first,defendants control over of digital music sold to end purchasers in the united states.see phillip areeda and herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law hereinafter areeda hovenkamp ed.e mpirical studies considering many industries have suggested that noncompetitive pricing that may be the result of price coordination is likely to appear when the four leading firms account for some to percent of the market.second,one industry commentator noted that nobody in their right mind would want to use musicnet or pressplay,suggesting that some form of agreement among defendants would have been needed to render the enterprises profitable.see id.some acts,or failures to act,can not be profitably continued unless rivals behave in parallel.in re flat glass antitrust,cir evidence that the defendant acted contrary to its interests means evidence of conduct that would be irrational assuming that the defendant operated in a competitive market.in a competitive industry,for example,a firm would cut its price with the hope of increasing its market share if its competitors were setting prices above marginal costs.third,the quote from edgar bronfman,the current ceo of wmg,suggests that pressplay was formed expressly as an effort to stop the continuing devaluation of music.
fourth,defendants attempted to hide their mfns because they knew they would attract antitrust scrutiny.for example,emi and musicnet mfn,which assured that emi core terms would be no less favorable than bertelsmann or wmg,was contained in a secret side letter.emi ceo rob glaser decided to put the mfn in a secret side letter because there are reasons why it would be bad idea to have mfn clauses in any,or certainly all,of these agreements.scac.according to the executive director of the digital music association,mfns are inherently and anticompetitive.scac.
fifth,whereas emusic charges per song,defendants wholesale price is about per song.see areeda hovenkamp o ne can not profitably increase its price above that charged by rivals unless they follow the lead.sixth,defendants is the subject of a pending investigation by the new york state attorney general and two separate investigations by the department of justice.finally,defendants raised wholesale prices from about per song to per song in or about may,even though earlier that year defendants costs of providing internet music had decreased substantially due to completion of the initial digital cataloging of all internet music and technological improvements that reduced the costs of digitizing new releases.see richard posner,antitrust law ed.simultaneous price increases unexplained by any increases in cost may therefore be good evidence of the initiation of a scheme.
this complaint does not resemble those our sister circuits have held fail to state a claim under twombly.see,equilon,llc,cir dismissing section price fixing complaint under twombly where complaint alleged only that defendant conspired with numerous banks to fix the price of credit and debit card processing fees and received kickbacks from numerous banks as consideration for its unlawful agreement kendall visa,cir where plaintiffs alleged no facts to support their theory that defendant banks conspired or agreed with each other,dismissing section claim because plaintiffs pleaded only legal conclusions,and failed to plead the necessary evidentiary facts to support those conclusions.
defendants arguments that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim are without merit.defendants first argue that a plaintiff seeking damages under section of the sherman act must allege facts that tend to exclude independent conduct as an explanation for defendants parallel behavior.appellee br.this is incorrect.although the twombly court acknowledged that for purposes of summary judgment a plaintiff must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action,at,and that the district court below had held that plaintiffs must allege additional facts that tended to exclude independent conduct,id.at,it specifically held that,to survive a motion to dismiss,plaintiffs need only enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an agreement was made,id.at see also areeda hovenkamp ed.t he supreme court did not hold that the same standard applies to a complaint and a discovery record the plausibly suggesting threshold for a conspiracy complaint remains considerably less than the tends to rule out the possibility standard for summary judgment.
defendants next argue that twombly requires that a plaintiff identify the specific time,place,or person related to each conspiracy allegation.this is also incorrect.the twombly court noted,in dicta,that had the claim of agreement in that case not rested on the parallel conduct described in the complaint,we doubt that the references to an agreement among the baby bells would have given the notice required by rule because the pleadings mentioned no specific time,place,or person involved in the alleged conspiracies.at.in this case,as in twombly,the claim of agreement rests on the parallel conduct described in the complaint.therefore,plaintiffs were not required to mention a specific time,place or person involved in each conspiracy allegation.
defendants then argue that inferring a conspiracy from the facts alleged is unreasonable because plaintiffs allegations are the very same claims that were thoroughly investigated and rejected by the antitrust division of the department of justice,appellee br,which closed its inquiry in december and publicly announced that it had uncovered no evidence that the joint ventures had harmed competition or consumers of digital music.even if we could consider this evidence on a motion to dismiss,defendants cite no case to support the proposition that a civil antitrust complaint must be dismissed because a criminal investigation undertaken by the department
