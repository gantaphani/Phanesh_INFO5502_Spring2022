where a plaintiff settles with one of several joint tortfeasors,new york general obligations law a provides that its claim against the remaining tortfeasors is reduced by the greater of the amount paid for the release the amount stipulated in the release and the released tortfeasor equitable share of the plaintiff damages oblig.law a.the new york court of appeals has held that while the first two reductions are available at any point before final judgment is entered,the third is lost where a defendant fails to seek apportionment of liability until after a jury liability verdict.see whalen kawasaki motors.the question in this diversity action is whether a defendant similarly forfeits its right to a setoff in the amount of the settling defendant equitable share if it does not seek apportionment until after summary judgment is entered against it on the issue of liability.we hold that it does,and therefore vacate in part the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gold.
background 
appellants filed this action to recover damages sustained during a collision on the new jersey turnpike on december.appellants were passengers in a car owned and operated by brian ruzalski that was struck from behind by a owned by gallimore sons gallimore and driven by william mcleod.a third vehicle,a owned by byrd trucking company and operated by rudolph byrd and charles curry collectively,the byrd defendants,was directly behind the gallimore.according to a report prepared by the new jersey police,the byrd trucking vehicle collided with the gallimore,forcing it into the rear of ruzalski chevrolet tahoe.
shortly after the schipanis filed this diversity action,they settled with the byrd defendants for the schipanis then moved for summary judgment against gallimore,arguing that it was negligent as a matter of law for violating new york vehicle traffic law a,which prohibits drivers from following vehicles more closely than is reasonable and prudent.in its response,gallimore did not move to amend its answer to assert a defense and raised no defenses to its liability.gallimore sole argument was that appellants did not suffer serious injuries as required by new york law.the district court johnson,rejected that argument and granted the schipanis motion for summary judgment,holding that gallimore fail ed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case.schipani mcleod,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted quoting celotex catrett,d.judge johnson then referred the case to magistrate judge pollak for a determination of damages.id.at.in accordance with that mandate,judge pollak ordered briefs setting forth the basis and method for calculating damages,which were filed in the summer of.
in february,judge pollak recused herself,and the inquest was assigned to magistrate judge gold.at a may conference,judge gold ordered supplemental briefing on for prior settlement amounts and defendant right to apportionment of liability.in those papers,appellants argued that gallimore had an opportunity to request an apportionment of liability before judge johnson,but lost it by failing to do so before summary judgment was entered.appellants also contended that judge gold consideration of apportionment exceeded his authority to determin e damages.gallimore,on the other hand,submitted that it could still seek apportionment because rights can not be waived prior to trial.
judge gold agreed with gallimore,holding that the decision granting summary judgment was a finding of liability and not an apportionment of that liability.see schipani mcleod,wl,at.the court referenced whalen for the proposition that a defendant may amend an answer to assert a defense pursuant to section at any time,even after trial,provided there is no prejudice.id.citing whalen,at.however,the court did not distinguish between a setoff in the amount of the settling defendant equitable share of fault for causing the accident and a reduction by the amount paid or stipulated for the release.having determined that the right to apportionment was not lost,judge gold found that the byrd defendants were liable and gallimore was liable.id.at.the court awarded frank schipani and olga schipani for their past and future pain and suffering.id.at.applying,the court subtracted,the byrd defendants share of liability,leaving an award of to frank schipani and to olga schipani.id.
the schipanis appeal from that judgment,contending,among other arguments,that magistrate judge gold erred in permitting an apportionment of liability after summary judgment.we agree.
discussion 
in whalen kawasaki motors,the new york court of appeals warned that as an affirmative defense,general obligations law a must be pled by a tortfeasor seeking its protection.id.at.the plaintiff in whalen was injured in the crash of an vehicle manufactured by kawasaki and sold by robinson cycle sales robinson.id.at.following the crash,whalen sued kawasaki and robinson under theories of negligence,strict products liability and breach of warranty.id.during jury selection,whalen settled with kawasaki for million,proceeding to trial only against robinson and only under the negligence theory.id.at.robinson declined to seek an apportionment of liability,and the question before the court of appeals was whether robinson could,after the verdict,move to amend its answer to assert a as an affirmative defense.id.the court held that a defendant that waits until after the liability verdict to raise a is not entitled to the statute full protection 
by failing to seek apportionment against kawasaki,robinson foreclosed any possibility of the jury determining kawasaki equitable share of the fault,and in that respect foreclosed use of that prong of the statute benefits.section a,however,affords the nonsettling defendant the greatest of three modes of setoff,and the remaining amount stipulated or paid by the settling still properly available to robinson,notwithstanding its failure to put before the jury the question of kawasaki equitable share of fault.
id.at,citations omitted see also bonnot fishman,dep t defendant,of course,has waived his right to prove the hospital equitable share of the damages and to have the judgment against him reduced accordingly.thus,although robinson was barred from seeking apportionment,it was free to amend its answer to raise the remaining prongs of,provided that the late amendment does not prejudice the other party.whalen,at.
neither the new york court of appeals nor any of the departments of the appellate division has considered whether the right to an apportionment is forfeited with the entry of summary judgment on liability nonetheless,we have little difficulty holding that it is.to date,only one court has faced this exact issue squarely.in chubb son kelleher,cv,wl,judge amon,citing whalen,held that a defendant who did not assert a in any way,until after summary judgment had been granted and his liability established would not be entitled to seek a reduction in judgment based on apportionment of fault.id.at.
that holding finds support in the decisions of new york appellate courts.the court of appeals has noted that apportionment of fault is a component of the liability determination.bryant state.along the same lines,the second department has held that in bifurcated trials,liability should be apportioned during the liability phase,not the damages phase.see,abbas cole,dep t quoting perez state,dep t.we agree.for forfeiture purposes,there is no logical distinction between a jury verdict and an award of summary judgment on the issue of liability.after all,in both federal and new york state courts,summary judgment is only appropriate where there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.anderson liberty lobby,d see jones lang wootton usa leboeuf,lamb,greene macrae,dep t s ummary judgment is the procedural equivalent of a trial.what we take from these cases is that when liability and damages are determined separately,either through formal bifurcation or summary judgment,liability must be apportioned at the time it is determined.
