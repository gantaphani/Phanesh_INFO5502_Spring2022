this insurance coverage dispute raises three issues arising out of financial regulators investigations into alleged accounting misstatements by appellee and mbia,mbia and related litigation.based on these events,mbia made claims under two million director and officer d o insurance policies it had purchased from appellants and federal insurance federal and ace american insurance ace.it sought coverage for costs associated with these claims as losses under the policies.federal and ace did not believe they were liable for these claims,and,unsurprisingly,litigation ensued.resolving for summary judgment,the district court berman,granted summary judgment in favor of mbia on two of its three coverage claims but granted summary judgment in favor of federal and ace on one of mbia coverage claims.we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand a portion of the case to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of mbia.
background 
mbia is a connecticut corporation based in armonk,new york.it provides municipalities and other government entities with financial guarantee insurance for their bonds or structured finance obligations this insurance is a guarantee of payment of principal and interest due.like many corporations,mbia purchased d o insurance coverage for its directors and officers,as well as mbia itself for certain claims.mbia policies were purchased from federal and ace for the period between february,and august,including a extension.these policies covered securities claims,which include a formal or informal administrative or regulatory proceeding or inquiry commenced by the filing of a notice of charges,formal or informal investigative order or similar document.at.the policies also cover securities defense costs,which include costs incurred in defending or investigating securities claims.id.the policies also contemplate that should mbia seek to invoke coverage,mbia must give the insurers the opportunity to effectively associate in the investigation,defense and settlement of any claim against mbia and then seek the insurers consent before settling any covered claim or incurring any costs defending such a claim.id.at.both policies included million worth of coverage and covered the same claims with the same terms and conditions except as delineated in the ace policy.the coverage was only after the federal policy limit was exhausted did the ace policy provide additional coverage.because the two policies and claims are parallel in nearly all respects,we will refer to federal and ace together as the insurers throughout,analyzing the policies together except where we note that the analysis differs with respect to one of the insurers.
the purchases proved prescient.as part of a larger investigation into certain accounting practices in the insurance industry,federal and state regulators targeted mbia in november.the securities and exchange commission sec had issued a formal order of investigation on march,ordering an inquiry into certain companies compliance with the securities laws,their financial recordkeeping,their financial reporting,and related matters.specifically,the order initiated a private investigation into whether the subject companies engaged,are engaged,or are about to engage in any of the aforesaid acts,practices,or courses of business,or in any acts,practices,or courses of business of similar purport or object.at.the phrase acts,practices,or courses of business refers to the allegations of financial chicanery mentioned above.
pursuant to that investigation,the sec issued the first of several subpoenas to mbia on november.the subpoena did not identify specific transactions,but it compelled mbia to produce all documents concerning transactions involving non traditional product s.id.at.these were defined as,in relevant part,
any product or service developed,marketed,distributed,offered,sold,or authorized for sale that could be or was used to affect the timing or amount of revenue or expense recognized in any particular reporting period,including without limitation,transferring assets off of a counter party balance sheet,extinguishing liabilities,avoiding charges or credits to the counter party financial statements,or deferring the recognition of a known and quantifiable loss 
id.emphasis added.the subpoena also required production of mbia accounting treatment of payments in connection with these transactions and any developmental,training,or promotional materials for them,among other things.on november,the new york attorney general nyag followed suit and issued its first subpoena,which mirrored the sec.others from both the sec and the nyag followed through late.mbia produced documents to both regulators in tandem.
ultimately,three of mbia transactions came under regulatory scrutiny.the first transaction was mbia purchase of reinsurance on its guarantee of bonds issued by a hospital group owned by allegheny health,education and research foundation aherf.mbia insured these bonds in,and aherf declared bankruptcy in and defaulted.facing approximately million of exposure on its guarantee,mbia purchased reinsurance on the aherf transaction whereby the reinsurers retroactively agreed to assume mbia loss in exchange for a nominal premium.mbia agreed to give the reinsurers compensation in the form of future premiums from its other financial guarantee business yet continued to assume the risk of default on new loans guaranteed.the aim of this scheme was to allow mbia to avoid recognizing a large,insurance loss by disguising the loss and spreading payment for it over a longer period of time,increasing its stated earnings.the subpoenas caused mbia to produce documents concerning the aherf transaction.
later,in the summer of,at least two other transactions were subjected to regulatory scrutiny.the first involved mbia purchase of an interest in capital asset holdings gp,capital asset,a company that bought delinquent tax liens.after capital asset lender choked off funding for its operations,mbia provided more capital for the company.then mbia,through a subsidiary,guaranteed capital asset securitization of the liens it purchased,thereby transferring the risk of loss on mbia investment from mbia to the subsidiary.these machinations were designed to avoid mbia recognizing a loss on the capital asset deal immediately,instead spreading the loss out over time because of the way the guarantee was structured.
the second transaction involved mbia guarantee of securities used to purchase airplanes for airways.when airways declared bankruptcy in,rather than wait for a claim on the guarantee,mbia foreclosed on the airplanes and treated this transaction as an investment,not an insurance loss.here again,mbia took these steps to avoid recognizing a loss.
in the summer of,the sec and the nyag considered issuing additional subpoenas.however,in these instances,mbia asked the regulators whether they would accept voluntary compliance with their demands for records in lieu of subpoenas to avoid adverse publicity for mbia.the regulators agreed to those requests,and mbia complied with their demands for documents concerning the capital asset and airways transactions.
in may,mbia initiated the claims process by informing the insurers that it was the target of a regulatory investigation and by providing them with the subpoenas.mbia asked the insurers for their consent to retain counsel and to incur defense costs.the insurers did not view the subpoenas as sufficient to trigger coverage but accepted the subpoenas as notice of a potential claim under the policies.mbia proceeded to hire attorneys and defend,respond to,and discuss the regulatory inquiries.
nevertheless,in august,the regulators advised mbia that they would take action against it for securities law violations.apparently,discussions about settling the potential charges were ongoing because on september,mbia sought consent from the insurers to settle with the regulators.mbia also met with federal in person to discuss settlement.by letter dated october,federal responded to mbia and said that it understood a settlement for the aherf transaction requiring payment of approximately million in total to state and federal regulators was under consideration.federal stated that it did not believe a settlement would be covered,but it allowed mbia to proceed with settlement,saying that it would not raise the lack of its written consent to the settlements as a defense to coverage.id.at.retroactively,ace took essentially the same approach in december.
mbia signed an offer of settlement for both the state and federal claims on october,but that offer was preliminary,as the regulators had not completed their investigation into the capital asset and airways transactions at that time.to allow settlement talks to proceed despite this loose end,mbia and the regulators agreed that an independent consultant,paid by mbia,could complete a review of those transactions and report on a proposed remedy if misconduct was uncovered.mbia first informed the insurers of this development in september.meanwhile,the independent consultant had begun work.mbia offered an assurance of discontinuance to the nyag in november that would result in mbia payment of a million civil penalty and million in disgorgement upon acceptance by the new york superintendent of insurance.by december,the sec and mbia reached an agreement in principle under which mbia would pay a million civil penalty for the aherf transaction.both offers of settlement to regulators contained a provision for an independent consultant review of the two outstanding investigations.the settlements were executed and accepted by both regulators in late january.ultimately,the independent consultant exonerated mbia of any wrongdoing for the capital asset and airways transactions.the investigations were closed in.
after these investigations came to light,lawsuits against mbia alleging financial wrongdoing were filed.two actions are relevant here,one filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and one filed in the new york supreme court.on the way to filing suit,two shareholders sent separate demand letters to mbia asking the board to file suit against directors and officers for the alleged wrongdoing being investigated by regulators at the time.in due course,mbia set up a committee of independent directors the demand investigation committee or dic to investigate these demands mbia did not act on the shareholder demands,which is effectively a rejection of the demand under governing connecticut law,but the shareholders persisted and filed two derivative lawsuits.when the lawsuits were filed,mbia reconstituted the dic as the special litigation committee slc to determine whether maintaining these suits was in the best interests of mbia.the slc determined,after an investigation by outside counsel hired by the slc,that it was not and filed a motion to dismiss the complaints.the lawsuits were terminated.
following all of this turmoil,federal agreed to pay approximately million to cover losses from the sec aherf transaction investigation and related lawsuits,including for the dic investigation.but it refused to cover losses related to the capital asset and airways transactions and to the nyag aherf transaction investigation.because the federal policy limit was not breeched,ace paid nothing.mbia disagreed with the insurers interpretation of what the policies covered.it filed suit to compel the insurers to cover costs related to both regulators investigations of all three transactions,the independent consultant investigation pursuant to the settlement,and the work of the slc.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of mbia with respect to costs related to the investigation of the transactions and the costs incurred by the slc.mbia,fed.ins,civ,wl,at.it granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers,however,with respect to costs related to the independent consultant investigation.id.at.these appeals followed.

in this diversity case,the issues are governed by either new york or connecticut state law.see wilson nw.mut.ins,cir.we need not make a determination because under both states regimes,the applicable legal principles are aligned.an insurance contract is interpreted under ordinary contract principles,and we give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed in the clear language of the contract.morgan stanley,new eng.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted applying new york law accord griswold union labor life ins.we agree with the district court and the parties that the contract is unambiguous,so the plain meaning of its terms control.cont l ins.atl.cas.ins,cir.in the end,the insured bears the burden of showing that an insurance coverage covers the loss,but the insurer bears the burden of showing that an exclusion applies to exempt it from covering a claim.morgan stanley,at.doubts are resolved in favor of the insured.see id.at.
on appeal,the insurers argue that the district court erred in two ways.first,they argue that it erred because both the sec and the nyag investigations into the capital asset and airways transactions are not covered securities claim s under the policies and because the nyag investigation of the aherf transaction is likewise not covered.second,they argue that it erred because costs incurred by the slc were either not covered or subject to the policy sublimit.in its,mbia argues that the district court erred in its analysis denying it coverage for the costs of the independent auditor.we address these arguments sequentially.
investigation costs coverage 
the insurers first argument involves the scope of coverage provided in insuring clause,which states the company,the insurers shall pay on behalf of any organization,mbia and subsidiaries all securities loss for which it becomes legally obligated to pay on account of any securities claim first made against it during the policy period a securities claim is defined as,in relevant part,a formal or informal administrative or regulatory proceeding or inquiry commenced by the filing of a notice of charges,formal or informal investigative order or similar document.at.the question here is whether the expenses claimed in connection with the regulators investigations fall within this definition to answer this question,we analyze the various items mbia argues are securities claims the nyag investigation of the aherf transaction and the sec and the nyag investigation of the capital asset and airways transactions.we proceed in that order.
the nyag investigation of aherf 
we agree with the district court that the nyag subpoena on the aherf transaction was a securities claim.under new york law,the nyag may commence an investigation when,in his discretion,he believes it to be in the public interest that an investigation be made.bus.law.the form that investigation takes is the service of a subpoena,which,on its face,commands the production of documents and threatens criminal penalties for noncompliance.see,people thain,stating that the nyag may require information pursuant to the investigation and t o that end,he is empowered to subpoena witnesses and documents internal quotation marks omitted sanborn goldstein,stating that the nyag commenced an investigation pursuant to the martin act by service of a subpoena upon plaintiff see also bus.law.backed by the enforcement authority of the state,the nyag subpoena is at least a similar document to a formal or informal investigative order that commenced a regulatory proceeding,as stated in the policies.
moreover,we agree with the district court sensible intuition that a businessperson would view a subpoena as a formal or informal investigative order based on the common understanding of these words.mbia,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.in any event,the subpoena is,at absolute minimum,a similar document to those listed the definition of a securities claim because it is similar to other forms of investigative demands made by regulators.see,ace am.ins.ascend one,d,subpoenas may constitute insurance claims when issued by a governmental investigative agency.
we reject the insurers crabbed view of the nature of a subpoena as a mere discovery device that is not even similar to an investigative order.the new york case law makes it crystalline that a subpoena is the primary investigative implement in the nyag toolshed.we also reject the insurers argument that because the definition does not include a proceeding commenced by the service of a subpoena,a subpoena is not included.this reading puts form over substance the fact that the definition does not say service of a subpoena is not dispositive.
because the understanding of a securities claim includes this subpoena,securities loss arising from this investigation is covered.
capital asset and airways transactions 
we now turn to whether securities loss in connection with the capital asset and airways transactions is covered.this determination turns on two factors whether the sec investigation of these transactions was within the scope of its formal order and whether the nyag similar investigation was within the scope of its aherf investigation,which is a covered securities claim.we begin with the sec investigation.
a.the sec investigation 
the text of the sec formal order stated that the sec was empowered to investigate whether aig and other insurance companies,including mbia,engaged in securities fraud,accounting misstatements,reporting misstatements,or other acts,practices,or courses of business of similar purport or object.at.the district court held that the investigation into these two transactions was an investigation of a course of business of similar purport or object and,thus,within the scope of the formal order.we agree.
as we described,the three transactions at issue here all involved mbia attempts not to report or to delay reporting a loss.the subpoena that accompanied the formal order stated that the sec sought documents involving transactions designed to affect the timing or amount of revenue or expense recognized,including extinguishing liabilities,and deferring the recognition of a known and quantifiable loss.id.at.although the mechanics mbia employed in each of the three transactions differed somewhat as we described above,there can be no doubt that all of them involved efforts to delay,reduce,or eliminate the reporting of a loss,precisely as described in the subpoena.indeed,the aherf transaction involved an attempt not to book a loss at all,the capital asset transaction involved an attempt to spread the recognition of a loss out over time,and the airways transaction involved an effort to avoid booking a loss and,in fact,to represent that mbia was making an investment in the airplanes it repossessed.these courses of business fall within the scope of the transactions for which documents were subpoenaed by the sec as non traditional product s.this circumstance is highly probative of the scope of the investigation authorized by the sec formal order.
the formal order authorized the sec to investigate any of the broadly described acts and courses of business listed in the formal order.combined with the specific definition of the items subpoenaed by the sec,we conclude that the plain meaning of the formal order includes these transactions within its scope because they involved a course of business of similar purport or object to that described in the formal order.rnr,sec,cir concluding that a formal order predating company under investigation included the company because of similarly inclusive wording.
the insurers essay several reasons why they think the formal order does not include the capital asset and airways transactions.first,they point to the caption of the sec formal order,in re loss mitigation insurance products,to argue that this phrase delimits the scope of the sec investigation to a certain of financial transactions.this argument is unpersuasive.we do not doubt that t he purposes of such an order seem to be to define the scope of the ensuing investigation and to establish limits within which the staff may resort to compulsory process.sec jerry.but the caption alone does not serve these functions the whole order does.the only place this phrase occurs is in the caption to the formal order,and the operative language contains no limitation in scope to a certain product,nor does it appear to contemplate such a limitation.instead,it announces a broad but definite investigatory scope that includes these transactions as we described.in this way,it is quite telling that the actual subpoenas issued cover allegations involved in the capital asset and airways transactions.and sec subpoenas are enforceable only when they request reasonably relevant information in connection with the investigation.rnr,at quoting united states morton salt,see,pt,pt,reprinted in.in short,the caption to the formal order does not operate in the way advanced by the insurers here to narrow the scope of the sec investigatory authority as set out in the text of the order.rnr,at deferring to sec determination of relevance in challenge to subpoena by measuring value of information against general purposes of the agency investigation.
the insurers next argue that these investigations were conducted by way of oral request rather than subpoena or other formal process.this argument is meritless.the investigation,oral or by way of subpoena,was connected to the formal order.the sole reason the sec did not issue subpoenas is that mbia requested this procedure,and the sec believed that mbia would fully comply on a voluntary basis.the insurers can not require that as an investigation proceeds,a company must suffer extra public relations damage to avail itself of coverage a reasonable person would think was triggered by the initial investigation.
the insurers also argue that the sec began investigating these transactions because it was tipped off by a disenchanted investor in capital asset and by new york insurance regulators questioning the airways transaction.whatever the accuracy of this assertion,we fail to see how the sec investigative source is relevant to the coverage determination.
finally,the insurers argue that because the sec official who made the oral requests was not named on the formal order,the requests were not pursuant to that order.this argument,too,fails.the individuals named on the formal order are empowered to compel testimony,jerry,at,but the investigation authorized by the formal order need not be pursued only by those individuals.in addition,this policy provides coverage for informal investigative orders,and the oral inquiries fit that description 
as with the aherf transaction,the sec investigation of the capital asset and airways transactions was commenced by the sec formal order.mbia securities loss related to responding to it is therefore covered because the investigation was pursuant to a formal or informal investigative order.
b.the nyag investigation 
our analysis of mbia claim for coverage for securities loss related to the nyag investigation of the capital asset and airways transactions proceeds similarly.by the time the nyag office began looking into these transactions,its aherf investigation was already underway.the nyag subpoena contained the same definition of non traditional product s as the sec subpoena,so documents relating to these transactions were included in its scope.as with the sec investigation,mbia requested that the nyag issue no further subpoenas after the aherf subpoena,promising that mbia would comply fully with all demands.the nyag agreed,like the sec,to this procedure and continued its investigation with oral requests.therefore,for the same reasons that securities loss related to the sec investigation into the capital asset and airways transactions is covered,such loss related to the nyag investigation into these transactions also is covered.
for the reasons stated above,mbia securities loss related to the nyag investigation into the aherf transaction and both the sec and the nyag investigations into the capital asset and airways transactions is covered under the policy.each of the investigations was commenced by a formal or informal investigative order or similar document and is therefore a securities claim.
derivative litigation coverage 
turning to the insurers second contention,the costs incurred by the slc in terminating the derivative litigation were covered defense costs or securities defense costs under the policies.the policies provide coverage under insuring clauses to mbia its directors for expenses incurred in defending or investigating claims including securities claims.at.a claim includes a lawsuit.id.
the insurers argue that the costs are not covered for three main reasons.first,they say that the costs were incurred by the slc and not mbia or any individual directors and that the slc is not an insured person.second,they focus on the nature of a derivative suit to say that granting mbia coverage for the slc role would render the sublimit for demand investigation costs superfluous.see supra note.third,they rely on exclusions from the definition of loss.we conclude that the costs are covered.
we begin with the anatomy of a derivative action.connecticut law applies here because the suits alleged state claims against mbia,a connecticut corporation.halebian berv,cir may coffey.in connecticut,shareholders must perform two distinct steps to initiate a derivative suit.see stutz shepard.first,a disenchanted shareholder must make a demand on the corporation to take suitable action.ann.then,after one of three events,the shareholder may commence a derivative suit the passing of ninety days without any action by the corporation,notification that the shareholder demand is rejected,or a showing that irreparable injury would follow if the court waited for the period to expire.id.
connecticut law also provides that a corporation may form a committee of independent directors to determine whether maintaining a derivative action is in the best interests of the corporation.id,frank lovetere,d.if that committee determines in good faith,after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based,that maintaining the suit is not in the best interests of the corporation,it has the authority to move for dismissal.ann.a.on such a motion,the court shall dismiss the lawsuit.id.
here,both shareholders followed the process and made a demand before filing suit.ultimately,after the dic performed its work,mbia did not act within the period provided by connecticut law.thereafter,the shareholders took the next step and filed lawsuits.mbia formed the slc to determine mbia response to this litigation,and the slc decided to terminate the litigation.the slc entered appearances for mbia and filed motions to dismiss on its behalf in both the state and federal cases.the federal suit was voluntarily dismissed pursuant to rule of the rules of civil procedure before the court could rule on it the parties do not dispute that the state court action was also terminated,although the record does not indicate in precisely what manner.
connecticut law allows this procedure.the board may terminate derivative litigation by a majority vote of either of two of the board the independent directors if they constitute a quorum or a committee composed of at least two independent directors.id,b.a corporation,possessing an identity only in a legal sense,can act only through its agents.in re payroll express,cir.that connecticut law permits the board to terminate a derivative suit is an extension of the fundamental principle that the management and ownership of a corporation are divided,with management undertaken by the board.ann.b.in other words,corporate powers and management are exercised by agents under the authority of or under the direction of the board.id.the slc was one way mbia exercised its powers.see,id.a zapata maldonado,a n independent committee possesses the corporate power to seek the termination of a derivative suit.revised model bus.act official cmt.citing aronson lewis,overruled on other grounds by brehm eisner,del 
dismissal of the suits was mbia decision,undertaken pursuant to the powers granted to mbia under connecticut law.ann.a,and exercised by the slc as permitted under connecticut law,id.b.see also aronson,at stating that,ultimately,the board retains its managerial authority to make decisions regarding corporate litigation.we thus reject the insurers suggestion that the slc was not an insured person.
to counter this reasoning,the insurers argue that the slc was required to operate independently of mbia.they postulate that this circumstance means that the slc took on an identity and exercised powers separate and apart from those granted to mbia.this is argument by sleight of hand.connecticut law and corporation law generally requires that the decision to proceed with or terminate derivative litigation be made by independent directors to satisfy their fiduciary duties.ann.a b see,aronson,at.independent in this context means independence of judgment a lack of conflicts of interest.see.ann.frank,d at see also rmbca official cmt.stating that such directors must be disinterested and independent so as to avoid a likelihood that that director objectivity will be impaired.independence of judgment does not generate a new source of authority to terminate derivative litigation that authority is still exercised by the corporation,which can act only through its agents.aronson,at see.ann.a b frank,d at,a corporation should be free to determine in its own business judgment whether litigation is in its best interest.we do not agree with the insurers characterization of the slc independence.
the insurers second argument relies on the nature of a derivative suit.relying on the precept that an interpretation rendering a contract term superfluous is disfavor ed,int l multifoods comm l union ins,cir,the insurers say that because the slc investigates whether to maintain a derivative suit,coverage of the slc costs would eviscerate the sublimit applicable to the investigation of shareholder demands.we disagree.
the sublimit provides that the insurers maximum liability for all investigation costs covered under insuring clause on account of all shareholder derivative demands shall be.at.insuring clause states 
the insurer shall pay on behalf of mbia all investigation costs which mbia becomes legally obligated to pay on account of any shareholder derivative demand first made during the policy period for a wrongful act committed,attempted,or allegedly committed or attempted,by an insured person before or during the policy period.
in this instance,the insurers argument requires that the sublimit operate as an exclusion of coverage.they therefore bear the burden of proving that the claim falls within the scope of an exclusion.vill.of sylvan beach travelers indem,cir citing maurice goldman sons,hanover ins.to do so,the insurers must show that the policies,in clear and unmistakable language,exclude coverage.id.internal quotation marks omitted.bearing in mind that we must read a contract as a whole and construe terms in context,law debenture trust of maverick tube,cir,we conclude that the insurers do not meet this burden.
the policies structure and terms track the statutory shareholder grievance process.insuring clause,with its concomitant sublimit,by its terms applies to costs related to investigating shareholder derivative demands,which involves the first step in connecticut regime.but when a demand is rejected and the shareholders file a derivative suit in court,the application of insuring clause to further investigative costs is less obvious.at best,to cover such costs,the language on account of any shareholder derivative demand would have to be expanded to include the second stage of the connecticut process,a lawsuit.at that stage,however,insuring clause or squarely applies because both provide coverage for costs incurred in investigating claims or securities claims,respectively,each of which is defined expressly to include lawsuits.at.thus,either or both of insuring clauses certainly provide coverage at the lawsuit stage.this view of the policies makes sense because their structure and terms mirror the shareholder grievance process of the connecticut statute insuring clause specifically references a shareholder derivative demand,while insuring clauses and specifically reference lawsuits irrespective of whether the language of insuring clause bridges the gap between the demand stage and the litigation stage of a shareholder grievance a question on which we take no view we find certainty in saying only that the insurers have not met their heavy burden to show that the exclusion,as it operates here,applies.
finally,the insurers attempt to rely on the policies exclusion of any amount incurred by mbia including its board of directors or any committee of the board of directors in connection with the investigation or evaluation of any claim or potential claim by or on behalf of mbia from the definition of loss.at.here,the insurers bear the burden to establish that the exclusion is stated in clear and unmistakable language,is subject to no other reasonable interpretation,and applies in the particular case.cont l cas.rapid am.the insurers do not carry this heavy burden in this case.
to avail themselves of this exclusion,the insurers primarily rely on the procedural fact that mbia is a plaintiff in the caption of the cases because the lawsuits,which are claims,were filed on behalf of mbia.but mbia is named as a nominal defendant in the caption of these derivative actions as well.this situation is unsurprising because,in a derivative suit,the corporation is in an anomalous position of being both a defendant and a plaintiff in the same action,llc pro search.thus,the insurers reliance on the on behalf of language provides only equivocal support for their position.moreover,we think that the exclusion in the definition of loss is not clearly applicable to the costs incurred by the slc because those costs were,at least to some extent,related to litigation,not investigation.in sum,we are not persuaded that mbia has carried its burden to show that this exclusion applies.
the costs incurred by the slc are covered under the policies.
independent consultant coverage 
the final issue remaining is whether the costs of the independent consultant are covered.mbia informed the insurers in september of settlement discussions requiring payment of approximately million in disgorgement and penalties.because the regulators had not completed their investigation into the capital asset and airways transactions,in october,they asked mbia to add an independent consultant ic review of those transactions as a condition of any settlement.mbia would pay for this review,which increased the costs of the total settlement.while mbia made settlement overtures during this time,settlement itself remained tentative.
the ic began work in mid,and the insurers were first notified of the addition of the ic in september.in october,the insurers and mbia again discussed settlement proposals under consideration,including the regulators insistence on an ic review.on december,mbia sent the insurers copies of its settlement offer.any settlement was still unconsummated.
then,on december,mbia gave the regulators its final offer of settlement,which the regulators accepted in late january.the sec issued a order on january,and the nyag finalized an assurance of discontinuance with mbia on january.these events marked a final settlement,and mbia reported the investigations and settlements to the public shortly thereafter.mbia,current report form k.in july,the ic issued a report exonerating mbia from wrongdoing with respect to the capital asset and airways transactions.this event officially ended the regulators investigations.
the district court held that the addition of the ic in the course of settlement discussions breached the right to associate clause in the policies and that costs are therefore not covered.mbia,wl,at.having considered the parties nuanced and multifaceted arguments on appeal,we appreciate the difficult question the district court faced on this point.ultimately,however,we take a different view and conclude that the ic costs were covered.
we begin with the right to associate clause,which states in federal policy 
federal shall have the right and shall be given the opportunity to effectively associate with mbia in the investigation,defense and settlement,including but not limited to the negotiation of a settlement,of any claim that appears reasonably likely to be covered in whole or in part by this policy.
at.ace policy contains similar language ace shall have the right,but not the duty,and shall be given the opportunity to effectively associate with the insureds in the investigation,settlement or defense of any claim,even if federal underlying limit has not been exhausted.id.at.as the policy language indicates,these policies required mbia to give the insurers the opportunity to associate in settlement discussions.
mbia argues that it notified the insurers of a proposed settlement and invited them to associate,in compliance with both right to associate clauses,by its september,letter seeking consent to settle the regulators investigations see at.mbia also points to settlement discussions with the insurers throughout the settlement offer process as indications that it complied with the right to associate clause.the insurers counter that although mbia informed them of a proposed settlement of million,it breached the right to associate clause when it failed to inform them until september of the addition of the ic to the settlement proposals.
the purpose of the right to associate clause is to provide the insurer with an option to intervene in the defense and settlement of a claim.see mut.ins.murphy,d,see also christiania ins.of great am.ins,cir describing right to associate as opportunity outboard marine liberty mut.ins,cir describing right to associate as an option.to associate means to come together as partners or allies.webster third new international dictionary.this right thus allows the insured and the insurer to come together as partners in investigating,defending,or settling a claim.that partnership can be useful to an insured,who may lack the expertise and experience of an insurer,where,as here,the insured bears the duty to defend.see outboard marine,at.
of course,providing the insurer with sufficient notice of the claim allows it to meaningfully exercise its option.see christiania,at.however,the right to associate is useful only if the insurer can use its experience throughout the process,not just at the end stages.the policies read as such.they provide,in the present tense,for an opportunity to effectively associate with the insured in the investigation,defense and settlement of a claim.at.indeed,the federal policy underscores this point by stating explicitly that the right to associate applies to the negotiation of a settlement.id.
these principles lead us to conclude that mbia fulfilled its obligations under the policies right to associate clauses.it provided sufficient notice of the claims involved in settlement discussions early enough in the process to allow the insurers to exercise their option to associate effectively.where the insured gives the insurer an invitation to associate with adequate information about the claim under consideration for settlement,the insured has done what is required under this clause.this is not to say that the right to associate is a opportunity,but it is not the insured duty to return to the nonparticipating insurer each time negotiations about the same claim take a new twist and ask if the insurer still wants to opt out.in short,the insured can take the insurer rsvp at face value.
that is what mbia did here.it gave the insurers an opportunity to join with it in resolving the regulators investigations,but the insurers declined to participate.to give the insurers the opportunity to exercise their right effectively,as it must,mbia notified the insurers of a potential claim long before settlement was discussed.it informed the insurers of the nature of the claims and provided an estimate of the monetary amount of those claims.it also met with federal in person to discuss possible settlements.after the insurers declined to participate in settlement n
