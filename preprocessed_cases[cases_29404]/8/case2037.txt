appellants investment,jvw and virgil waggoner,two of the several original defendants below,appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york sweet,dismissing an action in the nature of interpleader brought by correspondent services corporation csc.with csc action no longer before it,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over appellants state law against appellee suisse security bank trust,ssbt,and therefore vacated an attachment of assets belonging to ssbt that had been entered in conjunction with these.although the substance of these apparently remains viable for litigation in state court,the attachment,and especially its current priority in ssbt ongoing liquidation proceedings,might not be restored if this federal action were to be dismissed.
the district court dismissed csc claims after both granting csc rule a motion for voluntary dismissal and determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over csc original complaint,without considering csc amended complaint.we vacate the dismissal and remand to the district court for the following proceedings first,to clarify whether jurisdiction existed under csc amended complaint and,if it did,whether the allegations establishing jurisdiction related back to the original complaint and second,if the allegations sufficient to establish jurisdiction relate back to the original complaint,to consider whether the prejudice to appellants flowing from the vacating of the attachment precludes dismissal of either csc action under rule a or the appellants for lack of supplemental jurisdiction.
background 
while the facts of this case illustrate one of the myriad ways in which complicated investment transactions can turn sour,the question that confronts us is much less complicated whether the district court had jurisdiction over this action,and,if so,whether it abused its discretion by allowing csc to withdraw the action or by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims amongst the interpleader and defendants.although the specifics of the investment scheme are neither uncontested nor necessary to resolve this case,in abbreviated form they serve the alternate purpose of introducing the relationships between the parties in this action.
i.the investment scheme 
in,donald kelleher,a united kingdom citizen,undertook for a commission to realize enormous financial returns by investing million belonging to virgil waggoner,a texas businessman.a joint participation agreement memorializing this investment scheme implied that the investment would achieve a profit within three to five months,and that kelleher was to receive between twenty and percent of these profits.
kelleher and waggoner established jvw,an alien corporation organized under the laws of the republic of dominica,with waggoner as the sole shareholder and kelleher as the director.through jvw,kelleher entered into an agreement with british trade commerce bank btcb,a dominica bank,to invest the million in a cd.btcb issued the cd to jvw,and the cd was transferred to first equities of florida first equity,a florida subsidiary of btcb,which in turn placed the unfunded cd into the custody of csc,a company that provided custodial services for first equity.csc is a citizen of new york and delaware.
meanwhile,kelleher,through jvw,created a bank account at ssbt,an offshore bank organized under the laws of the bahamas,and caused waggoner million to be deposited into this account.after several unsuccessful attempts to transfer this money from jvw ssbt account into btcb ssbt account and thus to fund the cd,only approximately million was transferred to equity,leaving million unaccounted for.even after the cd was funded,however,csc possessed only the physical cd document,and it never controlled any of the funds received by equity.
waggoner and kelleher then had a disagreement,and waggoner dissolved the joint participation agreement,removed kelleher as director of jvw,and appointed himself jvw sole director.waggoner received the proceeds of the million investment when the cd matured in june.kelleher,in turn,demanded from csc,btcb and first equity not merely that sum but the entire million that a fully funded million cd would have yielded upon maturity.kelleher continued to make this demand even after first equity determined that its transfer of the cd proceeds to waggoner was proper.
ii.the interpleader action 
in august,still with custody of the physical cd and facing waggoner and kelleher apparently conflicting claims to it csc commenced a statutory interpleader action under,naming waggoner,kelleher,jvw,btcb and first equity as potential claimants.csc complaint made clear that it believed the stake was the cd itself,rather than proceeds from the cd.
a flurry of followed,contesting ownership of the cd,liability and responsibility for the million loss.in one of these,waggoner and jvw brought a claim against kelleher,added ssbt as a defendant,and moved to attach approximately million of ssbt assets located in new york.based upon evidence that ssbt may have forged documents to conceal its potential wrongdoing,the district court found that waggoner and jvw were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims against ssbt,and ordered the attachment.
after some litigation and significant discovery on the merits of the various,ssbt went into bankruptcy.ssbt liquidator in the bahamas then moved to dismiss csc interpleader action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the cd upon which the action was based had no value,and to vacate the attachment of ssbt assets.dissolving the attachment,which had been granted prior to ssbt initiation of bankruptcy proceedings,would effect a subordination of jvw and waggoner claim to the million and might result in their receiving a smaller share of ssbt total assets than they would receive if the attachment remained in place.in response to ssbt motion,csc initially argued that subject matter jurisdiction was proper and filed an amended complaint reasserting jurisdiction under and also including a declaratory judgment claim,allegedly with diversity jurisdiction under.after obtaining a release of all claims from kelleher,however,csc subsequently filed a notice of voluntary dismissal with the court.
the district court dismissed the action as well as all of the.it held that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction based on the original complaint,vacated the attachment because it had no jurisdiction at the time it was granted,and held that ssbt was entitled to attorney fees incurred defending against the wrongful attachment.the district court then granted csc voluntary dismissal under.a and declined supplemental jurisdiction over defendants,without considering in either of these decisions the potential prejudice to jvw and waggoner that losing their attachment of ssbt assets would create.furthermore,to make these decisions in the first place,the district court must have implicitly determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the amended complaint at least as of the time of ssbt motions it did not,however,articulate its basis for jurisdiction under the amended complaint,or consider whether the amended complaint related back to the original filing date to cure the jurisdictional defect inherent in csc original complaint.
jvw and waggoner appealed,and ssbt,the only other party with an interest in this appeal,responded.
