this action for breach of contract and related tort claims has its origin in a february,credit and security agreement credit agreement,wherein defendant wells fargo bank,agreed inter alia to provide plaintiff interpharm,with a revolving line of credit.interpharm now appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered on may,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard holwell,judge.interpharm contends that the district court erred in relying on releases executed in favor of wells fargo,most recently in a forbearance agreement dated may,to dismiss its claims,see interpharm,wells fargo bank,civ.rjh,wl,at,because its complaint pleaded that these releases were induced by economic duress on de novo review,we reach the same conclusion as the district court interpharm failed to plead plausibly that wells fargo made a wrongful threat,an essential element of economic duress.rather,the conduct alleged to have caused duress evidences only the exercise of wells fargo legal rights under the parties original contract and subsequent agreements.to the extent that those rights included wells fargo exercise of reasonable discretion in various areas,interpharm allegations fail as a matter of law to plead actions exceeding the scope of such discretion.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
a.the commercial transaction giving rise to this lawsuit 
on this review of a judgment of dismissal,we accept as true the following facts as to the commercial transaction at issue,which are drawn from interpharm complaint as well as from the contracts referenced therein that are integral to the pleading.see hess cohen slamowitz llp,cir chambers time warner,cir.
the credit agreement 
in,interpharm,a manufacturer of generic drugs,sought credit to support the expansion of its business.in the february credit agreement that is the basis for this action,wells fargo agreed to provide interpharm with a revolving line of credit up to million through february.interpharm secured this credit line with various assets,including its accounts receivable,inventory,and equipment.
the amount available to interpharm at any particular time under the line of credit varied,depending on the values of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.specifically,the credit agreement indicated that the borrowing base would be calculated based on of interpharm eligible inventory and of its eligible accounts receivable,but the agreement also permitted wells fargo,in its reasonable discretion or commercially reasonable discretion,both to reduce those percentages and to deem particular receivables or inventory ineligible for credit calculation.credit agreement definitions of accounts advance rate borrowing base eligible accounts and eligible inventory.
the credit agreement also contained financial covenants and performance standards that interpharm was required to satisfy.in the event of any default,the agreement afforded wells fargo a range of remedies,including termination of the line of credit,acceleration of interpharm obligations to be due and payable forthwith,and liquidation of collateral.
the first default and the october forbearance agreement 
in the third calendar quarter of,a decline in interpharm revenue put it in default of the credit agreement.rather than exercise its default remedies,however,wells fargo entered into a new agreement with interpharm on october,october forbearance agreement,that partially amended the credit agreement,increasing interpharm revolving line of credit by million in exchange for additional fees and higher interest rates.as part of the october forbearance agreement,interpharm admitted that it was in default of the credit agreement and that it owed wells fargo,plus interest and costs.wells fargo agreed to forbear from invoking its default remedies provided that interpharm raised additional capital and complied with certain financial requirements,including a covenant that it have a positive net income and cash flow for both the month of november and the quarter ending december.interpharm alleges that,at the time the october forbearance agreement was negotiated,it thought these targets highly uncertain and unreasonable and communicated its concerns to wells fargo.compl.wells fargo purportedly responded by vaguely propos ing to negotiate new financial covenants for the first half of that would provide interpharm with the relief it needed to succeed.id.thinking it had little choice but to agree to wells fargo terms,interpharm signed the october forbearance agreement.id.therein,it agreed to release all claims against wells fargo arising prior thereto.the october forbearance agreement also contained a merger clause stating that t his agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties.forbearance agreement.
the second default and the february forbearance agreements 
interpharm did not meet the financial targets set forth in the october forbearance agreement and,in early january,advised wells fargo of this default.wells fargo responded on january by increasing interpharm interest obligations to the default rate and assessing other default penalties.that same month,it advised interpharm that it wanted out of the loan.compl.also in january,wells fargo decided to exclude the receivables of four of interpharm major wholesale customers from the eligible accounts used to calculate the monies available under the revolving line of credit.according to interpharm,wells fargo explained that the amount of these receivables was imprecise because three of the customers were entitled to charge back to interpharm any difference between the prices they paid for interpharm products and the prices negotiated with interpharm by downstream customers such as pharmacy chains id.interpharm alleges that such a policy was standard practice in the pharmaceutical business and that wells fargo justification was a pretext for constricting the credit available to interpharm.id.
by the end of january,interpharm financial condition had so deteriorated that it could no longer pay its suppliers or meet its payroll.interpharm advised wells fargo that,without working capital,it would have to liquidate.wells fargo would not advance further funds without a new agreement,which the parties signed on february,february interim forbearance agreement,further amending the credit agreement.therein,wells fargo agreed to forbear from exercising its default rights through february.meanwhile,interpharm acknowledged that it was in default of both the credit agreement and the october forbearance agreement released all claims to date against wells fargo agreed to amend the credit agreement definition of eligible accounts specifically to exclude receivables from any wholesalers,including the four already excluded by wells fargo in january and promised to retain a chief restructuring officer acceptable to wells fargo in its sole discretion,who would prepare and administer interpharm operating budget and oversee all credit requests and payments to wells fargo.
on february,the parties entered into a agreement february forbearance agreement further amending the credit agreement,wherein wells fargo agreed not to exercise its default rights against interpharm through june,and to continue extending credit.in return,interpharm released all claims against wells fargo arising prior to the date of the agreement and agreed to pay additional fees,to furnish more collateral,and to restructure its operations so as to pay down its obligations to wells fargo by june,through either refinancing or an asset sale.
interpharm alleges that it was a critical premise of the february forbearance agreement and the budget incorporated therein that wells fargo would continue to include of eligible inventory in the revolving credit line calculation.id.such terms were not included in the february forbearance agreement,which did,however,contain a merger clause stating that t his agreement represents the entire agreement between wells fargo and interpharm.forbearance agreement.
the march forbearance agreement 
on march,wells fargo lowered the multiplier on interpharm eligible inventory from to,ostensibly based upon the work of a third party vendor sent in by wells fargo to evaluate the liquidation value of the inventory.compl.interpharm alleges that wells fargo action was a material breach of the february forbearance agreement,and had the practical effect of reducing available credit below the amount interpharm required to meet its obligations.
in response to interpharm protests that it needed still more credit to operate,wells fargo proposed,and on march,the parties signed,yet another agreement march forbearance agreement.therein,wells fargo reiterated its promise to forbear pursuit of its existing default remedies through june,and temporarily raised the multiplier for credit calculation to of inventory,though reserving the right to impose such lesser rate as wells fargo,in its sole discretion,deemed appropriate.forbearance agreement.in return,interpharm reiterated its default status,agreed to higher fees,and released all claims against wells fargo arising prior to the date of the agreement.
the may forbearance agreement 
interpharm asserts that but for wells fargo actions,it would likely have been able to secure refinancing to repay its obligations under the credit agreement.instead,it was obliged to sell its assets,entering into purchase agreements in april,scheduled to close in late june of that year.in early may,interpharm advised wells fargo that it could not survive through closing unless wells fargo agreed to abide by certain unspecified aspects of the credit agreement in calculating interpharm available credit.compl.wells fargo conditioned its agreement on a new forbearance agreement signed may,may forbearance agreement,wherein interpharm,for the fifth time,released its claims against wells fargo.that is the release relied on by the district court to grant the challenged dismissal 
by executing this agreement,the borrower,interpharm and guarantor,an interpharm entity called interpharm holdings,hereby waive,release and discharge any and all claims or causes of action,if any,of every kind and nature whatsoever,whether at law or in equity,arising at or prior to the date hereof,which it or they may have against wells fargo its officers and employees in connection with the credit agreement,this agreement and all documents executed in connection therewith.borrower also agrees that all waivers,releases and agreements made herein are made in consideration of,and in order to induce wells fargo to temporarily forbear the exercise or further exercise of its rights and remedies against the borrower under the credit agreement and to induce wells fargo to enter into this agreement.
may forbearance agreement.
after completing the sale of substantially all its assets on june,interpharm paid its obligations to wells fargo.sometime thereafter,interpharm advised wells fargo in writing that it was repudiating all of the forbearance agreements,which necessarily included their release provisions.
district court proceedings 
on december,interpharm filed this action against wells fargo,alleging breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,tortious interference with business expectations,unjust enrichment,and breach of fiduciary duty.wells fargo moved for dismissal citing the release provision in the may forbearance agreement.interpharm opposed the motion on the basis that the releases it executed in favor of wells fargo were the product of economic duress.in its complaint,interpharm specifically alleged that it had entered into the forbearance agreements releasing all prior claims against wells fargo only because wells fargo threatened to continue to wrongfully restrict credit that would have been available to interpharm had wells fargo complied in good faith with its contractual obligations.compl.this allegedly left interpharm with no choice but to agree to the terms of the forbearance agreements or file for bankruptcy,which would have made it impossible to continue in business.id.
noting that interpharm did not dispute that the release provision of the may forbearance agreement would bar its claims absent duress,the district court determined that interpharm allegations were insufficient as a matter of law to plead two required elements of economic duress a wrongful threat by wells fargo and the overbearing of interpharm free will.see interpharm,wells fargo bank,wl,at.as to the first element,the district court reviewed interpharm allegations and concluded that,a t best,interpharm claim of wrongful conduct is that wells fargo exercised its discretion unreasonably in restricting the monies available to interpharm through the revolving line of credit.id.at.this was insufficient to support a claim of duress because when a lender is faced with a borrower in continued default of its financial covenants,there appears to be nothing wrongful in a lender exercising its right to increase its level of security as its borrower becomes less creditworthy.id.in short,interpharm allegations might demonstrate that the bank drove a hard bargain in conditioning further credit on the higher demands of successive forbearance agreements but not that it did anything unlawful to convince interpharm to enter into these agreements.id 
accordingly,the district court dismissed interpharm claims arising prior to the date of the may,release.insofar as the district court allowed interpharm to pursue two claims arising out of,events,the parties stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of those claims in order to allow a final judgment to be entered and this appeal to be filed.

interpharm duress challenge to its release of claims against wells fargo 
wells fargo relies on the release provision of the may forbearance agreement to support its motion for dismissal interpharm defends that motion on the ground that the agreement was procured by economic duress.under new york law,which both parties agree controls,a valid release constitutes a complete bar to an action on a claim which is the subject of the release.centro empresarial cempresa am.movil,de,slip op.at internal quotation marks omitted.an otherwise valid release may,however,be void on several grounds,one of which is its procurement by economic duress.see id.stating that signed release shifts the burden of going forward to the plaintiff to show that there has been fraud,duress or some other fact which will be sufficient to void the release brackets,ellipsis,and internal quotation marks omitted.
the standard for establishing economic duress 
the doctrine of economic duress is grounded in the principle that courts will not enforce an agreement in which one party has unjustly taken advantage of the economic necessities of another and thereby threatened to do an unlawful injury.vkk nfl,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to void a contract on the ground of economic duress,the complaining party must show that its agreement was procured by means of a wrongful threat that precluded the exercise of its free will.see stewart muller constr,accord sitar sitar,dep t see also kamerman steinberg,cir new york law establishes the following elements of economic duress a threat,which was unlawfully made,and caused involuntary acceptance of contract terms,because the circumstances permitted no other alternative.internal quotation marks omitted.
the principle,however,extends no further than equity demands.thus,a mere demonstration of financial pressure or unequal bargaining power will not,by itself,establish economic duress.see boshes williamson,picket,gross,dep t edison stone.dev,dep t see also vkk nfl,at recognizing frequency with which one commercial party to agreement will have decided economic advantage over other,and emphasizing that ability of party to disown contract obligations or release on that basis is reserved for extreme and extraordinary cases.the law demands threatening conduct that is wrongful,outside a party legal rights.third realty.thus,a threat to withhold performance that one is contractually obligated to provide in order to compel the other party to submit to new demands can constitute a wrongful threat.see accord bechard monty bay recreation,dep t.but a threat to exercise a legal right in pursuit of those same demands can not.see third realty,at,at accord madey carman,dep t faillace port auth.of,dep t.in this respect,it is axiomatic that a party can not be guilty of economic duress for failing to grant further forbearance when it ha s no legal duty to do so.mli indus.urban dev,dep t accord davis,health mgmt,d.
plaintiff failure to allege a wrongful threat 
interpharm defaults preclude it from accusing wells fargo of wrongful threats in conditioning forbearance agreements on new demands 
these principles readily reveal a critical flaw in interpharm pleading of economic duress.specifically,once interpharm defaulted on its obligations under the credit agreement,as it did in the third quarter of and again in early,wells fargo was no longer obliged to continue providing interpharm with any credit pursuant to that contract.rather,wells fargo had the legal right at both junctures to terminate the line of credit and to demand immediate repayment of interpharm legal obligations,which then totaled more than million.further,because wells fargo was not obliged to forbear the exercise of these legal rights,see mli indus.urban dev,at.at,its threat not to forebear exercise of those rights was not wrongful.interpharm has pleaded no facts supporting a different conclusion.
interpharm allegations of economic duress 
conclusory allegations 
in the complaint section charging wells fargo with economic duress,interpharm asserts that it agreed to the three forbearance agreements with wells fargo in only because wells fargo threatened to take actions that it was not entitled to take under its contract with interpharm.compl.emphasis added.specifically,interpharm asserts that it agreed to the forbearance agreements only because wells fargo threatened to continue to wrongfully restrict credit that would have been available to interpharm had wells fargo complied in good faith with its contractual obligations.id.earlier in the complaint,interpharm had similarly charged wells fargo with squeezing credit availability in the fall of in ways it was not entitled to under the credit agreement.id.see id.describing such conduct as new pattern whereby wells fargo would restrict credit in anticipation of or during negotiations with interpharm in order to increase the financial pressure on interpharm to agree to wells fargo new terms.thereafter,wells fargo is alleged to have refused to abide by its contractual obligations,id,wrongfull ly restrict ed funds to interpharm,id,and failed to abide by certain unspecified aspects of the credit agreement in calculating the borrowing base,id.
such bald allegations that wells fargo acted wrongfully or contrary to its contract obligations constitute,at best,a threadbare and conclusory recital of the wrongful threat element of economic duress.mortimer off shore servs,fed.republic of germany,at.these allegations alone are not sufficient to plead plausibly a wrongful threat,particularly where it is undisputed that interpharm was in default of both the credit agreement and the october forbearance agreement as of january,and where the credit agreement,by its terms,allowed wells fargo to terminate interpharm line of credit upon default.in these circumstances,to plead a plausible claim of wrongful threat,interpharm was obliged to allege facts allowing a court to draw the reasonable inference that,even after interpharm defaults,wells fargo remained bound to perform its obligations under the parties credit agreement and that wells fargo was wrongfully threatening not to perform its obligations in order to compel interpharm agreement to the greater demands of the forbearance agreements.see ashcroft iqbal.at bechard monty bay recreation,at,at.
particular allegations 
in its complaint,interpharm charges wells fargo with three violations of its obligations in the january,decision to assess charges and increase interest rates in response to interpharm default under the october forbearance agreement the late january decision to exclude the receivables of four wholesale customers from the calculation of funds available under the revolving line of credit and the march,decision to reduce the multiplier applicable to interpharm eligible inventory from to.like the district court,we conclude that these allegations can not,as a matter of law,plausibly support a wrongful threat.the claims effectively reduce to an argument that,even after interpharm defaulted under the credit agreement and the october forbearance agreement,wells fargo was obliged to continue extending credit without availing itself of any of the enhanced protections provided in the parties agreements.we hereby conclude that invocation of these legal rights can not demonstrate a wrongful threat for purposes of claiming economic duress.
a the january,decision with respect to interest rates and costs 
interpharm alleges that,after its default under the october forbearance agreement,wells fargo january,demand for higher interest rates and charges was unreasonable and inconsistent with the intentions of the parties when entering into the october agreement.compl.in support,interpharm asserts that,when the october agreement was signed,it had told wells fargo that the agreement financial targets were unrealistic.id.in response,wells fargo had vaguely proposed to negotiate new financial covenants for the first half of that would provide interpharm with the relief it needed to succeed.id.see id.
accepting these allegations as true,interpharm nevertheless fails to plead plausibly that wells fargo acted wrongfully.after interpharm default under the credit agreement,wells fargo was under no legal obligation to extend further credit.rather,the credit agreement gave wells fargo the legal right to terminate the revolving line of credit and to demand forthwith repayment of all monies loaned.it is in this context that a court must consider interpharm pleading that,notwithstanding its view,communicated to wells fargo,that the financial covenants in the october forbearance agreement were highly uncertain and unreasonable,id,it had little choice but to sign the agreement in order to secure further financing,id.if interpharm had little choice but to agree to the covenants of the october forbearance agreement,it was not because wells fargo was threatening to withhold performance under its contract with interpharm,but because wells fargo was otherwise unwilling to forbear from its contract right to terminate the line of credit.the former circumstance might evidence a wrongful threat,see third realty,at,d at the latter illustrates only permissible hard bargaining,see boshes williamson,picket,gross,at,at edison stone dev.corp,at,at.moreover,the same conclusion obtains with respect to wells fargo application of contractually authorized higher interest rates and charges after interpharm default on the october forbearance agreement.whatever expectations interpharm may have had from its conversations with wells fargo,the october forbearance agreement contained a merger clause that precludes interpharm from maintaining that wells fargo had any legal obligation to extend it further credit after default.see jarecki shung moo louie,the purpose of a m
