plaintiff gary walton challenges various rulings which led the district court to dismiss his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against his former employer,nalco chemical company nalco,and to disallow his motion to amend the complaint to include a defamation claim under maine law.
in its,nalco challenges various evidentiary rulings,as well as the denial of its motion to dismiss walton pendant claim under the maine human rights act mhra.we affirm the district court judgment.
in,walton joined the staff at nutmeg technologies,nutmeg,selling water treatment chemicals and supplies to industrial and institutional customers in maine.between and,his annual sales increased from to more than.by the time diversey water technologies,a nalco subsidiary,announced its intention to acquire nutmeg in october,walton then sixty years of age,was earning a year as nutmeg highest paid maine salesman 
prior to the time nutmeg was actually acquired by nalco,walton had explained to nalco peter hallson and kenneth yankowski that he wanted to retain his sales accounts and intended to continue working until at least age.after hallson and yankowski acceded to his demands,walton entered into an agreement not to compete with nalco within his current sales territory for a period of eighteen months following any termination of his employment with nalco.whereupon nalco agreed to disburse to walton as a retention bonus,provided that walton remained employed by nalco as of september.
in june,however,walton learned that nalco had reassigned some of his sales accounts,including the third largest,to troy malbon,a salesman previously supervised by walton.on august,walton met with yankowski and joseph carney,walton direct supervisor,at their request.yankowski inquired into walton financial condition,including the value of his residence and personal property,then announced that all of walton remaining sales accounts would be transferred to malbon,effective january.finally,yankowski related two anecdotes about former nalco employees who had been demoted or discharged at age,explaining that nalco had forced one of them to accept early retirement.
at the same time,yankowski advised walton that nalco was not prepared to offer him any incentive,suggesting instead that walton accept employment at per than his salary at the time.walton regarded yankowski remarks as warnings designed to compel him to accept early retirement.in due course,walton retained counsel,who informed nalco on october,that it had engaged in age discrimination.on october,yankowski and carney instructed walton to bring additional information regarding his financial condition,so that his minimum financial needs could be calculated by nalco with a possible view to tendering him a offer 
at yankowski direction,during another meeting in november,walton was required to submit to an employee evaluation pursuant to a personnel regeneration form walton tested deficient in thirteen of its fifteen categories.walton declined to sign the written evaluation and rejected the proffered employment contract after informing nalco richard murphy,in writing,that he would not sign the new contract unless nalco first met with his attorney to discuss the claims.during this period,walton experienced emotional distress and even fantasized about suicide.in february,walton was discharged for refusing to sign the new employment contract tendered by nalco.
the day after walton discharge,a nalco employee came to the walton home to reclaim a piece of testing equipment and the company car.after rebuffing walton request that he be allowed to retain the testing equipment for its sentimental value,the nalco employee repossessed both the testing equipment and the company car in the presence of walton family and neighbors.less than sixty days passed before walton was hired by a nalco competitor and assigned to one of his former maine sales districts.
walton instituted suit in the united states district court for the district of maine,claiming violations of the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,and the fair employment provisions of the mhra.ann.tit,et,as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress.nalco counterclaimed that walton had breached the noncompetition agreement by accepting employment with a nalco competitor.in due course,the district court denied walton motion to amend the complaint to include a defamation claim,granted partial summary judgment to nalco on the issue of walton liability under the counterclaim,and reserved for trial the issue of damages under the counterclaim.
at trial,nalco counterclaim was dismissed after all its evidence on damages had been excluded.the district court entered judgment as a matter of law for nalco on the walton claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned verdicts on the adea and mhra claims,awarding walton in back pay,for pain and suffering,and in punitive damages.the district court reduced the total jury award to,consistent with the limitations prescribed in the adea and the mhra.
discussiona.the walton.the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim 
walton first contends that there was enough evidence to establish that nalco intended to inflict emotional distress by discharging him.judgments entered as a matter of law are reviewed de novo,and will be affirmed only if,after scrutinizing the proof and inferences derivable therefrom in the light most hospitable to walton,we determine that a reasonable factfinder could have reached but one conclusion that nalco w as entitled to judgment.fleet bank anchor media television,cir 
walton had the burden to prove that 
nalco intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain that such distress would result from its conduct the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community nalco actions caused his emotional distress and the emotional distress was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.
vogt churchill,me internal citations and quotation marks omitted.moreover,it was necessary for the district court,in its gatekeeper role,to determine,in the first instance,whether nalco conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery.champagne med,me citation omitted.
walton insists that the evidence demonstrated the requisite extreme and outrageous conduct,in that nalco i abused its position of authority,qua employer ii threatened his livelihood and professional reputation by attempting to pressure him to accept a package and iii subjected him to undue humiliation by,inter alia,transferring his sales accounts to a less experienced employee,promulgating a false and demeaning review,and repossessing company property from him in the presence of his family and neighbors.
the district court correctly ruled that walton claim should be dismissed because the evidence failed,as a matter of maine law to demonstrate an intentional infliction of emotional distress.
the motion to amend 
walton next contends that the district court erred in denying,as untimely,his motions to amend his immediately before and after include a defamation claim under maine law.see.a,b.we review only for abuse of discretion.see kemper ins.fed.express,cir quaker state oil ref.garrity oil,cir trial court considering proposed amendment must examine the totality of the circumstances and exercise sound discretion in light of the pertinent balance of equitable considerations.although leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a,parties seeking the benefit of rule a liberality must exercise due diligence unseemly delay,in combination with other factors,may warrant denial of a suggested amendment.quaker state,at amendments may be foreclosed where movant delay is extreme or unexplained.
the first motion to amend the walton complaint was submitted eight months after the due date prescribed in the scheduling order,six months after discovery closed,and one week prior to the trial date initially established by the district court yet walton offered neither an explanation nor a justification for the inordinate delays,relying instead on the naked assertion that nalco could not have been prejudiced.
walton nonetheless insists that his motion to conform the complaint to the evidence is distinguishable,in that nalco implicitly consented to the trial of his defamation claim.by way of example,walton points to evidence that nalco personnel falsely represented that he was incompetent,and contends that falsity is an element of his defamation claim.his characterization misses the mark.
consent to the trial of an issue may be implied if,during the trial,a party acquiesces in the introduction of evidence which is relevant only to that issue.united states davis,cir emphasis in original citation omitted.in the present case,however,where evidence of the alleged falsifications by nalco representatives was independently material to establish pretext on the walton claims under the adea and mhra,the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying walton amendatory motions.
b.the nalco 
proof of the maine human rights commission charge 
the is predicated on the contention that nalco was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,on the mhra claim brought by walton,because maine law allows neither damages nor attorney fees unless the plaintiff alleges and establishes that the mhrc has taken final action on the administrative charge or issued a letter.see.ann.tit,c see also gordan cummings,me the district court ruled that nalco waived its contention by i failing to raise it,either in its answer or as an affirmative defense,and ii engaging in trial by ambush by withholding its objection until the close of walton evidence.
the maine supreme judicial court sjc has yet to determine the proper allocation of burdens of proof under section.consequently,we must make an informed prophecy of what the sjc would do in the same situation,seeking guidance in analogous state court decisions,persuasive adjudications by courts of sister states,learned treatises,and public policy considerations identified in state decisional law.blinzler marriott int l,cir.we review statutory interpretations de novo.see laaman warden,state prison,cir.
section,by its plain language,precludes any characterization of the mhrc exhaustion issue as a mere affirmative defense since it explicitly states that the plaintiff,rather than the defendant,must plead the requisite mhrc filing.on the other hand,the section requirement,strictly speaking,is not an element of the statutory claim,since it does not preclude a jury finding of discrimination,but merely limits the types of recovery available to prevailing plaintiffs 
since section more closely resembles a condition precedent,jensen frank,cir noting that title vii exhaustion requirement is condition precedent to suit mhrc local,upiu,me observing that title vii case law may provide guidance in interpreting mhra,it is governed by.c,see charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.rule c is applicable in all actions in the federal courts,even when the pleading practice in the state in which the court is sitting is different.
federal rule of civil procedure c provides as follows 
in pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent,it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred.a denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity,but when so made the party pleading the performance or occurrence has the burden of proving it 
c.rule c has the effect of forcing defendant to raise the issue of noncompliance with a condition precedent whenever he believes there actually is a question about performance.wright miller id.rule c is designed to eliminate the detailed and largely unnecessary averments that resulted under common law procedure,and to prevent nonmeritorious dismissals for failure to plead the fulfillment of conditions precedent that are not at issue in the suit.
as we have noted,supra,section explicitly requires that the plaintiff plead the requisite mhrc filing.consequently,provided the complaint includes a general averment that all conditions precedent to suit or recovery have been met,and the defendant does not deny the satisfaction of the preconditions specifically and with particularity,then the plaintiff allegations are assumed admitted,and the defendant can not later assert that a condition precedent has not been met.jackson seaboard coast line,cir 
accordingly,the appropriate inquiry in the present case is whether either the original or amended complaint included an adequate general averment that walton had met all conditions precedent to the recovery of damages under the mhra,even though neither complaint explicitly alleged that walton had filed an mhrc charge.the original complaint alleged that walton had satisfied all conditions precedent to jurisdiction under the adea,including the timely filing of a discrimination charge with the eeoc.moreover,count adea damages,including,but not limited to loss of income,loss of benefits,liquidated damages,attorneys fees,costs,prejudgment interest,and declaratory and injunctive relief.further,the prayer for relief in count demanded all available remedies under the maine human rights act including reinstatement,back pay and penal damages and such other relief and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
finally,the amended complaint made crystal clear that count of the original complaint had been brought under both the adea and the mhra and that walton was demanding damages,including,but not limited to,loss of income,loss of benefits,liquidated damages,attorneys fees,costs,prejudgment interest,and declaratory and injunctive relief.emphasis added.yet nalco neither opposed the motion to amend the complaint,nor submitted an amended answer 
under the liberal notice pleading standards,see.e f,these original and amended complaints met the general averment requirements prescribed by rule c.although the complaints neither explicitly alleged compliance with all preconditions to recovery under the mhra,nor with the requirement that an mhrc charge be filed,such compliance was plainly implicit,kiernan zurich,cir holding it sufficient to satisfy the loose guidelines of rule c that plaintiff allege that insurance policy was in full force and effect,thus by implication that all conditions precedent to valid policy were met.
first,walton alleged that he had filed an eeoc charge.second,it is common practice to file simultaneous eeoc and mhrc charges.furthermore,by explicitly demanding mhra damages,both in the original and amended complaints,walton plainly placed nalco on reasonable notice that he was claiming compliance with section.indeed,at trial nalco counsel acknowledged i be candid to say i did not have in mind this affirmative defense when i drafted the answer.consequently,the parties proceeded to trial with no hint whatsoever that section compliance was in dispute.accordingly,the district court correctly rejected the motion for judgment as a matter of law on the mhra claim.
the claim evidence 
nalco contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdicts on the adea and mhra claims.we review these rule motions de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prevailing party.see negron caleb brett,cir.we must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.see id.citation omitted.this demanding standard was not met.
nalco contends that walton was discharged due to his refusal to sign the employment agreement tendered to him,and that his age was immaterial.the record evidence nonetheless reasonably permitted a contrary inference.walton adduced competent evidence that yankowski,who attempted to intimidate walton into accepting early retirement,had related several anecdotes regarding former employees of walton vintage who had been forced into early retirement by nalco.more particularly,yankowski stated to another nalco employee we ca have a man in his sixties,walton s
