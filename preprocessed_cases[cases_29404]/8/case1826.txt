plaintiff edward tocker plaintiff or appellant had been employed as a tax attorney for defendant general foods for many years.when he learned in he was suffering from a serious,illness,he discussed his circumstances with his employer benefits administration manager.as a result,the benefits administration created a special package of benefits for him in,which plaintiff accepted.in january,years later,tocker,despite the doctor prognosis,was still alive and applied for a pension benefit based on years and four months of credit,from september until december,when he turned years old.general foods benefits administration responded that under the special package and agreement,tocker was eligible for service credit only for the years and six months from september until march,because of a severance agreement he had signed as part of the benefits package.plaintiff claimed he had not been told in that he was being terminated and would therefore be ineligible for pension benefits.he appealed the benefit administration determination,and requested a review of his pension computation.the kraft administrative committee upheld the denial of pension credit.
tocker then filed suit pro se in the united states district court for the southern district of new york robinson,against kraft parent company philip morris companies,altria group,kraft foods,and general foods collectively defendants,alleging violations of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et.although proceeding pro se in the district court,tocker is now represented by counsel on this appeal.giving deference to the administrative committee finding that tocker was terminated in march,and to its interpretation of the general foods retirement plan for salaried employees general foods plan or plan,the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.
plaintiff appeals from the grant of summary judgment for defendants and from the denial of his motion to amend his complaint to add necessary parties dated september.the law has put in place a procedure to filter claims under erisa.where the administrators are given discretion under the terms of a benefit plan,as they are in this case,the gate to success on a claim is not the applicant to open.rather,the administrator decision on a claim will be upheld if reasonable,and only overturned if found to be arbitrary.there lies the test we apply here.
background 
tocker history with general foods and the general foods plan 
plaintiff tocker began his employment with general foods as a tax analyst on september.a tax attorney and certified public accountant by training,he earned praise from his supervisors for making substantial contributions to the business,and eventually attained the position of assistant tax director for general foods.
as a salaried employee,plaintiff participated in the general foods plan,a retirement and pension plan.the general foods benefits program also included plans for general disability,disability benefits,medical benefits,dental benefits,life insurance,employee thrift investment,vacation,and mortality payments.the general foods plan was a separate legal entity from its sponsoring employer,general foods.its successor,the kraft plan,continues to be a separate entity from the employer corporations,kraft foods north america,and philip morris companies,now altria group.the plan was administered by an appointed administrative committee consisting of five to seven general foods employees,and by its terms reserved discretion to the administrative committee to make conclusive determinations and interpretations on all questions arising under the plan.
the employer distributed a summary plan description spd to all its employees as required by erisa,a.the spd included information with regard to each of the various plans,including the retirement plan,that constituted the general foods benefits program.although the spd was silent with respect to what discretion was granted the pension board and the administrative committee,it did state 
the governing documents in all cases will be the insurance contracts,the official texts of the plans and the trust agreements,whichever are applicable.while it is the intent of general foods to continue the benefits described in this book,the right to change,modify or discontinue them,without notice,is reserved to the extent permitted by law.
tocker diagnosis and benefit arrangement 
in january tocker was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and underwent radiation and chemotherapy treatments.his doctors told him he had six to months to live.tocker disclosed his condition and discussed his benefits options with his supervisor,edward bloom,and the general foods benefits administration manager,robert varone.in the normal course,tocker would have had two options continue his employment with general foods and be placed on disability,which would provide him with percent of his base salary each month while he remained disabled,or terminate,through the workforce reduction program,his employment with general foods and receive an immediate payment totaling months pay plus payment for unused vacation time.typically these two disability and workforce reduction mutually exclusive.disability employees were not eligible for the kind of payments available under the workforce reduction program,and terminated employees receiving payments through the workforce reduction program were not eligible for disability.
plaintiff supervisor,edward bloom,wrote an unsolicited letter to managers at general foods on tocker behalf,praising tocker contributions to the corporation over the years,explaining that he was having a difficult time choosing between the two options of either disability or a payment,and urging the corporation and the administrative committee to do something to help him.general foods responded by presenting tocker with a new choice,the just referred to special benefits not typically which tocker could receive a bonus payment through the workforce reduction program,effective march,and thereafter receive disability benefits as well.
robert varone outlined the terms of the benefits arrangement for tocker in a letter dated february,and in a revised and finalized copy of the letter dated march.these letters detailed the actions to be taken with respect to tocker benefits.the letters stated you will be put on medical leave effective through.you will report to work and be terminated with workforce reduction.varone explained the benefits due to tocker as follows 
retiree retiree medical will be in effect beginning at a monthly cost of 
active all other active benefits will terminate.
life you have completed a preliminary term insurance application requesting conversion of life insurance cancelling as a result of your termination.
retirement you have elected a certain option to begin at age.the amounts you will receive from the qualified and apa plan each month are indicated below.
tocker agreed to this arrangement,signing a number of documents in early in which he elected benefits consistent with those outlined in varone march letter.these documents indicated that plaintiff was being terminated effective march.he signed a workforce reduction program election of separation options form,in which he elected lump sum in full and agreed that this election of separation option is irrevocable.he signed also a election form that stated my employment having been terminated,i hereby make the following election.when filling out a conversion of group term life insurance form that asked the date his employment ended,tocker responded month day year.tocker never worked after that date.according to plaintiff,even though he signed the forms indicating he was terminated,he did not believe he was actually being terminated.tocker had not been previously identified as a candidate for workforce termination and his supervisor in the tax department was not notified that he was terminated on march.
after receiving an immediate payment of,tocker continued to receive disability benefits a benefit ordinarily available only to employees until he turned years old on december.he then contacted the kraft as general foods was then known benefits department to request a calculation of his pension benefits.the department sent tocker a letter dated may,informing him that he would receive pension credit only for the years from september until march,and not for the years after march.plaintiff appealed the benefit department determination and requested review of his pension computation,arguing that he was entitled to additional service credit from march to january.by letter dated september,the administrative committee upheld the denial of pension credit for the years after march.
procedural history 
bringing suit under,tocker filed his pro se complaint in the southern district against defendants philip morris companies,kraft foods,and general foods,alleging that the administrative committee denial of pension credit for the years from until violated erisa,et.defendants moved for summary judgment,and tocker moved to amend his complaint to add as defendants the general foods plan and the administrative committee.
tocker maintained that the administrative committee had miscalculated his years of credited service because according to the spa an employee would continue to receive credit toward his pension while receiving disability benefits.defendants countered that tocker receipt of disability benefits had been exceptional,that the special benefits had been provided for humanitarian reasons,and that the administrative committee had acted reasonably in denying tocker pension credits for the years after march because tocker had been terminated with a payment effective march.
the district court determined that the kraft plan had reserved discretion to the administrative committee to make benefit decisions,and so the court utilized an arbitrary and capricious standard to review the administrative committee denial of benefits.it noted that tocker was not without evidence supporting his claim for pension benefits.the court also found that the administrative committee determination was reasonable.given a district court limited scope of review of the committee decision,the trial court found that summary judgment for the defendants was proper and therefore granted that relief to them.in addition,the district court denied plaintiff motion to amend the complaint,reasoning that the amended complaint would not survive summary judgment and that such an amendment would be futile.it is from this judgment that plaintiff appeals.
the principal question before us is whether the district court properly applied an arbitrary and capricious standard instead of a de novo standard in reviewing the administrative committee denial determination.tocker contends that the wrong standard was utilized because even though the general foods plan reserved discretionary review to the administrative committee,the spd distributed to general foods employees did not mention the administration discretion afforded to the committee,and erisa requires that an spd be sufficiently comprehensive to apprise participants of their rights under the plan,see a.
because we think the district court applied the correct standard of review,we affirm its decision with respect to tocker benefits claim.but,we vacate and remand with respect to plaintiff fiduciary duty claim and the denial of his motion to amend the complaint.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,in this case,tocker.cioffi averill park cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
i standard for reviewing administrative committee determination 
tocker claims that he is entitled to additional years of credited service for his pension benefits.in adjudicating this claim,we must first determine whether the district court used the correct standard in reviewing the administrative committee decision that appellant was not entitled to additional years of pension credit.a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed by a district court under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.where the plan does grant discretion to the administrator,a court will not disturb the administrator ultimate conclusion unless it is arbitrary and capricious.pagan nynex pension plan,cir.
we have in the past described discretion as a concept whose contours are not clearly defined.morse stanley,cir.in recent years,the amount and type of discretion afforded a plan administrator under erisa has received more judicial attention,and it is now settled that if a plan administrator clearly has been granted discretionary authority in the plan documents,a court will defer to the administrator decision.see pagan,at.the grant of discretionary authority thus narrows the range of judicial oversight and shields a plan administrator decision from a more searching and broader de novo review.
appellant argues that we must look to the spd in determining the proper standard.the spd in the instant case is silent with respect to any discretion reserved by the committee.yet appellant does not dispute the fact that the general foods plan itself gives discretionary authority to the administrative committee.it states that the general foods administrative committee shall have all powers reasonably necessary to administer the plan and is authorized,in accordance with its provisions,to determine eligibility,to compute and determine benefits,and to determine individual rights and privileges under the plan.the plan further explains the acts,decisions,determinations,and interpretations of the administrative committee pursuant to the provisions of the plan the trust agreement s shall be conclusive.this language satisfies the concern expressed by the supreme court in firestone that the fiduciary in that case was not one who exercises entirely discretionary authority or control.at.emphasis removed.
plaintiff contends that because the spd is intended to be an employee foremost resource on the terms of the plan,see heidgerd olin,cir,to avoid de novo review by courts,the plan administrator must make plain in the spd that the administrative committee retains discretionary authority to which courts will likely defer.this issue is one we have left unresolved.see mario p c food markets,cir although this question is open to debate,we need not resolve it now because,in the instant case,the plan administrator determination survives even the broader de novo review.
we have also held that where the plan documents and the summary plan description conflict,the spd controls.heidgerd,at.where the spd is silent on a provision that the plan documents include,and plaintiff contends therefore the term can not apply to him,we utilize a approach to analyze plaintiff argument.see,wilkins mason tenders dist.council pension fund,cir mario,at.first,relying on the statutory language of erisa and its implementing regulations,we look to see whether erisa requires the term to be stated in the spd.wilkins,at.second,we consider whether plaintiff was likely prejudiced by the spd silence on the term or information at issue.id.at.
erisa requires plan administrators to furnish participants and beneficiaries with a summary plan description written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.a.the summary plan description is an employee primary source of information regarding employment benefits,and employees are entitled to rely on the descriptions contained in the summary.heidgerd,at.nonetheless,the summary plan description is intended to be a summary,not a full recitation of the terms of the plan,and we do not expect that spds will anticipate every possible idiosyncratic contingency that might affect a particular participant eligibility for benefits.estate of becker eastma
