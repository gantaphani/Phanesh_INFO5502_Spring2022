on march,jack sheek,while working as an employee of mobil oil singapore private mobil in jurong,singapore,slipped on a small pipe and injured his shoulder.sheek brought suit in united states district court against asia badger,asia badger,alleging that asia badger or one of its subcontractors performed certain repiping work and negligently failed to correct a known hazardous condition which proximately caused him serious injuries.a jury found in favor of sheek and awarded him.asia badger appeals,arguing that the district court committed reversible error by making erroneous evidentiary rulings giving the jury confusing and misleading jury instructions and denying asia badger motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court on all issues.
background 
the basic facts of the case may be summarized as follows.
a.the project 
in june,sheek went to jurong,singapore to work as an operations specialist on a new aromatics plant under construction by mobil the project.asia badger,a subsidiary of badger engineering,was the general contractor on the project.during the project early stages,sheek worked during the day and was responsible for walking through the plant and reporting on the work being done by asia badger.part of his report included operational problems,or punch list items,that needed to be corrected.sheek referred these items,directly or through intermediaries,to asia badger.in turn,asia badger or its subcontractors worked on the identified problems.
in january,sheek became the night superintendent and began working shifts from to sheek ran equipment,flushed pipes,and completed other tasks in order to prepare the plant for operation.sheek also continued to identify punch list items which were passed on to the day shift.these items were addressed during the day,and sheek checked the progress of the work while on duty at night.
in or early february,mobil discovered that four xylene splitter pumps were operating at excessively high temperatures.tests indicated that the piping was too small,preventing cooling water from adequately circulating through the pumps.sheek received orders to take these pumps out of service so that work could be performed on them during the day shift.the pumps required two types of work.the first was maintenance work,such as the replacement of seals and bearings damaged by the lack of coolant this involved unscrewing a flange,removing piping,replacing the parts,and screwing the piping back together.the second type of work involved repairing the actual design defect,cutting out the inadequate cooling pipes and replacing them with larger diameter piping.like other punch list items,sheek noted the work completed on the pumps when he arrived on duty in the evening.
sheek accident 
when the facility entered its final stages of construction in early,mobil gradually took control of sections of the plant as they became operational and expanded its maintenance work in those areas.full mechanical acceptance of the plant by mobil occurred on march.one week later,on march,mobil held a dedication ceremony for the plant.in preparation,some areas of the plant were shut down and cleaned.
also on march,sheek received instructions to take the last of the four pumps,the d pump,out of service.on the evening of march,sheek observed that some of the piping in the d pump had been changed to a larger diameter size.at that same evening,mobil workers arrived with a large control valve which had been removed during the day for maintenance.sheek checked up on the workers several times as they reinstalled the valve.at about on march,sheek walked past the xylene splitter pumps on his way to look at the valve once more,since the work was nearing completion.as sheek neared the d pump,he stepped on a piece of pipe,fell backwards,threw his right arm behind him and grasped a drain line to break his fall.as he got up,sheek saw the pipe,removed it from the walkway and continued with his shift.
injury and treatment 
when sheek awoke the next morning,he felt pain in his right shoulder and could not raise his arm.on march,sheek saw jimmy darwulla,an orthopedic surgeon in singapore.darwulla determined that sheek had a partial tear in his right shoulder muscle and prescribed medication and physical therapy.that same day,sheek filed an accident report with mobil,identifying the pipe he slipped on as the kind being replaced on the xylene splitter pumps.on march,sheek returned to his home in texas to obtain a visa for a assignment with mobil in saudi arabia,which had been arranged prior to his accident.although darwulla had advised sheek that he was not fit to go on the assignment,sheek left for saudi arabia shortly thereafter.
after returning from his assignment in saudi arabia,sheek visited reid,an orthopedic surgeon in texas.reid diagnosed a complete tear in sheek rotator cuff and recommended surgery,which was performed in june.sheek underwent a second surgery several weeks later to remove bone spurs and scar tissue that was causing him pain.following the surgery,sheek accepted a temporary assignment with mobil but was unable to obtain a full medical release and thus return to work permanently.sheek declined mobil offer to place him on half pay and retired in.
sheek filed suit against asia badger in the district court for the eastern district of texas on june.on september,the case was transferred to the district of massachusetts.during the trial,both parties presented conflicting testimony concerning almost every fact in the case.for purposes of this appeal,we will briefly highlight the evidence relating to three main issues i who replaced the piping work on the xylene splitter pumps ii whether asia badger exercised control over the persons who performed the work and iii whether sheek injuries were caused by the pipe on which he slipped.
the piping replacement 
asia badger central defense was that it was not responsible for the repiping work performed on the pumps.to support this contention,asia badger presented the deposition testimony of gary steinmetz,who worked as a mechanical engineer for asia badger during the project.according to steinmetz,the problem with the xylene pumps was a result of a manufacturing error.specifically,in addition to the inadequate piping,the coolers were grossly undersized and had to be replaced with larger capacity coolers.the piping could not be replaced until the coolers were replaced.steinmetz testified that mobil was the only party with the proper equipment to change the piping asia badger did not work with galvanized schedule pipe,identified by sheek as the type of pipe on which he slipped.the deposition of ch tai,mobil venture manager for the project,supported steinmetz testimony by revealing that mobil had received and replaced both the cooler and piping system in august.
sheek did not dispute that mobil changed the coolers and piping in august.he added,however,that a different set of pipes were also changed in march by asia badger.sheek testified that in addition to observing some replaced pipes on the evening of march,he had seen a memorandum prepared by asia badger indicating that the pipes would be replaced and the design drawings altered accordingly to reflect the change.according to sheek,moreover,the overheating of the pumps was a result of a design problem.during the period sheek worked on the night shift,mobil only performed maintenance work on the xylene pumps.james syar,a supervisor on the project at the time of sheek accident,also testified that while mobil replaced seals on the pumps,asia badger took responsibility for the pipe replacement beginning in january or february.syar also witnessed the accident and identified the pipe that sheek fell on as the same type being replaced on the xylene splitter pumps.
control over the work performed 
asia badger also rejected the notion that it had control over any persons who had allegedly completed the claimed work on the pumps in march.to this end,the testimony of mark henderson,a project control manager,indicated that after full mechanical acceptance on march,control and custody passed to mobil.any remaining work was conducted by mobil or by asia badger subcontractors under mobil supervision.gary steinmetz also testified that by this time,all but thirteen asia badger personnel had left the site.
sheek,however,countered this theory by testifying that during his day duty in late,he observed asia badger by their hats bearing the company work being done on the plant.although sheek himself could not see the actual work performed on the pumps once he assumed the role of night superintendent,he stated that asia badger was responsible for all punch list work that involved design defects.finally,sheek closing statement referred to the testimony of gary steinmetz,who had stated that asia badger pattern of work was the same both before and after january.
the cause of sheek injury 
asia badger presented kennedy,an orthopedic surgeon,to render his expert opinion concerning sheek injury.kennedy examined sheek on march,and april,and his two medical reports were admitted as exhibits.during direct examination,he testified that he had also reviewed the evaluation of haig,an orthopedic surgeon in port arthur,texas,who had evaluated sheek condition on october,as part of a disability rating for the texas workers compensation system.kennedy then read from a portion of haig report which described sheek alleged activities in saudi arabia,including that he had to do a great deal of heavy work,climbing,pushing,pulling,et cetera,for about days.kennedy identified this report as the source of information about sheek activities in saudi arabia.
on,kennedy offered the opinion that the progression of sheek partial tear into a massive evulsion of the rotator cuff could be explained by sheek work in saudi arabia.upon further questioning,kennedy acknowledged that he had reviewed haig report since preparing his own april report.at this point,the court held a voir dire,during which kennedy testified that he had read haig report three weeks prior to trial.he also indicated that his opinion concerning sheek worsening injury was based,in part,on haig report.
jury instructions and verdict 
both parties agreed that singapore law governed the issues of both direct and vicarious liability.with respect to the latter,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
the contractor is also liable for the failure of any of his subcontractors to use such reasonable care if the contractor exercised direct supervision and control over the manner in which the subcontractor does this work.thus,in this case,to prevail,sheek must first establish that asia badger or one or more of its employees was negligent or that there was negligence on the part of an asia badger contractor,and that asia badger exercised direct supervision and control in the manner in which this subcontractor performed his work.
with respect to the concept of asia badger direct control and supervision over the manner in which the subcontractor performed the work assigned to the subcontractor,i instruct you that direct supervision and control in this context means more than retention of general sic asia badger to watch over the progress of the work of the subcontractor.it means that asia badger must have exercised direct control,not only over what work was to be done,but the actual performance of the subcontractor as well.
in addition,the special verdict form submitted to the jury contained the following question concerning negligence were employees or agents of the defendant,asia badger,negligent in performing the work in the area of the alleged incident the court denied asia badger request to modify both the instructions and the verdict form.
during its deliberations,the jury sent the court a note asking,regarding number on the verdict form,is sheek negligence restricted to the time of the accident or could it include the subsequent recovery period the court answered the jury 
i have instructed you that you are to determine whether in the first instance,negligence on the part of employees or agents as i described,as i defined agents,caused the injury to sheek,and if you determine that it did,that is to say that negligence was the proximate cause of injury to sheek,then you are to determine whether negligence on the part of sheek was a proximate cause of his injury.
the underlying question in the analysis is of course what is the injury.
and depending on how you determine,what you determine the nature of the injury to be that sheek has is how you answer that question.so my answer to you in short will be,it depends.it depends on what you say the injury is,whether you consider the time of the accident or you consider some later period.
after additional deliberation,the jury returned a verdict for sheek in the amount of,reduced by ten percent,or,based on its finding that sheek was also negligent.the court entered judgment on september.on september,asia badger moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial and remittitur.the district court denied both motions,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
asia badger challenges the jury verdict on three grounds.first,asia badger contends that various evidentiary rulings prejudiced its case against appellee.next,asia badger asserts that the district court failed to properly instruct the jury on the requirements for vicarious liability under singapore law.finally,asia badger challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the verdict.we address each of these claimed errors in turn.
evidentiary issues 
asia badger claims that the district court erred in excluding critical portions of asia badger expert testimony.asia badger also contends that the court improperly allowed sheek and syar to offer testimony about which they had no personal knowledge.we disagree.
kennedy testimony 
at trial,the district court excluded portions of testimony from asia badger medical expert,kennedy,for failure to supplement his medical report to include changes in his medical opinion as required by.e.the court noted that neither of kennedy own reports linked the development of sheek massive rotator cuff evulsion to his work in saudi arabia,and that consequently,his opinion as to the cause of sheek injury was inadmissable.we will reverse a trial court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony only when there is an abuse of discretion.coastal fuels of puerto rico,caribbean petroleum,cir licciardi tig ins.group,cir.
fed.civ.proc.e requires a party to supplement its disclosures if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.as we have noted previously,the supplement requirement helps a party avoid the burden of responding to unexpected and changes in its opponent expert testimony.see licciardi,at.this,in turn,promotes the broader purpose of discovery,which is the narrowing of issues and the elimination of surprise.johnson webster,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
asia badger asserts that,as an initial matter,it did not violate rule because kennedy was originally scheduled to testify after the close of appellee case.since by this time haig report would have been introduced into evidence by appellee,kennedy would be qualified to testify based on the haig report pursuant to,which states that t he facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to him at or before the hearing.according to asia badger,although kennedy had to testify earlier than planned due to scheduling conflicts,the same result should ensue.
we are not persuaded by this evidentiary sleight of hand.it seems clear that rule,which outlines the permissible bases for expert testimony,was not designed to thwart the goals of open and fair discovery embraced by rule.here,kennedy revealed during voir dire that haig in provided to him by asia badger at least three weeks prior to trial.in addition,asia badger itself introduced the report and questioned kennedy on its contents,suggesting that it was aware of his changed opinion.thus,even if appellee intended to introduce haig report before kennedy testified which is itself uncertain,asia badger would not be excused from its duty to abide by the rules of discovery and inform appellee of the change in the expert pretrial report.see licciardi,at defendant required to inform plaintiff of material change in expert opinion,even where plaintiff might have reason to expect that it might change see also thibeault square d,cir emphasizing that this court attempts to ensure that the spirit of open discovery embodied in rule is not undermined either by evasion or dilatory tactics.furthermore,appellant offered no explanation whatsoever for its failure to amend kennedy reports to reflect his new opinion.there is thus ample support in the record for the district court conclusion that asia badger stood in violation of rule e,and we do not believe that rule was intended to this basic requirement of fair play.
when faced with a discovery violation,the district court possesses wide latitude in formulating the appropriate sanction.poulin greer,cir.under the federal rules of civil procedure,a party that fails to disclose information under rule e shall not be permitted to use as evidence any witness or information not so disclosed.c.although the court originally ruled to exclude all of kennedy sanction well within the district court scope of court ultimately decided to strike only those portions of kennedy testimony based on the passage in haig report describing sheek activities in saudi arabia.it is true,as asia badger points out,that causality was an important issue in this case.however,haig report itself remained in evidence,and the jury was free to infer,as asia badger argued in its closing,that sheek activities in saudi arabia contributed to his injury.given its minimal impact on appellant case,the district court sanction was relatively lenient and we see no reason to disturb it.
sheek and syar testimony 
asia badger challenges the admission of sheek testimony that the cooling water issue was a design problem rather than a maintenance problem and that asia badger was responsible for the design work sheek testimony regarding the purpose of the repiping work and sheek rebuttal testimony that the work done in august of described by ch tai was not the same work done in march of that year.appellant also challenges syar deposition testimony that asia badger handled the repiping work in march of,arguing that syar did not personally observe the work being done.we review evidentiary issues for abuse of discretion.kelley airborne freight,cir.
requires that a witness have personal knowledge about the matter to which he testifies.such knowledge can include inferences and opinions,so long as they are grounded in personal observations and experience.united states rodríguez,cir quoting united states neal,cir see also.we believe that the record supports the district court conclusion that sheek and syar met this threshold in each of their disputed statements.
first,as his testimony reveals,sheek had been a mobil employee for years,beginning as an operator in a chemical processing unit.he later worked as a controlman and then as a production supervisor during the construction of new mobil plants in the united states and abroad.by the time he arrived in singapore,sheek had completed two years of work in cambridge,massachusetts,which involved reviewing drawings and providing input into the design of the project.during his day duty,sheek was personally responsible for relaying,directly or indirectly,all punch list items to asia badger.finally,sheek also observed a memorandum from asia badger outlining the modifications of the piping combined,these factors provided a sufficient foundation for sheek to identify the cooling water issue as a design defect and to infer that asia badger had performed the design work.given his experience and observations,moreover,sheek was qualified to testify that the purpose of the repiping was to increase the flow of the cooling fact that appears uncontroverted by both parties.
sheek rebuttal testimony did not even require inference or opinion,but was grounded in his personal observations alone.according to the deposition testimony of ch tai,mobil performed modifications on the cooling water pipes that led to the xylene splitter pumps in august.this work allegedly took place in the aromatics unit,an area that sheek supervised for a period of three months.sheek countered that during one of his shifts in march,he observed that the piping in the d pump had been changed to a larger diameter size.sheek therefore had the personal knowledge to not only distinguish the work described by tai on the pipes leading to the pumps from that which he observed within the pump itself,but also to testify that they involved different locations within the aromatics unit.
finally,the court properly admitted james syar testimony that asia badger performed the repiping work.syar deposition testimony included the following colloquy 
q okay.when you say december and april are you talking about december and april 
q all right.you were on the night shift that whole time period 
q okay.now,the work being done on these cooling water pipes,that was done during the daytime 
a most of them were,because we were limited to what we could have done at night.
q okay.so it yes that they were 
q okay.so you could have actually seen the work being done,is that right 
a on that particular pipe,no,only if they were there,worked over at night.
q and did they 
a i was there for some of it.now,for the main header,that was done during the day.most of the time what we dealt with was just what connected to our pumps so 
q all right.tell me the dates when you actually saw the work being done at night.
a i ca.i ca do that.
although appellant makes much of the court initial impression that the testimony was unclear,the court subsequently concluded that syar testimony indicated that some of the repiping work took place at night,while he was working.in fact,syar affirmatively responded that some of the work took place in his presence.the fact that syar was unable to specify the dates on which he saw the work being done may affect the weight,but not the admissibility,of his testimony.see neal,at.viewing his statements as a whole,syar demonstrated sufficient personal knowledge to testify to the party responsible for the repiping work on the xylene pumps.
in sum,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting any of the testimony claimed as error by appellant.
jury instructions 
asia badger next contends that the district court provided misleading and confusing instructions on the issue of vicarious liability and then exacerbated that error through a special verdict form.once again,we can not agree.
the jury charge 
according to asia badger,the district court erred when it refused its request to enumerate and clarify the standard for vicarious liability because asia badger objected to the court instructions before the jury retired,it met the requirements of.and must be reviewed to see whether there was error and,if so,whether it was harmless.beatty michael bus.mach,cir.to this end,
t he rules of decision are uncontroversial.the trial court refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case.elliott warren,cir quoting united states destefano,cir.similarly,the giving of an instruction is reversible error only if it was misleading,unduly complicating,or incorrect as a matter of law,and adversely affected the objecting party substantial rights.levinsky stores,cir.
faigin kelly,cir.using these guidelines,we discern no error in the district court instruction.
asia badger meets the first and third prongs of the test for the court refusal to accept its proffered instruction.both parties agree that singapore law governs the issue of vicarious liability.for this issue,both sheek and asia badger cite as authority mohd bin sapri private,slr lexis,which held that a party was not liable for the negligent act of its subcontractor because the party did not control the work of the subcontractors and was not involved in any substantial supervisory or coordinating capacity.id.at the party had left the matter entirely to is.distinguishing the facts in from an english case where such liability was found to exist,mcardle andmac roofing,eng,the singapore court highlighted two scenarios where a contractor may be liable for the negligence of its subcontractors,slr lexis at.first,the party may be liable where the working conditions are inherently dangerous,thereby requiring the exercise of a significant degree of supervision and control over persons with whom he has no contractual relationship.id.alternatively,the party may owe a duty of care if he has taken it upon himself to exercise a degree of control and actively coordinate the sub contractors activities,given that the work environment itself involved inherent risks or danger.id.
the record suggests that the parties and the court took the second route for determining liability.to be sure,sheek did not argue that asia badger was required to exercise control over its subcontractors or third parties due to the inherent danger of the work and facilities,nor did asia badger defend on this theory.rather,the issue presented to the jury was whether asia badger did,in practice,exercise control over the claimed repiping work,which would lead to a duty of care to sheek.on this point,asia badger proposed instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law it required the jury to find that an asia badger employee personally supervised and directed the manner and details of the doing of the work of that subcontractor in order to be liable for the negligence of its subcontractor it is unquestionable,moreover,that the issue of vicarious liability was integral to an important the most important the case.
nevertheless,the refusal to incorporate the exact wording offered by the appellant will not constitute error unless the court failed to substantially incorporate the offered theory in its instruction.elliott,at.according to asia badger,the court did not properly instruct the jury on the elements of vicarious liability,namely,that a party must have control over the details and the manner of the work to be done by the subcontractor.however,we can find no disparity between this concept and the court charge to the jury.the court explicitly noted that the jury was required to find that asia badger exercised direct control,not only over what work was to be done,but the actual performance of work of the subcontractor as well.this indicated to the jury that it was to consider both the details and the manner of the work performed.when the court has sufficiently conveyed a litigant theory,that litigant is not entitled to dictate the turn of phrase the judge should use to acquaint lay jurors with the applicable law.id.we therefore uphold the district court refusal to give the instructions offered by asia badger.
however,asia badger also claims that the given instruction,though incorporating its theory of applicable law,nonetheless confused and misled the jury.we find this contention without merit.if anything,the court condensed the lengthy and somewhat repetitive instruction offered by asia badger into concise and straightforward language that would be more easily comprehended by the jury.see id.at decision to give a general statement of law in order to avoid potential confusion from proffered instruction by counsel lies uniquely within the trial judge discretion.as we noted above,the court offered a correct statement of the law,and appellant has failed to identify any misleading or unduly complicating aspect of the given instruction.since we find none,we hold that there was no error in the jury charge rendered by the district court.
we also reject appellant challenge to the adequacy of the court response to the jury query.we acknowledge that jury instructions given during the course of deliberations come at a particularly delicate juncture and require the court to construct its wording carefully.testa stores,cir warning that the court can err as easily by overinclusiveness as by underinclusiveness.however,we have also noted that as long as the court correctly addresses the issue submitted by the jury,it may amplify the instruction at its discretion.see id.at.the court here,after reminding the jury that it first needed to resolve the issue of negligence,proceeded to explain that sheek negligence could include either the time of the accident or some later period,depending on the nature of the injury.while it may be true that the court could have phrased its answer more simply,we find no basis to conclude that the instruction was confusing,misdirecting,or misleading.see steckstor hancock,cir concluding that district court reference to insurance in answering jury question concerning liability,though unfortunate,was not error.we presume that the jury followed the court instruction,united states,cir,and asia badger disappointment that the award was reduced by only ten percent for comparative negligence does little to rebut this presumption.
verdict form 
asia badger also objects to the wording of the verdict form,which it argues conflated the issues of direct and vicarious liability.a verdict form must be reasonably capable of an interpretation that would allow the jury to address all factual issues essential to judgment.johnson teamsters local,cir quoting united states real property located at big rock,cir.we examine the court instructions to the jury and the wording on the verdict form as a whole to determine whether the issues were fairly presented to the jury.id.at.
as we have already discussed,the court clearly instructed the jury on the requirements for vicarious liability.the court also separately addressed asia badger direct liability for its own employees.given this distinction,the jury could reasonably interpret the phrase employees or agents included in question of the verdict form to refer to employees or subcontractors and hence,the respective theories of direct and vicarious liability.if the general charge adequately directs the jury to its duties in answering the questions submitted to it there is no need to accompany the submission with repetitive instruction.id.quoting lawrence gulf oil,cir.since the jury was so directed,we hold that the court was not required to ask separate questions concerning direct and vicarious liability in the verdict form.
sufficiency of the evidence 
finally,asia badger maintains that the district court erred in refusing its motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and new trial,because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the jury verdict.specifically,asia badger contends that sheek failed to establish two crucial elements of his claim that asia badger or its subcontractors actually performed the repiping work in march and that asia badger exercised control over any work so performed.our standard of review is de novo,viewing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict.sinai new england,cir.
first,asia badger contends that the evidence establishes,unequivocally,that mobil did the repiping work.the facts and inferences most favorable to sheek,however,suggest otherwise.sheek testified that on march,he took the d pump out of service.the next evening,he observed that some of the piping within the pump had been changed to a larger diameter.a jury could reasonably infer,despite tai testimony to the contrary,that some repiping work was indeed performed on the pumps in march of with respect to the march work,moreover,sheek conceded that mobil performed maintenance as replacing the the xylene pumps.he noted,however,that in the course of this work,any piping that was removed would necessarily have to be reconnected.based on this testimony,a jury could reasonably believe that the pipe on which sheek slipped could not be related to the work done by mobil.finally,asia badger performance of some punch list work sheek observation of a memorandum from asia badger outlining repiping work to be done in
