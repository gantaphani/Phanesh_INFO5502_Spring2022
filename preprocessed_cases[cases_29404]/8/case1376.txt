background 
from through,mechler worked as a special enforcement officer for the kansas department of corrections doc.her primary responsibility in this role was apprehending fugitive parolees,and at various points in time she was assigned to work with the united states marshal fugitive task force.this type of work required mechler to carry with her a firearm.in march,mechler left the kansas doc to begin a three year contract with dyncorp,which operated various overseas prisons on behalf of the united states government.mechler was assigned to the mitrovica detention center in kosovo,where,on april,her first day on the job she and five other dyncorp employees were shot by a jordanian soldier working for the united nations.three of the victims died.
mechler was wounded in her left leg and pelvis,but,after treatment at a military hospital,returned to work on crutches two days after the attack.because of her physical injuries dyncorp assigned mechler to light duty,where she remained until january.even on light duty,however,mechler struggled to complete her hour shifts.for her first two weeks back on the job,her colleagues would sometimes complete her shifts for her.they also would occasionally cover for her when,beginning about four weeks after the shooting,mechler would attend counseling sessions with an army psychologist,captain cora courage.at the time,mechler was experiencing trouble sleeping,intrusive thoughts,and anxiety.to treat the anxiety and sleeplessness,captain courage referred mechler to an army psychiatrist,colonel mcclure,who prescribed mechler zoloft and trazodone.the sleeping medication,trazodone,apparently needed to be taken at a consistent time of day,so colonel mcclure recommended that mechler stop alternating between day and night shifts at dyncorp.to accommodate this,dyncorp transferred mechler to a different prison where she no longer had to work nights.
around august,dyncorp brought one of its employees,paul brand,to kosovo to administer psychological examinations to all the shooting survivors.although mechler testified that she believed brand was retained to gauge the survivors mental fitness,the timing of his visit seems to coincide roughly with contact between kurt kerns,a kansas lawyer,and the survivors.kerns was contemplating a law suit against the jordanian government and possibly the united nations.after brand evaluation,kerns arranged for the survivors to meet with a psychologist whom he had retained to assist with his case.that psychologist,george hough,phd,evaluated mechler in october at kern direction and again in december when mechler was home on vacation.later,after mechler filed this claim,hough began treating mechler regularly.at some point prior to litigation before the alj,hough formed a diagnosis of mechler based on the october and december evaluations.he concluded that mechler was suffering from depression,stress disorder,and possibly a histrionic personality disorder.there is no evidence in the record that this diagnosis or any of the results of the evaluation were ever communicated to mechler.
in november,captain courage was deployed to iraq and,with the exception of the second evaluation with hough and one or two more visits by brand there is no indication that mechler received any further mental health treatment.on april,dyncorp successor in interest,civilian police international,informed mechler and the other surviving employees that they would be sent home.this was a year earlier than provided for in her contract,and mechler sought to stay the remaining year.she testified,however,that the state department refused to grant its approval and informed her that she and the other survivors were being sent home for their mental.
once mechler returned to work at the kansas doc,she was prevented from carrying a firearm.according to mechler,the kansas doc became aware through media reports and gossip that she had been shot and sent home early from kosovo.they believed she was mentally unfit to carry a weapon and assigned her to a desk job that paid less than what mechler would have made if she had been able to continue on as special enforcement officer.
on april,mechler filed a claim for workers compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,et seq longshore act or act,as extended by the defense base act,et.she sought,inter alia,periodic benefits to cover the difference in salary between her former and current jobs at the kansas demotion,she asserted,caused by her ongoing psychological problems.when the district director of the department of labor office of worker compensation programs was unable to resolve the claim informally,he referred it to an alj on september,for formal disposition.applying the longshore act one year statute of limitations,the alj found that mechler claim was time barred because she should have been aware that her injuries would likely result in an impairment of her earning capacity at the time of hough evaluation of october.the alj based this finding in part on mechler testimony that she thought hough was retained as part of an effort to rebut a potentially negative diagnosis by brand.the alj also noted that hough himself diagnosed mechler with mental impairments following his evaluation in october,and that mechler had sought treatment for a multitude of psychological symptoms ahead of time.as such,the alj dismissed mechler claim as untimely 
mechler appealed within the agency,and the benefits review board board reversed and remanded.dyncorp int l,ben.bd.serv.mb.after noting that the alj should have applied a statutory presumption in favor of timeliness,the board reviewed the record and concluded that there was not substantial evidence to support the alj finding that by october mechler was constructively aware of the connection between her psychological injury and her future earning capacity.the board was particularly concerned by what it perceived as the alj reliance on evidence related to mechler temporary physical impairment immediately following the shooting.
on remand,the alj awarded mechler disability benefits based on her psychological impairment.dyncorp and its insurance carrier,fidelity and casualty company of new international,collectively petitioners appeal.
discussion 
in relevant part,section a of the longshore act,a,states that t he time for filing a claim shall not begin to run until the employee or beneficiary is aware,or by the exercise of due diligence should have been aware,of the relationship between the injury or death and the employment.the conventional interpretation of this provision relied on by both the alj and benefits review board below is that a claim under the act accrues when the employee knows or should know that the injury is work related,and knows or should know that the injury will impair the employee earning power.paducah marine ways thompson,cir citing cases from the first,fourth,fifth,ninth,eleventh,and circuits.we agree that this is the appropriate standard for measuring the timeliness of claims filed under the act.we also adopt the board position that claims like mechler are presumed timely.see dyncorp int l,ben.bd.serv.mb applying statutory presumption contained in section b of the act,b,to the timeliness of a claim.thus,only by producing substantial evidence,see b,of untimeliness can an employer successfully raise a statute of limitations defense under the act.
here,petitioners assert that they met their burden of production and that the alj initial finding of untimeliness was supported by substantial evidence.they seek to characterize the board review in this case,not as one for substant
