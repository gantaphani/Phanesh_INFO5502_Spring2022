on october,we certified questions to the connecticut supreme court regarding the scope of connecticut immunity for conservators and attorneys for conservatees,as well as regarding the role of such actors and of nursing homes that house conservatees in the connecticut system.on april,the connecticut supreme court answered our certified questions in an opinion,holding as a matter of state law that conservators are entitled to immunity when their actions are authorized or approved by the probate court and that attorneys for conservatees are not entitled to immunity.it also described the role of nursing homes housing conservatees in the connecticut system and suggested that such entities should not be entitled to immunity.
we now consider whether the conservator for an elderly conservatee,his attorney,and the nursing home that housed him in allegedly abusive circumstances are entitled to immunity as a matter of federal law.we hold that federal immunity parallels state immunity for these actors.the judgment of the district court with regards to kathleen donovan donovan,the conservator,jonathan newman newman,daniel gross gross attorney,and grove manor nursing home,grove manor,the nursing home in which gross was housed,as to the federal claims and,with regards to donovan and newman,as to the state claims is therefore vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
background 
the facts necessary to understand this opinion are set forth below.a fuller account of the factual background is available in our certification opinion,gross rell gross i,cir.the allegations of the complaint are accepted as true in this recitation.
gross,an octogenarian resident of the state of new york,sought treatment in a hospital in waterbury,connecticut,where his daughter lived.while there,a hospital employee filed an application for appointment of a conservator in waterbury probate court for reasons unknown.
the probate court appointed newman to represent gross in the involuntary conservatorship action.despite the fact that the hearing did not conform to the proper notice procedure,that gross was not a connecticut resident,and that gross appeared to be alert and intelligent at the time of hearing,newman concluded that there was no legal basis to deny the application.
on september,the probate court appointed donovan as conservator of gross person and estate.a week or two later,donovan placed gross in a locked ward in grove manor nursing home.gross remained captive in grove manor for roughly ten months,and during that time,numerous restrictions were placed upon him,including limits to the duration and circumstances of visits with his daughter.
on june,gross filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the connecticut superior court.referring to gross conservatorship as a terrible miscarriage of justice,the court granted the writ.
gross filed the instant suit in the district of connecticut.the complaint contained both federal and state claims against a number of defendants only those claims at issue today are discussed in this opinion.gross filed state and federal law claims against donovan and newman and federal claims against grove manor.the district court dismissed these claims reasoning that all three actors enjoyed immunity.gross appealed.
we held that gross appeal depended upon unresolved questions of state and federal law regarding the scope of immunity.gross i,at.we certified the following questions to the connecticut supreme court 
under connecticut law,does absolute immunity extend to conservators appointed by the connecticut probate courts 
under connecticut law,does absolute immunity extend to attorneys appointed to represent respondents in conservatorship proceedings or to attorneys appointed to represent conservatees 
we also observed that resolving whether donovan,newman,and grove manor enjoyed immunity as a matter of federal law required further information regarding the role these actors played in the state system.the supreme court has advised that we can determine whether an actor is entitled to immunity by reference to six factors described in cleavinger saxner 
a the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation b the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct c insulation from political influence d the importance of precedent e the adversary nature of the process and f the correctability of error on appeal.
d.we sought guidance as to how to apply these factors in determining the availability of federal immunity in a third certified question 
what is the role of conservators,attorneys for conservatees,and nursing homes in the connecticut probate court system,in light of the six factors for determining immunity outlined in cleavinger saxner,d 
the connecticut supreme court accepted our certified questions and on april,issued an opinion.gross rell gross ii.it held that none of the types of actors here enjoy absolute immunity as a matter of connecticut law.it held that conservators are entitled to immunity from liability for acts that are authorized or approved by the probate court.id.at.when conservators act pursuant to the authorization or approval of the probate court,the court reasoned,they function as the probate court.id.at.outside of such situations,however,conservators in the connecticut system function as fiduciaries of the conservatee and may be held personally liable.id.at.
with regards to attorneys for conservatees,the connecticut supreme court concluded that such attorneys should enjoy no immunity as a matter of connecticut law.it observed,
t he primary purpose of the statutory provision of.requiring the probate court to appoint an attorney if the respondent,an individual who is the subject of conservatorship proceedings prior to the imposition of a conservator is unable to obtain one is to ensure that respondents and conservatees are fully informed of the nature of the proceedings and that their articulated preferences are zealously advocated by a trained attorney both during the proceedings and during the conservatorship.the purpose is not to authorize the probate court to obtain the assistance of an attorney in ascertaining the respondent or conservatee best interests.because the function of such attorneys generally does not differ from that of privately retained attorneys in other contexts,this consideration weighs heavily against extending immunity to them.
id.at.it also contrasted attorneys for conservatees with attorneys for children,noting that attorneys for children are called upon to play dual roles,to assist the court in serving the best interests of the child and to function as the child advocate.id.at.it emphasized that these roles are not easily disentangled.id.thus,attorneys for conservatees should enjoy no immunity.id.at.
finally,the connecticut supreme court made several observations about the role of nursing homes that house conservatees in the connecticut legal system.after noting that the probate court does not have the statutory authority to issue injunctive orders to third parties to carry out its decisions on behalf of a conservatee,the court stated that because grove manor was not party to the conservatorship hearing,grove manor was not acting as the probate court agent when it complie d with the conservator instructions.id.at.the actions of grove manor,therefore,were not an extension of the authority of the probate court and should not,in the opinion of the connecticut supreme court,be entitled to immunity.
the case returned to us for consideration of the remaining questions of federal law.we have had the benefit of supplemental briefing from the parties on the extent to which federal immunity should apply in light of the connecticut supreme court opinion.
discussion 
the connecticut supreme court has advised us of the limits of state immunity.we adopt its analysis and remand the state law claims against donovan and newman to the district court for further proceedings.gross did not appeal the dismissal of his state law claims against grove m
