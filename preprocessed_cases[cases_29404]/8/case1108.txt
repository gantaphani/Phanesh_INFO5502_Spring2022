plaintiffs marissa carter et,individually and as representatives of putative classes of persons alleging that they were overcharged for copies of their medical records by defendants rochester general hospital rgh,unity hospital of rochester unity,thompson hospital,thompson,and healthport technologies,llc healthport,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york,frank geraci,chief judge,dismissing their complaint complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the complaint alleged principally that rgh,unity,and thompson collectively the hospitals,through their agent healthport,charged plaintiffs more than the statutory maximum fees allowed by pub.health law d and e mckinney for providing copies of plaintiffs medical records.the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss the action pursuant to.b on the ground that the complaint alleged that the requested records had been paid for by plaintiffs attorneys,ruling that the complaint therefore did not plead to the plaintiffs themselves and that plaintiffs lacked standing under article iii of the constitution to bring this action.plaintiffs challenge that ruling.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that,in light of ordinary principles of agency,the complaint allegations that each named plaintiff through her or his counsel paid the charges demanded by defendants for providing the records and that plaintiffs bore the ultimate expense for those records,plausibly alleged that plaintiffs themselves were injured by the claimed violations of new york law.accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the action pursuant to rule b for lack of standing.
background 
the complaint alleged that d and e of the new york public health law forbid hospitals to profit from the process of providing a patient with copies of his or her medical records.the complaint cited d as requir ing that,upon written request by a patient or other qualified person for that patient medical records,a health care provider must furnish a copy of the patient information requested complaint,and alleged that a q ualified person is defined broadly in g h of that law to include,among other s,any subject of the medical information or attorney representing a qualified person complaint.it alleged that e 
places two caps on the amount of money that a provider or a person or entity acting on behalf of a provider may charge for these records.first,a charge must not exceed the costs incurred by such provider.second,the reasonable charge for paper copies shall not exceed cents per page.

a.the complaint factual allegations 
the complaint whose factual assertions are taken as true,given the district court dismissal on the basis of the complaint alleged the following as facts.plaintiffs are seven individuals,each of whom had been a patient of one of the hospitals.see complaint.healthport was a limited liability company id.that ha d contracts with the hospitals and other new york health care providers to a respond to requests for medical records,and b produce such records to patients and other qualified persons id.
between october and april,each plaintiff,through her or his counsel,requested medical records from the treating hospital.complaint.the complaint alleged that healthport responded to each such request and stated that the charge for such records would be cents per page,plus a fee for electronic delivery the fee demanded was paid by each plaintiff through her or his attorney.for example,
o n or about september,carter requested medical records from rgh through her counsel.
on or about october,healthport,acting on behalf of rgh,sent an invoice,which indicated that carter would be charged for pages of medical records per page,plus a electronic dlvry fee.
on or about october,carter paid the charge through her counsel in order to obtain copies of the requested medical records.
the cost to produce these medical records was substantially less than cents per page.
the fee charged to,and paid by,carter exceeded the cost to produce these medical records,and included a kickback from healthport to rgh.

while the fee for carter records included a charge for electronic delivery see id,healthport produced her records in paper format id.see also id.same with respect to the third request by koning.with respect to the first two requests by koning and the requests of the other five plaintiffs,the healthport fee included charges of cents per page,but their records were provided only electronically through an online portal.see id.grys id.currier id,koning id.beehler id.mancuso id.cuthbertson.
in may,plaintiffs commenced the present action on behalf of themselves and a putative class the class,defined as 
all patients who requested medical records either by themselves or through a qualified person acting on their behalf from a health care provider in the state of new york that contracted with healthport technologies,llc to produce such records,and were charged on or after may,for such records.

the complaint alleged that the fees charged by healthport and paid by plaintiffs substantially exceeded the cost to produce the requested medical records and included kickback s from healthport to the respective hospitals,id.to support this allegation,plaintiffs attached to the complaint printouts of two advertisements on healthport website offering hospitals and large clinics a shared release of information roi or roi partner service,for responding to requests for medical records complaint exhibit,at.one advertisement stated to offerees,w ith healthport roi partner,you will gain significant cash flow from the roi process id.the other advertisement proffered testimonials from users of healthport roi services

the complaint alleged that charging patients fees in excess of defendants costs in order to obtain their medical records violated pub.health law d and e,and unjustly enriched defendants at the ultimate expense of plaintiffs and other class members complaint,see id.the complaint also alleged that defendants conduct,including charging of excessive fees,f ailing to disclose the actual cost to produce medical records,engaging in the kickback scheme,and failing to disclose the kickbacks,constituted deceptive business practices in violation of new york general business law,see bus.law a and h mckinney.complaint.the complaint stated that plaintiffs and the class were injured and suffered monetary losses as a result of defendants conduct.see,id.
defendants motions to dismiss 
all of the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,each urging dismissal under rule b on the ground that plaintiffs lacked standing,or dismissal under rule b for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.in support of their argument,defendants principally submitted copies of a some of the relevant requests for plaintiffs medical records,b healthport invoices for the related fees,and c checks or transaction records in payment of those fees.defendants argued that these documents showed that the records were requested by,and the fees were paid by,plaintiffs attorneys faraci lange,llp,and not by plaintiffs directly,and that plaintiffs themselves therefore had suffered no injury and thus had no standing to complain of any charges.
c.the decision of the district court 
in a decision and order dated march,see wl,the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss under rule b on the ground that the complaint allegations were insufficient to show constitutional standing.the court noted that in deciding such a motion it was entitled to consider evidence outside the pleadings,wl,at but it rendered its decision based solely on the complaint,stating 
i find that the complaint in this action fails to establish the plaintiffs standing to bring this suit.there is no plausible allegation in the complaint to establish that it was plaintiffs as opposed to their counsel who requested the copies or paid the resulting bill and therefore bore the alleged injuries in this case,and without such an allegation in the complaint,the plaintiffs have failed to establish their standing to sue.
having concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing,the court did not address defendants motions to dismiss under rule b.the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.judgment dated april.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend principally that the complaint,alleging,inter alia,that they,through their attorneys,paid the excessive charges demanded by defendants,and that plaintiffs and other class members bore the ultimate expense of the overcharges,was sufficient to reveal their article iii standing to bring the present action.plaintiffs brief on appeal at.they argue that while the district court correctly stated the deferential standard applicable to resolution of a motion under b,it failed to apply that standard and to credit the factual allegations in the complaint.
defendants principally urge us to affirm the district court dismissal for lack of standing on the ground that the complaint did not allege that plaintiffs are obligated to repay their attorneys for the fees charged,which defendants contend was necessary to allege to plaintiffs see joint brief on appeal of healthport,rgh,and unity at thompson brief on appeal at.thompson also urges us to affirm the dismissal on the alternative grounds that plaintiffs lack standing to sue thompson because they failed to show that thompson caused their alleged injuries and because thompson did not receive money from healthport see thompson brief on appeal at,or that the complaint fails to state a cause of action.
preliminarily,we note that where a complaint is dismissed for lack of article iii standing,the dismissal must be without prejudice,rather than with prejudice.such a dismissal is one for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,see,davis federal election commission,d lujan defenders of wildlife,d amidax trading group scrl,cir amidax and without jurisdiction,the district court lacks the power to adjudicate the merits of the case,see,steel citizens for a better environment,d.accordingly,where there is a lack of article iii standing,article iii deprives federal courts of the power to dismiss a case with prejudice,hernandez conriv realty associates,cir.thus,if we were to agree with the district court conclusion that the complaint failed to show article iii standing,we would nonetheless be constrained to have the april,judgment amended to provide that the dismissal is without prejudice.
for the reasons that follow,however,we vacate the dismissal because we conclude that the complaint contained sufficient plausible allegations to defeat defendants rule b motions.
elements of article iii standing 
article iii restricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies that restriction requires that the party invoking federal jurisdiction have standing the personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation.
davis,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis ours.
t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.only the first and second elements are at issue here.
the element requires that the plaintiff be the proper party to bring this suit.raines byrd,d.a plaintiff complaint must establish that he has a personal stake in the alleged dispute id.at.any monetary loss suffered by the plaintiff satisfies this element e ven a small financial loss suffices.natural resources defense council,united states food drug administration,cir.further,a liability,including a contingent liability,may be a cognizable legal injury.see,clinton city of new york,d new york city department of education,cir denney deutsche bank ag,cir.
the causal connection element of article iii standing,the requirement that the plaintiff injury be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court,lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted,does not create an onerous standard.for example,it is a standard lower than that of proximate causation.see rothstein ubs ag,cir.a defendant conduct that injures a plaintiff but does so only indirectly,after intervening conduct by another person,may suffice for article iii standing.see id.at.
procedures with respect to challenges of standing 
although the article iii standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed,davis,at see,lujan,at standing is to be determined as of the commencement of suit,the standing issue may be raised by a party,or by a court on its own initiative,at any stage in the litigation,even after trial and the entry of judgment,arbaugh y h,d see,grupo dataflux atlas global group,d raised after jury verdict.at each such stage,t he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the elements of article iii standing,lujan,at but the stage at which,and the manner in which,the issue is raised affect a the obligation of the plaintiff to respond,b the manner in which the district court considers the challenge,and c the standard of review applicable to the district court decision.
since the elements of article iii standing 
are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff case,each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.
id.thus,the showing that must be made in order to withstand a dismissal for lack of standing increases as the suit proceeds.
at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presum e that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim in response to a summary judgment motion,however,the plaintiff can no longer rest on such mere allegations,but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts.e,which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.and at the final stage,those facts if controverted must be supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.
lujan,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.
at issue here are defendants rule b challenges to standing at the pleading stage.a rule b motion challenging subject matter jurisdiction may be either facial or.
when the rule b motion is facial,based solely on the allegations of the complaint or the complaint and exhibits attached to it collectively the pleading,the plaintiff has no evidentiary burden.see,amidax,at.the task of the district court is to determine whether the pleading allege s facts that affirmatively an
