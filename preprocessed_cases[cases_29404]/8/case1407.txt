background 
since this is an appeal from a.b dismissal,the following facts are drawn from plaintiffs second amended class action complaint for violations of federal securities laws the second amended complaint,and are accepted as true.see slayton am.express,cir.we also rely on information derived from cbre filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and other documents that are invoked by the complaint.see atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir w e may consider any written instrument attached to the complaint,statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,legally required public disclosure documents filed with the sec,and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit.
cbre is a commercial real estate speciality finance company focused on originating,acquiring,investing,financing,and managing commercial real loans and securities.its investment portfolio consists of whole loans subordinated interests in first mortgage real estate loans real mezzanine loans commercial securities and joint venture investments.on september,cbre filed an sec form s registration statement the registration statement for its ipo.the registration statement offered common shares to the public at per share.the underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional common shares at per share.the sec declared the prospectus effective on september.the ipo raised approximately million.
at the time of the ipo,two mezzanine loans were outstanding to developer triton real estate partners,llc triton.as defined in cbre prospectus,investments in mezzanine loans take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that directly or indirectly owns the property.the first loan,with a carrying value of million,was made on or about october,and was collateralized by the rodgers forge,a unit condominium conversion project in north bethesda,maryland the rodgers forge loan.the second loan,with a carrying value of million,was made on or about november,and was collateralized by the monterey,a unit condominium conversion project in rockville,maryland the monterey loan,and together with the rodgers forge loan,the triton loans.
the second amended complaint alleges that defendants knew that these mezzanine loans were in trouble at the time of the ipo.triton had missed tax payments on both the rodgers forge and the monterey,sales were declining at both condominiums,and the monterey development was over budget cbre had entered into an intercreditor agreement in or around november with freemont investment and loan freemont,the senior lender on the monterey loan.under that agreement,cbre and freemont were required to keep each other apprised of any developments with respect to the monterey,including whether the project was experiencing any financial difficulties.according to a former regional manager at freemont,triton had exceeded the construction budget for the monterey by approximately million by the summer of,and as a result of this condition,freemont stopped funding its senior loan on several occasions.during the summer of,freemont discussed the condition with triton pursuant to the intercreditor agreement,freemont would also have been required to inform cbre.
other allegations concerning triton troubles include cost overruns due to unforeseen asbestos removal and unexpected mechanical and electrical issues at the monterey mechanics liens filed against both projects,claiming nonpayment of contractors in mid triton solicitation of additional funding from equity investors and triton default on payments to,which caused the to halt construction on both projects.
the second amended complaint alleges that cbre registration statement was materially inaccurate because it failed to disclose that the triton loans were impaired a defined.the registration statement reported that cbre had reviewed its portfolio of loans and did not identify any loans that exhibit ed characteristics indicating that impairment ha d occurred.
on february,five months after the ipo,cbre announc ed its financial results for the fourth quarter of.the press release indicated that as of december,cbre had classified the monterey loan as and that the rodgers forge loan was on cbre watch list,but that cbre had no impairments or loss reserves since inception.and watch list are defined in the margin following the press release,cbre common stock price dropped more than over the period ending february.
cbre reported more bad news in the following months.its form k filed on or about march,reported that cbre had advanced approximately million to protect its mezzanine loan position in the rodgers forge.a may,press release disclosed that,as of april,cbre was no longer pursuing equity real estate investments through joint ventures,and that on may,cbre foreclosed on the rodgers forge loan.on may,cbre foreclosed on the monterey loan.cbre wrote down the value of both loans,and incurred a million impairment charge with regard to the of the monterey loan.
on january,defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to.b,arguing that the second amended complaint failed to plausibly allege that the prospectus contained a material misstatement or omission.on july,the district court issued an order dismissing the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim.judgment was entered on august,dismissing the action and closing the file.
the district court held that plaintiffs did not plausibly allege that the omissions concerning the triton loans were material because,as reflected in cbre sec filings,the triton loans were fully collateralized by the underlying real estate.therefore,the district court reasoned,cbre was not at risk of a material loss on the loans at the time that the registration statement and prospectus issued.hutchison i,d at.the district court did not rely on any quantitative benchmarks to assess the materiality of the alleged omissions at issue in this case.id.at.
after the dismissal,plaintiffs moved for reconsideration or,in the alternative,for leave to file a proposed third amended complaint.the motion was denied.the district court found that plaintiffs were attempting to relitigate the issue of materiality,and that the allegations they claimed had been overlooked had in fact been considered.hutchison cbre realty,cv,wl,at,hutchison ii.in denying plaintiffs request for leave to file a proposed third amended complaint,the district court held that the proposed pleading added no relevant factual allegations and would have been futile.id.at.specifically,the district court noted that b ecause the triton loans were adequately collateralized at the time of the ipo,there existed no risk of a loss to cbre at that time.the facts as pled in the proposed third amended complaint fail once again to rectify the deficiencies concerning the materiality of the omissions.id.as a separate ground for denying leave to amend,the court ruled that plaintiffs had inordinately delayed seeking leave to amend for a third time by waiting until after the entry of judgment dismissing the second amended complaint,nearly two years after the litigation began.id.at.

section of the securities act provides a private right of action to a person who purchased a security,either directly from the issuer or in the aftermarket,if the registration statement filed with the sec contained either misstatements or omissions of material facts.see a.similarly,section a imposes liability on the issuer or seller of securities if the securities were sold using a prospectus that contained a material misstatement or omission.see id.a.so long as a plaintiff establishes one of the three bases for liability under these provisions a material misrepresentation a material omission in contravention of an affirmative legal disclosure obligation or a material omission of information that is necessary to prevent existing disclosures from being misleading,see in re morgan stanley,at then,in a section case,the general rule is that an issuer liability is absolute.blackstone,at quoting in re initial pub.offering sec,cir.section creates liability for individuals or entities that control any person liable under sections or.a.

to determine whether a misstatement or omission is material is an inherently inquiry.basic levinson.a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to act.id.at quoting tsc,northway.that is to say there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.tsc,at.
w e have consistently rejected a formulaic approach to assessing the materiality of an alleged misrepresentation.ganino citizens utils,cir.in both ganino and jp morgan,we cited with approval sec staff accounting bulletin,which provides relevant guidance regarding the proper assessment of materiality.blackstone,at.according to sec staff accounting bulletin sab,t he use of a percentage as a numerical threshold such as,may provide the basis for a preliminary assumption of materiality,but a bright line percentage can not appropriately be used as a substitute for a full analysis of all relevant considerations.at.among useful qualitative factors are whether the misstatement concerns a segment or other portion of the registrant business that has been identified as playing a significant role in the registrant operations or profitability.at,and whether management expects that the misstatement will result in a significant market reaction,jp morgan,at.
cbre registration statement represented that loans or other investments would be considered impaired when it is deemed probable that cbre will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original agreements.in the second amended complaint,plaintiffs rely on the statements of several confidential witnesses to support their allegations concerning cbre knowledge that the triton loans were impaired.one witness,a former regional manager of freemont,explained that prior to the ipo,freemont was in constant discussions with triton about the condition of its loan and that the condition caused triton to seek a to million capital infusion from a group of outside investors.as previously discussed,freemont and cbre entered into an intercreditor agreement after they closed on the monterey loans the agreement provided that freemont communicate with cbre upon the occurrence of potential default events.and that one such potential event of default.required that freemont notify cbre upon the occurrence of a condition,which is more commonly referred to as a construction cost overrun.freemont discussions with cbre,plaintiffs allege,should have apprised cbre that the monterey loan was impaired,or at least likely to be impaired.
because we are at the pleading stage,we accept plaintiffs allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.see johnson rowley,cir per curiam.therefore,because freemont was aware of cost overruns at the monterey and because the intercreditor agreement required freemont to disclose potential default events to cbre,a plausible inference may be drawn that cbre was aware of the cost overruns and was thereby aware of an existing trend,event or uncertainty under item.a ii see blackstone,at observing that item imposes a disclosure duty where a trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty is both presently known to management and reasonably likely to have material effects on the registrant financial condition or results of operations.internal quotation mark omitted.t he sole remaining issue is whether the effect of the known information was reasonably likely to be material for the purpose of item and,in turn,for the purpose of sections and a.blackstone,at.
the district court,eliding any discussion of the traditional quantitative and qualitative factors used to assess materiality,instead dismissed the second amended complaint on the sole ground that the alleged misstatements and omissions were not material because the triton loans were adequately collateralized at the time of the ipo.see hutchison i,d at.while this bright line rule has considerable appeal,this is not a case in which we should consider adopting it,because the unambiguous wording of the registration statement defines impairment in a way that discounts any issue of collateralization loans and other investments are considered to be impaired,for financial reporting purposes,when it is deemed probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original agreements emphasis added.even assuming the triton loans were fully collateralized,a loan default would result in at least a temporary loss to cbre because in the event of a default,cbre would have to initiate foreclosure proceedings that would entail delay,fees,costs and prolonged uncertainty.even if cbre could ultimately recover the full amount of its loan after a foreclosure,and even if a default ultimately would not harm cbre,id.at,cbre would not have collected according to the contractual terms of the original agreements.without categorically rejecting the district court collateralization approach,we hold that it can not decide this case.adequacy of collateral is one of the qualitative factors but not the only one that determines whether a misstatement or omission concerning the loan is material.
we therefore turn to quantitative measures.to do so,we must at the outset reconcile two recent decisions in our circuit,each of which analyzed whether statements in a registration statement were material for purposes of a section claim eca local ibew joint pension trust of chicago jp morgan chase,cir,and litwin blackstone,cir.in jp morgan,the panel conducted a quantitative materiality analysis that compared the value of the troubled investment to the value of the defendant entire investment portfolio,whereas the blackstone panel,conceding that the troubled investment did not meet the quantitative threshold when considered as a part of the company entire portfolio,determined that the investment was qualitatively material nevertheless by weighing the impact of the troubled loan on the constituent part of blackstone business in which the loan was located.
in jp morgan,plaintiffs alleged that jp morgan chase jp morgan made material misstatements concerning billion in prepay transactions that jp morgan made to a special purpose entity that,in turn,made loans to enron corporation.at.we first looked to the quantitative factors and observed 
although billion in prepay transactions may sound staggering,the number must be placed in contextreclassifying billion out of one category of trading assets derivative receivables totalling billion into another category loan assets totalling billion does not alter jpmc total assets of billion.moreover,the underlying assets in either classification carry some default risk.as the district court said about this same information,c hanging the accounting treatment of approximately of jpm chase total assets from trades to loans would not have been material to investors.
id.at quoting in re jp morgan chase sec,d,internal citation omitted.on appeal,we approved the quantitative approach as a good starting place for assessing the materiality of the alleged misstatement,and reasoned that a n accounting classification decision that affects less than of a percent of total assets does not suggest materiality.id.we added that a further necessary consideration is the qualitative factors set forth in sab.id.
in blackstone,the plaintiffs alleged that blackstone group,blackstone invested approximately million in fgic,a monoline financial guarantor,at billion in freescale semiconductor,a semiconductor designer and manufacturer,and an undisclosed amount in residential real estate investments,id.at.plaintiffs alleged that at the time of blackstone billion ipo,fgic faced massive losses as a result of the housing market collapse,id.at,and that freescale had lost an exclusive agreement to manufacture chipsets for its largest customer,id.at.we conceded that blackstone investments in fgic and freescale f e ll below the presumptive threshold of materiality,but held that the district court erred in its analysis of certain qualitative factors related to materiality.id.at.first,we held that blackstone could not rely on its corporate structure to argue immateriality on the ground that a loss in one division was offset by a gain in another.id.second and critical for present purposes we held that the district court erred in finding that the alleged omissions did not relate to a significant aspect of blackstone operations.id.the corporate private equity group was represented by blackstone to be its flagship segment and had a critical role in the overall enterprise.id.at.even where a misstatement or omission may be quantitatively small compared to a registrant financial results blackstone investment in freescale was a relatively minor piece of blackstone total investments,accounting for of the corporate private equity segment assets under management its significance to a particularly important segment of a registrant business tends to show its materiality.id.
we need to consider these two opinions together in order to decide in this case whether to gauge the materiality of the triton loans in terms of cbre entire portfolio or its portfolio of mezzanine loans only.it is clear that blackstone does not purport to limit or affect the holding of jp morgan a panel is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court.united states wilkerson,cir.so we need to identify the crucial factor or fact that renders blackstone consistent with the holding of jp morgan.it is this if a particular product or productline,or division or segment of a company business,has independent significance for investors,then even a matter material to less than all of the company business may be material for purposes of the securities laws.hypothetically,such a product or segment might be the company original niche,its iconic or eponymous business,critical to its reputation,or most promising for growth or as an engine of revenue.thus blackstone emphasized as a qualitative factor that the corporate private equity group was the firm flagship segment a reasonable investor would almost certainly want to know information related to that segment that blackstone reasonably expects will have a material adverse effect on its future revenues.blackstone,at.
cbre is a commercial real estate speciality finance company that is primarily focused on originating,acquiring,investing,financing,and managing a diversified portfolio of commercial real loans and securities.plaintiffs claim that the entirety of the triton loans million constituted of cbre mezzanine loans which were of cbre total capital,of all of cbre loans,and of cbre entire investment portfolio.thus plaintiffs isolate some of cbre transactions mezzanine loans as a notional division or segment in which the triton loans could loom as material in quantitative terms.however,plaintiffs have not alleged plausibly or otherwise that mezzanine loans constitute a component of cbre business that is of distinct interest to investors other than as another component of cbre book of business.for a company that makes real estate loans,mezzanine loans which are one tier in the hierarchy of secured interests are not the subject of investors fixation.so any alleged impairment of the triton loans must be analyzed in relation to cbre entire investment portfolio billion,consistent with the quantitative approach in jp morgan.
in that light,the triton loans were not material.moreover,the second amended complaint fails to allege how much of the triton loans was impaired at the time of the ipo.it is alleged that when cbre foreclosed on the triton loans,long after the ipo,it incurred a million impairment charge on the of the monterey loan but it is not alleged that this figure or some other dollar amount of impairment was known to cbre at the time of the ipo 
as to the qualitative analysis,plaintiffs rely on two sab factors to support their contention that the misstatements and omissions were material a cbre stock price drop following disclosure of the triton loans impairment,and b the impact on a major portion of cbre business.see sab.at among the considerations that may well render material a quantitatively small misstatement are whether the misstatement concerns a segment or other portion of the registrant business that has been identified as playing a significant role in the registrant o
