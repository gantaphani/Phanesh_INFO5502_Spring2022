this is a case where the plaintiff attempts,in effect,to appeal from an order that the district court never made.not surprisingly,her appeal goes nowhere.
we start by rehearsing the bare facts and travel of the case.alison cioffi is an exotic dancer who resides in woburn,massachusetts.she applied for and accepted employment with club fantasies the club,an adult entertainment venue dysphemistically called a strip club operated in providence,rhode island,by gilbert enterprises.she performed at the club without apparent incident until.she alleges that,on a date that is in dispute a fellow dancer assaulted her and inflicted severe injuries.
on april,the plaintiff sued the club in a massachusetts state court she alleged that her injuries resulted from the club failure to furnish her with a safe and secure workplace.
the club is owned and operated by a rhode island corporation.alleging diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,the club removed the action to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.see a.in due course,the club moved to dismiss the action for,inter alia,improper venue and want of in personam jurisdiction.see.b.the plaintiff opposed the motion.after briefing and argument,the district court saylor,concluded that the club had insufficient contacts with massachusetts to warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction.see cioffi gilbert,d,order on motion to dismiss.instead of dismissing the case judge saylor asked the parties to brief the question of whether dismissal or transfer of venue would be the more condign remedy.see id.
the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration,beseeching the district court to rethink its conclusion on personal jurisdiction or,in the alternative,to transfer the case.for its part,the club exhorted the district court to dismiss the suit outright.after mulling these importunings,judge saylor invoked a and transferred the case to the district of rhode island a district in which the suit unarguably could have been brought 
at this point,the plaintiff improvidently attempted to appeal.her notice of appeal,plainly interlocutory,was dismissed for want of diligent prosecution after the plaintiff counsel failed to respond to our order questioning appellate jurisdiction.see cioffi gilbert,cir,unpublished order see also cir.b.
once the case was docketed in the district of rhode island,the club again moved to dismiss.its motion posited that the plaintiff complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because suit had been commenced outside the applicable limitations period.see.b.inexplicably,the plaintiff did not respond to this motion.after the time for filing an opposition expired,see b,the district court mcconnell,summarily granted the motion and dismissed the action.this appeal followed.
the plaintiff frames the issue on appeal as whether she set forth sufficient facts in her jurisdictional proffer to establish minimum contacts over the club in massachusetts.appellant br.at.by framing the issue in this way,she attempts to challenge judge saylor determination that the massachusetts district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the club.but appellate courts do not review issues as such.see california rooney.a district court speaks through orders and judgments,and only those decisions are reviewable.see in re shkolnikov,cir downey state farm fire cas,cir.this is of decretory significance because judge saylor jurisdictional conclusion never ripened into an order of dismissal but,rather,formed a part of his rationale for transferring the action to rhode island under a.see cioffi gilbert,d,order denying reconsideration.
a transfer order under a is appealable after final judgment in the case see,dubin united states,cir see also marine ins.lafarge,cir reviewing denial of transfer pursuant to a after entry of final judgment cianbro curran lavoie,cir reviewing,after final judgment,separate orders transferring and refusing to transfer case.here,however,the plaintiff does not take aim at the transfer order.the statute on which the transfer order is predicated provides the district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss,or if it be in the interest of justice,transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.a.the plaintiff,though,has not argued that the district court misapplied the statute.
moreover,where such a transfer order is appealed,appellate review is for abuse of discretion.see cianbro,at.yet,the plaintiff has not argued that judge saylor abused his discretion.nor has she tried to explain why the transfer order runs counter to the interest of justice.indeed,she has scarcely mentioned the subject of venue in her appellate brief.
to be sure,the plaintiff could have appealed judge mcconnell order of dismissal.see,vega encarnación babilonia,cir stating that i f the merits are at issue,the mere fact that a motion to dismiss is unopposed does not relieve the district court of the obligation to examine the complaint itself to see whether it is formally sufficient to state a claim.that order,though,was premised on the club unopposed motion,which contended that the plaintiff had sued too late.see laws b limning limitations period for personal injury actions.but what the plaintiff could have done and what she actually did are two different things she has not mounted any semblance of a challenge to judge mcconnell dismissal order.
the crux of the matter is that the plaintiff briefing all but ignores both section a and the statute of limitations.instead,she argues the case as if judge saylor had dismissed her action on jurisdictional grounds.this sets up a straw man and the plaintiff effort to reinvent the record will not wash.
the short of it is that there are only two appealable orders here judge saylor transfer order and judge mcconnell dismissal order.to challenge either one,the plaintiff would have to present,at a minimum,some developed argumentation addressed to the relevant order.see casillas díaz palau,cir stating that litigants have an unflagging obligation to spell out their contentions squarely and distinctly,or else forever hold their peace internal quotation marks omitted united states zannino,cir it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work see also shelby superperformance int l,cir a party failure to designate a particular order for appeal ordinarily defeats a later attempt to dispute that order in the court of appeals.when a party fails to develop even a ghost of an argument as to why a particular order is erroneous,any potential challenge to that order is ordinarily deemed waived.see borges ex rel.serrano isern,cir zannino,at.we have no occasion to depart today from this prophylactic rule.
we add a coda.while we might have the authority to stretch a point and read the plaintiff frontal assault on the district court jurisdictional views as an indirect attack on the transfer order,we are reluctant to do so.after all,it is not our place to do a party homework for her.an appellate court is entitled to have litigants present arguments face up and squarely,see moses.mele,cir,and the plaintiff has not done so here.
if more were needed and we doubt that it is we see no injustice in holding the plaintiff to the easily satisfied standard requiring the presentation of developed argumentation.the plaintiff could have argued that the transfer order constituted an abuse of discretion.instead,her notice of appeal expressly disclaimed an intent to appeal the order to the extent it did anything more than reaffirm judge saylor conclusion about jurisdiction.
in all events,showing an abuse of discretion would have been a heavy lift.rhode island is clearly the center of gravity of this case the club is located in rhode island and its owner is a rhode island corporation that does not operate elsewhere,the plaintiff employment was performed entirely in rhode island,the alleged assault occurred there,and the parties agree that the substantive law of rhode island governs t
