background 
fifa is the worldwide governing body of soccer or football,as it is known outside the united states,and the organizer of the world cup soccer tournament held every four years.the underlying lawsuit is a breach of contract action brought by mastercard against fifa seeking enforcement of an alleged contractual provision giving mastercard first right to acquire exclusive sponsorship rights in its product category for the fifa world cup event in and.mastercard complaint alleges as follows for the past sixteen years,mastercard has had a contractual relationship with fifa to act as a sponsor for the world cup.mastercard served as an official sponsor of the world cup event in,and.although soccer is still catching on among american television audiences,the world cup is the sporting event in the world.the world cup drew a cumulative television audience of billion viewers from over countries.
in,mastercard and fifa entered into a contract by which mastercard acquired exclusive sponsorship rights in its product category for fifa competitions between and,including the world cup the mastercard contract.this contract also allegedly contained a first right to acquire provision that gave mastercard a right of first refusal to sponsorship rights during the next fifa sponsorship cycle,covering fifa competitions from.according to mastercard,under this provision,fifa may not offer these sponsorship rights to another entity within mastercard product category without first providing mastercard the opportunity to purchase these rights on comparable terms.pursuant to this provision,fifa allegedly offered mastercard exclusive sponsorship rights for all fifa competitions between and,including the and world cups.negotiations between the parties continued over several months and allegedly culminated with fifa sending mastercard a final agreement on march,which mastercard signed and returned to fifa.
meanwhile,fifa was also in negotiations with visa regarding these sponsorship rights.on march,mastercard learned that fifa had decided to finalize an agreement with visa.on april,mastercard received a letter from fifa president stating that fifa had entered into a contract with visa granting visa the exclusive sponsorship rights to fifa competitions,including the world cup,through the visa contract.the visa contract becomes effective january.upon learning of the deal,mastercard notified both fifa and visa that it considered fifa actions a violation of the right of first refusal provision in the mastercard contract and mastercard would seek legal redress if fifa went forward with the visa contract.
on april,visa issued a press release announcing its contract with fifa for exclusive sponsorship rights in the world cup through.on april,mastercard filed suit in the southern district of new york for breach of contract and sought injunctive relief enjoining fifa from consummating,effectuating or performing any terms of the visa contract and ordering fifa to perform its obligations under the alleged contract granting mastercard exclusive rights through.federal jurisdiction is premised solely on diversity of citizenship.
on june,mastercard filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.after fifa motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and motion to compel arbitration were both denied,the district court scheduled the preliminary injunction hearing for september,and later adjourned it to september.email communication produced in this case indicates that visa has been in contact with fifa regarding this litigation since the time it was filed.on september,two weeks before the preliminary injunction hearing,visa sent a letter to the district court stating that it was a necessary and indispensable party to the litigation because of its contractual entitlement to the fifa sponsorship rights.visa claimed that because it was an indispensable party,the case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.since mastercard and visa are both incorporated under the laws of delaware,visa joinder would destroy diversity sole basis for federal jurisdiction.
the district court construed visa letter submission as a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure and scheduled a hearing for september.at the conclusion of that hearing,the district court denied visa motion,finding that visa was not a necessary party under rule a,and even assuming that it were,visa was not an indispensable party under rule b requiring dismissal of the action rule order.the district court reasoned that because the underlying litigation involved the mastercard contract and whether fifa had breached that contract,visa presence was unnecessary to decide the dispute between mastercard and fifa.moreover,even if mastercard prevailed in this lawsuit,visa right to sue fifa for breach of the warranty provision in the visa contract would not be prejudiced.finally,since visa conceded that it had no knowledge of the negotiations between mastercard and fifa or the mastercard contract,it would have nothing to contribute to the outcome of that lawsuit.thus,the district court found that the case could proceed without visa.
on september,visa filed a notice of appeal of the district court rule order.visa also filed a motion to stay the district court proceedings and a motion for expedited appeal with this court.in addition,visa filed in the district court a motion to stay and a motion to intervene in the litigation under federal rule of civil procedure.visa apparently these papers on friday,september,but they were not received by the district court until monday,september.on september,the district court denied visa motion to stay.that same day,the district court held a telephonic hearing on visa motion to intervene,and denied that motion as well.the district court also promptly issued a written decision regarding visa motion to intervene rule order.see mastercard int l fifa,civ,wl.
meanwhile,also on september,this court in response to visa emergency motion temporarily stayed the proceedings in the district court pending hearing of visa motion.after hearing oral argument,this court granted visa motion to stay the proceedings for the remainder of the appeal,set an expedited briefing schedule,and placed the appeal on the court calendar for november.approximately ten days before this court was scheduled to hear visa appeal of the rule order,visa filed its notice of appeal of the district court rule order recognizing the overlap of issues presented by these appeals,we ordered consolidation and heard oral argument as scheduled on november cognizant of the impending january,trigger date for the visa contract and the need for expeditious resolution of the underlying lawsuit,this court issued an order on november,indicating its disposition in this case,vacating the stay previously granted by this court,and remanding the matter to the district court.we now explain the basis of our decision.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
before we can discuss the merits of visa appeal,we must first establish that we have jurisdiction to do so.see steel citizens for a better env t,d on every writ of error or appeal,the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction,first,of this court,and then of the court from which the record comes.internal quotation marks omitted.mastercard contends that we lack jurisdiction to entertain visa original appeal of the rule order because it is an uncertified interlocutory appeal.visa asserts that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.visa cites no case in which this court has entertained an interlocutory appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss under rule.we too have found no such authority.we attribute the absence of prior case law on this issue to the fact that visa,as a to the underlying action,should not have been allowed to file a motion to dismiss in the district court.the proper procedure would have been for the district court to construe visa letter submissions as a motion to intervene under federal rule of civil procedure.this rule provides the mechanism by which who believe they have a valid and sufficient interest in a litigation can assert their rights.see.a b.rule explicitly contemplates motions by.see.c setting forth procedural requirements for persons seeking to file motions to intervene.we find nothing in the text or notes to rule that would indicate strangers to an action may file motions to dismiss under that rule.
this is not to say,however,that the district court was prohibited from considering the issue of whether visa was an indispensable party to the underlying litigation.because rule protects the rights of an absentee party,both trial courts and appellate courts may consider this issue sua sponte even if it is not raised by the parties to the action.see,manning energy conversion devices,cir e ven in the absence of an objection under rule a,we are obliged to consider whether m n and osmc are indispensable parties under federal rule of civil procedure b.havana club holding,galleon,w hen a court believes that an absentee may be needed for a just adjudication,it may raise compulsory party joinder on its own motion.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.b oth the trial court and the appellate court may take note of the nonjoinder of an indispensable party sua sponte.james moore et,moore federal,a ed.the district court may raise compulsory party joinder on its own motion.see also provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d instructing courts to take steps on their own initiative to protect an absentee party delgado plaza las,cir rejecting argument that district court lacked jurisdiction to consider rule issue because w e have squarely held that a district court may raise the issue of nonjoinder sua sponte pickle int l oilfield divers,cir a rule objection can even be noticed on appeal by the reviewing court sua sponte.mccowen jamieson,cir rule issue is sufficiently important that it can be raised at any stage of the sua sponte.finberg sullivan,cir in banc a n appellate court should consider,on its own motion,any plausible argument that the interest of an absent party requires that party joinder.therefore,although the district court erroneously permitted visa to file a motion to dismiss under rule,the district court was not precluded from considering the issue on its own accord.since appellate courts have an equal duty to consider compulsory joinder issues sua sponte and ensure that indispensable parties are adequately protected,we will interpret the district court decision to entertain visa motion as an exercise of its duty to examine rule issues on its own initiative and will reach the merits of the rule order if appellate jurisdiction exists to review that order.
we agree with mastercard that the appeal of the rule order originally filed by visa is an uncertified interlocutory appeal that does not fit within the exception created by the collateral order doctrine.the denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final order and is therefore only appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see bernard county of suffolk,cir see also merritt shuttle,cir generally speaking,an order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory and hence nonappealable.catlin united states.d enial of a motion to dismiss,even when the motion is based upon jurisdictional grounds,is not immediately reviewable,superseded by statute on other grounds.
the collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception to the general rule that interlocutory orders are not appealable as a matter of right.schwartz city of new york,cir.an interlocutory order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine only if it satisfies all of the following conditions it conclusively determine s the disputed question it resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and it is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.whiting lacara,cir quoting coopers lybrand livesay,d.the appeal of the rule order originally filed by visa fails the third prong of this test.as visa has amply demonstrated by its filing of a second appeal,the rule order is not effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.the second appeal challenges the district court denial of visa motion to intervene.it is settled law that this court has jurisdiction over an order denying intervention.united states peoples benefit life ins,cir citing news,kheel,cir because a district court order denying intervention is a final order,we have appellate jurisdiction.see also ionian shipping british law ins,cir t he proper and sensible course is to assume that an order denying intervention is final for the purposes of appeal.since the substance of the rule order is reviewable on appeal of the rule order,visa original appeal of the rule order does not satisfy the collateral order exception and is accordingly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
we therefore turn our attention to the second appeal filed by visa.as indicated above,we have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to intervene.see peoples benefit life,at kheel,at.once appellate jurisdiction is established,we may simultaneously consider another issue not itself entitled to interlocutory review if the otherwise unappealable issue is inextricably intertwined with the appealable one,or if review of the otherwise unappealable issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the appealable one.merritt,at internal quotation marks omitted.we find review of the district court rule order is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the rule order.as we explained in merritt,t he existence of subject matter jurisdiction goes to the very power of the district court to issue the rulings now under consideration o ur review of the district court order would be meaningless if the district court was without jurisdiction over that claim in the first instance.id.at citing catholic conference abortion rights mobilization,d see also san filippo united of carpenters and joiners of,cir where there is an appeal otherwise properly before this court,and the absence of subject matter jurisdiction is suggested,that issue may be reviewed,superseded by statute on other grounds.thus,in merritt,we first reviewed the otherwise unappealable denial of the defendant motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it was necessary to ensure meaningful review of the order that was properly before the court.at.the same situation is before us.if the district court ruling that visa is not a necessary and indispensable party is erroneous,then,because visa joinder would destroy diversity jurisdiction,the underlying action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.thus,because the rule order implicates the district court subject matter jurisdiction over this litigation,we must first examine the correctness of this ruling before we turn to the merits of the rule order.see,filetech fr.telecom,cir we are,as was the district court,to address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at the outset.saint john marine united states,cir we have the duty to determine whether subject matter jurisdiction exists even if the issue is not presented by the parties.
ii.rule order 
we review the district court failure to join a party under rule only for abuse of discretion.see conntech dev.of.educ,cir.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.jonesfilm lion gate int l,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting zervos verizon new york,cir.a party is necessary under rule if 
in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
a.visa contends that it fits within all three of these categories.we disagree.
a party is necessary under rule a only if in that party absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties.a emphasis added.visa absence will not prevent the district court from granting complete relief between mastercard and fifa.visa argues that without it in the case,mastercard can receive only partial relief because visa still holds contractual rights to the sponsorship rights and will file suit against fifa to enforce the visa contract while there is no question that further litigation between visa and fifa,and perhaps mastercard and visa,is inevitable if mastercard prevails in this lawsuit,rule a is concerned only with those who are already parties.mastercard can obtain complete relief as to fifa without visa presence in the case.if mastercard prevails and is granted its requested relief,fifa will be enjoined from awarding the sponsorship rights to another party,including visa.this will resolve the dispute between mastercard and fifa,and visa presence is unnecessary to decide those questions.thus,visa is not a necessary party under rule a 
we find no abuse of discretion in the district court conclusion that visa was not a necessary party under rule a i.visa claims that because mastercard seeks to enjoin fifa from performing the visa contract,its interests are clearly implicated and it is therefore entitled to appear in this litigation.visa relies primarily on this court decision in internorth,cir,which it characterizes as controlling here in,the defendant asserted a counterclaim alleging that a proposed merger between the plaintiff and a third party,belden,was unfair under the business judgment rule because it lacked any legitimate business purpose and was entered into solely to defeat the defendant tender offer.id.at.the counterclaim sought to enjoin the merger.id.on appeal of the district court grant of a preliminary injunction,this court noted its disagreement with the district court conclusion that belden was not a necessary party to the action because belden rights under the merger agreement would clearly be prejudiced if the relief sought by internorth were to be granted.id.at citing lomayaktewa hathaway,cir no procedural principle is more deeply imbedded in the common law than that,in an action to set aside a lease or a contract,all parties who may be affected by the determination of the action are indispensable.
visa reliance on this case is misplaced.in,the actual contract involving the absent third party was the basis of the claim.the counterclaim specifically challenged the validity of the merger agreement and sought to set aside that agreement.if the defendant prevailed on this counterclaim,the merger agreement would be deemed invalid,which would presumably affect belden ability to then sue for breach of that agreement or invoke any of the protections in that agreement.thus,belden was faced with the possibility of having its contract terminated in its absence.in contrast,in this case,while the visa contract may be affected by this litigation,it is not the contract at issue in mastercard lawsuit.the underlying litigation involves the mastercard contract and whether mastercard had a right of first refusal to the world cup sponsorship rights.even if mastercard prevails and receives the relief it seeks,that does not render the visa contract invalid.it means that fifa likely has breached the warranty provision of that contract,and visa has the right to sue fifa for that breach.
furthermore,in,because the absent was a party to the contract at issue,its ability to protect its interest in that contract would have been seriously impaired if it were not made a party to the action.this places the absentee in in a distinctly different position from visa,whose contract with fifa is not at issue here.as the district court correctly found,visa ability to protect its interest in its contract with fifa will not be impaired if is not joined here.the primary flaw in visa argument is that it has construed rule a i to extend to any party whose interests would be impaired or impeded by a litigation.this overlooks a key element of the definition of necessary party under rule a i.it is not enough under rule a i for a third party to have an interest,even a very strong interest,in the litigation.nor is it enough for a third party to be adversely affected by the outcome of the litigation.rather,necessary parties under rule a i are only those parties whose ability to protect their interests would be impaired because of that party absence from the litigation.see.a defining necessary party as one with an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest emphasis added.thus,while visa may have an interest that would be impaired by the outcome of this litigation,visa still does not qualify as a necessary party under rule a i because the harm visa may suffer is not caused by visa absence from this litigation.any such harm would result from fifa alleged conduct in awarding visa sponsorship rights it could not legally give.we would be significantly broadening both rule a i and the principle discussed in if we found that because the outcome of this case may impact a separate contract involving a different party,that finding would transform the action into an action to set aside a lease or a contract,at quoting lomayaktewa,at.involved an actual action to set aside a contract here we have an action that could in the future impact a third party rights under a separate contract.we,therefore,do not find controlling here and decline to broaden its scope to reach the facts before us,particularly since doing so would read a key element out of the text of rule a i.
visa also relies on several cases that recite the general proposition that a party who claims title to a piece of property that is the subject of an action has sufficient interest in the action to justify compulsory joinder,and urges us to follow that reasoning here.visa attempts to characterize this case as if it were a proceeding to determine the rightful owner of a piece of property to which mastercard and visa have competing claims.while we have held in cases involving this factual scenario that all claimants to the property at issue are necessary parties to the action,see,brody village of port chester,cir holding that in action by property owner to recover land taken by eminent domain,current titleholder to land might be necessary party if district court were to restore land to plaintiff kulawy united states,cir holding that in an action to quiet title by aggrieved tax payer against government seeking to recover automobiles sold to satisfy tax lien,purchasers of automobiles were necessary parties,we do not find this reasoning applicable here.in brody and kulawy,the district courts were required to determine who among several parties had title to a piece of property.thus,the district court could not grant the
