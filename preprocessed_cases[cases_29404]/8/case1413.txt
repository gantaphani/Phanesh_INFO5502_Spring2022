plaintiff international strategies group,isg appeals from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut chatigny,granting defendant peter ness motion to dismiss as untimely isg complaint,which alleges breach of fiduciary duty,intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and conspiracy to commit those three offenses.isg claims arose from the loss of a million investment it made with ness employer,corporation of the bankhouse bankhouse.the district court ruled that tolling of the untimely claims,on the basis of ness continuing concealment,was unwarranted.we affirm on the ground that this lawsuit,commenced in april,arises from an injury suffered no later than june,and is therefore barred by the applicable statute of repose.
background 
we recount only the facts that bear upon the issues necessary to decide the appeal,and assume as we must that all plausible allegations in isg first amended complaint are true.where appropriate,we take judicial notice of filings from isg related lawsuits.see scherer equitable life assurance soc y of the,cir.
the defendant,peter ness,was the vice president of corporate finance at bankhouse,as well as an counsel and the head of the greenwich office.ness was one of a core group of senior executives for entities controlled by james pomeroy,ii.bankhouse,and several other entities,purported to offer a sophisticated investment opportunity but was in essence a ponzi scheme.
around april,pomeroy enticed isg to invest million with bankhouse by promising guaranteed profits of million every twelve days for three months with an express covenant that invested funds would not be depleted.although pomeroy assured isg that profits were accruing as expected,isg funds were soon depleted through various unauthorized transfers.
bankhouse prolonged the scheme by tantalizing isg with some or all of its notional profits in the form of a million promissory note.around october,ness and pomeroy proposed that isg forgo the payment by note and instead participate in another investment opportunity.isg knew nothing about this proposed investment but agreed nevertheless.bankhouse then transferred million of its clients money to a foreign entity,swan trust,which included any remnant of isg investment.
the funds that bankhouse transferred to swan trust were swiftly distributed unlawfully to bank accounts.bankhouse concealed the depletion from isg for a time in january,ness sent a memorandum informing chris barber,a managing director of isg,that funds invested with swan trust were expected to yield profits of to,which would be disbursed to bankhouse by the end of the month at some point prior to june,however,isg learned that swan trust had dissipated the funds.isg filings reflect an unimportant inconsistency on the timing 
the complaint alleges that bankhouse undertook or pretended to undertake efforts to recover the funds from swan trust,as a ploy to dissuade isg from bringing a claim.as part of the deception,isg cites two memoranda that ness to it in october the october memoranda,which optimistically described the recovery efforts conducted by bankhouse attorneys and its recovery specialists,but stressed the need for confidentiality.see pl.opp.to def.mot.to dis.exs.f,isg was lulled although the memoranda suggested an imminent recovery,isg waited for months while the recovery efforts unfolded.
approximately nine months later,isg and other investors accepted bankhouse suggestion to grant a power of attorney to bankhouse outside counsel,john pappalardo,to act on its behalf in the recovery efforts.efforts by pappalardo continued from mid through the fall of,during which time as isg alleges generally bankhouse and its employees and agents deceived isg by insisting that they were doing everything feasible to recover the funds and that independent action would interfere with bankhouse ability to recover on behalf of the investors.first am.compl.
on august,nearly two years after the october memoranda he,ness faxed a,handwritten note the august fax to chris barber of isg,in evident response to an inquiry by isg 
discussed your letter with jim pomeroy 
will get letter to you asap from me with john pappalardo ok or from john 
we are proceeding with first steps of litigation 
pl.opp.to def.mot.to dis.ex.isg claims that it first realized that the recovery efforts were futile or perhaps fictitious after the promises in this fax went unfulfilled.
after a few more months,isg hired its own counsel to recover its funds through litigation.several additional months later,on march,isg commenced a suit against bankhouse,pomeroy,and various other entities to recover its investment funds ness was not named a defendant or mentioned in the complaint.the defendants answered,but later ceased to defend.after more than two years of litigation,isg won a default judgment of over million in damages and penalties 
isg inability to collect on its judgment triggered additional lawsuits.this suit was filed on april,in the united states district court for the district of connecticut.three days later,a nearly identical suit was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against stephen heffernan,the chief financial officer of bankhouse,alleging among other claims the same six causes of action as alleged in this suit ness was not mentioned in the complaint.the suit against heffernan was dismissed as untimely 
while this suit against ness and the suit against heffernan were pending,isg began suing third parties involved in the transactions.in may and june,isg sued two banks involved in the transfers in september,isg sued pappalardo and his current and prior law firms,claiming malpractice in connection with the power of attorney it granted him pappalardo and the firms prevailed on summary judgment each claim was held either meritless because no relationship was formed or untimely 
after the other suits had concluded,the district court in this case granted ness motion to dismiss the action as untimely,ruling that the limitations period began to run by june and that tolling was unwarranted.

tort actions under connecticut law are with exceptions not relevant here subject to the statute of repose that begins with the date of the act or omission complained of,not the date when the plaintiff first discovers an injury.piteo gottier,internal quotation marks omitted see.barrett montesano,noting that.is among the statutes that the connecticut supreme court has referred to as statutes of limitations even though they technically function more like statutes of repose.
isg funds were unlawfully dissipated by june,the point by which isg concedes knowledge of the dissipation in the present complaint.see first am.compl.the present suit was filed on april,nearly four years later.isg argues that its claims are nevertheless timely,because ness actions amounted to a continuing course of conduct through august,thereby allowing it to commence its lawsuit at a later date.sherwood danbury,internal quotation marks omitted.
at the threshold,ness argues that a course of conduct can not toll the repose period beyond the plaintiff discovery of the injury.see,rosato mascardo.the cases he cites interpret a different statute of limitations,one that contains a separate limitation triggered when an injury is first sustained or discovered.however,at least one connecticut trial court has indicated that this proposition from rosato is nevertheless equally applicable to,and the knowledge of the injury may well deny a plaintiff with a claim subject to that provision the benefit of the continuous course of conduct doctrine.see coss stewart,civ.s,wl,at,aff.it is possible that the wording in rosato may s
