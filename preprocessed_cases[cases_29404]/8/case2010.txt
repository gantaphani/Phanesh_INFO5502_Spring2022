in april,appellant roy william harris filed a second petition for habeas corpus relief,alleging for the first time that counsel in his direct appeal had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to appeal two alleged sentencing errors.pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,b,this court declined to authorize consideration of that successive petition,and it was dismissed in july,harris asserted the ineffectiveness claim again,this time in a motion under.b to reopen his first habeas proceeding,on the more attenuated theory that his counsel in the first habeas proceeding had been ineffective because he failed to argue that counsel in his direct appeal had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to appeal the two alleged sentencing errors.rule b affords relief from a prior judgment for a variety of narrow reasons such as mistake or fraud,subsection for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.to justify this extraordinary relief,harris cited a declaration in which his former lawyer swore that his representation in the first habeas proceeding had been ineffective.
we ruled in rodriguez mitchell,cir,that relief under rule b is available with respect to a previous habeas proceeding only when the rule b motion attacks the integrity of the habeas proceeding and not the underlying criminal conviction.harris has cast his rule b motion as such an attack on the integrity of his initial habeas proceeding,although the ground cited by harris for reopening the first habeas proceeding would if valid require the habeas court to consider whether the sentencing judge committed reversible error.see mayo henderson,cir holding that an claim is only valid if the appellate error prejudiced the defendant.harris attack on the integrity of the habeas proceeding is thus a step on the road to the ultimate objective of invalidating the judgment of conviction.rodriguez,at.
in an exhaustive opinion that recognized the procedural intricacies of the case,the united states district court for the southern district of new york haight,ruled,on a variety of grounds,that harris attack on the integrity of his previous habeas proceeding lacked merit and therefore was procedurally barred as a second or successive habeas petition.harris united states,d.harris now appeals from this order pursuant to c.
on this appeal,we consider again how district courts should give effect to the protections of rule b with respect to previous habeas proceedings without allowing unsuccessful habeas petitioners to bypass the procedures of aedpa.in light of our holding in rodriguez,we reiterate that relief under rule b is available for a previous habeas proceeding only when the rule b motion attacks the integrity of the previous habeas proceeding rather than the underlying criminal conviction.guided by rodriguez,our rule b case law,and the congressional intent of aedpa,we hold that an attack on the integrity of a previous habeas proceeding using subsection of rule b is viable only in extraordinary circumstances,and that such circumstances will be particularly rare where the relief sought is predicated on the alleged failures of counsel in a prior habeas petition.that is because a habeas petitioner has no constitutional right to counsel in his habeas proceeding,see coleman thompson,d,and therefore,to be successful under rule b,must show more than ineffectiveness under strickland washington,d.to obtain relief under rule b,a habeas petitioner must show that his lawyer abandoned the case and prevented the client from being heard,either through counsel or pro se.we conclude that the failures of habeas counsel alleged in harris motion do not survive review under this standard and the motion therefore should have been denied with prejudice by the district court in accordance with our holdings in rodriguez,at,and gitten united states,cir.we reach no other issue 
background 
roy harris was chief executive officer and majority shareholder of the petroleum company known as the arochem corporation.represented at trial by an experienced member of new york criminal defense bar,harris was convicted in the southern district of new york in december on counts,including conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud in violation of,wire fraud in violation of,bank fraud in violation of,money laundering in violation of a,conducting a continuing financial crimes enterprise in violation of,and making a false statement on a loan application in violation of.
in,represented by another experienced criminal defense lawyer,harris moved for a new trial on grounds of constitutionally ineffective trial counsel and newly discovered evidence.after this motion was denied,counsel filed a letter memorandum raising a host of issues relating to sentencing,prompting,inter alia,the two rulings that are relevant to the current appeal.first,the court declined to group the money laundering and wire fraud counts of harris indictment under of the sentencing guidelines.second,the district court rejected the argument of harris counsel that imposing both i a severity increase under b a of the sentencing guidelines for more than minimal planning and ii a severity increase under a for being a leader or organizer in an activity involving five or more participants,was impermissible double counting.the district judge conceded that both sentencing decisions were debatable under the law of this circuit and would probably be grounds for appeal but harris appellate counsel attacked neither ruling in his direct appeal of harris prison sentence.we affirmed the conviction and sentence in united states harris,cir.
sometime in,even before harris sentence,friends put him in touch with john conway,a retired maritime lawyer.over the next several years,conway worked without compensation as harris legal advisor on civil litigation in which harris appeared pro se.after the conclusion of harris criminal which time harris apparently lacked personal resources to retain new criminal assisted harris by researching issues that might support a habeas corpus petition to vacate the conviction.conway lacked expertise in criminal law and claimed none he therefore tried without success to interest various defense lawyers in preparing harris petition.on march,conway filed a motion on harris behalf for a new trial under.and coupled this motion with a habeas petition under the district court rejected all the claims in may.harris united states,d,aff,cir,cert.denied,d.over the next three years,conway labored without compensation to vacate harris conviction.
sometime in,harris managed to retain present counsel with funds apparently supplied by friends.in april,two months after the supreme court denied conway petition for a writ of certiorari,see,harris new counsel filed a second habeas petition in april this time under.this second petition alleged that the lawyer who argued harris direct appeal to the second circuit was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to appeal the district court two disputed sentencing decisions.since harris was in prison in the district of new jersey,the petition was filed there.the district of new jersey was made aware of the previous habeas decision,construed the petition as a second petition under,and transferred it to this court for aedpa certification.applying aedpa,we denied harris permission to file a second habeas corpus petition in district court.
harris thereafter asked the southern district of new york to reopen his initial habeas corpus proceeding,pursuant to rule b.as grounds for relief,harris i repeated the claim originally made to the district of new jersey that the lawyer who argued his direct appeal had been constitutionally ineffective for failing to contest the two sentencing rulings,and ii alleged that conway admitted failure to raise the appellate ineffectiveness claim during the first habeas proceeding constituted ineffective habeas assistance that justified relief under subsection of rule b.the district court ruled that conway initial failure to raise the alleged constitutional ineffectiveness of harris appellate lawyer did not subvert the integrity of the previous habea
