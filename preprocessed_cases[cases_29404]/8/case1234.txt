discussion 
we have long made clear that i n deciding a pretrial motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction a district court has considerable procedural leeway.it may determine the motion on the basis of affidavits alone or it may permit discovery in aid of the motion or it may conduct an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the motion.marine midland bank,miller,cir citing cases.significantly,however,the showing a plaintiff must make to defeat a defendant claim that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it varies depending on the procedural posture of the litigation.ball metallurgie hoboken overpelt,cir.in ball,we explained this sliding scale as follows 
prior to discovery,a plaintiff challenged by a jurisdiction testing motion may defeat the motion by pleading in good faith,legally sufficient allegations of jurisdiction.at that preliminary stage,the plaintiff prima facie showing may be established solely by allegations.after discovery,the plaintiff prima facie showing,necessary to defeat a jurisdiction testing motion,must include an averment of facts that,if credited by the trier,would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.at that point,the prima facie showing must be factually supported.
where the jurisdictional issue is in dispute,the plaintiff averment of jurisdictional facts will normally be met in one of three ways by a rule b motion,which assumes the truth of the plaintiff factual allegations for purposes of the motion and challenges their sufficiency,by a rule motion,which asserts that there are undisputed facts demonstrating the absence of jurisdiction,or by a request for an adjudication of disputed jurisdictional facts,either at a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction or in the course of trial on the merits.if the defendant is content to challenge only the sufficiency of the plaintiff factual allegation,in effect demurring by filing a rule b motion,the plaintiff need persuade the court only that its factual allegations constitute a prima facie showing of jurisdiction.if the defendant asserts in a rule motion that undisputed facts show the absence of jurisdiction,the court proceeds,as with any summary judgment motion,to determine if undisputed facts exist that warrant the relief sought.if the defendant contests the plaintiff factual allegations,then a hearing is required,at which the plaintiff must prove the existence of jurisdiction by a p
