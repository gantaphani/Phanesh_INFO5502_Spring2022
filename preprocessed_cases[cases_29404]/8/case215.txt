wanda cordero suárez appeals a district judge grant of summary judgment in favor of three defendants,each of whom she claims had some hand in discriminating against her at work because of her political affiliation.although some of cordero allegations are unsettling,we nevertheless hold that summary judgment was appropriate because cordero suit was untimely.we therefore affirm.
because this is an appeal from a grant,we sketch the facts as they appear on the record,viewed in the light most favorable to cordero.see galera johanns,cir.in,wanda cordero began working as an agent in the internal revenue division of the puerto rico treasury department.for some years her supervisor was orlando rodríguez,whose brother was the mayor of mayagüez,puerto rico,and head of the popular democratic party pdp city office.politically,cordero affiliates herself with the new progressive party npp,while rodríguez affiliates himself with the pdp.cordero says that on many occasions rodríguez made disparaging comments about the npp within her earshot she also claims that rodríguez took many subtle steps to inconvenience her,such as repeatedly changing her schedule and falsely claiming that she left early so he could deduct ten minutes of pay from her check.
but more important are some specific instances of misconduct cordero describes.for example,in february rodríguez physically and verbally assaulted her in an incident neither party details but that apparently resulted in rodríguez filing a complaint to the municipal police where his brother,who is the mayor,is the chief.then on february,rodríguez approached cordero desk with his gun in front of him.he said i going to screw you up,and cordero,crying,fled to a restroom.she reported the incident to internal affairs,to fabián,but nothing ever came of her report.sometime later in,rodríguez came into cordero office and said that he could give a fuck about the npp winning an upcoming election because his brother would still be the mayor and he could continue doing whatever the fuck he wanted.
a serious scheduling incident also occurred in late.on december,rodríguez told cordero that she had to cover a coworker shifts from december.then on december,rodríguez issued a memo instructing cordero to work on sunday,december in addition to covering her coworker shift.within the next couple days,cordero told rodríguez that she was sick and could not work on the or.then on december,rodríguez issued another memo instructing cordero to work on sunday,december too.cordero claims that she never received the memo though there is some evidence to the contrary and thus did not show up for work that day.
at some point during all of these incidents,cordero requested that the department transfer her to a different office.in february,deputy secretary of human resources josé fas acquiesced and transferred cordero from the bureau of alcoholic beverages and licenses to the bureau of taxpayer services,where she remained part of the treasury department but rodríguez was no longer her supervisor.but even the transfer could not keep rodríguez away from cordero he continued to visit her new office and harass her.
in may cordero met with fas and with one fabián serrano apparently a treasury department separately to complain about rodríguez continued harassment,but both said they could not help the record is silent as to their reasons.fas then sent cordero a letter at her new office on july,stating that she would be suspended for thirty days because she had missed the shifts on december,and,the ones that rodríguez had assigned her,allegedly at the eleventh hour and without adequate notice.after internally appealing the decision,cordero received another letter from fas on november,one day after the npp won a big election stating that her suspension would proceed.
finally,after cordero returned from her suspension,rodríguez approached her at her new office and again informed her that he did not care about the npp having won the recent general election because his brother still retained power in mayagüez.he also added according to cordero that he would not rest until cordero was permanently dismissed from the treasury department.
on june,cordero filed a complaint asserting several federal and claims against rodríguez,serrano,and fas in their personal and official capacities,and against former treasury secretary angel ortiz garcia and current treasury secretary juan carlos puig as well.a motion to dismiss whittled the defendants down to rodríguez,serrano,and fas in their personal capacities only,and the complaint down to claims seeking injunctive and monetary relief under.
after discovery,the remaining defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.they said the incidents cordero complained of had all occurred more than a year before she filed her complaint,and they therefore argued that the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.see santana castro toledo dávila,cir.they also argued that,if these incidents were excluded on timeliness grounds,the only possible adverse employment action supported by the record was cordero suspension for skipping work,which would have been imposed regardless of her political affiliation.cordero responded with an objection and memorandum opposing summary judgment on the ground that incidents had still been ongoing in the year before her complaint filing these ongoing incidents,she argued,rendered the older incidents actionable under the continuing violation doctrine.and along with her objection,cordero filed a sworn statement bolstering her evidence of the defendants misconduct.the district judge refused to consider the sworn statement he called it and incongruent with her deposition testimony he nevertheless found cordero claim timely on grounds,but in the end he granted summary judgment on the merits anyway and dismissed the case,primarily on the ground that the workplace incidents cordero described were not sufficiently severe and pervasive.
cordero appeals the district judge exclusion of her sworn statement and his grant of summary judgment.because we would affirm summary judgment even with the sworn statement as part of the record,we bypass that issue and proceed to summary judgment.
this case presents questions involving both the timeliness and the merits of cordero claim.normally we would begin with timeliness,because if cordero claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations then we have no occasion to reach the merits.but in the case of an alleged continuing violation constituting a hostile work environment,the question of timeliness is closely intertwined with the substance of the claim.see city of providence,cir.we therefore address the two issues together.and because they arise in the context of summary judgment,both the and issues receive de novo review see rosario of army,cir hostile work environment montalvo gonzalez amparo,cir statute of limitations.
we begin our analysis with the framework,which finds its roots in the first amendment protections.to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination,a plaintiff must be able to show the plaintiff and the defendant belong to opposing political affiliations the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff affiliation a challenged employment action occurred and political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind it.peguero moronta santiago,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if a plaintiff makes this showing,the burden shifts to the defendant to point out evidence that it would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiff political affiliation.rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir.
applying this framework,cordero says that elements one and two above are easily satisfied.she goes on to say that in deeming her complaint timely on grounds the court necessarily determined that she had suffered a hostile work environment,which would satisfy the third element an adverse employment action.see martinez vélez rey hernández,cir.the fourth element depends on cordero satisfaction of the third.the defendants,too,focus on the third element and counter that their conduct was not severe and
