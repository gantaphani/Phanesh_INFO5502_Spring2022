plaintiffs in this class action were policyholders of metropolitan life insurance company when it was a mutual insurance company.they complain that they were misled and shortchanged in the transaction by which the company demutualized in.nine years after the action was commenced and five weeks before trial was scheduled to begin,plaintiffs moved to disqualify the lead counsel for metropolitan life insurance company and metlife,metlife,debevoise plimpton llp debevoise.the grounds alleged related to that firm representation of metlife in the underlying demutualization.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,granted the motion to disqualify on september the district court then stayed its order and immediately certified the issue to this court pursuant to b.we accepted the certification on september,and on september we heard oral argument.after time allotted for additional briefing,a short delay caused by the recusal of two judges,and the observance of national and religious holidays,we reversed the disqualification by order dated september,with opinion to follow.this is that opinion.
the district court disqualified debevoise on the ground that its representation of metlife in the demutualization made it counsel to the policyholders as well.on appeal,plaintiffs urge affirmance on that ground,and also on the independent ground that the rule requires disqualification because four debevoise lawyers who worked on the demutualization will give testimony adverse to metlife at trial.
we conclude that i debevoise did not have an relationship with the policyholders by virtue of its representation of metlife and ii plaintiffs have failed to establish that the purported violation of the rule in this case would warrant disqualification.accordingly,we reverse.
in,metlife converted from a stock life insurance company to a mutual insurance company.on april,metlife completed a process of demutualization back to a stock insurance company.debevoise served as metlife corporate counsel in that transaction.
on april,plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit in the eastern district of new york,alleging that metlife violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting or altogether omitting certain information from the materials provided to its policyholders during the demutualization process.in june,metlife invoked the privilege to prevent plaintiffs discovery of particular communications between metlife and its and outside counsel.the district court denied a protective order on the ground that the plaintiff policyholders were the owners of the mutual company and were therefore clients of debevoise during the demutualization.
following discovery and the usual preliminaries,the trial was set to begin on september.when settlement negotiations failed,plaintiffs moved to disqualify debevoise on july,than nine years after the action was commenced,more than two years after the court ruled that plaintiffs were clients of debevoise,and five weeks before trial.plaintiffs argued that disqualification was appropriate for the same reason articulated by the district court to support its discovery ruling debevoise had been counsel to plaintiffs in the demutualization and can not now jump sides to become adverse to plaintiffs at trial.plaintiffs also argued that disqualification was required by the rule,because four debevoise lawyers are scheduled to testify about disclosures and documents related to the demutualization.
metlife response invoked the doctrine of laches argued that as a matter of law the policyholders of a mutual insurance company are not a priori the clients of that company corporate counsel denied that the testimony of the debevoise lawyers would be adverse to metlife or even significant and charged that the motion was made for improper tactical purposes.
on september,the district court granted plaintiffs motion and disqualified debevoise.the following colloquy explains the court decision 
metlife b ut debevoise represents in this litigation metlife and metropolitan life insurance company,and not the shareholders of metlife.
the court i understand that and that the result of the demutualization process,and i fully understand that.but the problem is whether your representation of the policyholders which turned into a representation of the corporation is tainted because of a conflict.
metlife and your honor is aware that our position is that debevoise plimpton never represented the policyholders of metropolitan life insurance company before this litigation began or presently.
the court you did represent the policyholders,because there were the corporation.that the problem.the problem was that all of the former or the policyholders were the owners of the corporation.so you represented them and the track if you will because there was were your clients.
having granted the motion,the court immediately stayed its order and certified the following question to this court should debevoise plimpton be disqualified from representing metlife in this case based on a conflict of interest we accepted certification and now reverse.
plaintiffs argue that the district court discovery ruling that plaintiffs are clients of debevoise is now law of the case,which we lack jurisdiction to review.we conclude,first,that we have jurisdiction to consider the question and second,that under new york law,the policyholders of a mutual insurance company are not the clients of that company outside counsel.new york law is applicable to this case because metropolitan life insurance company was a mutual life insurance company that was reorganized into a stock insurance company under new york law,with its principal place of business in new york,doing business in all fifty states.
under b,a district court can certify a question for interlocutory appeal if the issue involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and if an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.in ruling on a certified question of law,we have the discretion to entertain an appeal of another ruling of the district court if the two rulings were inextricably intertwined or if review of the latter decision was necessary to ensure meaningful review of the former.ross am.express,cir quoting in re methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe prods.liab,cir quoting swint chambers county comm n,d see also golino new haven,cir w here we have jurisdiction to consider some questions on appeal,we may exercise our discretion to take pendent jurisdiction over related questions.
the district court and decisions are clearly related.in,the court determined that prior to demutualization,metlife policyholders were the clients for metlife and outside counsel,because they were metlife beneficiaries and the beneficiaries of metlife counsel advice.in re metlife demutualization,d.the ruling explained similarly that the problem,and debevoise problem,is they represented the policyholders up until the day on the closing when they walked over across the aisle and started representing the stockholders,if you will,and the corporation more exactly because these two rulings are inextricably intertwined,we have jurisdiction to decide whether plaintiffs were,in fact,clients of debevoise.
we conclude that plaintiffs were not clients of debevoise.it is that outside counsel to a corporation represents the corporation,not its shareholders or other constituents.evans artek,cir a corporate attorney whether an lawyer or a law firm that serves as counsel to the a duty to act in accordance with the interests of the corporate entity itself.the client is the corporation.this rule is entirely consonant with rule of the new york rules of professional conduct,prof l conduct a a lawyer employed or retained by an organization is the lawyer for the organization and not for any of the constituents,and with the restatement third of the rule governing lawyers,cmt.b explaining that a lawyer retained by a corporation has an relationship with the corporation,but the lawyer does not thereby also form a relationship with all or any individuals employed by
