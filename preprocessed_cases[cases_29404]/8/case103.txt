rule is separated into six subsections,each of which describes a particular basis for relief from judgment.ungar,at.giroux seeks relief under three of these subsections,which are described in more detail herein.
under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,a court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding.b.giroux contends that the district court erred in failing to provide an explanation for denying her rule motion.she relies on this court decision in ungar in support of her argument that the district court was required to provide reasoning for its decision.but ungar is inapposite ungar concerned whether there is a categorical rule that a party whose strategic choices lead to the entry of a default judgment is precluded as a matter of law from later obtaining relief under rule and had nothing to do with the absence of a written decision.at.indeed,the ungar court stated that there is no ironclad rule requiring an,analysis in every case.id.at.moreover,this court does not require that a district court provide an explanation when denying rule motions and has affirmed summary denials of these motions.see,ofori ruby tuesday,app x,cir affirming summary denial of rule b motion where e ach of the arguments presented was previously presented to and fully considered by the district court stokes merson,app x,cir the summary denial of relief under rule b was not an abuse of discretion.lepore vidockler,cir affirming summary disposition of rule b motion.further,a review of the record reveals that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that giroux claim lacked merit,even if it declined to offer a rationale.see lepore,at there was ample support for the result reached by the district court,and although an opinion explaining the court rationale is always welcome,the absence of an opinion gives us no pause in this case.
rule b provides relief for litigants who present newly discovered evidence that,with reasonable diligence,could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b.in her rule motion,giroux explains that paragraph of her mortgage requires that a lender provide notice containing certain information to the borrower before proceeding with foreclosure,and that,after the district court issued its order dismissing the case,giroux received a letter from bank of america attorney stating that bank of america was unable to locate the paragraph notice.but giroux was aware that the paragraph notice was missing when this case was pending before the merrimack superior court.indeed,in her rule motion,giroux asserted that she had received a letter from fannie mae foreclosure counsel in december stating that w e do not have a copy of the notice at this time and that she submitted an affidavit to the merrimack superior court averring that she did not recall receiving the notice.further evidence corroborating these allegations does not warrant relief under rule b.see morón barradas dep t of educ.of the commonwealth of,cir finding that new evidence which at best is merely cumulative of previously submitted materials does not satisfy rule b steel dematteo constr,cir a party is entitled to relief,under rule b,where the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching.
a party may seek relief under rule b where a litigant can demonstrate fraud whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an opposing party.b.giroux alleges that the mere fact that the defendants intended to proceed with the foreclosure absent the requisite paragraph notice evinces that the foreclosure is fraudulent and illegal.to satisfy rule b,giroux must demonstrate misconduct such as fraud or misrepresentation by clear and convincing evidence and show that the misconduct foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of her case.karak,at quoting anderson cryovac,cir.not only do giroux conclusory allegations fall far short of clear and convincing evidence,she does not assert that this allegedly fraudulent act affected or was in any way related to litigation of her action.see roger edwards,llc fiddes son,cir noting that rule b is concerned with instances of fraud.
rule b is a provision that authorizes the district court to grant relief from judgment for any other reason that justifies relief.ungar,at quoting.b.the high threshold required by rule b reflects the need to balance finality of judgments with the need to examine possible flaws in the judgments.bouret echevarría,at.in her rule motion,giroux analogizes to this court refusal,in ungar,to impose a bar to rule b relief for certain default judgments.she contends that ungar required the district court to analyze her action on a discretionary basis rather than categorically barring it on res judicata grounds.but,by its terms,the reasoning in ungar was limited to instances of willful defa
