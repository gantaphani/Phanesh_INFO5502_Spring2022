these appeals,heard in tandem,challenge two separate judgments entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york castel,and sullivan,in favor of td bank,td bank and capital one bank,capital one,respectively,dismissing plaintiffs claims that the banks violated article of the new york civil practice law and rules cplr,as amended by the exempt income protection act eipa,laws ch.codified as amended at cplr,a,and,and new york common law.
in both cases,the plaintiff judgment debtors maintained accounts with the defendant banks.the banks notified plaintiffs that their accounts were frozen pursuant to restraints served by creditors.plaintiffs allege,however,that the banks failed to provide them with certain required notices and forms,restrained their accounts,and assessed them fees,all in violation of eipa.
the district courts dismissed the complaints pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,concluding that judgment debtors do not have a private right of action against their banks for the banks violations of eipa procedural requirements.see cruz td bank,d martinez capital one,d.
these appeals present unresolved questions of new york law 
first,whether judgment debtors have a private right of action for money damages and injunctive relief against banks that violate eipa procedural requirements and 
second,whether judgment debtors can seek money damages and injunctive relief against banks that violate eipa in special proceedings prescribed by article of the cplr and,if so,whether those special proceedings are the exclusive mechanism for such relief or whether judgment debtors may also seek relief in a plenary action.
because these unresolved questions implicate significant new york state interests and are determinative of these appeals,we reserve decision and certify them to the new york state court of appeals.
background 
for purposes of these appeals,we assume the facts alleged in the complaints to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.see mortimer off shore,fed.of,cir.
cplr article and eipa 
cplr article governs the enforcement and collection of money judgments in new york state courts.see cplr.in,the new york state legislature amended article by enacting eipa,which created a procedure for the execution of money judgments such that judgment debtors would retain access to certain exempt funds deposited in their bank accounts.these exempt funds included,for example,a certain minimum amount regardless of the source,as well as a minimum amount received from social security benefits,public assistance,unemployment insurance,and pensions.see state senate introducer mem.in,bill no,at hereinafter sponsors memo the stated purpose of eipa was to protect a baseline amount of every person income t o ensure that money judgments do not render working new yorkers unable to care for their or their families most basic needs.id.at.
as relevant to these cases,eipa prohibits the restraint of a minimum amount of funds in a judgment debtor account,regardless of the source of the funds.see cplr i further,pursuant to eipa new procedures,judgment debtors must be notified of the available exemptions and how to claim them.accordingly,to restrain a debtor bank account,a judgment creditor must serve the debtor bank with two copies of the restraining notice,an exemption notice,and two exemption claim forms,in a prescribed format.cplr a b.if the creditor fails to serve these notices and forms on the bank,the bank can not restrain the debtor account and any restraint on the account is void.id.
eipa also requires the debtor bank to serve the notices and forms on the debtor within two days after receiving them from the creditor.id.a b.banks are prohibited from charging fees to debtors whose accounts are exempt from restraint or restrained in violation of eipa.id.j.nevertheless,under cplr a b,t he inadvertent failure by a depository institution to provide the notice required by this subdivision shall not give rise to liability on the part of the depository institution.id.a b.
article prescribes certain procedures to resolve disputes that arise in connection with the enforcement and collection of money judgments.cplr,entitled p roceeding to determine adverse claims,provides 
prior to the application of property or debt by a sheriff or receiver to the satisfaction of a judgment,any interested person may commence a special proceeding against the judgment creditor or other person with whom a dispute exists to determine rights in the property or debt.
id.the presiding court may vacate the execution or order,void the levy,direct the disposition of the property or debt,or direct that damages be awarded.id.in addition,cplr empowers a court at any time,on its own initiative or the motion of any interested person,to make an order denying,limiting,conditioning,regulating,extending or modifying the use of any enforcement procedure.id.the new york state court of appeals has explained that cplr grants the courts broad discretionary power to control and regulate the enforcement of a money judgment under article to prevent unreasonable annoyance,expense,embarrassment,disadvantage,or other prejudice to any person or the courts.guardian loan early,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,cplr a h,entitled r ights of judgment debtor,provides that n othing in this section shall in any way restrict the rights and remedies otherwise available to a judgment debtor,including but not limited to,rights to property exemptions under federal and state law.cplr a h.
