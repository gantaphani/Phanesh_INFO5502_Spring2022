on october,jos√© batiz chamorro batiz invoked federal question jurisdiction,and brought an employment discrimination action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico against puerto rican cars,the hertz corporation hertz.given the posture of this appeal,the details of the underlying dispute between batiz and hertz need not concern us.what matters is that a little over two years after suit had been started,the district court dismissed the case with prejudice for want of prosecution and failure to comply with the court orders.batiz appeals.we affirm.
the travel of the case is illuminating.after receiving an extension,hertz filed its answer on december.in february of,batiz initiated a request for production of documents.see.the parties exchanged some desultory communications about this request,but could not achieve consensus.in an attempt to bring matters to a head,hertz moved for a protective order on grounds that the document request intruded upon periods and sought irrelevant materials.batiz did not oppose this motion,and only a few uncontroversial documents were produced batiz made no further efforts at discovery,and the case stalled.
on october,the district court noted batiz apparent lack of interest in pressing forward and ordered him to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for want of prosecution.batiz received an extension of time within which to reply and thereafter filed a response in which he explained what steps he had taken to prosecute the action,pledged to avoid further delays,and beseeched the court for an opportunity to continue the pursuit of his claims.the district court did not press the order,but,rather,scheduled a status conference for december,at which time the parties were instructed to inform the court no later than february,about how they intended to proceed with the diligent prosecution of the action.batiz ignored this order.hertz complied with it,listing various depositions that had been taken following the status conference,describing the parties informal agreement to stay further discovery until april,and limning its future plans including its intention to move for summary judgment.
between may and september of,the parties engaged in limited discovery,hertz unsuccessfully requested the production of documents and deposition transcripts,and batiz eventually made a second request for production of documents.these maneuverings generated no docket activity.apparently dismayed both by the lack of activity and by batiz failure to file the mandated progress report,the district court invoked rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and dismissed the case with prejudice by order dated october.the clerk entered the order on the docket on october,and batiz filed a timely motion to alter or amend.see.e.hertz opposed the motion.on november,the district court summarily denied reconsideration.this appeal ensued.
before we can address the merits of the appeal,we first must dispel a procedural miasma created by poor draftsmanship.as a general rule,a notice of appeal must specify the orders and judgments that the appellant intends to contest.see fed.c c.the notice of appeal in this case targets only the order denying reconsideration to the exclusion of the order dismissing the action.this raises the question of whether the notice,as drafted,confers jurisdiction upon this court to review the original order of dismissal.
hertz batiz has forfeited any right to have this court review the district court original not entirely without force.the pendency of a timely rule e motion tolls the running of the appeal period from the original judgment.see fed.a.e.nevertheless,an appeal from an order denying such a motion is generally not considered to be an appeal from the underlying judgment,cir.
the holding in does not mean,however,that an appellate court invariably is bound to read the notice of appeal literally.such formalism is not obligatory instead,our precedents encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and examine them in the context of the record as a whole.see,kotler am.tobacco,cir.that function proceeds with a recognition that the core purpose of a notice of appeal is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.foman davis,d.in light of these principles,it is not surprising that courts faced with poorly drafted notices of appeal occasionally have been known to rescue the technically defaulted portion of an appeal,town of norwood new eng.power,cir.we caution,however,that such rescue missions are not automatic,and litigants will do well to draft notices of appeal with care.
against this backdrop,we inspect batiz notice of appeal.notwithstanding its focus on the order denying reconsideration,the text of the notice mentions the original judgment and notes that s aid judgment dismissed the action on the ground of want of prosecution.read in context,this reference is consistent with a desire to have this court review the propriety of the original dismissal for want of prosecution.the fact that batiz,in his appellate briefs,presents exactly the same arguments as to the original order of dismissal and as to the denial of his subsequent motion for reconsideration provides further justification for ascribing to him an intent to seek review of both orders.see town of norwood,at.finally,both sides have fully briefed the merits,and undertaking appellate review of the original order of dismissal would not unfairly prejudice hertz.kelly united states,cir explaining that an appellee who is not misled by a misstatement in a notice of appeal is,by definition,not prejudiced by it.we conclude,therefore,that the notice of appeal,while carelessly drafted,provides a sufficient foundation for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the original order of dismissal.see foman,at.in re san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir leblanc great am.ins,cir.
having resolved the jurisdictional question,we turn to the two disputed orders.we begin our analysis with bedrock the effective administration of justice requires that trial courts possess the capability to manage their own affairs.chambers nasco,d.the authority to order dismissal in appropriate cases is a necessary component of that capability.see link wabash,d.moreover,the inherent power of trial courts to dismiss cases for want of prosecution or disregard of judicial orders is reinforced and augmented by rule b.see hmg prop.investors,parque indus.rio canas,cir.
it is that courts can not function if litigants may,with impunity,disobey lawful orders.hmg prop.investors,at.for that reason,courts must be given considerable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to punish laggardly or noncompliant litigants.it follows logically that the trier determination to dismiss a case for such reasons should be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.aoude mobil oil,cir.
even so,dismissal with prejudice is a severe sanction.to ensure against arbitrariness,a reviewing court must balance the trial court authority to impose such a sanction against the obvious policy considerations that favor disposition of cases on the merits.see zavala santiago gonzalez rivera,cir richman motors,cir.this is an balancing test,hmg prop.investors,at,conducted with due respect for the trial court knowledge of the nuances of the case and the sometimes recondite agendas of the parties.
in enlace mercantil internacional,senior industries,cir,we said that the sanction of dismissal for want of prosecution is appropriate only when the plaintiff misconduct has been extreme.for this purpose,however,extreme misconduct comes in many shapes and forms,ranging from protracted to defiance of court orders to ignoring warnings to other aggravating circumstances.cosme nieves deshler,cir.a classic form of aggravating circumstance is a wasteful expenditure of the court time.enlace,at.
in this instance,the district court dismissed the case because batiz,after being suitably court earlier had issued a order that specifically mentioned the possibility of flouted the court direct order to furnish a progress report.in the district court view,this stonewalling not only exhibited a disregard for the court time a
