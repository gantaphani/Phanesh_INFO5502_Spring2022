three legal prescriptions figure in this case.title gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states,and its core application is to rulings that terminate an action.federal rule of civil procedure b permits district courts to authorize immediate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising multiple claims.and authorizes the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml to transfer civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in order to promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions,a.
the london interbank offered rate libor is a reference point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the united states and globally.the jpml established a multidistrict litigation libor mdl for cases involving allegations that understated their borrowing costs,thereby depressing libor and enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors.over actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the district court for the southern district of new york,including a class action filed by petitioners ellen gelboim and linda zacher,who raised the single claim that several banks,acting in concert,had violated federal antitrust law.determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury,the district court granted the banks motion to dismiss all antitrust claims,including the complaint sole claim.the district court thus dismissed the complaint,denied leave to amend,and dismissed the case in its entirety.other cases made part of the libor mdl,however,presented discrete claims which remained before the district court.assuming that the plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under,the district court granted rule b certifications authorizing the plaintiffs in some of the actions to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pending in the district court.on its own initiative,the second circuit dismissed the appeal because the order appealed from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action.the district court thereafter withdrew its rule b certifications.
held the order dismissing their case in its entirety removed gelboim and zacher from the consolidated proceeding,thereby triggering their right to appeal under.
because cases consolidated for mdl pretrial proceedings ordinarily retain their separate identities,an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qualify under as an appealable final decision.section refers to individual actions transferrable to a single district court,not to a monolithic multidistrict action created by transfer.see lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach.and a language at or before the conclusion of pretrial proceedings,each transferred action must be remanded to the originating district unless the action shall have been previously terminated indicates congress anticipation that,during the pendency of pretrial proceedings,final decisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated pursuant to.the district court order dismissing the complaint was a final decision.the district court completed its adjudication of petitioners complaint and terminated their action.petitioners thus are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings.nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil action with other libor mdl cases renders the dismissal of their complaint tentative or incomplete.
to hold,as the banks contend,that no appeal of right accrues until a consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like gelboim and zacher in a quandary about the event that triggers the period for taking an appeal.the sensible solution to the trigger is to allow an immediate appeal in a case such as this,where the transferee court in an mdl grants a defendant dispositive motion on every claim or the sole claim in a transferred case.the banks are also concerned about allowing plaintiffs with the weakest cases to appeal because their complaint states only one claim,while leaving those with stronger cases unable to appeal simultaneously because they have other pending claims.but that concern is attended to by rule b,which authorizes district courts to grant certifications to parties with complaints,thereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate review of discrete claims.the district court did that in this very case.rule b,however,is of no avail to gelboim and zacher,who asserted only one claim.see sears,roebuck mackey.section b which allows district courts to designate for review certain interlocutory orders is also inapposite here,for there is nothing interlocutory about the dismissal order in the action.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
an unsuccessful litigant in a federal district court may take an appeal,as a matter of right,from a final decisio n of the district cour t.the question here presented is the right to appeal secured by affected when a case is consolidated for pretrial proceedings in multidistrict litigation or mdl authorized by 
petitioners ellen gelboim and linda zacher filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york a complaint raising a single claim.they alleged that a number of banks,acting in concert,had violated federal antitrust law.their case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings together with some other cases,commenced in different districts,raising one or more common questions of fact,a.
the defendant banks,respondents here,moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had suffered no antitrust injury.the district court granted the motion,denied leave to amend the complaint,and dismissed the case in its entirety.other cases made part of the multidistrict pretrial proceedings,however,presented discrete claims and remained before the district court.
the court of appeals for the second circuit,acting on its own motion,dismissed the appeal filed by gelboim and zacher for want of appellate jurisdiction.we reverse the second circuit judgment and hold that the complaint retained its independent status for purposes of appellate jurisdiction under.petitioners right to appeal ripened when the district court dismissed their case,not upon eventual completion of multidistrict proceedings in all of the consolidated cases.
