for the third time before this court,transcontinental gas pipe line corporation transco challenges the decision by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to deny transco proposal for implementing a firm to the wellhead ftw rate structure on its natural gas pipeline when we remanded this case for a second time,we instructed ferc to reconcile two arguably inconsistent orders issued in response to transco rate structure proposals.while ferc new variations on its theme have not rendered this already convoluted proceeding any less opaque perhaps an understandable result of multiple remands,a consistent principle can still be discerned prices may be increased,terms may be altered,but contracts may not be unilaterally amended to effectively add new service.accordingly,we hold ferc did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in its previous orders.we therefore deny the petitions for review.
transco operates a natural gas pipeline that stretches northeastward from production areas in the gulf of mexico,terminating in the new york city area.the pipeline is divided into six zones,three in the upstream production area near the gulf coast and three in the downstream market area.in the production area zones,the pipeline system consists of both supply lateral lines and a mainline the supply laterals transport gas from the gathering areas to the mainline,where the gas is collected at pooling points.until the,transco and other pipeline companies acted primarily as gas merchants,transporting their own gas and selling it to distributors.beginning in,pipelines were required to start offering customers the ability to transform their entitlements to sales of gas into service this allowed the customers to purchase gas from the pipelines competitors while still being able to transport it.order,issued by ferc in,completed this process by requiring pipelines to unbundle transportation service from sales of gas customers would have equal access to firm transportation ft service that is,guaranteed capacity regardless of whether they purchased gas from the pipeline or another company,a change intended to foster competition in the industry.pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation and regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol,order,on reh g,order,on reh g,reh g denied,aff in part,united distrib.ferc.
order also required companies to use a straight fixed variable pricing system for ft service.id.at.under such a system,pipeline companies would charge a rate an initial reservation charge to guarantee that capacity would be available,plus a usage charge based on the volume of gas actually transported.see.in an effort to increase competition and improve transparency in pricing,ferc required pipelines to recover the fixed costs of ft service through the reservation charge rather than through the volumetric charge.order at.
finally,order implemented a flexible receipt and delivery point policy under which any customer who paid a reservation charge for shipping gas within a zone had to be granted secondary rights to deliver or receive gas at points in that zone other than the primary points specified in the customer contract.id.at.when a customer used these secondary rights,shipping capacity would not be guaranteed the rights would carry a lower scheduling priority than ft service purchased by customers with primary rights at the same points.order at.at the same time,the secondary rights would have higher scheduling priority than a third category of service,interruptible transportation it service,which does not entitle a customer to any guaranteed capacity.order at.as higher priority service can take precedence over it service,no reservation charge applies to it service hence,a rate based on the volume of gas actually transported by the customer is charged for it service.
most pipeline companies responded to order by offering firm to the wellhead ftw service,charging their customers rates for transporting gas on both the supply laterals and the mainline.transco,however,had already unbundled its service a year earlier,in,through settlement agreements with its customers.transcon.gas pipe line,on reh g,on reh g,aff in part,elizabethtown gas ferc,on remand,reh g denied.pursuant to these settlements,transco charges ft rates for transporting gas on the mainline customers who switched to this service were termed shippers.on the supply laterals,though,transco adopted an it rate structure,charging a rate based on the volume actually transported with no separate reservation charge.transco does not sell any ft service on the supply laterals when it shippers deliver gas to shippers at receipt points on the mainline,their service on the laterals is given a higher priority priority than regular it service.
in calculating the reservation charge shippers have to pay for service in a zone,transco divides the fixed costs to be recovered,those fixed costs allocated to that zone by the total amount of transportation service projected for that zone,including both ft and it service.the resulting figure determines both the reservation charge for ft service and the,charge for thus,the more it service shippers demand in a zone,the lower an ft shipper reservation charge will be for that zone.
for reasons that have never been made clear,transco service was not purchased by the shippers but rather by natural gas suppliers including the petitioners,indicated shippers who used the service to transport their gas to the pooling points on the mainline once the gas arrived at the mainline,it would be transported by the ft shippers who purchased the gas from the producers.eventually,indicated shippers became dissatisfied with this arrangement.they had to pay approximately million per year in transportation costs on the supply laterals producers who used other pipelines did not incur this expense,as their customers subscribed to ftw service that included transportation on both the supply laterals and the mainlines.still,the indicated shippers believed they could not always pass these costs on to their customers,as they needed to make their rates appear competitive with rates charged by producers serving other pipelines.

ferc rejected this proposal because the changes modified transco contracts with its shippers.at.on appeal,we queried whether the proposed changes would be acceptable under the framework established by the supreme court.exxon ferc.under the doctrine,ferc may modify a contract rate provision if but only if the public interest so requires.id.at discussing united gas pipe line mobile gas serv,and fed.power comm sierra pac.power.however,united gas pipe line memphis light,gas water division,d,allows pipeline companies to change their rates if their contracts contain clauses now known as memphis clauses reserving the right to do so.exxon,at.we remanded the case for ferc to explain why the alleged changes to transco contracts would not be permitted under the contracts memphis clauses.
on remand,ferc acknowledged that the memphis clauses anticipated changes to the rates,terms,and conditions of contractual service but concluded the same clauses did not allow transco to force customers to accept additional service.transcon.gas pipe line,at,on reh g.if transco ftw proposal were accepted,ferc reasoned,the ft shippers would be required to pay for service on the supply laterals,although they had not contracted for this service.on appeal from that remand,we again remanded the case to ferc for further explanation.exxon mobil ferc,exxon mobil i.we found ferc arguments to be plausible but detected within those arguments a possible conflict with an earlier ferc order,issued in,where ferc rejected transco proposal to implement a firm transportation supply lateral ftsl rate structure.transcon.gas pipe line,reh g denied.in the proposal,transco sought to replace its service on the supply laterals with uninterruptible ftsl service transco would charge a rate a reservation charge and a volumetric charge for use of the laterals rather than the rate currently in place for it service.at.the maximum rate charged for ftsl service on the supply laterals in a zone would be the same as the maximum rate charged for ft service on the mainline in that zone.id.at.however,within each zone,shippers purchasing ftsl capacity would only have flexible access to secondary points on the supply laterals not the mainline,and shippers would only have flexible access to secondary points on the mainline not the supply laterals.id.ferc objected to this plan because both sets of shippers would pay the full reservation charge for service in a zone thus,under order,both should receive flexible access to secondary points throughout the zone.id.at.
in exxon mobil i,we spotted a possible inconsistency in denying the ftsl proposal,ferc appeared to indicate that if transco eliminated its service,then the shippers would be entitled to flexible access to the supply laterals without a contract change however,in rejecting the ftw proposal,ferc had concluded that providing flexible access to the supply laterals would abrogate the contracts of shippers.exxon mobil i,at.this apparent contradiction led to our second remand.

ferc frames much of its argument in terms of the distinction between primary and secondary rights,stating that while secondary access rights could be given to a shipper without requiring contract modification,forcing a shipper to receive and pay for additional primary service would impermissibly modify the shipper contract.at.because transco ftw proposal granted primary rights on the supply laterals to shippers,ferc concluded the ftw proposal would require the shippers contracts to be modified.id.at.on the other hand,in denying transco ftsl proposal,ferc noted that shippers would be entitled to only secondary rights on the supply laterals if the service were eliminated.id.at.transco and indicated shippers dispute ferc use of the terms primary and secondary,claiming the ftw proposal would only give shippers secondary rights on the supply laterals.
ferc contends the rights granted under the ftw proposal are properly characterized as primary because transco would be forced to reserve capacity on the supply laterals for the shippers.therefore,as no higher priority service would be sold,the ftw plan would shift the fixed costs allocated to the supply laterals solely onto the shippers,whereas granting secondary rights would not do so.id.this rationale is at the heart of the case,the allocation of the annual million cost has motivated the past dozen years of litigation much of the rest of the debate over the meaning and applicability of the terms primary and secondary obscures the real substance of the dispute.
under transco current rate structure,the rate charged to it shippers for each unit transported is equal to the total rate that an shipper pays per unit one component of that ft rate is the reservation charge,which guarantees the availability of shipping capacity.the reservation charge for a zone is calculated by dividing the fixed costs allocated to the zone by the total amount of ft and in the zone.hence,the more gas projected to be shipped through a zone via it service,the lower the shippers reservation charge will be.the burden of those savings is then effectively shifted to the it shippers because the rate for it service mirrors the ft rate including the reservation charge,the charge for it service incorporates some of the function of recovering fixed costs.in essence,transco recovers part of the fixed costs for each zone through the shippers reservation charges,and the rest of the fixed costs through the it shippers charges.
under the ftw proposal,though,service on the supply laterals is eliminated.shippers would be given flexible access to the supply laterals,but their reservation charges would also increase,as it shippers would no longer be bearing part of the fixed costs of the zone.the result of this change would be the same as if transco were to add service in a new zone onto existing service would be expanded to new parts of the pipeline system,but a greater reservation charge would be required,in order to recover that new area fixed costs.in this sense,the supply laterals are virtually a separate zone in the present system.though the laterals are designated as parts of transco existing zones,paying the reservation charge for ft service in a zone does not currently give a shipper access to supply laterals within that zone nor does paying for access to a supply lateral give an it shipper the right to use the mainline in the same zone.two transactions are required to purchase capacity for shipping gas on the supply laterals and the mainline within one zone.
hence,requiring shippers to pay an increased reservation charge for access to the laterals is equivalent to forcing them to accept service in an additional zone,for which they would have to pay a new reservation charge.regardless of the labels placed on the proposed change,the substantive effect of the ftw plan would be to require shippers to take on a new service.although they benefit from the existence of the priority,the shippers never contracted for service on the supply laterals.because the ftw proposal would effectively add service to these shippers contracts,not merely change contractual rates or terms,the scope of the change exceeds that which is permitted under memphis clauses.see exxon mobil i,at.
this analysis is consistent with ferc denial of transco ftsl proposal.order requires that any ft shipper who pays the reservation charge for a zone be afforded flexible secondary access to other points in the zone.as shippers as a class are not currently paying the full reservation charge for each zone,the it shippers also pay part of the fixed costs for each part allocated to the laterals,they are not currently entitled to flexible access to secondary points on the supply laterals.flexible access may be acquired,if a shipper desires it,through purchasing separate it service.
in the ftsl proposal,transco sought to sell ft service on the supply laterals.in each zone,ftsl customers would have been charged the same rate as the shippers thus,all ft shippers within a zone whether using the mainline or the supply laterals would be paying the same reservation charge.unlike the ftw plan,the ftsl plan would not have forced existing shippers to bear the full fixed costs of a zone on their own,as they would share this burden with the ftsl shippers.at the same time,the fixed costs for the whole zone would be divided up among all the ft shippers in the zone proportionally,through equal reservation charges.therefore,the supply laterals would no longer have been virtually a separate zone under t
