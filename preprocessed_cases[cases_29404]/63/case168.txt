before the court are two interlocutory appeals challenging three district court orders authorizing execution against property of a foreign sovereign,the république du congo the congo,and société nationale des pétroles du congo snpc,an oil company owned by the congo.to satisfy its money judgment against the congo,fg hemisphere,llc,filed suit against cms nomeco congo,the nuevo congo,and nuevo congo collectively the garnishees,and the congo and snpc.in the first appeal,fg hemisphere i,the garnishees challenge two october orders that authorized the execution in favor of fg hemisphere against the congo right to receive in cash or royalties from the garnishees,in exchange for allowing them to drill for oil in congolese waters.in the second appeal,fg hemisphere ii,the congo and the garnishees challenge a december order authorizing the issuance of garnishment writs in favor of fg hemisphere against snpc right to receive a working interest share of oil produced in the congo.we consolidated the appeals for oral argument and,due to the overlapping issues presented in the appeals,we also consolidate them for disposition.
the congo and the garnishees collectively the congo defendants appeal,arguing in fg hemisphere i that it was error for the district court to authorize execution against the interest in royalties without a prior determination that the property met the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia requirements for an exception to the congo sovereign immunity from execution.in fg hemisphere ii,the congo defendants argue that snpc working interest share is not a debt obligation and that snpc right to receive working interest oil is immune from garnishment under the fsia.the congo defendants also assert that,at the time of the challenged orders,the property was not in the united states and therefore,pursuant to the fsia,could not be garnished.
to resolve each appeal,we must decide this res nova issue at what point in time does property have to be in the united states for a court to determine whether the exception to the congo sovereign immunity from execution applies we conclude that the foreign sovereign property must be in the united states when the district court determines whether the exception applies,and prior to authorizing execution,the district court must find the facts necessary for the exception to apply.we further conclude in each appeal that the district court misapprehended the effect of applying the exception to immunity,and that the challenged writs of garnishment issued as a direct result of a misinterpretation and misapplication of law.accordingly,we reverse the october and december orders and remand with instructions that the district court dissolve the writs of garnishment.
factual and procedural background 
in the congo entered into a loan agreement with banco do brasil fg hemisphere is the owner of the rights of banco do brasil under that loan agreement.the congo subsequently defaulted and fg hemisphere obtained a judgment against the congo in the southern district of new york.in the loan agreement,the congo expressly waived its right to immunity from execution.
a.the congo royalty interest and snpc working interest share 
fg hemisphere sought to satisfy its money judgment against the congo via garnishment of royalty obligations under which the garnishees periodically deliver oil that is produced,stored,and delivered in congolese territorial waters.the royalty obligations arose under a agreement the convention.the parties to the convention were the congo,congolese superior oil company,cities service congo petroleum corporation,canadian superior oil,and société nationale de recherches et pétrolières.it appears that the garnishees are successors in interest to three of these parties,with snpc being the successor to.
pursuant to the convention,the congo issued a permit,the marine permit,allowing the companies to drill for oil in exchange for royalties paid to the congo.under the convention,the congo has the right to elect to receive royalties in cash or,but since,the congo has elected to receive the payments.the garnishees and snpc are the current owners of working interests in the convention.
the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement are governed by a series of contracts.the joint operating agreement joa,a separate agreement among the working interest owners,sets forth their respective proportionate interests and also provides for how the oil production operations are conducted.the parties to the joa were all the parties to the convention except the congo.a related agreement,the amendment to lifting agreement,establishes the logistical procedures to coordinate oil liftings taken by snpc and the garnishees.the oil produced pursuant to the convention is transported via a subsurface pipeline network to an offshore vessel located off the coast of the congo.
a lifting occurs when oil is offloaded from a storage vessel located off of the congo coast.the garnishees take liftings of oil stored on the vessel for their own account and sell of the oil for their own account.cms nomeco congo,cms nomeco,as operator,calculates the royalty owed to the congo and the working interest amount owed to snpc as a result of the garnishees liftings.these amounts owed to the congo and snpc are called the position.cms nomeco records the results of its calculations on an statement.once the combination of the congo royalty entitlement and snpc working interest entitlement exceeds an position of at least barrels,snpc is entitled to take a lifting of oil for itself and for the congo.apparently,when snpc conducts such a lifting,it lifts about to barrels,at which point it is,which is then accounted for in the statement described above.republic of congo,ii,clarified on reh g,republic of congo,cir.snpc would then not take another lifting until it is by barrels.in this manner,the snpc lifting extinguishes the royalty obligation and puts snpc into an position.the process repeats as the garnishees take more liftings.
the oil production operations entail operating costs that are borne by the working interest owners,which do not include the congo.pursuant to the joa,the garnishees advance snpc share of the operating expenses.these advances are reimbursed by allocation of a portion,of snpc working interest share of the production.accordingly,snpc takes only of its share of the production,of the total production.the remaining of snpc share,or of the total production,is lifted by the garnishees to reimburse themselves for the amounts paid to cover snpc share of the operating costs.through these various agreements,the working interest owners established a procedure for the lifting of the garnishees share of the oil as well as the lifting of snpc working interest share,which it takes at the same time it takes the congo royalty oil.
location of the garnishees and their predecessors 
in may,cms oil and gas and its subsidiary cms oil and gas international,and subsidiaries of those companies,owned exploration and production assets in the united states,the congo and various other countries.in july,cms oil and gas parent company signed a purchase and sale agreement for the stock of cms oil and gas international along with its subsidiary,cms nomeco,to be sold to affiliates of perenco perenco and its affiliated companies,including the garnishees,are headquartered in europe.
in september,cms nomeco,a delaware corporation,became a member of the perenco group of companies with officers and directors located in paris and london.operations relating to the congo that previously had been performed in the united states were performed in the congo.in july,nuevo congo and nuevo congo became members of the perenco group of companies.nuevo congo is incorporated in the cayman islands and nuevo congo is incorporated in delaware.by july,none of the garnishees had operations,officers,or a physical presence in the united states.
c.the writs of garnishment 
on september,we decided ii.there,another of the congo judgment creditors sought to garnish the same royalty obligations fg hemisphere seeks to garnish in this case.we found that the royalty obligations were not immune to execution and reversed the district court decision to the contrary.one week after our ii decision,fg hemisphere filed an emergency application to issue writs of garnishment,asking the district court to issue writs of garnishment directed to the royalty obligations.
on october,the district court granted this emergency application,finding only that a valid judgment exists against the republique du congo that is unchallenged,that the republique du congo irrevocably waived immunity with respect to the obligations of the loan agreement,and that the waiver extends to any assets,revenues and properties that belong to the republique du congo.that same day,writs of garnishment issued against the garnishees as to any assets and other property of the republique du congo of any nature including any payments or obligations due to the republique du congo,whether denominated as taxes,fees,royalties,net profits,or otherwise.
fg hemisphere filed a motion to clarify the october,order and to abandon portions of the garnishment regarding certain tax obligations.specifically,this motion asked the district court to modify the order to include a determination that the royalty obligations at issue in fg hemisphere emergency application are not immune from execution under the fsia because they constitute property of the republique du congo located in the united states,which has been used for commercial activity in the united states,and order that the writs of garnishment issued in accordance with the order do not relate to the bona fide obligation of the garnishees to pay taxes to the congo and are modified to exclude such tax obligations.
the district court granted this motion and,on october,modified and restated its earlier order 
the court has reviewed the application and the defendants response,and determines that a valid judgment exists against the republique du congo that is unchallenged,that the republique du congo irrevocably waived immunity with respect to the obligations of the loan agreement,and that the waiver extends to any assets,revenues and properties that belong to the republique du congo.the garnishees owe to the republique du congo certain royalty obligations under a convention for the production of oil.based on the plaintiff emergency application for the issuance of writs of garnishment and the garnishees response thereto,the court determines that said royalty obligations constitute property of the republique du congo located in the united states,which has been used for commercial activity in the united states,therefore,satisfying the requirements of the foreign sovereign immunities act and enabling the plaintiff to execute on said property.
in december,fg hemisphere filed an emergency application for writs of garnishment addressed to snpc working interest.the district court reasoned that the garnishees advance operating expenses to snpc via a transaction that functions like a revolving loan,and found snpc working interest share to be a species of a previous determination.the court further held that the congo had waived the defenses that might be asserted under the fsia.the district court found that the garnishees held assets for the congo in the united states when this action commenced.finally,the court determined that the obligations owed by the garnishees to snpc had a commercial purpose and were located in the united states.on december,the district court held that snpc working interest share was not immune from execution under the fsia and that,therefore,fg hemisphere was entitled to execute against this property.as with the october,order,writs of garnishment issued against snpc property on the same day as the december order.
the congo defendants appeal the district court october and december orders granting fg hemisphere applications for writs of garnishment against them.

b.the fsia immunity from execution against property 
the fsia sets forth the sole and exclusive standards used by courts in the united states to resolve sovereign immunity issues.walker int l holdings,republic of congo walker int l ii,cir.a claim of sovereign immunity merely raises a jurisdictional defense.republic of austria altmann,d.the sovereign immunity claim may be raised by a garnishee as well as by a foreign sovereign.see walker int l i,at finding no authority for the proposition that it is the sovereign exclusive right to raise the issue of sovereign immunity under the fsia,and concluding that a does not give the sovereign exclusive standing to raise the waiver element.the district court denial of immunity under the fsia is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see byrd corporación forestal y indust.de olancho,cir stena,at.
the general rule under the fsia is that property of a foreign sovereign is immune from attachment and execution.ed.supp.iii atwood turnkey drilling,petroleo brasileiro,cir.the exceptions to the general rule of immunity are central to the fsia functioning.republic of austria,at.at the threshold of every district court action against a foreign state,the court must satisfy itself that one of the exceptions applies because its jurisdiction depends on that application.id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.one of the exceptions is a 
the property in the united states of a foreign state,as defined in section a of this chapter,used for a commercial activity in the united states,shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution,or from execution,upon a judgment entered by a court of the united states or of a state after the effective date of this act,if the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution either explicitly or by implication 
ed.supp.iii emphasis added atwood,at.this section simply determines whether property belonging to a foreign sovereign is immune from execution by a state or federal court in the united states it does not provide a cause of action for execution against such property.see.bank of commerce republic of congo i,cir noting that the fsia provides foreign sovereigns with immunity from execution against their property to satisfy an adverse judgment walker int l ii,at t he fsia does not create an independent cause of action instead,i t simply provides a defense to claims raised against a sovereign,and a federal forum for the resolution of such claims.citation omitted first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d the fsia was not intended to affect substantive law determining the liability of a foreign state.
under a,even when the foreign sovereign has waived its immunity from execution,courts in the united states may execute only against property in the united states that is used for commercial activity in the united states.i,at,quoting a.in i and ii,we assumed without deciding that,for purposes of determining the a in the united states requirement,the obligations to pay royalties to the congo were intangible debt obligations.see discussion infra part.
intangible rights are but relationships between persons,natural or corporate,which the law recognizes by attaching to them certain sanctions enforceable in courts.the power of government over them and the protection which it gives them can not be exerted through control of a physical thing.they can be made effective only through control over and protection afforded to those persons whose relationships are the origin of the rights.

applicability of i and ii 
the garnishees assert that the fsia requires that a court determine that a foreign sovereign property meet the requirements for an exception to immunity before authorizing execution against such property.they complain that instead of making the required determinations,the district court merely decided that ii was conclusive on the immunity issue,and argue that this exclusive reliance on ii was error.fg hemisphere counters that ii settles the immunity issue because the garnishees were located in the united states when this case was removed to the district court.
the ii holding that the situs of the garnishee is the situs of the property is instructive regarding our focus on the congo intangible property.nevertheless,we distinguish ii on its facts and reasoning because the ii panel did not make the determinations there that are essential to the issues in this case.
the garnishees situs was not at issue in i and ii 
in i and ii,we examined the same royalty obligations that fg hemisphere seeks to garnish in this case and determined that a common sense appraisal of the requirements of justice and convenience in this particular context yields the conclusion that the situs of these royalty obligations is the united situs of the garnishees.ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.on the i and ii record,it was undisputed that texas was the locus from which the garnishees had supervised,directed,and financed the activities that gave rise to their obligations to make royalty payments to the congo.i,at dennis,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.
also undisputed was the garnishees continuous presence in texas.id.accordingly,i and ii did not consider either whether the therefore intangibles in their in the united states,or the applicable time period during which the obligations must be in the united states for a purposes the a situs snapshot,or the situs snapshot.see ii,at discussing the rule applicable to a a situs determination for intangibles but not discussing the situs of the garnishees.
classification of the royalty interests was not at issue in i and ii 
in i,we assumed that the obligations were intangible property in ii,we stated that the royalty obligations were intangibles.nevertheless,neither i nor ii analyzed the nature of the property,in large part because i and ii addressed only the fsia exception to executional immunity.neither i nor ii mentioned statutory or jurisprudential considered the record factual the assumption and conclusion that these obligations were intangible property.
for example,the word intangible first appears in i as follows contrary to the bank suggestion,assigning the phrase used for its ordinary meaning does not make it impossible to execute against the intangible property of the foreign state.i,at.next,we noted that,predecessor in interest,connecticut bank of commerce suggests that,because it is difficult to prove what a foreign state intends to do in the future with intangible property,like bank accounts,judgment creditors will rarely be able to execute against any intangible property.id.footnote omitted.
continuing to refer generally to intangible property,we examined the meaning of used for in a used for commercial activity in the united states requirement,noting that we can not see how focusing on the use of property forecloses execution against intangible property.our decision in atwood turnkey drilling,petroleo brasileiro,cir,helps illustrate how certain intangible property can uncontroversially be viewed as used in service of a commercial activity in the united states.i,at.we concluded that intangible property is not so inherently speculative that courts can not determine how such interests are used by the foreign state.id.
the i panel first associated intangible with the congo royalty interest in an observation that,o n the record before us the congo has not put its intangible property in the service of any commercial activity in the united states.id.at.the second such association was a finding that,u nder the undisputed facts,the property executed garnishees intangible obligations to pay in the united states,as required by fsia a.the garnishees are oil companies headquartered in texas.the situs of a debt is the situs of the debtor in texas.id.at dennis,concurring in the judgment but disagreeing as to the controlling principles of law.next is a statement that t he factual question of what the royalty and tax obligations are used for appears much less difficult on this record than the legal question of determining the situs of the intangible royalty obligations.id.at.our focus in i was the interest entitling its owner to a share as part of the a used for commercial activity the classification of that interest.
in ii,we confirmed the i assumption that the royalty obligations are intangibles,and determined that the situs of an intangible obligation is the situs of the garnishee.whether the royalty obligations were classified as intangibles or otherwise was not squarely part of our analysis.the panel in ii determined whether the obligation to pay royalties,assumed in i and ii to be intangible,was in the united states,given the uncontroverted fact that the garnishees were in the united states.
finally,the congo royalty interests,but not snpc working interest,was at bar in both i and ii.there has been no appellate determination that the working interest satisfies either requirement for application of the a exception to execution immunity.
to sum up in the cases,we decided that the obligations to pay royalties to the congo,here at issue in fg hemisphere i,had been used for commercial activity in the united states and as to these intangible obligations to pay royalties,the undisputed united states situs of the garnishees was the a situs of the congo intangible property.in fg hemisphere i and fg hemisphere ii,we are not faced with a straightforward application of law to undisputed fact,as was the case in ii.to properly apply the ii a situs rule in each of these two appeals,it must be determined when the property must be in the united states whether the obligations at issue are intangible and whether snpc working interest was property in the united states that was used for commercial activity in the united states.our decisions do not speak to these determinations.as in the decisions,we do not analyze whether the property at issue in either appeal is classified as tangible or intangible.moreover,because the garnishment writs against snpc must be dissolved for other reasons,we do not address whether snpc working interest share satisfies the requisites of a.in contrast to the decisions,the facts disputed in both appeals require that we determine the a time period during which the obligations must be in the united states.
iii.discussion 
we first address the situs snapshot question,at issue in both appeals,then address the issues that remain in each appeal.
the congo defendants contend that the a situs snapshot should be taken when the writs of garnishment issue.in contrast,fg hemisphere argues that the situs determination should be made either when the suit commenced or when the garnishees received notice of the garnishment action against them.we find that for purposes of a,the foreign sovereign property must be in the united states when the district court applies the exception to immunity from execution.
a.the a situs snapshot 
in fg hemisphere i,the congo defendants challenge the october,order,asserting that the district court erred by granting the writ application without making a determination that the congo royalty interest was located in the united states,as required by the fsia.the congo defendants also assert that the district court erred in its subsequent finding that the property was in the united states because neither the congo nor the garnishees had property in the united states when the october writs issued.similarly,in fg hemisphere ii,the congo defendants challenge the district court december order that writs issue against the garnishees obligation to pay snpc working interest,asserting that the working interest was neither garnishable property nor was it property in the united states for purposes of a.
fg hemisphere,on the other hand,asserts that the garnishees or their predecessors were located in the united states at the commencement of this suit when the garnishees received notice of the garnishment action against them.therefore,it contends,under ii,the intangible obligations at issue were situated in the united states.according to fg hemisphere,this satisfied the a in the united states requirement because the royalty obligation and the obligation to pay snpc working interest share are intangible property rights that were in the united states for purposes of a.
fg hemisphere also argues that the situs of both the royalty obligations and working interest share obligations is presently,and has been,in the united states for purposes of a because the congo defendants subjected themselves to personal jurisdiction via their removal of this action from texas state court and via defending this case on the merits,and because two of the garnishees are incorporated in delaware and are therefore legally present in the united states.
while this court has previously addressed the time period applicable to the used for commercial activity requirement for this exception to immunity,there has been little said in this or any other circuit about exactly when the property has to be in the united states.perhaps this is because generally,as in the cases,there was no dispute about the location of the property or the location of the garnishees when the garnishment order issued or perhaps it is because the language of a suggests a present tense for the property in the united states factual determination.
the operative language in a states property in the united states of a foreign state shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution,or from execution.this language suggests that the property must be in the united states at the time of the immunity determination.garnishment is a quasi in rem proceeding used by a creditor to reach property of the debtor that is in the possession of a third party,the garnishee.stena,at.in texas,the writ of garnishment applies to debt obligations the garnishee owes to the debtor and property belonging to the debtor but in the garnishee possession,from the time the garnishee is served with the writ of garnishment to the time the garnishee must answer the writ.civ.
writs of attachment or garnishment usually target either property that is in the jurisdiction of the court or that is in the possession of a garnishee who is within the jurisdiction of the court.see stena,at.the fsia statute does not say property that was in the united states or property that has been in the united states.a common sense appraisal of the requirements of justice and convenience in this particular context yields the conclusion that the situs snapshot is taken when the court makes the a situs determination.ii,at a common sense appraisal of the requirements of justice and convenience in this particular context yields the conclusion that the situs of these royalty obligations is the united situs of the garnishees.internal quotation marks omitted.stated differently,to satisfy the exception to immunity,the property must be in the united states when the district court authorizes execution.this result best prevents disruption of the public acts of foreign sovereigns by not garnishing property that was in the united states but is now exclusively in a foreign country.
fg hemisphere also argues that the garnishees presence in the united states has been continuous because they have remained subject to the jurisdiction of the district court throughout this litigation and because two of the garnishees are incorporated in delaware.although jurisdiction over the parties does not change after the action commences or after the party submits to the court jurisdiction,immunity from execution is nevertheless narrower than jurisdictional immunity.i,at noting that the second circuit examined the history of immunity from execution and the international law context at the time congress passed the fsia and determined that congress deliberately chose to narrow the scope of immunity from execution citing deletelier republic of chile,cir.we reject fg hemisphere argument because it conflates the considerations and effects attendant to commencement notice of a suit seeking to execute upon the foreign sovereign property with those attendant to deciding whether to authorize execution upon that property.
to show the importance of commercial use rather than diplomatic use for property to be subject to attachment under a,i uses an example of an airplane owned by a foreign state that lands in the united states.see i,at.drawing on that analogy,a foreign state airplane that landed in the united states would not be property in the united states once it left the united states.likewise,tangible property that was in the united states at the onset of litigation,or when notice of the litigation was received,but was not there when a writ of garnishment was requested,issued,or served would not be considered property in the united states for purposes of garnishment.
applying the ii rule that the situs of intangible property is the situs of the garnishee,we conclude that the relevant inquiry is whether the garnishee is in the united states when the court makes its jurisdictional determination whether an exception to the fsia immunity applies to the foreign sovereign property.
we decline fg hemisphere invitation to fashion a situs snapshot that allows the a exception to immunity to apply simply because the legal fiction of intangible property situs is deemed to be in the united states at a time when tangible property would not be property in the united states.like the airplane,the a situs of tangible property is its location when the court determines whether it is immune from execution.similarly,under ii,the situs of intangible property is the location of the garnishee when the immunity determination is made.
we need not determine whether any garnishee was in the united states when the district court granted fg hemisphere applications for writs of garnishment because the garnishment writs must be dissolved.moreover,we express no opinion whether the delaware incorporation of a garnishee is,alone,sufficient to satisfy the a location in the united states requirement.
fg hemisphere i findings necessary under the fsia 
in fg hemisphere i,the congo defendants argue that the district court erred in determining that the fsia general rule of immunity does not apply to the royalty obligations without first conducting an analysis of whether these obligations were in the united states.
unlike the initial order that authorized execution against the congo royalty interests,the district court october,order included factual findings and legal conclusions that the congo waived its immunity to attachment and execution of judgment as to the congo property and rights to royalties owed by or in possession of the garnishees the garnishees owe certain royalty obligations to the congo these royalty obligations are property of the congo in the united states and these royalty obligations have been used for commercial activity in the united states.
the district court must apply the fsia in each action against a foreign sovereign because the court jurisdiction in any such action depends on the existence of one of the specified exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.in fg hemisphere i,this means that there must be a determination that the obligation to pay the royalty interest conforms to the two a requirements before the district court has subject matter jurisdiction.these two requirements can not be waived because they are jurisdictional.see republic of austria,at.discussing the development of foreign sovereign immunity law and noting that a claim of sovereign immunity raises a jurisdictional defense schooner exch.mcfaddon,cranch.holding that american courts had no jurisdiction over an armed french vessel found in united states waters verlinden cent.bank of,d indicating that subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction each turn on application of the substantive provisions of the fsia.
no court in the united states has jurisdiction to execute against a foreign sovereign property until these determinations are made.accordingly,we find that the district court erred when it authorized issuance of the october writs without first determining that an exception to the fsia immunity applied to the property executed against.the result of that error is that the district court had no jurisdiction to enter that order.this kind of error can not be cured by subsequent modification because the order was void ab initio.accordingly,we vacate the october orders that authorize execution against the congo interest in royalties.
fg hemisphere ii snpc working interest 
in fg hemisphere ii,the congo defendants argue that the district court erred in determining that the garnishees obligation to pay snpc working interest is a debt obligation.they contend that snpc and the garnishees were of working interests under the joa and that snpc owns a working interest to take oil produced in the oil owed by the garnishees to snpc.
the congo defendants assert that the district court mischaracterized snpc property as obligations owed to snpc.they further argue that the agreements for snpc to take liftings do not convert the positions of snpc into an obligation on the part of the garnishees.just as in fg hemisphere i,the congo defendants contend that the district court erred in applying the a exception to immunity to the congo property because the garnishees did not possess obligations due to snpc that were in the united states or used for commercial activity in the united states.
fg hemisphere counters that the joa parties agreed not to distribute,pro rata by working interest share,the oil or proceeds from each lifting directly to each working interest holder instead they entered into agreements that create legal obligations in the garnishees toward snpc.fg hemisphere contends that the december garnishment writs were properly issued because snpc working interest was property of the congo,in the united states,that was used for commercial activity in the united states.
among their various arguments,the congo defendants raise the jurisdictional defense that snpc of the congo,as stipulated by the immune from execution pursuant to the fsia.fg hemisphere argues,inter alia,that this property satisfies the a exception to immunity.as the threshold determination,we first address the sovereign immunity claim.we do not reach the parties other arguments about snpc property because there was error as a matter of law in the analysis of the immunity claim and the interpretation of a.see discussion infra part.
to apply the a exception to executional immunity,there must be a finding that the property is located in the united states and used for commercial activity in the united states.the absence of either prong is fatal to the a executional immunity exception.in addition,there must be a waiver of immunity by the foreign sovereign.therefore,the district court could have jurisdiction over fg hemisphere action to garnish snpc working interest share only if the congo has waived its immunity from execution against this working interest,and the working interest share is property of the congo that was in the united states when the district court authorized execution against it,and the working interest share has been used for commercial activity in the united states.the discussion in part and our conclusion that,to satisfy the a situs requirement,the property must be in the united states when the district court authorizes execution,also apply to the immunity determination about snpc working interest.as we explained in part,this determination must be made prior to authorization of execution.
in the december order authorizing execution against the obligations owed by the garnishees to snpc that snpc owes to the congo,the district court found that the garnishees owe intangible obligations to snpc and in turn to the congo under the terms of the joa.the district court made a number of additional findings of fact and conclusions of law,including the following 
the garnishees advance to snpc the joa expenses via a transaction that functions like a revolving loan,therefore these obligations are not immune under the fsia 
the congo waiver of immunity on sovereign immunity grounds was not the only waiver there were others that effectively waived any fsia defense,including the defense that the property was not used for commercial activity in the united states 
the congo has authorized seizure of its property in the united states 
the intangible property at issue is simply a species of the previous determination made in this proceeding that the property was used for commercial purposes and 
when this proceeding was instituted,the garnishees held assets for the congo in the united states.
the district court concluded that b ased on the application for writs of garnishment and the response in opposition thereto,these obligations are property of the congo,snpc has assets located in the united states that have been used for commercial activity in the united states and,therefore,fg hemisphere may execute on said property.
we have reviewed the writ application and response thereto and find the factual basis used to support the district court conclusion is,at best,at worst,to that part of snpc working interest if any that is intangible property.moreover,the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law reveal an erroneous interpretation and application of a.some of the factual findings are clearly erroneous.others,though not clearly erroneous,were used in the district court misinterpretation misapplication of law.
the district court ultimate conclusion was that fg hemisphere may execute on snpc working interest share because it is an asset located in the united states and used for commercial activity in the united states.as explained below,this conclusion is erroneous.see discussion infra part.we discuss,but do not decide,whether the factual basis for this conclusion was sufficient.
the factual basis for the december immunity determination 
in accord with the statute,ii does not permit a a exception to immunity for obligations that were not used for commercial purposes in the united states.ii,at.the fact that property was generated by commercial activity,namely,oil exploration,is irrelevant what matters under a is what the property is used for.walker int l i,at see also i,at what matters under a is what the property is used for,not how it was generated or produced.e ven if a foreign state property was generated by commercial activity in the united states,that property is not thereby subject to execution or attachment if it is not used for a commercial activity within our borders.i,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in its december order,the district court stated that the garnishees owe to snpc certain intangible obligations under agreements relating to the convention.this order does not otherwise mention the convention,joa,or amendment to lifting except in reference to the congo waiver of immunity and the garnishees royalty obligations.the district court concluded that the garnishees payments of snpc share of operation expenses,and recoupment of their payments from snpc share of oil,is a transaction that functions like a revolving is therefore not immune under the did not determine whether this transaction is a loan or other intangible obligation.similarly,the district court made no factual findings that support its determination that the garnishees obligation to pay snpc working interest share is property that satisfies the a requirements.there is no factual basis in the district court analysis to support its conclusion that the garnishees owe intangible obligations to snpc that are not immune from execution.
fg hemisphere argues that the working interest share has been used for commercial activity in the united states to finance the lifting and production of oil,to finance the costs of such production.according to fg hemisphere,the garnishees obligation to pay snpc its working interest share has been used to finance the production and lifting of oil in congolese waters.fg hemisphere characterizes the reimbursement to the garnishees as a use of the garnishees obligation to give snpc its working share.fg hemisphere asserts that this use of snpc working interest share to reimburse the garnishees is payment of a commercial debt to the garnishees.fg hemisphere further asserts that the garnishees are deemed to be in the united states for purposes of the fsia,and were undisputedly based in the united states when this action commenced in federal court.therefore,fg hemisphere contends,this reimbursement use of the working interest share is commercial activity in the united states under the fsia,just as in ii the congo use of royalties to pay a commercial debt to a united creditor was commercial activity in the united states.see ii,at,and at.
fg hemisphere argument is creative but it does not accurately describe the sequence of these transactions.pursuant to the joa,the garnishees advance snpc share of the operating expenses.snpc is then obligated to reimburse the garnishees it is snpc debt obligation.after an oil lifting,snpc takes less than its working interest share of the production with the remaining part of its share used to reimburse the garnishees.just over one third of the total production is retained by the garnishees to reimburse themselves.it is not clear how the repayment of snpc debt to the garnishees becomes snpc property in the hands of the garnishees solely because the garnishees and snpc agreed that snpc may reimburse the garnishees by letting them keep part of an oil lifting that otherwise would be paid to snpc.
neither the district court factual findings nor fg hemisphere argument in this interlocutory appeal indicates that snpc working interest was used for commercial activity within the united states.the district court conclusion that this property was located in the united states was based on a previous,unrelated situs determination and on a situs snapshot taken at commencement of the federal garnishment proceedings.the district court factual findings do not support its conclusions of law.the district court misapprehended a in making the immunity determination and authorized execution against snpc property because it incorrectly applied the law to the facts.
erroneous facts and errors of examples 
the december order contains a number of findings and conclusions that reveal misinterpretation of law,factual errors,and misapplication of law to the facts.we shall discuss two examples.first is the statement that there had been a previous finding and holding that snpc working interest share was used for commercial purposes.second is the holding that the congo waived its fsia defenses and authorized seizure of its property.
the district court deemed the working interest to be simply a species of the previous determination made in this proceeding that the property was used for commercial purposes.the previous determination was in the modified october order that authorized execution against the royalty obligations.the immunity determination about snpc working interest share is not a species of the determination about the royalty obligations.moreover,the district court can not rely on the october determination because it had no subject matter jurisdiction at that time.
prior to issuing a garnishment order,a district court must make factual findings that support application of the a exception to executional immunity during the situs snapshot for each form of property.for example,a foreign sovereign car does not become exempt from executional immunity solely because it was previously determined that the sovereign airplane was not protected by fsia immunity.likewise,a previous determination that royalty obligations were used for commercial activity in the united states tends to neither prove nor disprove whether a working interest share was used for commercial purposes in the united states as a matter of law,the working interest share could only be executed against if both a requirements were met and the congo waiver of immunity applied to snpc property.the obligation to pay snpc working interest would not be exempt from executional immunity just because the a exception applied to the obligations to pay royalties.
next,the district court finding that the congo waived its fsia defenses regarding snpc property is clearly erroneous.the congo stipulated that any snpc property was also the congo property,but reserved its right to challenge whether such property is property in which snpc has a right or interest sited in the united states and property used for a commercial activity in the united states within the meaning of a.contrary to the district court findings,the congo did not waive its fsia defenses.moreover,the a defenses are jurisdictional and can only be waived by failure to raise the sovereign immunity claim.
the dispositive error of law 
the error of law critical to our disposition of fg hemisphere ii is the conclusion that a determination that the foreign sovereign property is not immune to execution necessarily,and without more,results in an order authorizing execution.this error is also among the reversible errors in fg hemisphere 
in restating its october order,the district court concluded that the royalty obligations were property located in the united states and used for commercial activity in the united states,thus satisfying the requirements of the foreign sovereign immunities act and enabling the plaintiff to execute on said property.therefore,it is ordered that fg hemisphere application for writs of garnishment is granted.this statement highlights what may be a common misapprehension of the law.the december order repeats this misinterpretation and misapplication of law 
t he court determines that said obligations constitute property of the congo and that snpc has assets located in the united states,which have been used for commercial activity within the united states,therefore,satisfying the requirements of the foreign sovereign immunities act and enabling the plaintiff to execute on said property.
therefore,it is ordered that plaintiff application for writs of garnishment is granted.
thus,the district court granted fg hemisphere applications for writs of garnishment as the consequence of its determination that the property satisfied the requirements of an exception to the fsia immunity from execution.
a finding that an exception to executional immunity applies is a finding that the court has jurisdiction over the garnishment action.this is not the same as concluding that execution is appropriate or that writs of garnishment should issue.as actions supplemental to or in aid of execution,according to federal rule of civil procedure,garnishment actions are governed by state law to the extent it does not conflict with federal law.a.civ.prac.providing for garnishment actions civ.same grenada bank willey,cir a writ of execution can not be the exclusive means of enforcing a judgment since the state practice and procedure provides for garnishment.
we note that there have been no findings whether the royalty interest and working interest are real property,intangible personal property,or both.likewise,there has been no finding that the property is garnishable under texas law.application of an exception to immunity is but the f
