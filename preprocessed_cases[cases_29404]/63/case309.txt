the irs generally has three years after a return is filed to assess a tax deficiency,but it has six years to do so when the return omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.a,e a.this case requires us to decide whether the irs can use this extended limitations period to assess a deficiency where a taxpayer has overstated its basis in an asset and thereby lowered the amount of gross income reported in its return.in other words,does a taxpayer omit from gross income an amount properly includible therein for purposes of e a by overstating its basis we conclude,like the tax court below,that we are bound by colony,comm r,d,which held that a taxpayer overstatement of basis does not omit from gross income an amount properly includible therein for purposes of e a.accordingly,the irs had only three years to assess the tax deficiency at issue in this case,and it failed to do so.we therefore affirm the tax court judgment in favor of the taxpayer.
bakersfield energy partners,lp bakersfield,the taxpayer in this case,is a limited partnership that owned an interest in oil and gas property a third party,seneca,offered to purchase the property for.
according to the irs,before the sale was consummated,four of the seven partners in bakersfield took a series of steps that led bakersfield to increase its basis in its oil and gas property and thereby decrease its gross and potentially taxable income from the sale before taking these steps,bakersfield basis in the oil and gas property was zero.
the steps were as follows first,the four partners formed a new partnership,bakersfield resources,llc resources.second,the four partners sold their partnership interests in bakersfield to resources for.the four partners collectively owned of bakersfield by selling more than half of the total partnership interests in bakersfield,they caused a technical termination of the bakersfield partnership and the formation of a new bakersfield partnership in which resources held a interest.see b b.third,the new bakersfield partnership made use of certain tax provisions that allow a partnership to elect to increase its basis in partnership assets following a transfer of a partnership interest.see.in this case,bakersfield made an election under to adjust its basis in all of its assets by the sales price of the partnership interests sold to resources.bakersfield allocated of its new basis to the oil and gas property and the remainder to its other assets.fourth,after completing these steps to adjust its basis in its oil and gas property,bakersfield consummated the sale of its oil and gas property to seneca for in may.
on october,bakersfield filed a partnership return for the tax year ending december.the return reported that bakersfield gain from the sale of the oil and gas property was the sales price of the oil and gas property minus its new adjusted basis.bakersfield return also stated that its gain was reduced by mining exploration costs of.accordingly,bakersfield return recognized a net taxable gain of from the sale of the oil and gas property the gain minus the in mining and exploration costs.
bakersfield partnership return included a short statement explaining its claimed basis 
pursuant to irc b b and the regulations thereunder,bakersfield energy partners,lp terminated on april.on that date,certain partners sold over a ownership interest in the partnership capital and profits to bakersfield resources,llc tein.on april,bakersfield resources,llc acquired additional partnership interests through purchases.these transactions resulted in a new partnership for federal income tax purposes the new partnership retains the same federal employer identification number.
as reflected within the capital accounts,the partnership books were restated to reflect the value of the assets as required in the regulations under irc.as reflected within this return,in the event of a sale of these assets proper adjustments have been made to reflect the tax basis and the proper taxable gain.
bakersfield also attached a statement indicating its election under to adjust the basis in its assets in accordance with b.
on october,almost six years after the return was filed on october,the irs mailed bakersfield a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa.an fpaa tolls the limitations period in which the irs can assess a tax deficiency.see a,d.the irs conceded before the tax court that,if the fpaa was untimely,there was no other basis for tolling the limitations period for any assessment and that summary judgment should therefore be entered in favor of bakersfield.see bakersfield energy partners comm r,wl.
the fpaa claimed that bakersfield adjustment of its basis in the oil and gas property from zero to was invalid because it was the result of a sham transaction,a transaction lacking economic substance that had no business purpose and no economic effect was availed for tax avoidance purpose and should not be respected for tax purposes.because the irs determined that bakersfield basis in the oil and gas property was zero,not,the irs calculated that bakersfield gain from the sale of the oil and gas property to seneca was,not.based on this calculation,the irs determined that bakersfield had underpaid its taxes and was also liable for a penalty on the underpayment.
bakersfield petitioned the tax court for readjustment.before the tax court,the parties filed for summary judgment.bakersfield claimed,among other things,that the fpaa was untimely under the limitations period in a the irs argued that the fpaa was timely under the limitations period in e a and c these provisions give the irs six years in which to assess a tax when the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.e a.the irs claimed that,because this provision applied to bakersfield return,the fpaa was timely.
applying the supreme court decision in colony to e a,the tax court determined that the limitations period applied.see bakersfield,at.accordingly,the tax court held that the irs fpaa was untimely and granted bakersfield motion for summary judgment.the irs timely appeals.we have jurisdiction under.
this case turns on whether the general limitations period in a,or the extended limitations period in e a,applies to bakersfield partnership return,which was filed almost six years before the irs mailed its fpaa to bakersfield.the supreme court addressed this precise question over sixty years ago in colony,when it interpreted the same language in an earlier version of the tax code.thus the primary legal dispute in this case is whether colony is controlling or whether it is distinguishable 
understanding the parties arguments requires an overview of the extended limitations period in e a and its precursor,c,which was the provision construed by the supreme court in colony.
section c of the tax code provided 
if the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return,the tax may be assessed,or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment,at any time within years after the return was filed.
c supp.v,stat.emphasis added.other than replacing the period with a period,and per centum with percent,this language in the code is identical to the language in the body of the current provision,e a 
the internal revenue code,like the current code,generally defined gross income as including gains from dealings in property and provided that gain from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis.a supp.v,stat.f supp.v,stat.a supp.v,stat.in other words,gross income under the code had the same general meaning that it does under the current code the total amount of money received,gross receipts minus basis.see a a.
given this definition of gross income,disputes arose over whether the extended limitations period of c applied if a taxpayer overstated its basis.a taxpayer that overstated its basis would report an erroneously low amount of gross income,since gross income was defined as the difference between gross receipts and basis.this court,as well as the majority of other courts addressing the issue,determined that an overstatement of basis was not an omission of an amount from gross income under c.in slaff comm r,we sided with the majority of the circuits to address the question and held that the general limitations period was applicable where a taxpayer reported the income he had received overseas on his tax forms but erroneously claimed it was excluded from gross income,cir from the day these returns were filed it was plainly revealed that this taxpayer had earned and said amount was claimed to be exempt how such a plain statement can be construed as an omission is difficult for us to understand under the circumstances.see also uptegrove lumber comm r,cir holding that a manufacturing corporation tax return did not make an omission from gross income when it erroneously inflated its cost of goods sold.but see reis comm r,cir holding that the limitations period applied where the petitioner adopted an incorrect basis because it resulted in an understatement of more than of the gross income properly stated in the return.
in,congress enacted a new tax code.the code,still in effect as amended reenacted c as e a.see benson comm r,cir referring to c as the predecessor statute to e a.as noted above,e a of the code,using the same language as c,provides for an extended limitations period when a taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.congress also added two subparagraphs to e a not present in c.the first,and the one of import here,is subparagraph i,which defines gross income in the case of a trade or business as gross receipts,the total amount of money received from a transaction,without any subtraction of cost or basis.see e a i in the case of a trade or business,the term gross income means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services if such amounts are required to be shown on the return prior to diminution by the cost of such sales or services.accordingly,in the case of a trade or business,an overstatement of basis can not constitute an omission from gross income under the code,because subparagraph i of e a removes basis as a component of the definition of gross income.
shortly after the enactment of the code,the supreme court issued its decision in colony.because colony involved a tax return relating to tax years prior to,see at,the court applied the code,even though the court was aware of and referred to the additional subparagraphs in the code,see id.at.
colony involved a corporation dealing in real estate that filed a tax return containing understatements of gross income of more than per cent resulting from an erroneous overstatement of the basis of land sold,rather than from any omission of gross receipts,cir per curiam,rev,d.the irs did not argue that the corporation return had inaccurately reported its gross receipts.at.instead,the deficiencies were based upon the commissioner determination that the taxpayer had understated the gross profits on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the basis of such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain unallowable items of development expense.id.the sixth circuit had held that c extended limitations period did apply.id.at.
the supreme court reversed the sixth circuit decision,holding that the extended limitations period was applicable only in the specific situation where a taxpayer actually omitted some income receipt or accrual in his computation of gross income,and not more generally to errors in that computation arising from other causes.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court first examined the statutory text of c and held that,although the statute on its face lends itself more plausibly to the taxpayer interpretation,it can not be said that the language is unambiguous.see id.on one hand,the court noted,the draftsman use of the word amount instead of,for example,item suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of the is,whether or not gross income was understated by as much as.id.at.on the other hand,the court noted that the commissioner reading fails to take full account of the word omits,which congress selected when it could have chosen another verb such as reduces or understates,either of which would have pointed significantly in the commissioner direction.id.
because c was ambiguous,the court then examined the provision legislative history and found persuasive evidence that congress was addressing itself to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually omitted some income receipt or accrual in his computation of gross income,and not more generally to errors in that computation arising from other causes.id.at.concluding that congress did not intend the limitation to apply whenever gross income was understated,id.at,the court explained 
congress manifested no broader purpose than to give the commissioner an additional two years to investigate tax returns in cases where,because of a taxpayer omission to report some taxable item,the commissioner is at a special disadvantage in detecting errors.in such instances the return on its face provides no clue to the existence of the omitted item.on the other hand,when,as here,the understatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting an item disclosed on the face of the return the commissioner is at no such disadvantage.and this would seem to be so whether the error be one affecting gross income or one,such as overstated deductions,affecting other parts of the return.
finally,the court offered the following dictum,upon which the irs in this case places considerable weight w ithout doing more than noting the speculative debate between the parties as to whether congress manifested an intention to clarify or to change the code,we observe that the conclusion we reach is in harmony with the unambiguous language of e a of the internal revenue code of.id.at.the court did not specify which part of e a was unambiguously in harmony with its conclusion.
as explained above,colony held that a taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein for purposes of the extended limitations period in c when the taxpayer actually omitted some income receipt or accrual in his computation of gross income,and not more generally to errors in that computation arising from other causes.colony,at.here,bakersfield did not omit any income receipt or accrual in its computation of gross income it reported the full amount of its receipts from seneca for the oil and gas properties.benson,at distinguishing colony and holding that the taxpayers omitted an amount from gross income by failing to report constructive dividends paid by their closely held corporations.the irs contends only that bakersfield overstated its basis in the property it sold.applying colony interpretation of c to the substantially identical language in e a,bakersfield error does not trigger the extended limitations period.
notwithstanding this straightforward application of colony,the irs contends that the plain language of e a compels the conclusion that the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein for purposes of e a when the taxpayer overstates its basis.the irs notes that gross income is defined as all income from whatever source derived,including gains derived from dealings in property.a,a.the gain from property is defined as the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis.a.because gain is determined by subtracting basis from the amount realized,the irs argues that,under a natural reading of e a,a taxpayer can omit from gross income an amount properly includible therein by overstating its basis.other courts have agreed with this interpretation of e a.see salman ranch united states,brandon ridge partners united states,wl,at.july.the irs further supports its argument by pointing to the addition of e a i in the code.as noted above,subparagraph i removes basis as a component of the definition of gross income in the case of a trade or business,and therefore taxpayers in a trade or business can never be subject to the limitations period merely because they overstated their basis.the irs contends that the existence of a special rule for these taxpayers makes clear that the general rule,as set forth in the main section of e a,is that an overstatement of basis constitutes an omission from gross income.
the irs interpretation of e a is reasonable.unfortunately for the irs,however,it is also directly contrary to colony construction of the same language in the predecessor statute,c.nevertheless,the irs contends that we are not bound by colony interpretation of c for two reasons.first,the irs argues that colony interpretation of c is not binding because e a,as reenacted with the addition of subparagraph i,is materially different from c.second,the irs argues that colony,read correctly,interpreted c as having the same meaning as e a i and applying only to taxpayers in a trade or business.we consider each argument in turn.
the irs first argues that we are not bound by colony in interpreting e a because the provision was materially altered by the addition of subparagraph i.if we read e a in light of subparagraph i,the irs argues,colony interpretation of c is simply inapplicable,and we must give e a its plain meaning as explained by the irs above.the irs also contends that it would be unreasonable to apply the supreme court interpretation of c to e a,because the supreme court interpretation of c would make e a i superfluous.
the irs points out that if we apply colony to the main section of e a and hold that an overstatement of basis can not constitute an omission from gross income,then no taxpayer that overstates its basis will be subject to the limitations period.because the special definition of gross income as gross receipts in e a i also means that an overstatement of basis can not constitute an omission from gross income in the specific case of a trade or business,the irs argues that applying colony to e a generally would render subparagraph i superfluous.and because i t is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a court must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,in re bonner mall,cir,the irs argues that we can not read colony interpretation of c as applying to e a.
we disagree.congress did not change the language in the body of e a,which is identical to the language in c that the supreme court construed in colony.as a general rule,we construe words in a new statute that are identical to words in a prior statute as having the same meaning.see norman singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,ed explaining that a successor provision using equivalent language constitutes a continuation of the original law see also united states,cir strange comm r,lilly comm r.we therefore interpret e a in light of colony.see benson,at applying colony to e a.
although the irs would have us infer that congress addition of subparagraph i casts the language in the body of e a in a different light,we can equally infer that congress in intended to clarify,rather than rewrite,the existing law.see castaneda united states,cir noting that redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting and that the presumption against surplusage applies more weakly in situations in which the provision is potentially rendered superfluous by language contained in a separate,later statute internal formatting omitted.in enacting the code,congress was presumably aware of the dispute over the interpretation of c,and it could have expressly added a definition of omits if it wanted to overrule the cases that concluded,as the supreme court later did in colony,that omits did not include an overstatement of basis.instead,congress allowed the preexisting general definition of omits to carry forward into the successor provision,and additionally provided for a special definition of gross income in the case of a trade or business.clarifying that an overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross income in the case of a trade or business does not establish that congress also intended to alter the general judicial construction of omits in all other contexts.nor has the irs pointed to any legislative history evincing an intent to alter the law outside the context of a trade or business.
moreover,we are not convinced that applying colony to the code would render e a i superfluous.the main body of e a provides 
if the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,the tax may be assessed,or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment,at any time within years after the return was filed.
subparagraph i provides that 
in the case of a trade or business,the term gross income means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services if such amounts are required to be shown on the return prior to diminution by the cost of such sales or services.
section e a requires a comparison of two numbers the gross income omitted with the gross income stated in the return.if the first number divided by the second number is greater than,then the limitations period applies.because e a i changes the definition of gross income for taxpayers in a trade or business,it potentially affects both the numerator the omission from gross income and the denominator the total gross income stated in the return.colony holding,however,affects only the numerator,by defining what constitutes an omission from gross income.
when there is no dispute about the amount of gross income omitted,the denominator,the total amount of gross income stated in the return,determines whether the omission meets the threshold that triggers the limitations period.for taxpayers not in a trade or business,the denominator is the amount of gross income gross receipts minus basis for taxpayers in a trade or business,the denominator is the total amount of money received without any reduction for basis gross receipts.thus,in a case where there is no dispute regarding the amount of gross income omitted,whether a taxpayer omissions constitute more than of the gross income stated in the return may depend on whether subparagraph i definition of gross income applies.in such cases,subparagraph i may be dispositive,whether or not we accept the irs interpretation of colony.
indeed,in numerous tax court cases where the amount omitted the numerator was not in dispute,the applicability of the limitations period under e a turned on whether the court was obliged to use subparagraph i special definition of gross income for trades and businesses when determining the amount of gross income stated in the return the denominator.in one case,for example,the tax court determined that,because the special definition of gross income in e a i applied,the irs had to provide evidence of the taxpayers share of gross receipts rather than gains from various partnerships they owned in order to prove that the taxpayers omission met the threshold.see hoffman comm r,the amount petitioners omitted,the numerator in the calculation,is not in dispute in this case.the amount omitted is.the parties disagree,however,as to the amount of gross income stated in their return.because the irs could not meet its burden of proof of showing the taxpayers gross receipts,the limitation period did not apply.see id.at.whether e a i applied was the dispositive issue because it determined whether the omitted amount of gross income constituted more than of the gross income stated in the return,wholly aside from colony holding regarding what constitutes an omission from gross income.see also eagan united states,cir insulglass comm r,connelly comm r,cch philipp,comm r.we therefore do not render subparagraph i superfluous by applying colony holding to the same statutory language in the code.
the irs next argues that,if colony holding does apply to the substantia
