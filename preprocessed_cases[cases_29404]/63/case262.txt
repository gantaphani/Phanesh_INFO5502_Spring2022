clajon gas company clajon appeals an adverse united states tax court judgment requiring clajon to depreciate the value of its natural gas pipeline system during certain audit years using a,rather than a,depreciation schedule.for the reasons set forth herein,we reverse the tax court.
background 
we begin our analysis of this taxpayer claim with a discussion about the relevant processes and facilities involved in the production of natural gas.natural gas production is a process.these steps include extraction of the gas from the earth,processing to make it marketable,and transportation to storage.natural gas emerges from the ground as a mixture of natural gas methane,liquid condensate and,sometimes,oil.gas typically flows from the well to a gathering system through gathering pipelines,and the gathering system then aggregates the gas for delivery to a gas processing plant,transmission pipeline,or other central point.the gathering system may dehydrate the gas to remove water and treat the gas to remove corrosive substances.without dehydration and treatment,natural gas is unusable.gas that contains natural gas liquids ngls such as ethane,propane,butane,and natural referred to as wet gas.wet gas must be processed at a gas processing plant to remove the ngls before the gas can be transmitted to consumers.the resulting residue gas is delivered to a transmission line at the outlet of the processing plant.the company extracting the gas may own the gathering system,or it may be owned by an independent pipeline company that is not in the business of extracting gas from the earth.
the central issue in this case is whether clajon natural gas gathering pipeline systems should tax classified as production facilities or as transportation facilities.this issue,in large part,turns on the manner in which the pipelines are used in the collection and production of natural gas 
clajon owns and operates natural gas gathering pipeline systems.a system is a system of interconnected subterranean pipelines and related compression facilities that collect the raw gas from wells and deliver it to a central point,such as a processing plant.gathering lines may include thousands of miles of pipe that are typically located over a relatively small area.a gathering system smaller diameter pipelines sometimes called feeder lines or lateral lines,connect individual wells or one or more central production facilities to larger diameter lines,or trunk lines,that deliver the gas to a gas processing plant or to a transmission line.due to the short distances raw gas must travel in a gathering system,gathering lines typically are designed to function at relatively low pressure.
in contrast,a system carries residue gas from remote areas of production to local gas distribution systems for the market.typically,a company will not permit gas in its pipelines that does not meet its specifications as to the content of ngls,water,and other impurities.transmission pipelines deliver this pipeline quality gas to gas distribution systems typically owned by local utilities that deliver it to industrial,commercial,and residential customers.unlike gathering lines,transmission lines are not exposed to the same corrosive chemicals because those chemicals have been removed as part of the gathering and treatment processes.transmission lines generally range from twenty to inches in diameter and may span hundreds or thousands of miles located over a large area.consequently,transmission pipelines are designed to withstand the higher pressure required to move the gas greater distances.
gathering pipelines typically have a shorter physical to the corrosive effect of the do transmission pipelines.the economic useful life of gathering pipelines is dependent on the productive life of a particular gas field or fields localized in one all of the economically recoverable reserves in a field have been produced,the production activity in that field terminates,and the gathering system serving that field may cease to be useful.on the other hand,the economic useful life of a transmission line is not tied to the economic useful life of any one gas field,as transmission lines serve multiple fields spread over a much larger area.
clajon,a company that does not itself produce natural gas,contracted with gas producers who paid clajon for the use of its gathering pipelines the majority of these contracts called for the producer to be paid a percentage of the proceeds derived from the sale of the natural gas after processing.under a gas transportation contract,clajon charged its customers a fee to move gas through its systems.
the issue facing us is straightforward if clajon gathering systems are classified as production assets,they depreciate over a period.however,if the gathering systems are classified as transportation assets,they should depreciate over a period.
our inquiry begins with an examination of the modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs the current system of depreciation rules.under macrs,the recovery period for a given asset is determined by the asset guideline class to which the asset belongs under m of the internal revenue code the asset classes are set out in proc.saginaw bay pipeline,cms united states,cir duke energy natural gas comm r,cir.
clajon contends that its gathering pipelines fall within asset class.this class i ncludes assets used by petroleum and natural gas producers for drilling of wells and production of petroleum and natural gas,including gathering pipelines and related storage facilities.proc.natural gas production assets,including gathering pipelines under asset class,are depreciated over seven years.proc.natural gas processing plants are likewise depreciated over seven years under asset class.
the irs contends that clajon pipelines fall within asset class.this class i ncludes assets used in the private,commercial,and contract carrying of petroleum,gas and other products by means of pipes and conveyors.the trunk lines and related storage facilities of integrated petroleum and natural gas producers are included in this class.proc.transmission pipelines are depreciated over fifteen years under asset class.proc,at.gas distribution assets also are depreciated over fifteen years under asset class.proc,at.

the government argues that the asset primary use must be based on how the taxpayer uses the asset,not on how the asset itself is used.the government asserts that reg.a b iii b makes plain that it is the taxpayer and not another primary use of the property that determines classification.the government bases its stance on the included sentence,property shall be classified according to primary use even though the activity in which such property is primarily used is insubstantial in relation to all the taxpayer activities,and asserts that this reference to the taxpayer indicates that the use must be how the taxpayer uses the asset.id.
