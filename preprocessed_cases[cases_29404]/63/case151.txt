in,appellants,directly or through their predecessors in interest,leased immovable property in new orleans to bp products north america,formerly american oil company or amoco bp products,its successors and assigns,for bp products to operate a fuel and automotive service station there.well after that lease expired,appellants initiated this action to recover damages for contamination of the leased property and possible contamination of adjacent property,also owned by appellants.they now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of bp products,which the district court grounded solely in its conclusion that a subsequent lease of the same property signed by appellants and star enterprise star on august,but effective august,the star lease constituted a novation of the prior lease the amoco lease,which had been executed in by appellants and bp products,had been extended from time to time,and had expired on august.the court further ruled that an effect of this novation was to release bp products from any duties that it might have owed to appellants in solido with star,the last assignee of the lessee interest under the amoco lease and the original lessee under the star lease.convinced that the district court erred in holding that the star lease was a novation of the amoco lease,we reverse that ruling and the court dismissal of bp products based on that ruling,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
pursuant to the amoco lease executed on june,but effective august of that year,bp products as lessee occupied appellants immovable property located at south carrollton avenue,new orleans,louisiana,the property and operated a retail service station there.that lease had an initial term of ten august,and ending august,one option to renew for an additional ten years.on august,bp products exercised this renewal option,extending the term of the amoco lease from august,to august.during this renewal term,the parties amended the amoco lease to clarify that the initial renewal term had actually commenced august,and add two additional renewal options which would commence,respectively,on august,and august.in,bp products exercised the first of these two additional options.
thereafter,during that first extension term,a series of assignments of the lessee interest in the amoco lease were made.first,in april,bp products assigned the lessee interest in the amoco lease to charles prieur,who,on that same day,assigned that interest to texaco refining and marketing,trmi.then,in december,trmi assigned the lessee interest in the amoco lease to star.finally,in february,star exercised the final amoco lease option,effective august.pursuant to this final extension,the amoco lease would and did expire on august.
on august,appellants and star signed a new lease agreement,which created the star lease,specifying an initial term of six years that commenced august,the day after the expiration of the amoco lease and expired august.the star lease was essentially identical to the amoco lease except that it specified a modest increase in star monthly rental commitment,provided star with one extension option,and contained environmental provisions,one of which addressed the remediation of,and liability for,hydrocarbon contamination which provisions were not contained in the amoco lease.the star lease also included a provision titled entirety of agreement the merger provision,which stated 
no prior stipulation,agreement or understanding,verbal or otherwise,of the parties or their agents shall be valid or enforceable unless embodied in the provisions of this lease.
in may,the star lease was assigned to motiva enterprises,llc motiva and in august,appellants and motiva extended the term of the star lease to february.consistent with the new provision for lessee responsibility for environmental clean up at the end of the star lease,appellants and motiva also agreed that at the expiration of the star lease in february,motiva would retain an environmental consultant to perform a phase ii site assessment report on the property.
in june,after the star lease had expired,appellants were informed that the property soil and groundwater were contaminated with petroleum products and other toxic substances attributable to the decades of operation of the service station on the premises.they filed the instant lawsuit seeking,inter alia,damages related to contamination of the property and contamination of their adjacent property at south carrollton avenue and south claiborne avenue the adjoining property resulting from migration of petroleum and other toxic agents from the property.
as one of the named defendants,bp products filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that the star lease constituted a novation of the amoco lease,one effect of which was to release bp a solidary of any duties to restore the property and repair any damage caused by its negligent acts and omissions while occupying the property and operating the service station on it.the district court agreed with bp products and dismissed it from the suit.in granting bp products motion on the ground of novation,the district court focused solely on the merger provision of the star lease,calling it completely unambiguous,completely clear evidence of the parties intent to novate.and,given that bp products was deemed a solidary with star,the district court released bp products from liability to appellants under the amoco lease pursuant to louisiana civil code article which provides in part that a novation made by the obligee and one of the obligors of a solidary obligation release the other solidary obligors.
appellants timely filed a notice of appeal,challenging the district court conclusion that the star lease constituted a novation of the amoco lease,absent which bp products would not be entitled to a release from liability under the amoco lease.having considered the parties arguments and the applicable law,and reviewed the record on appeal,we reverse the district court dismissal of bp products.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we resolve any doubts and draw any reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party moreover,i f any ambiguity exists in a contract,a fact issue remains regarding the parties intent thus precluding a grant of summary judgment.
we note at the outset that under louisiana law,the amoco lease constituted an obligation between appellants and bp products,specifically a conventional obligation or contract by virtue of this legal relationship,appellants and bp products each possessed particular rights and owed particular duties with respect to one another.appellants,as lessors,enjoyed,inter alia,the right to collect and owed duties to bp products such as delivering the property,maintaining it in a condition suitable for the purpose for which it was leased,and protecting bp products peaceful possession of it for the duration of the lease bp products,as lessee,enjoyed,inter alia,the right to use and enjoy the and owed duties to appellants such as paying the rent,using the property as a prudent administrator according to the purpose for which it was leased,and returning it at the end of the lease in the same condition as it was delivered,save for normal wear and tear even though courts and practitioners alike have loosely referred to these accompanying rights and the obligations,this word usage is technically imprecise.correctly put,though,these rights and duties are correlative to,and flow from,the overarching conventional or legal,the conventional obligation or contract of lease.it is important to distinguish the obligation from the rights and duties derived therefrom,as this distinction bears on the concept of novation,which is here at issue when the louisiana civil code speaks of novation,it is referring to the sub
