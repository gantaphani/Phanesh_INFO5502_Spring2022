this case calls on us to decide a matter of first impression regarding the application of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea,adopted by statute at,better known by their common acronym as the colregs.crowley marine services,crowley owned and operated a tug boat hired to accompany an oil tanker operated by maritrans operating company maritrans to an oil platform in the puget sound.during the crossing the two vessels collided,causing more than million in damages.
in the inevitable suit that followed,each side identified numerous violations of the colregs as the alleged cause of the collision.the district court apportioned fault for the accident as to crowley and to maritrans.the district court found that the two vessels were operating in concert according to agreed maneuvers,and therefore determined that several substantive provisions of the colregs at issue were inapplicable.specifically,the court ruled that this situation presented special circumstances that provide an exception to the colregs.we hold that the plain language of the colregs precludes such a broad exception,and remand for the district court to reconsider the relative liability of the parties consistent with this opinion.
background 
crowley provides vessel escort and assistance services in puget sound.federal law requires that any tanker transiting puget sound east of navigational buoy r with oil cargo must be escorted by two vessels.maritrans hired crowley to provide escort services for the allegiance,an oil tanker under the command of captain joseph semler,on the evening of january.crowley provided two tug boats the sea king,under the command of captain donald nekeferoff,and the chief,under the command of captain william lowery.
at,the three captains held a radio conference to plan the escort.according to the plan,the allegiance would travel east towards buoy r at a speed of about knots.while the allegiance was still two to three miles away,the two tugs would depart from buoy r at about knots.the allegiance would gradually overtake the two tugs and pass between them,at which point the tugs would take up position on either side of the tanker to complete the escort maneuver,with the chief tethered to the stern and the sea king on the tanker port shoulder.
for approximately the first minutes,the maneuver went according to plan.each of the three vessels sailed with set to degrees true,with the allegiance gradually overtaking the tug boats.during this time both the allegiance and the chief made numerous adjustments to their course to account for the fact that the vessel function maintains a ship heading the direction in which the bow points but does not reflect changes due to wind or currents.the sea king made no comparable adjustments to its course.
by,with the sea king still a short distance ahead,the pilot and helmsman aboard the allegiance realized that the tug boat was also closing the lateral distance between the vessels.nonetheless,both men testified that they had seen escort tugs running close alongside tankers many times before,and saw no cause for alarm.as the sea king came closer and closer,captain semler aboard the allegiance decided that the vessels proximity exceeded his comfort zone.although later testifying that he did not see any risk of collision,captain semler radioed captain nekeferoff aboard the sea king,inquiring,don,are you ok captain nekeferoff responded affirmatively.
shortly after the radio communication,the allegiance and the sea king collided,with the tug boat pushed along by the tanker bow and nearly capsizing as she rolled to the tanker starboard side while heeling to port.about halfway down the tanker side,the sea king righted itself as the tanker sailed past.the exact dynamics of the collision were disputed.crowley presented expert testimony that the two vessels gradually converged until the allegiance struck the sea king almost directly from behind.maritrans presented testimony that the sea king veered suddenly to starboard,into the path of the allegiance.
at trial,each side attributed fault entirely to the other,relying in large part on the colregs.the colregs provide a universal system of sea traffic rules applicable to vessels in international waters.william tetley,international maritime and admiralty law.originally adopted by treaty under the auspices of the international maritime organization in,the colregs have since been incorporated into the national law of every shipping nation in the world.id.these rules apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.rule a.
crowley argued that maritrans violated four provisions of the colregs rule,which establishes a duty to maintain a lookout rule,which establishes a duty to avoid collision rule,which makes an overtaking vessel responsible for avoiding collision and rule,which requires vessels in sight of each other to give a signal when changing course.maritrans countered that crowley violated rule by failing to maintain a proper lookout.maritrans also maintained that crowley reasonably should have investigated the risks stemming from captain nekeferoff history of alcoholism and health problems,conditions that appeared to be related to a temporary loss of situational awareness shortly before and during the collision.
the district court credited maritrans arguments,finding that because the two vessels were operating according to agreed maneuvers,rules and of the colregs did not apply.to reach this decision,the district court invoked rule,which provides that i n construing and complying with these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances,including the limitations of the vessels involved,which may make a departure from these rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.rule b.
although noting that the plain language of the special circumstances exception in rule did not provide such an exception on its face,the district court found that courts have either expanded the scope of rule b special circumstances or have created a wholly separate category of special circumstances involving vessels operating in concert and pursuant to agreed maneuvers.thus freed from the restrictions of rule and rule,which would have focused on maritrans fault for failing to avoid the sea king,the district court found maritrans to be only responsible for the accident.
this opinion addresses the proper scope of rule b special circumstances exception to the colregs.the remaining issues presented by crowley appeal are addressed in a separate memorandum disposition 
the district court observed that jurisprudence regarding the scope of the special circumstances exception has done little to clarify murky waters.this feeling is not unwarranted and may actually understate the dearth of applicable precedent.relevant case law largely dates to the early part of the last century,decades before the colregs were adopted in the.the permissive decisions in these cases have not been reconciled with the plain language construction of the contemporary colregs as a whole,thus leaving the murky waters alluded to by the district court.
i.the law governing collisions at sea 
three of the colregs collision avoidance rules are at issue two rules that govern a ship obligation to avoid collision,rules and,and one rule that provides an exception to the general rules,rule.crowley primarily alleges that the allegiance violated rule,which provides that any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.rule a.a ship is overtaking another when approaching from a direction more than degrees aft of perpendicular.rule b.further,w hen a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another,she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.rule c.the allegiance,which was approaching the sea king from at least degrees aft of perpendicular,was overtaking the tug.nothing in the text of rule allows us to escape the conclusion that as the overtaking vessel,the allegiance had the responsibility of avoiding the sea king.
crowley also argues that,by failing to slow do
