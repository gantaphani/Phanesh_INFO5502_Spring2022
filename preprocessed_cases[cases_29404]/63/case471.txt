seek review of four orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc relating to three pipeline capacity sale contracts between el paso natural gas company el paso and dynegy marketing and trade dynegy formerly national gas clearinghouse.petitioners contend that in approving the contracts,ferc abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not adhering more closely to antitrust principles,as instructed by the court in southern california edison ferc,socal ii,and as manifested by the purposes of ferc order and finding that a certain portion of the sold pipeline capacity,designated as block ii capacity,was not recallable if unused by dynegy.because the contracts expired in december,we hold that the issues underlying the petitions are moot,and accordingly,we dismiss the petitions.
el paso is one of four interstate pipelines delivering natural gas to california.in,one of el paso major firm gas transportation customers,pacific gas and electric company,notified el paso that it would terminate its entire contract of mainline capacity effective december.turnback,along with other smaller capacity relinquishments,would leave more than percent of el paso firm capacity unsubscribed.shortly thereafter,in,el paso negotiated a rate settlement with all of its direct customers concerning the impending excess capacity settlement.the settlement reduced el paso reservation charges and established a moratorium on general rate increases.the settlement also divided turnback capacity into three blocks,designated as blocks i,ii,and iii these blocks had receipt points and primary delivery points to topock,california.according to the settlement,block ii capacity was subject to certain recall rights,upon notice,in favor of shippers located in service territory in northern california.ferc approved the settlement on april.see el paso natural gas,reh g order.
although el paso continued to seek buyers for the excess capacity,as of august more than mmcf per day of firm capacity remained unsubscribed.el paso held an open season during august and september to sell the excess block ii and block iii capacity.in october,el paso entered into a transaction contract with dynegy that committed most of the unsubscribed block i,ii,and iii capacity to dynegy for a period,commencing january,and ending december.the transaction was divided into three separate contracts to reflect the different characteristics of the three blocks of capacity created by the settlement.each contract included a revenue reduction mechanism rrm,under which dynegy minimum pay obligation would be reduced if el paso sold interruptible capacity above certain volume levels in competition with dynegy resale of the firm capacity it had purchased from el paso.
on december,el paso filed for approval of a revised tariff to include the terms of the el transaction contract.see natural gas act,d nga on january,petitioners filed a protest,objecting,among other things,to the fact that the contracts,and particularly the rrm,were anticompetitive and inconsistent with the settlement.in the first challenged order,dated january,ferc authorized the contracts to become effective january,subject to refund and the outcome of a technical conference,which was held on march.see el paso natural gas,el paso i.
petitioners filed a request for rehearing of the january,order.as relevant here,petitioners argued that ferc must apply antitrust principles in examining issues of competition and discrimination raised by the el transaction.petitioners asserted that,in light of established antitrust principles,the rrm was per se unlawful because it tended to restrain competition in the secondary transportation market,and that the el contracts were in granting dynegy excessive market power upon el paso transfer of the purchased capacity.see el paso natural gas,at el paso ii.in addition,petitioners asserted that el paso block ii contract with dynegy contravened the settlement by effectively denying block ii shippers access to the northern california market.see id.at.
in its second challenged order,el paso ii,dated june,ferc denied the rehearing request.see el paso ii,at.in el paso ii,ferc held that,w hile it may apply concepts in analyzing competitive issues,it is not charged with administering or enforcing the antitrust laws.id.at.rather,its obligation was to examine each transaction in the context of ferc current regulatory paradigm under the natural gas act.id.the relevant regulatory structure,ferc stated,was set forth largely in its order and subsequent rehearing orders,which provide,among other things,that interstate gas pipelines are not required to discount below the maximum lawful rate contained in their tariffs.see id.citing order,order.further,ferc stated,order specifically rejected assertions that style regulation should play a central role in developing its regulatory paradigm.id.thus,ferc stated,the relevant analysis was whether,in light of the regulatory structure set forth in order,the contracts at issue were unduly discriminatory.see id.
applying this analytical structure,ferc concluded that,while the rrm reduced el paso incentive to compete and was therefore,it did not result in an unduly discriminatory situation in the gas transportation market to california.see id.at.first,the rate established by the contracts was far below the maximum transportation rate authorized by el paso tariff.see id.at.second,the effect of the transaction was diminished by the large amount of unutilized capacity that was available on pipelines serving california,the fact that this was a transaction,that gas demand was not expected to increase in california in the next two years,and that capacity release rates remain ed well below the maximum ceiling.id.at.in rejecting petitioners anticompetitiveness arguments,ferc also cited southern california edison company southern california gas company,reh g denied,socal i,where ferc dismissed a complaint alleging abuse of market power by the southern california gas company in the secondary release market for pipeline capacity on the ground that because the company had complied with the maximum tariff rate established by order,there was no need to engage in a further inquiry into market power.at.finally,ferc concluded that the contracts provisions concerning the recall of block ii capacity were not unduly discriminatory,holding that shippers located in northern california could not recall block ii capacity simply because the capacity was not actually used by dynegy.el paso ii,at.
after el paso ii,the parties submitted two compliance filings,protests to those filings,and two additional requests for rehearing.in their second and third rehearing requests,petitioners again raised two principal issues ferc obligation to address the allegedly nature of the transaction,and the right of certain shippers under the settlement to recall dynegy unused capacity to serve the northern california market.see el paso natural gas,el paso iii.in the meantime,the court reversed ferc decision in socal i and remanded the case to the agency,holding that ferc decision not to examine the market power issues raised by the petitioner was arbitrary and capricious.see socal ii,at.
in the third challenged order,el paso iii,dated july,ferc generally denied rehearing on the anticompetitiveness and block ii capacity issues.see el paso iii.ferc interpreted the recent socal ii decision as requiring it to examine allegations of behavior under its nga authority to prevent undue discrimination.see id.at.relying on supreme court and district of columbia circuit case law ferc stated that it need not pursue only the competitive concerns embodied in antitrust principles.id.at.rather,its duty,under the nga and socal ii,was to balance the transaction possible impact against the public policy goals in the nga,namely,to protect consumers against undue discrimination while also assuring that the pipeline has a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn an adequate return.id.at.given these considerations,ferc concluded that because dynegy competitors were able to obtain capacity and reach the california market,and because the tran
