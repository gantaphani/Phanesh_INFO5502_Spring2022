cherne contracting corporation cherne,a general contractor,sued marathon petroleum company,llc marathon,the owner and operator of a petroleum refinery in detroit,michigan,alleging breach of an implied contract and promissory estoppel.the district court granted summary judgment for marathon on all of cherne claims.cherne appeals,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
cherne is a michigan corporation with its principal place of business in minnesota.marathon is a delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in ohio.the amount in controversy is well in excess of,and we have diversity jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to and.
in early,marathon contacted cherne about performing revamp work at marathon detroit refinery in advance of and during a refinery turnaround initially scheduled for november.given the nature of the work to be performed,logistical difficulties with coordinating a complex project within an operating petroleum refinery,compressed time frames for completing work before and during the refinery turnaround,and incompletely defined engineering parameters,marathon determined that it needed to hire a general contractor.marathon also determined that it needed to seek a contract with a reimbursement scheme rather than a payment.when marathon described the project to cherne,cherne anticipated that the project would require approximately worker hours across several disciplines,including,but not limited to,electrical,piping,engineering,structural,insulation,and painting work.it is undisputed that both parties initially discussed the project as though they hoped that cherne would serve as general contractor for the entire project.
while it is clear that the parties had negotiated and communicated throughout winter and spring,they did not reach a final agreement.the parties appear to have been nearing agreement and,in fact,had mutually agreed upon reimbursement terms for time and materials as set forth in an april,proposal april proposal from cherne to provide labor and materials at cost plus a determined percentage.the parties documented many other terms in a draft agreement that remained unexecuted as of may.notwithstanding these attempts,the parties had not agreed upon an overall cost estimate or an overall scope of work.on may,marathon sent a letter of intent to cherne,and on may,cherne president accepted and signed the letter of intent the letter of intent referenced a termination provision from the draft agreement that permitted marathon to terminate the relationship without cause.the referenced provisions of the draft agreement also detailed the parties obligations regarding warranties,the return of materials,and the payment of reimbursable expenses in the event of termination.
the letter of intent stated that marathon intended to award a contract to cherne subject to several contingencies.relevant to the present appeal,these contingencies included cherne future agreement with marathon as to a cost estimate,determination of a scope of work to marathon satisfaction,and the parties execution of a final written contract.cherne agreed in the letter of intent to begin work on the project prior to the parties execution of the final contract.
the letter of intent authorized cherne to begin limited work for up to.as the original deadline listed in the letter of intent approached,the parties had not yet finalized their agreement and had not executed a written contract.in a first addendum dated may,the parties raised the cap on permissible work to and extended the deadline to june.in a second addendum dated june,the parties raised the cap on permissible work to,extended the deadline to june,and extended the permissible work under the letter of intent in accordance with a june email between the parties.that email referenced structural steel erection and an indirect mobilization estimate.in the email,as in the original letter of intent,cherne acknowledged that the parties had yet to determine an overall project scope,stating,upon determination of total project scope,we will perform a control estimate for project indirect costs which will be inclusive of the indirect mobilization costs outlined above.in a third addendum dated july,the parties extended the deadline to july without further extending the financial cap or the description of permissible work as referenced in the second addendum.the third addendum provided 
it is agreed that marathon will be directly involved with cherne planning efforts in terms of manpower loading,cherne staffing,equipment rentals,and temporary facilities.further,the indirect mobilization estimate will need to be reviewed in detail and approved by marathon as the overall and turnaround planning efforts are finalized.
upon proper signature below,this addendum shall serve,in advance of a fully executed contract,as cherne authorization to continue progressing the scope of work.
it is undisputed that the letter of intent and its addenda served as a valid contract governing the parties relationship between may,and july.each addendum stated that,except for the express revisions,the terms and conditions of the letter of intent remained in force.after july,cherne continued performing revamp work for marathon,and marathon continued paying cherne for the revamp work.cherne work for marathon substantially exceeded the financial cap of the second addendum,and marathon continued to pay cherne amounts in excess of that financial cap.the parties continued their relationship in this manner until september,when marathon project manager sent a letter to cherne terminating their working relationship effective september.
after receiving the termination letter,cherne responded by letter dated september,notifying marathon that cherne would be returning or delivering materials to marathon.cherne stated that it was returning materials with the understandings t hat marathon agrees that upon turnover of the materials to marathon,cherne will have fully completed its material turnover responsibilities related to the contract,that marathon would pay certain invoices,t hat,as cherne submits its remaining invoices related to the contract,marathon will continue to review and process such invoices in good faith,and that cherne was providing materials to marathon with no warranties or representations as to the condition of the materials.
ultimately,marathon paid almost all of cherne and invoices,totaling over.marathon,however,refused to reimburse cherne for approximately in severance payments that cherne had paid to select employees after marathon termination.marathon also refused to pay cherne for approximately in fees.
cherne filed the present action in december.notwithstanding cherne statements in its september letter referring to specific material turnover responsibilities related to the contract,cherne alleged that,after july,the parties relationship was no longer governed by the letter of intent,the termination clause of the draft agreement as incorporated by express reference within the letter of intent,or any written agreement with specific conditions regarding termination or responsibilities.rather,cherne argued that the parties had entered into an oral or implied contract that could not be terminated without cause.cherne argued it was entitled to,inter alia,expectation damages in the form of over million in profits it believed it would have received if it had performed all and turnaround work.in the alternative,cherne argued promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment,alleging that it had provided marathon a discounted rate in expectation of a greater scope of work.
marathon moved for summary judgment.the district court granted marathon motion,finding that the parties,by their conduct,had modified and extended the letter of intent and that the letter of intent authorized marathon to unilaterally terminate the relationship without cause.the district court noted that the parties agreed that their conduct established a contract following the july,deadline,and that the parties only disputed the terms of that contract.the court found,although the scope of and expenditures for cherne work exceeded the letter terms,the parties conduct established their mutual assent to the modification of those terms.the court proceeded to conduct an analysis of the termination provisions of the draft agreement as incorporated into the letter of intent and held that marathon retained the right to terminate the relationship with cherne.finally,the district court rejected the promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment theories as inconsistent with the parties position and the court finding that a contract governed their relationship 
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.in re.mut.life ins.sales practices,cir.the parties agree that minnesota contract law governs in this case.minnesota law provides that a court is to determine whether a written contract is ambiguous,and if it is unambiguous,the court is to construe the contract as a matter of law.denelsbeck wells fargo,the construction and effect of a contract is also a question of law unless the contract is ambiguous.art goebel,suburban agencies,the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for this court to decide.in determining whether a written contract is ambiguous,the court is not to give words cramped,unnatural,or readings but to assess the meaning assigned to the words or phrases in accordance with the apparent purpose of the contract as a whole.art goebel,at.further,when the intention of the parties to a contract is ascertainable from the writing,construction is for the court.lasociete generale immobiliere minneapolis cmty.dev.agency,cir.
if reference to disputed extrinsic facts is required to resolve an ambiguity in a contract,a jury is to determine the relevant facts.see turner alpha phi sorority house,the construction and effect of a contract are questions of law for the court,but where there is ambiguity and construction depends upon extrinsic evidence and a writing,there is a question of fact for the jury.also,a jury is to decide material questions of fact regarding the existence or terms of an oral or implied contract.see bergstedt wahlberg,berquist,rothchild,whether a contract is to be implied in fact is usually a question to be determined by the trier of fact as an inference of facts to be drawn from the conduct and statements of the parties.that is not to say,however,that the existence of disputed terms in oral or implied contracts,or ambiguities in written contracts,necessarily preclude summary judgment.rather,as with the analysis for summary judgment in any case,where no reasonable jury could find the facts necessary to entitle a plaintiff to relief,summary judgment remains appropriate.see celotex catrett,d stating that summary judgment is appropriate where there is no dispute as to a material fact.
here,undisputed facts demonstrate that the parties established a contract by their conduct following july,and that the resulting contract was an extension of the written letter of intent.further,we find that the terms of the letter of intent unambiguously grant marathon termination rights.accordingly,we agree with the district court that the letter of intent continued to govern the parties relationship after july,and that marathon properly terminated the relationship consistent with its rights as set out in the letter of intent.
conduct of the parties 
several aspects of the parties conduct following july,support the inference that the parties impliedly extended and modified the letter of intent.see fischer pinske,holding that continuation of a business relationship without material change after expiration of contract resulted in extension of original contract see also house baxter,reversing and remanding with instructions to consider whether conduct demonstrated an intent to impliedly extend terms of original contract.initially,we note that neither party materially changed its course of performance after the letter of intent stated expiration date.the only aspects of performance that arguably were inconsistent with the letter of intent and its addenda were the scope of,and financial cap upon,cherne work cherne work and marathon payment exceeded that described in the letter of intent and its written addenda.given the series of three written addenda preceding july,however,the parties had already established a pattern of extending the scope and scale of their time and materials relationship in the absence of a final written agreement.
by its express terms,the letter of intent required cherne to cease work and return materials to marathon only if the deadline for execution of a contract passed and if marathon failed to extend the letter of intent.see letter of intent,supra emphasized provisions.the letter of intent did not specify a particular means for marathon to extend the letter of intent,but it clearly gave marathon the right to extend.we can discern no basis for viewing marathon continued performance and acceptance of cherne continued,unaltered performance as anything other than an extension of the letter of intent.
second,after marathon terminated the parties relationship,cherne expressly referenced the written termination provisions from the draft contract as incorporated into the letter of intent,returned materials in accordance with these provisions,and disclaimed any warranties,as per these provisions.cherne stated expressly in its september,letter that it was returning materials to fulfill its material turnover responsibilities related to the contract.in the district court and on appeal,cherne offers no explanation as to what it was referencing in the september letter if not the letter of intent and the termination provisions incorporated therein.
as explained below,cherne made clear at oral argument that it is asserting the existence of an implied or oral contract largely void of any detailed terms addressing such fine matters as material turnover responsibilities.accordingly,not only is cherne reference in the september letter consistent with extension of the letter of intent and its incorporated termination provisions,it is inconsistent with the simple,unadorned contract cherne urges us to find in the record.
finally,cherne submitted invoices seeking payment and in fact received payment for services rendered,as per the april proposal incorporated into the letter of intent and as per its conduct.not until long after termination and after pursuing a course of conduct consistent with continued applicability of the letter of intent did cherne eventually assert a claim for over million in expectation damages based on an alleged promise of of labor and attendant material sales.while we do not suggest that cherne is somehow estopped from presenting its current theory,it is difficult to appreciate how a reasonable jury might find the existence of this type of guaranteed contract for hours in light of cherne compliance with,and reference to,the letter of intent in september.
in sum,the parties conduct points solely toward the conclusion,as reached by the district court,that the parties intended the letter of intent to continue governing their relationship after july and in the absence of a final written agreement.even if the record were amenable to a different interpretation,nothing that cherne identifies suggests that the parties,at any time,contemplated a requirement that termination be allowed only for cause.see,house,at there is no evidence of the parties conduct following the expiration date which implies a contract to require cause.
cherne position as to,contract terms 
in its opinion,the district court stated in a footnote that several statements and communications cited by cherne as support for a contract with a greater scope of work did not establish the necessary offer evidencing marathon willingness to be bound by such a term or acceptance of such a term by cherne.on appeal,cherne relies upon these several statements as well as deposition testimony from three marathon employees to support its position.we address below the terms of the contract cherne asks us to find as well as those elements of the record that cherne cites as support for its position.
at oral argument,cherne clarified what it alleged to be the term
