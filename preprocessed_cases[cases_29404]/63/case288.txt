the parties cross appeal the district court decision granting in part and denying in part their dispositive motions regarding environmental claims brought by the washington environmental council wec and the sierra club,washington state chapter,collectively,plaintiffs under the provision of the federal clean air act caa.plaintiffs seek to compel the washington state department of ecology ecology and other regional agencies collectively,the agencies to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the state five oil refineries under the caa.the western states petroleum association wspa,whose members include those refineries,intervened on behalf of the agencies.specifically,plaintiffs claim that the agencies failed to define emission limits called reasonably available control technology ract for greenhouse gases,and apply those limits to the oil refineries,in violation of two provisions of washington caa state implementation plan sip the ract standard and narrative standard.the district court awarded plaintiffs summary judgment on their ract claim,but dismissed their narrative claim.the court enjoined defendants to complete the ract process for the refineries by may.
on appeal,wspa argues that plaintiffs lack article iii standing.we agree with wspa,and hold that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the causality and redressability requirements to establish article iii standing.accordingly,we vacate the district court order on the parties dispositive motions and remand with instructions that the action be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
facts and prior proceeding 
greenhouse gas emissions 
greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to what is known as the greenhouse effect.see endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under section a of the clean air act,massachusetts epa,d.greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide,methane,nitrous oxide,hydrofluorocarbons,perfluorocarbons,and sulfur hexafluoride,among others collectively,greenhouse gases or ghgs.at.both natural and sources contribute to greenhouse gases,which are mixed and dispersed in the global atmosphere.id.although there is continuing scientific debate regarding some of the causes,projections,and effects of global warming,we assume for the purposes of this opinion that global temperatures have increased over the past fifty years and that greenhouse gases are contributing to global climate change.the environmental protection agency epa has announced that six greenhouse gases taken in combination may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare.at see also id.at discussing adverse environmental effects and other dangers resulting from greenhouse gas emissions am.power connecticut,d aep 
in washington,plaintiffs allege and defendants admit that greenhouse gases have caused changes,such as rising sea levels,coastal flooding,acidification of marine waters,declines in shellfish production,impacts to snow pack and water supplies,agricultural impacts on the east side of the cascades,and changes in forest fires.compl.the governor of washington declared that greenhouse gases are air contaminants within the meaning of the state clean air act and pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of washington citizens and the quality of the environment.state of.governor exec.order,washington leadership on climate change may.
in this case,there is no dispute that the five oil refineries in washington bp cherry point,conocophillips,shell oil,tesoro,and oil collectively,oil refineries emit greenhouse gases.they are each members of intervenor defendant wspa,a trade association that represents the interests of the petroleum and petroleum products industry in several states,including washington.specifically,the refineries emit three greenhouse gases carbon dioxide,methane,and nitrous oxides during the conversion of crude oil into usable petroleum products,and they publicly report their annual greenhouse gas emission levels most of the refineries ghg emissions are carbon dioxide.the collective ghg emission levels for the five refineries in were million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.this figure approximates current greenhouse gas emission levels from the refineries.ecology reported that the total greenhouse gas emissions in washington in were million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.thus,in,ghg emissions from the oil refineries were approximately of the total greenhouse gas emissions in washington.
regulatory framework caa and sips 
the clean air act authorizes the creation of air quality standards for a number of pollutants.these standards are called the national ambient air quality standards naaqs.a,b.the caa instructs the epa to publish a list of air pollutants that cause or contribute to air pollution and to issue naaqs for each pollutant it has identified.a,a.the epa refers to the air pollutants for which it has established naaqs as criteria pollutants or naaqs pollutants.see.to date,the epa has developed naaqs for six criteria pollutants sulfur dioxide,particulate matter,carbon monoxide,ozone,nitrogen dioxide,and lead.the epa has not established naaqs for greenhouse gases.
to ensure that air quality standards are met,the caa establishes a cooperative scheme that relies heavily on state participation.safe air for everyone epa,cir.once the epa sets the criteria pollutants,each state must propose a sip for the implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of the ambient air quality standards,a,which is subject to the epa review and approval.safe air for everyone,at bayview hunters point cmty.advocates metro.transp.comm n,cir.when the epa approves a sip,it becomes federal law and federally enforceable,and must be carried out by the state.safe air for everyone,at bayview hunters,at.
in washington,the agencies are responsible for implementing the caa requirements.the epa approved certain revisions to the sip submitted by ecology in.june.at issue in this case are two provisions in the sip the ract standard and narrative standard codified in the washington administrative code wac.
first,the ract standard provides in relevant part 
all emissions units are required to use reasonably available control technology ract which may be determined for some sources or source categories to be more stringent than the applicable emission limitations of any chapter of title wac.where current controls are determined to be less than ract,the permitting authority shall,as provided in rcw,define ract for each source or source category and issue a rule or regulatory order requiring the installation of ract.
wac.ract is defined as the lowest emission limit that a particular source or source category is capable of meeting by the application of control technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.wac.emissions unit is any part of a stationary source or source which emits or would have the potential to emit any pollutant subject to regulation under the federal clean air act.wac.as referenced in the ract standard,the revised code of washington rcw states in part that i n establishing or revising ract requirements,ecology and local authorities shall address,where practicable,all air contaminants deemed to be of concern for that source or source category.rcw.oil refineries qualify as sources or source categories.see wac rcw.each of the five oil refineries in washington constitutes a source of air contaminants subject to the state sip.wac rcw.
second,the narrative standard provides 
no person shall cause or allow the emission of any air contaminant from any source if it is detrimental to the health,safety,or welfare of any person,or causes damage to property or business.
wac.the term air contaminant,referenced in both the ract and narrative standards,is synonymous with air pollutant and is broadly defined in the sip to mean dust,fumes,mist,smoke,other particulate matter,vapor,gas,odorous substance,or any combination thereof.wac rcw.the washington governor executive order declared that greenhouse gases are air contaminants.exec.order.the supreme court has also held that the sweeping definition of air pollutant under the caa encompasses carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.massachusetts,at aep.at.
the agencies admit that they have never set or applied ract standards for ghg emissions at the oil refineries.plaintiffs insist,therefore,that the agencies must do so pursuant to the mandate in sip.defendants argue that washington sip is not federally enforceable as to regulation of greenhouse gases under rcw because they are not properly criteria pollutants with recognized naaqs.
procedural history 
in march,plaintiffs filed their complaint against the agencies,asserting two claims under the caa provision,a.under count i,plaintiffs claim that the agencies failed to establish ract standards for greenhouse gas emissions from the oil refineries,in violation of the ract standard,wac and rcw.under count ii,plaintiffs claim that the agencies have allowed the oil refineries to emit greenhouse gases,thereby failing to protect the health,safety,and welfare of washingtonians,their property,and business,in violation of the narrative standard,wac plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and an injunction requiring the agencies to set racts for ghg emissions from the oil refineries.
in july,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their claims.wspa successfully moved to intervene as a defendant,and filed a for summary judgment.wspa further moved to strike several of plaintiffs exhibits and standing declarations.the agencies moved to dismiss the case under federal rule of civil procedure b.
in december,the district court issued its order on the parties dispositive motions.the court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on count i,concluding that the ract provision plainly applies to greenhouse gases emitted by the oil refineries.the court,however,dismissed plaintiffs narrative claim as unenforceable because it concluded the provision was overly broad and aspirational.the court granted wspa motion to strike several of plaintiffs exhibits as irrelevant,but otherwise denied it as to plaintiffs standing declarations.after additional briefing,the district court denied wspa motion for reconsideration.in march,the district court issued its order on remedies enjoining defendants to determine ract for the oil refineries within months.the parties timely appealed.

discussion 
defendants contend for the first time on appeal that this case must be dismissed for lack of article iii standing,or in the alternative,because plaintiffs lack statutory standing.although defendants did not advance these objections below,we may consider them here,since a jurisdictional defect is a challenge that may be raised at any time during the proceedings,including on appeal.see united states hays,d renee duncan,cir.we also have an independent duty to assure that standing exists,irrespective of whether the parties challenge it.summers earth island,d.
standing general requirements 
a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he or she seeks to press and for each form of relief sought.daimlerchrysler cuno,d.the plaintiff also bears the burden of proof to establish standing with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.while a t the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,in responding to a summary judgment motion,the plaintiff can no longer rest on such mere allegations,but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts,which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.id.citation and quotes omitted accord gerlinger amazon.com,cir.a plaintiff basis for standing must affirmatively appear in the record.salmon spawning recovery alliance gutierrez,cir citation and quotes omitted.
where,as here,plaintiffs are organizations,they may assert standing on behalf of their members as long as the members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d see also nrdc,at.
in this case,plaintiffs wec and the sierra club are conservation groups dedicated to environmental protection in washington state.the wec focuses on state level and implementation.it consists of roughly member households and member organizations.its members routinely enjoy recreation in the north cascades,olympic,and mount rainer national parks.the sierra club,with approximately members in washington,is dedicated to exploring,enjoying,and protecting waterways,mountains,forests,sustainable agriculture,air quality,and global and regional climates.the sierra club regularly organizes outings for its members in public places.in support of standing,three members of wec and three members of the sierra club each submitted affidavits attesting to their current and future injuries resulting from elevated levels of greenhouse gases.thus,the relevant inquiry is whether at least one member from each group has established standing to sue in his or her right.carrico city and cnty.of san francisco,cir.
ii.constitutional requirements 
for article iii standing,a plaintiff must satisfy three irreducible constitutional minimum requirements he or she suffered an injury in fact that is concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.lujan,at see also nrdc,at.
injury in fact 
plaintiffs allege that defendants failure to set and apply ract standards has contributed to greenhouse gas pollution and caused their members to suffer recreational,aesthetic,economic,and health injuries,in violation of the ract and narrative provisions.an environmental plaintiff may satisfy the injury requirement by showing that the challenged activity impairs his or her economic interests or a esthetic and environmental.natural res.def.council epa,cir quoting sierra club morton,d see also friends of the earth,at e nvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.citation and quotes omitted.injury may also include the risk of future harm,a connection to the area of concern sufficient to make credible the contention that the person future life will be less enjoyable that he or she really has or will suffer in his or her degree of aesthetic or recreational satisfaction if the area in question remains or becomes environmentally degraded.ocean advocates army corps.eng rs,cir quoting ecological rights found.pac.lumber,cir.
wec and sierra club members have submitted declarations attesting to specific aesthetic and recreational injuries allegedly resulting from the agencies failure to control greenhouse gas emissions.scott stromatt,an officer and member of the sierra club,states that his members enjoyment of outings to washington natural areas has and will be diminished because those areas have been impacted by climate change through changes in precipitation patterns,reduction of glaciers,changes in wildlife habitat,and increased risk of forest fire.stromatt decl.for example,terese vanassche a member and volunteer of the sierra club for years is an avid snowshoer who routinely travels to rainer,shuksan and baker,stevens pass lanham lake,and the wild sky wilderness.vanassche decl.she states that her ability to engage in snowshoeing has been diminished because of elevated levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,which have increased temperatures and reduced snow pack in washington.id.due to reduced snow pack in and,she was forced to either cancel snowshoeing and ski trips or change their venue.id.she states that future outings to those locations are threatened by poor snow pack and high avalanche conditions.id.likewise,wec members david gorton and jabez blumenthal are skiers who are concerned that increased alpine temperatures and decreased snow pack have reduced and will reduce the viability of their favorite ski spots at snoqualmie pass and shorten the ski season at those locations.gorton decl.blumenthal decl.in addition to skiing,gorton enjoys backpacking at least five times a year throughout the cascades and the olympics.gorton decl.he states that climate changes have degraded and will degrade the habitat of native species,thereby decreasing his enjoyment of the environments near crater peak.id.blumenthal,too,enjoys other recreational activities,including hiking,mountaineering,and glacier climbing.he is concerned that climate change will negatively affect his enjoyment of climbing the glaciated volcanoes in washington and rainier.blumenthal decl.
wec and sierra club members further state that their properties have been damaged by climate change.for example,rodney brown,a wec officer and member,attests that flooding from the teanaway river has eroded his acre farmland.brown decl.he is concerned that flooding and decreased water availability will further reduce the benefits from and enjoyment of his property.id.gorton similarly states that flooding particularly heavy rains in has damaged his seattle home and threatens further harm to his property.gorton decl.blumenthal also attests that his acre ranch in eastern washington has been,twice,burned by wildfires,charring his once ridge into a row of black dead spikes.blumenthal.he fears that as global climate change worsens,the frequency and intensity of wildfires near his property will increase,and diminish the value and enjoyment of his property.id.
finally,plaintiffs members claim that their or their family health has been negatively affected by climate changes.for instance,aaron robins,a member of the sierra club,is an asthma patient who is concerned that his health is personally endangered by uncontrolled climate pollution from oil refineries operating with outdated equipment and processes.robins.vanassche son also suffers from muscular dystrophy that has diminished his capacity to clear his lungs of air pollutants.she and her son live four miles from two oil refineries emitting greenhouse gases in washington.vanassche decl.she fears that higher air temperatures and ozone pollution exacerbated by global warming expose her son to increased respiratory problems.id.vanassche has expended significant time and resources in caring for her son while he suffers from air ailments.id.
defendants do not dispute the accuracy of these statements of injuries.nor do they challenge their legal sufficiency.for the purposes of this case,we assume without deciding,that the declarations submitted by wec and sierra club members have provided specific facts,lujan,at,of immediate and concrete injuries.natural res.def.council,at friends of the earth,at.plaintiffs have therefore satisfied the first prong under lujan.
plaintiffs allege that their injuries are causally linked to the agencies failure to set and apply ract standards.wspa contends that the chain of causality between defendants alleged misconduct and their injuries is too attenuated.wspa argues that plaintiffs do not,and can not,show causality.we agree.
to satisfy the causality element for article iii standing,plaintiffs must show that the injury is causally linked or fairly traceable to the agencies alleged misconduct,and not the result of misconduct of some third party not before the court.see lujan,at.the line of causation between the defendant action and the plaintiff harm must be more than attenuated.native vill.of kivalina exxonmobil,cir citations and quotes omitted,cert denied,d.a causal chain does not fail simply because it has several links,provided those links are not hypothetical or tenuous and remain plausible.id.citations,quotes,and bracket omitted.nor does standing require the defendant action to be the sole source of injury.see barnum timber epa,cir.nevertheless,where the causal chain involves numerous third parties whose independent decisions collectively have a significant effect on plaintiffs injuries,the causal chain is too weak to support standing.native vill.of kivalina,at citations,quotes,and bracket omitted.
we assume without deciding that sources of ghg emissions are causally linked to global warming and detrimental climate change.see massachusetts,at barnes dep t of,cir.at.plaintiffs provide a litany of adverse environmental effects in washington,which defendants do not dispute,and are supported by various research reports increased temperatures,changes in precipitation and snow pack,flooding and storm damages,increased wildfires,adverse effects on agriculture and irrigation,disruptions to ecosystems,decreases in forest productivity,among others.the epa,too,admonishes that e ach additional ton of greenhouse gases emitted commits us to further change and greater risks,citation and quotes omitted.
we do not discount the gravity of these asserted environmental effects or gainsay the epa warning that continuing greenhouse gas emissions creates greater risks of harm.however,we may act only where we are granted power to do so by the constitution and applicable statutes and regulations.exxon mobil allapattah,d.one such limitation on our power to act is article iii standing.see bender williamsport area sch,d.under lujan causality prong,plaintiffs must show that a causal connection exists between their asserted injuries and the conduct complained of,the agencies failure to set and apply ract standards.therein lies the problem.plaintiffs offer only vague,conclusory statements that the agencies failure to set ract standards at the oil refineries contributes to greenhouse gas emissions,which in turn,contribute to changes that result in their purported injuries.see,vanassche decl.i fear that continuing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities and other sources,including the oil refineries that operate in washington state,will contribute to further reductions of winter snowpack in the region and make it more difficult or impossible for me to engage in snowshoeing in the future.stromatt decl.t he failure of the agencies to take the actions described will result in additional greenhouse gas emissions in washington state that will exacerbate changes to the regional and global climates.gorton decl.the failure of the clean air agencies to require ract that can result in reductions to greenhouse gas emissions at the oil refineries has harmed me,and other wec members,by failing to reduce and control air pollutant emissions that cause or contribute to climate change and its negative impacts on my property,my health,and my way of life.plaintiffs causal chain from lack of ract controls to plaintiffs injuries consists of a series of links strung together by conclusory,generalized statements of contribution,without any plausible scientific or other evidentiary basis that the refineries emissions are the source of their injuries.while plaintiffs need not connect each molecule to their injuries,simply saying that the agencies have failed to curb emission of greenhouse gases,which contribute in some undefined way and to some undefined degree to their injuries,relies on an attenuated chain of conjecture insufficient to support standing.salmon spawning,at quoting ecological rights,at.plaintiffs thus have failed to satisfy their evidentiary burden of showing causality at the summary judgment stage.see lujan,at 
indeed,attempting to establish a causal nexus in this case may be a particularly challenging task.this is so because there is a natural disjunction between plaintiffs localized injuries and the greenhouse effect.greenhouse gases,once emitted from a specific source,quickly mix and disperse in the global atmosphere and have a long atmospheric lifetime.current research on how greenhouse gases influence global climate change has focused
