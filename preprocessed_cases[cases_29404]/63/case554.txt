this appeal arises out of soil and groundwater contamination caused by gasoline leakage from an underground storage tank at a service station formerly operated by respondent morris shachory shachory,a sublessee of respondent atlantic richfield company arco.the appellants parviz david shamsian shamsian and roya goltche goltche,the current possessors of the property,seek to hold shachory and arco collectively,respondents liable for statutory penalties,damages,future remediation,and injunctive relief.the trial court granted summary judgment for the respondents,which the appellants now challenge.
we hold that the appellants cause of action for civil penalties brought under health and safety code section,the civil enforcement provision in the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of the act is barred by the limitation in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a further,we conclude that there are triable issues as to whether the appellants nuisance and trespass causes of action are barred by the limitation set forth in section,subdivision b,and as to whether the appellants are entitled to a declaration of rights regarding future remediation,but that there are no triable issues as to whether the respondents are liable for negligent misrepresentation.finally,even though the appellants may not state a cause of action for injunctive relief,we instruct the trial court on remand to permit the appellants to incorporate their request for injunctive relief into their nuisance cause of action.we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural history 
background.
from november,to september,shachory subleased property in los angeles the property from arco for the purpose of operating a service station.in the late,site investigations revealed the presence of hydrocarbons in the subsurface soil and groundwater,prompting arco to initiate a remediation program.in,geraghty miller,an environmental services company working on behalf of arco,prepared a site closure request for the los angeles regional water quality control board rwqcb summarizing the remediation efforts,the removal of contaminants,and the results of various tests.in response to and based on the site closure request,the rwqcb issued a no further action letter indicating that arco had completed the site investigation and remedial action.
in,shamsian negotiated a ground lease of the property on behalf of his wife,goltche,which she signed on december,before goltche signed,however,shamsian briefly reviewed the site closure request prepared by geraghty miller,for the rwqcb.when the appellants contractor began installing new underground storage tanks,he discovered a strong odor and discolored soil.subsequently,the appellants hired environmental managers auditors,to determine whether the subsurface soil and groundwater had been impacted with hydrocarbons.in may,environmental managers auditors,reported that the property was contaminated above regulatory limits,and in greater levels than detected by geraghty miller.
the complaint.
on may,the appellants filed suit,inter alia,against arco and shachory.against arco,the appellants alleged a cause of action for civil penalties,alleging that arco violated health and safety code section by knowingly discharging chemicals in such a manner likely to contaminate a source of drinking water.additionally,the appellants sued arco and shachory for private nuisance,trespass,negligent misrepresentation,declaratory relief and injunctive relief.the negligent misrepresentation claim was based on shamsian alleged reliance on the site closure request in making the decision for the appellants to enter into the ground lease for the property.
arco and shachory motions for summary judgment or adjudication.
in its motion,arco argued that the appellants cause of action for civil penalties is barred by the limitation in section,subdivision a.the respondents,in both their motions,argued that the nuisance and trespass causes of action are barred by the limitation in section,subdivision b because this action was filed more than three years after shachory vacated the property in and arco vacated the property in,and because the nuisance is permanent rather than continuing.both respondents urged the trial court to conclude that the nuisance is permanent based on the determination by rwqcb that arco completed the necessary corrective action in.further,they argued that even if the nuisance was a continuing one,the claim would have to fail because the appellants have not suffered allowable damages.regarding the negligent misrepresentation claim,both respondents argued that the site closure request made no misrepresentations.finally,both respondents argued that the appellants declaratory relief and injunctive relief claims fail if all the other claims fail.
the trial court ruling,the judgment,and this appeal.
after oral argument,the trial court ruled as follows the cause of action for civil penalties is barred by section,subdivision a.the nuisance and trespass causes of action are barred by section,subdivision b because the appellants interrogatory responses indicate that the chemical releases occurred while arco franchisee operated the premises,before.further,the rwqcb determined on that arco had abated the contamination in compliance with regulatory standards.that determination has not been reopened or set aside.there is no triable issue as to whether either arco or shachory misrepresented any facts to the appellants.because the appellants have not suffered any loss through the payment of an adverse judgment or settlement,the declaratory relief cause of action and request for equitable indemnity lack merit.finally,the absence of a viable substantive claim forecloses the request for injunctive relief.
thereafter,the trial court entered judgment for arco and shachory.this timely appeal followed.
the rwqcb october,case reopen letter.
after this appeal was filed,the rwqcb sent a case reopen letter to arco,stating in part this letter is written with regard to the need for a renewed investigation of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe pollution at the subject site.on october,this regional board issued a case closure letter for the site.at the time of closure,no mtbe analytical data related to the underground storage tank ust release were available for review by the regional board staff.since then,the r egional board has increased awareness of mtbe impact to the groundwater.the letter refers to the report prepared by environmental managers auditors,then states that the rwqcb has determined that the groundwater at the site has been impacted by mtbe and plume beneath the site has not been adequately assessed.you are required to submit a workplan for groundwater investigation.

discussion 
i.the civil penalties cause of action 
health and safety code section provides in relevant part that n o person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or onto or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water.section,subdivision b establishes that any person who violates health and safety code section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed per day for each violation.pursuant to health and safety code section,subdivision d,a civil action may be brought by any person in the public interest,so long as state and local prosecuting agencies have been notified of the violation and declined to pursue an enforcement action.
section,subdivision a governs a cause of action for civil penalties under the act.
the appellants contend that the limitation set forth in section,subdivision b applies to an action filed under health and safety code section,but the respondents disagree,urging us to conclude that this cause of action is governed by the limitation set forth in section,subdivision a.for reasons we discuss,we agree with the respondents.
the act does not specify a limitation on actions under health and safety code section,and no reported decision has determined which section of the code of civil procedure applies.therefore,we are presented with an issue of first impression,and our task is to resolve it by interpreting the competing statutes.we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing com.cal d.
we begin with section.subdivision a of that statute provides that within three years a party may bring a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.subdivision b of that statute provides that within three years a party may bring a n action for trespass upon or injury to real property.if we construe this statute as providing a limitation on an action for a civil penalty if the action happens to relate to an injury to property,it would create discord between subdivisions a and b.the question is whether we can avoid such discord without doing violence to either subdivision.we answer in the affirmative.subdivision b pertains to an action for injury to real property,but the act only authorizes actions for civil penalties and injunctive relief.while damage a particular person suffers could be a factor for a trial court to consider when imposing a civil penalty it is not the deciding factor,illustrating that an action for a civil penalty and an action for injury to real property are different in kind even if they are based on the same wrong.further,the civil penalty provided is penal,not compensatory,which serves to amplify the distinction.as a result,we conclude that subdivision b does not apply to a claim for civil penalties,and subdivision a operates to exclude causes of action for civil penalties from the scope of section.
next,we turn to section,subdivision a,which provides that within one year a party may bring a n action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture,if the action is given to an individual,or to an individual and the state,except if the statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation.this statute fits the appellants first cause of action because it is based upon a statute for a penalty which has been given to individuals as well as the state.any other interpretation would violate the plain language of section,subdivision a.moreover,this interpretation brings section,subdivision a into harmony with section,subdivision b.accordingly,we conclude that a limitation applies.
finally,we look to prior case law for affirmation.generally,section,subdivision a applies if a civil penalty is mandatory.jensen bmw of north america,th,d.in addition,the settled rule in california is that statutes which provide for recovery of damages additional to actual losses incurred,such as double or treble damages,are considered penal in nature citations,and thus governed by the period of limitations stated in section,subdivision a.citations.mts,d.health and safety code section,subdivision b provides that any person who violates health and safety code section shall be liable for a civil penalty.also,it provides a recovery in addition to the damages a plaintiff might otherwise recover,and it is therefore penal.because the civil penalty is mandatory and penal,and the act does not specify a different limitation on actions,prior case law supports our application of section,subdivision a 
to convince us to reach a different conclusion,the appellants refer us to wilshire westwood associates atlantic richfield th,d wilshire westwood and section neither persuades us to a contrary view.wilshire westwood states that a limitation applies to an action based on ultrahazardous activity wilshire westwood,supra,at,d,but that case is distinguishable because it did not involve a cause of action for civil penalties under the health and safety code.moreover,section establishes a limitation on actions brought pursuant to chapters,and of the health and safety code,but section falls within chapter.
c.the appellants claim for civil penalties is untimely.
in the complaint,and also in their appellate briefs,the appellants concede that they discovered the contamination by at least may,which is more than one year before this action was filed.the appellants make no argument that this claim survives the limitation.consequently,we can only conclude that this claim is untimely and the trial court did not err in so ruling.
ii.private nuisance.
nuisance law.
anything which is injurious to health or an obstruction to the free use of property is a nuisance.a nuisance which affects at the same time an entire community or neighborhood,or any considerable number of persons is called a public nuisance.if a nuisance is not a public one,then it is called a private nuisance.
depending upon its nature,a nuisance is either permanent or continuing.a permanent nuisance is generally of a type where a single occurrence causes permanent injury,and damages are assessed once and for all.citation.but where the nuisance involves a use which may be discontinued at any time,it is characterized as a continuing nuisance citation.the crucial test of a continuing nuisance is whether the offensive condition can be discontinued or abated at any time.citations.in case of doubt as to the permanency of the injury the plaintiff may elect whether to treat a particular nuisance as permanent or continuing.citation.wilshire westwood,supra,th at,d.
relevant to this case,a current possessor of property has a cause of action against a prior possessor who created a nuisance on the property.see mangini d.mangini.
section,subdivision b,accrual of tort claims,and the delayed discovery rule.
a nuisance claim alleging damage to real property is subject to the limitation provided by section,subdivision b.see wilshire westwood,supra,th at,d.if a nuisance is permanent,the plaintiff must bring one action for past,present and future damage within three years after the creation of the permanent nuisance.citation.ibid.however,if a nuisance is continuing,the persons harmed by it may bring successive actions for damages until the nuisance is abated.citation.ibid.
with respect to torts,generally speaking,a claim accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run upon the occurrence of the last event essential to the cause of action,even if the plaintiff is unaware that a cause of action exists.citation.the infliction of actual and appreciable harm will commence the limitations period.citation.see wilshire westwood,supra,th at,d.however,the discovery rule postpones commencement of the limitation period until the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the facts essential to his cause of action.citation.under this rule,p ossession of presumptive as well as actual knowledge will commence the running of the statute.citation.a plaintiff is charged with presumptive knowledge so as to commence the running of the statute once he or she has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry,or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation citations.id.at,d.
c.there is a triable issue regarding the statute of limitations.
according to the appellants,their nuisance claim survives because it was brought within three years of their discovery of the contamination and,in any event,the nuisance is a continuing one.the respondents argue that the nuisance is permanent because it has been abated and this claim is time barred because it accrued no later than september,the last date on which shachory occupied the property.because we conclude that there is a triable issue as to whether the nuisance is a continuing one,the respondents position lacks merit.
whether contamination is a permanent or continuing nuisance is generally a question of fact.see mangini,supra,d at.so it is here.
below,the respondents submitted the no further action letter,which stated this letter confirms the completion of the site investigation and remedial action for the underground storage tank s based on the available information and with the provision that the information provided to this agency was accurate and representative of site conditions,no further action related to the underground storage tank release is required.this letter was sent in response to the site disclosure request prepared by geraghty miller.
the site disclosure request indicated in the findings and conclusions that due to soil vapor extraction activity,pounds of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph and tph as were removed from the soil.the results of a soil vapor rebound test conducted in april suggest that residual soil is not present at the site.nine soil confirmation samples indicate that the remediation was effective in removing tph and benzene,toluene,ethylbenzene,and xylene btex from the soil.the groundwater treatment system was used to treat approximately gallons of groundwater and was effective in removing approximately pounds of tph as gasoline and pounds of btex through march.the tests indicate that the groundwater treatment activities was successful in dissolving hydrocarbon concentrations in the groundwater beneath the site.the tests indicate that the groundwater treatment system has reached a point of diminishing return with respect to dissolved hydrocarbon recovery and the probable limit of this remedial technology,pump treat.
although this evidence suggests that the contamination had been abated,also attached to the respondents motion was the report prepared on shamsian behalf by environmental managers auditors,the purpose of which was to assess if the current hydrocarbon levels in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of former underground storage tanks are indeed below the regulatory action levels for site closure.the report contained the following conclusions soil samples revealed s ignificantly high levels of,benzene,ethylbenzene,and xylenes in amounts that exceed the maximum soil screening level maximum allowable level.based on laboratory results,it appears that the petroleum hydrocarbons contamination in the soil still exists in the vicinity of former underground storage tanks.it should be noted that the hydrocarbons contamination detected in the soil during this investigation is significantly higher than the hydrocarbons levels detected in the soil during geraghty miller confirmation soil sampling conducted on october.significantly high levels of benzene concentration were detected in groundwater samples collected from various borings.the levels exceed the maximum contaminant level mcl which is set forth by the department of health services and the environmental protection agency.the toluene concentrations in a sample collected from one of the borings is above the mcl.certain borings revealed ether mtbe concentration above the mcl.based on the laboratory results,it appears that the hydrocarbons contamination in the groundwater still exists at the subject site.due to the level of contamination,it is possible that the prior remediation at the site was not adequate to reduce the hydrocarbons levels in the soil and groundwater below the regulatory limits for site closure.further assessment is needed to determine the source of the contamination.
as well,as we have judicially noticed,the rwqcb issued a case reopen letter to arco expressing concerns,inter alia,over mtbe levels.
section,subdivision c provides that a court shall consider all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,except summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,if contradicted by other inferences or evidence,which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.although the geraghty miller,site disclosure request and the rwqcb no further action letter create a reasonably deducible inference that the contamination at the site was remediated,the report prepared by environmental managers auditors,and the rwqcb subsequent case reopen letter create an equally reasonably deducible inference that the contamination at the site still exceeds regulatory limits and was not properly remediated.as we previously indicated,we must resolve all doubt regarding the propriety of granting summary judgment in favor of the party opposing it.the evidence submitted below and the case reopen letter create doubt as to the propriety of granting summary judgment 
d.there are triable issues as to damages.
the respondents contend that the appellants have not suffered cognizable continuing nuisance damages.this contention lacks merit.
in connection with a continuing nuisance,r ecovery is limited to actual injury suffered prior to commencement of each action.prospective damages are unavailable.baker airport authority cal d.
the appellants complaint alleges that the nuisance has caused them to incur costs and suffer damages.although it was undisputed below that the appellants did not incur any costs to abate the contamination,the respondents motions failed to eliminate a triable issue with respect to the appellants loss of use of their property.loss of use is a recognized measure of continuing nuisance damages.santa fe partnership arco products th,d.the respondents argue that any loss of use was due to the appellants voluntary decision to put a hold on developing the property.however,we decline the respondents implied invitation to hold that the appellants were obligated to ignore the contamination in order to mitigate their damages.it is telling that the respondents did not cite any authority supporting their position.
iii.trespass.
for purposes of this appeal,the parties treat the nuisance and trespass causes of action as presenting the same legal issues.because the parties make no distinctions,neither do we.for that reason,we allow the trespass and nuisance causes of action to proceed in conjunction 
iv.negligent misrepresentation.
the appellants concede that shachory did not make any misrepresentations.however,they argue that there is a triable issue as to whether arco is liable for negligent misrepresentations made on its behalf by geraghty miller,in the site closure request.we disagree.
the elements of negligent misrepresentation are.a plaintiff must prove the following in order to recover.m isrepresentation of a past or existing material fact,without reasonable ground for believing it to be true,and with intent to induce another reliance on the fact misrepresented ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom it was directed and resulting damage.citation.home budget loans,jacoby meyers law offices d.home budget.
the complaint alleges prior to their entering into the lease,the appellants were given by the owner and former owner of the property a site closure request prepared by geraghty miller,on behalf of arco concluding that the site contained no significant hydrocarbons which would prevent development.the appellants are informed and believe and thereon allege that defendants knew or should hav
