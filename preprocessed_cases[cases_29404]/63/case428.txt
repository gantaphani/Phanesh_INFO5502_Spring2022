bnsf railway petitions for review of an order of the surface transportation board rejecting as unreasonable certain rates the railroad charged the public service company of colorado,xcel energy,to ship coal from the powder river basin in wyoming to xcel electric generating plant in colorado.bnsf argues first the board should have dismissed the rate proceeding three years after the complaint was filed,pursuant to the limitation in c.in the alternative bnsf argues we should,for a number of reasons,set aside the board order as arbitrary and capricious.we hold bnsf first argument is forfeit and its other arguments are unpersuasive,wherefore we deny its petition for review.
background 
with the passage of the staggers rail act of,the congress limited regulation of railroad rates to markets in which a single carrier exercises market dominance,defined as an absence of effective competition from other rail carriers or modes of transportation.c d,a.furthermore,it provided in the icc termination act of that the surface transportation board may begin an investigation into the reasonableness of a carrier rates only on the complaint of an affected shipper.id.a.if the board finds the carrier dominates the relevant market,then it must determine whether the rate charged the shipper is reasonable.id.d.if the rate is unreasonable,id.c,then the board may prescribe the maximum lawful rate,id.a,and order the railroad to pay reparations to the complainant,id.b.the board is precluded,however,from finding market dominance and in turn regulating the rate if the revenue generated thereby does not exceed of the carrier variable cost of service.id.d a.
the board evaluates the reasonableness of rail rates in light of the standards promulgated by its predecessor,the interstate commerce commission,see coal rate guidelines,nationwide,aff sub nom.consol.rail united states,cir.in the coal rate guidelines the commission adopted the principles of constrained market pricing cmp to set upper limits on the rates a railroad may charge its captive shippers those customers who do not have practical access to an alternative carrier and who,because of their inelastic demand,the railroads may charge rates that significantly exceed the variable cost of service.id.at.the commission concluded that these principles would meet its dual objectives of providing railroads the real prospect of attaining revenue adequacy while protecting coal shippers from monopolistic pricing practices.id.at.under cmp,rail carriers set their own rates for rail service,subject to three main constraints revenue adequacy,management efficiency,and cost.see id.at.
a shipper may challenge a rate either on a basis,by arguing that the rate charged exceeds the amount necessary for the railroad to achieve revenue adequacy as adjusted for demonstrated management inefficiencies,id.at,or as in this case,under the cost sac test,which is designed to prevent.id.at.regardless of a railroad overall revenue adequacy,therefore,the rate charged a captive shipper is further constrained by the principle that a captive shipper should not bear the costs of any facilities or services from which it derives no benefit,that is,should not be required to other shippers.id.at.
a shipper challenging a rate under the sac test must hypothesize an efficient railroad sarr that would serve the captive shipper or a group of shippers who benefit from sharing joint and common costs.id.at.the test assumes a contestable market,that is,a market without any barriers to entry or exit.id.if the rate being challenged is more than would be required by the hypothetical new entrant to cover its costs including a reasonable return on investment,then that rate is unreasonable.see id.at.
a sac proposal must be comprehensive,taking into account a host of variables from capital expenses for trains and track to the operating plan and routing of traffic on the sarr.the complaining shipper has broad flexibility to design the route of the sarr in order to lower costs by taking advantage of economies of density.id.at.although there are no restrictions on the traffic that may potentially be included in a group,the proponent must identify,and be prepared to defend,the assumptions and selections it has made.id.at.there is a rebuttable presumption that traffic,that is,the traffic of shippers,will contribute revenue at the level of their current rates.id.when such traffic is routed over a sarr for only a part of its through movement,the method for allocating the revenue from this traffic may be hotly disputed,as it is in this which more later.
xcel filed its complaint with the board in december challenging rates bnsf charged for the transportation of coal from the powder river basin to xcel pawnee electric generating station near brush,colorado.in january xcel submitted its opening evidence,including its proposed sarr,which replicated a section of the traffic handled by bnsf rail lines between the eagle butte mine in northern wyoming and the pawnee plant.traffic,which would move on the sarr for only a part of its overall movement before reaching an interchange point where it would be transferred to bnsf for carriage to its destination,accounted for more than of all traffic on the sarr.see appendix map showing route of sarr and residual bnsf lines that handle traffic.
bnsf moved in february to dismiss the complaint on the ground that xcel operating plan was infeasible and it had therefore failed to make out a prima facie case.the board denied the request,holding bnsf had not demonstrated that the alleged errors in xcel evidence are so large in magnitude or so egregious as to warrant dismissing the complaint at this early stage in the proceeding.bnsf then submitted its own evidence,which focused upon four points bnsf must be allowed to charge shippers with highly inelastic demand,such as xcel,high rates in order to achieve revenue adequacy the use of traffic,upon which xcel sarr so heavily relied,distorted the results of the sac analysis by allocating excessive revenues to the sarr portion of the overall movement the single largest movement on the sarr,coal destined for western resources jeffrey energy center the jeffrey traffic,was unreasonably diverted from its present route to a longer route on the sarr and xcel operating plan was infeasible.
in june the board ruled in favor of xcel,rejecting bnsf challenges to xcel sac presentation and holding bnsf rates unreasonable.see pub.serv.of xcel energy burlington santa fe,stb docket,wl stb served june,decision i.bnsf petitioned for reconsideration,which the board denied in relevant part,see pub.serv.of xcel energy burlington santa fe,stb docket,wl stb served,decision ii,and then petitioned this court for review.
ii.analysis 
as a threshold matter,bnsf argues xcel complaint should have been dismissed pursuant to c in december,three years after it was filed.in the alternative the carrier claims the board decision is,in a number of respects,arbitrary and capricious.
time limit 
subsections a and c of title provide in pertinent part 
a except as otherwise provided in this part,the board may begin an investigation under this part only on complaint.
c a formal investigative proceeding begun by the board under subsection a of this section is dismissed automatically unless it is concluded by the board with administrative finality by the end of the third year after the date on which it was begun.
bnsf contends this rate proceeding was begun by the board under subsection a,c,when xcel filed its complaint on december.therefore,bnsf urges,the case was dismissed automatically on december,nearly six months before the board issued its decision.
the board counters that bnsf forfeited this argument because,even if the limitation applied,bnsf did not raise the point until long after three years had elapsed and the board had ruled indeed bnsf first made the argument in a footnote to its petition for reconsideration.on the merits the board reasons that because the congress can not have intended to punish a complainant for agency inaction,the limit must be read to apply only to investigations begun by the board on its own initiative.this it does by reading the phrase formal investigative proceeding,as used in c,to refer not to an investigation begun on complaint of a captive shipper,pursuant to the second clause of a,but rather to a investigation otherwise provided in this part and thus within the first or exception clause of a.see,c board may reopen an investigation id.b board may extend an investigation.the board contends its interpretation of formal investigative proceeding is consistent with the commission reading of the preceding version of.see amended.the commission read the limit in that version of c to apply only to investigations under a,which at the time provided the commission could begin an investigation not only on complaint but also on its own initiative,id.a.see complaints filed pursuant to the savings provisions of the staggers rail act of.according to the board,because by the term formal investigative proceeding had an established meaning,the congress is presumed to have been aware of that interpretation when it retained that term.see lorillard pons,d.further,the board argues that reading the revised statute differently than the commission read the preceding version would produce an absurd,unfair,and perhaps unconstitutional result because it would depriv e xcel of a decision on the merits of its rate complaint where the delay was not xcel fault more generally,it would,quite perversely,reward any railroad that managed to prolong a rate proceeding beyond the time limit.
the board concern with due process for shippers may be.see logan zimmerman brush,d holding a cause of action is a species of property protected by the fourteenth amendment due process clause and therefore could not constitutionally be extinguished by expiration of period for state agency to convene conference.we need not resolve the issue of the limit,however,because bnsf failed to raise the argument in a timely manner.a reviewing court generally will not consider an argument that was not raised before the agency at the time appropriate under its practice.united states tucker truck lines.bnsf raised this argument when,after three and one half years of proceedings,the board had ruled against it on the merits and the carrier was petitioning for reconsideration.assuming its relegation of the argument to a footnote was not itself fatal,united states whren,absent extraordinary circumstances we do not entertain an argument raised for the first time in a footnote,the timing surely was.
without identifying the exact moment the argument was forfeited,we are confident it could not have been later than when the board decided the case because the criteria for granting reconsideration are limited by statute the board may not grant a petition for reconsideration except for material error,new evidence,or substantially changed circumstances.c.the limitation obviously was not new evidence or a changed circumstance,and if it was a material error,the error was induced by bnsf own failure to raise the argument in good time.canady sec,agency decision that statute of limitations defense was forfeited by failure to raise argument until motion for reconsideration held not arbitrary or capricious see also.mun.power agency burlington santa fe,stb docket,wl,stb served,board generally does not consider new issues raised for the first time on reconsideration where those issues could have and should have been presented in the earlier stages of the proceeding.in sum,bnsf argument came too late to command the attention of the board,let alone that of this court.
still,bnsf protests,the statutory provision for automatic dismissal is a mandatory directive and therefore leaves no discretion to the agency to treat its claim as having been forfeited.even a defect in the jurisdiction of an agency,however,when not timely raised before that agency is forfeit,see usair,dot,challenge based upon deadline for agency action forfeit when not raised before agency,unless it concerns the very composition or constitution of that agency,mitchell christopher,which bnsf objection does not.compare arbaugh y h,d subject matter jurisdiction,because it involves the court power to hear a case,can never be forfeited or waived citation omitted.
b.the merits 
because the investigative proceeding initiated by xcel complaint was not dismissed,we shall go on to consider bnsf arguments concerning the merits of xcel case.as usual,we review the board findings of fact for substantial evidence and ask whether its decision is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,e,bearing in mind that w here an agency has rationally set forth the grounds on which it acted,this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency,mccarty farms surface transp.as detailed below,we find no fault with the board reasoning and therefore leave its decision undisturbed.
revenue adequacy 
bnsf first argues the board decision to lower the carrier rates when,according to the board own calculations,bnsf revenues were not adequate to provide a reasonable return on its investment,violated the board statutory duty to look out for the adequacy of the carrier revenues.see a the board shall make an adequate and continuing effort to assist carriers in attaining revenue levels that are adequate,under honest,economical,and efficient management,to cover total operating expenses,including depreciation and obsolescence,plus a reasonable and economic profit or return or both on capital see also id.policy in regulating railroad industry to promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues.in order to attain revenue adequacy,reports bnsf,it must be allowed to charg e relatively high rates to coal shippers,like xcel,with highly inelastic demand.see coal rate guidelines,at owing to significant production economies the cost structure of the railroad industry necessitates differential pricing of rail services based upon diverse shippers sensitivities to price.
although the board explained that the sac test inherently addresses a railroad need for adequate revenues,see decision ii,at,bnsf argues the board must address the revenue adequacy mandate in the context of individual cases.the board responds that it is charged with seeking not only adequate revenues for carriers but also reasonable rates for shippers,see,and that it seeks both via the sac test,which is designed to accommodate the se dual objectives by assuring captive shippers that they are not other parts of the defendant network,while assuring railroads that any given rate prescription will provide a reasonable return on the replacement of facilities needed to serve the shipper.
the board is on solid ground here.regardless whether bnsf as a system is,revenue inadequacy is not a basis upon which a carrier may defend an unreasonable rate over a segment of its system.see coal rate guidelines,at a rate may be unreasonable even if the carrier is far short of revenue adequacy.as the board explained in denying bnsf petition for reconsideration,the sac test is designed to take into account the railroad need for revenue adequacy on the portion of its system that is included in the system of the sarr.decision ii,at see also burlington icc,cmp explicitly builds in the idea of revenue adequacy subject to the sac constraint.the test therefore reasonably excludes revenue needs associated with other traffic traveling over other parts of the system.decision ii,at.to be sure,a railroad may still charge a captive shipper more than it charges shippers for the use of shared facilities.the sac test,however,is designed to ensure the carrier does not portions of the system by charging its captive shippers more than they should have to pay for efficient rail service,coal rate guidelines,at,and thereby recovering from them the costs of facilities or services from which they derive no benefit,id.at.
nor are we persuaded by bnsf argument that it was arbitrary and capricious for the board to lower its rates below the rates indicated by the board revenue shortfall allocation method rsam.the rsam is the board way of calculating the average percentage by which revenues received from captive shippers must exceed the variable costs of serving those shippers if the railroad is to achieve revenue adequacy.see rate proceedings,see also ass of am.surface transp.bnsf contends the rates prescribed by the board in this case yield a ratio of not more than,significantly below its rsam figure of about for the relevant time period.because a railroad in order to cover its fixed costs must be allowed to charge its highest rates to shippers with the least elastic demand,bnsf claims it must be able to charge them rates equal to or greater than the rates indicated by the rsam in order to have any chance of achieving revenue adequacy.
the rsam figure is not dispositive,however,it is but one of three benchmarks established by the board for use in smaller rate proceedings,where a sac analysis would be prohibitively expensive.see ass of am,at.as the board points out,the rsam figure merely provides a test of revenue need and therefore provides no guidance on the rates xcel should be charged for the particular facilities and services xcel uses.in contrast,the board has consistently affirmed that cmp,with its sac constraint,is the preferred and most accurate procedure available for determining the reasonableness of rates in markets where the rail carrier enjoys market dominance.burlington,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.of course,a railroad does need to recover a higher percentage of its fixed costs from shippers with relatively inelastic demand,but that is not to say it may charge a price that other shippers.the sac test constrains rates precisely to that end.as a result,where fixed costs are relatively low,even a shipper with inelastic demand may be charged less than the average derived by the rsam indeed,this will inevitably occur to some extent because the average derived by the rsam is the average for captive shippers only,so the ratios for some captive shippers must be above and some below that figure.here,the rates prescribed by the board were well in excess indeed,of variable cost.
in sum,bnsf has not shown us that the board arbitrarily applied its sac test.we will not disturb its decision on this ground.
bnsf next objects to the heavy reliance of xcel sarr upon traffic.according to the railroad,the allocation of revenues between the sarr and the portions of a through movement is distorted because a railroad does not charge rates for discrete portions of a through movement,as a result of which there must be an arbitrary allocation of through revenue between the two portions of the through movement.likewise,the cost side of the comparison is distorted because the costs of the portions of the movements are ignored altogether.therefore,contends bnsf,a properly performed sac test must use only movements and must examine the full costs of all facilities used to provide service to the shipper group and the total revenues generated by that traffic.
in response the board acknowledges that the use of traffic introduces imprecision into the sac analysis but argues that excluding such traffic would risk being intractable.decision i,at.the sac analysis must reflect the cost sharing and production economies derived from sharing facilities on the sarr.see decision i,at quoting coal rate guidelines,at without grouping,sac would not be a very useful test,since the captive shipper would be deprived of the benefits of any inherent production economies nevada power,at.therefore,to exclude traffic from a sac analysis would dramatically enlarge the geographic scope of a sarr needed to serve the group of shippers selected for the sarr by the complainant.decision i,at.in this case,the board estimated that in order to serve the same shippers without any traffic,the sarr would need to be at least times larger than the sarr that xcel proposed.id.the complexity of the consequent proceeding,the board concluded,would expand exponentially beyond what is already a dauntingly large and detailed task.id.at.
the pursuit of precision in rate proceedings,as in most things in life,must at some point give way to the constraints of time and expense,and it is the agency responsibility to mark that point.our role is limited to determining whether the balance it struck is arbitrary.see burlington,at the commission is free to make reasonable between the quality and cost of possible regulatory approaches and of course we owe the commission judgment on the point great deference so long as it intelligibly explained why the chosen was reasonable.
here,the board explanation for its decision to allow traffic as a simplifying mechanism,which the board has described as now a standard feature of sac cases,decision i,at,was both reasonable and intelligibly explained.the board must balance,among other concerns,the need for a reasonably accurate methodology and the need to avoid unduly protracting already complex and expensive sac proceedings.see board must provide for expeditious handling and resolution of all proceedings ass of am.surface transp,i t is up to the board to arrive at a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting policies set out in the staggers act.in view of the board estimate that presentation and analysis of the sarr,which already involved dozens of volumes of evidence,would have burgeoned tenfold without the simplifying mechanism of traffic,decision i,at,it was not unreasonable for the board to conclude that barring traffic from the sarr would be not only inefficient but infeasible.see decision ii,at we remain concerned that,without traffic,captive shippers could lack a practicable means by which to prosecute rate complaints.
our view of this matter might be different if bnsf had presented evidence to establish that the imprecision implicit in the use of traffic tends to overestimate the revenues generated by a sarr to a degree that outweighs any efficiency gains.instead,lacking such evidence,we are struck by the irony of bnsf calling for a dramatic increase in the complexity of the sac proceeding even as it argues the case should be dismissed because the board failed to resolve it more speedily.
in sum,we do not think the board unreasonably concluded that the value of this evidentiary tool outweighs its limitations.decision ii,at.
more persuasive,but also ultimately unconvincing,is bnsf argument that the specific method by which the board allocates revenue to traffic is flawed.the appropriate allocation of revenue from traffic is a perennial issue in sac proceedings and one the board even now has not resolved definitively.see,ppl,llc burlington santa fe,stb docket,wl,stb served,we have not adopted a single preferred procedure for developing revenue divisions on traffic.the modified prorate msp procedure,which was applied in this and several other recent proceedings,is a refinement of a formula long used in sac cases to allocate traffic revenues.decision ii,at see,duke energy csx,stb docket,wl stb served,duke energy norfolk,stb docket,wl stb served,carolina power light norfolk,stb docket,wl stb served.under msp,revenues from a movement are allocated to the sarr based upon the movement proportionate share of the combined mileage and upon the assumption that average costs are a continuous function of distance holding other factors constant.decision ii,at.in recognition of the proportionally higher costs associated with originating and terminating traffic,for each movement that originates or terminates on the sarr,a additive is included in the calculation as a surrogate in the absence of any better evidence as to the costs of those functions.id.
bnsf criticized the msp approach for its failure to take into account economies of density,that is,the principle that as the density of traffic increases over a stretch of rail,average costs diminish,see coal rate guidelines,at,at least initially.bnsf therefore proposed an alternative method it called the density adjusted revenue allocation dara.under this approach,revenues are allocated between the sarr and segments of a movement in proportion to each segment relative variable cost,distance,and density.decision i,at.the board rejected dara because,although it does allocate a higher proportion of reve
