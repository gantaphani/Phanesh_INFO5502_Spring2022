this appeal arises from judgment on a jury verdict in favor of interstate petroleum corporation interstate.robert morgan and vickie morgan appeal,asserting that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case.in addition,the morgans contend that interstate claim for money damages should not have been presented to the jury.interstate the district court denial of its motion for attorney fees.on september,because it found that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide this case,a divided panel of this court decided to vacate the judgment and remand the case for dismissal.interstate petroleum morgan,cir.the panel decision was vacated and rehearing en banc granted on november.because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for dismissal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and do not address the morgans damages argument or interstate for attorney fees.
on april,interstate and the morgans,green acres gas and grocery,entered a franchise agreement whereby interstate,as franchisor,agreed to sell british petroleum bp brand gasoline and petroleum products to the morgans,as franchisees.the terms of the agreement also allowed the morgans to operate their service station under the bp logo and required the morgans to obtain a irrevocable letter of credit from which interstate could draw amounts due and unpaid under the contract.despite nine requests over the next months,the morgans failed to obtain the required letter of credit,and on december,interstate notified the morgans of its intent to terminate the franchise agreement based on their nonperformance.instead,interstate apparently gave the morgans another chance to keep the franchise.this last chance was embodied in a letter contract,dated december,in which the morgans agreed to consent to the termination of the franchise should they fail either to begin making monthly payments to interstate in satisfaction of an earlier note or fail to deliver a letter of credit to interstate by january.
after the morgans failed to comply with the terms of the letter agreement of december,interstate brought suit in federal court,claiming breach of contract interstate complaint,filed on january,alleged federal question subject matter jurisdiction under,and the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa or the act.the morgans,on january,filed a separate suit in the district court based on state contract law,a suit which they later voluntarily dismissed on may.the district court granted interstate motion for injunctive relief,requiring the morgans not to display the bp logo.the morgans,on november,filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure h asserting that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the pmpa did not authorize actions brought by a franchisor against a franchisee the district court denied the morgans motion to dismiss and their subsequent motion for partial dismissal,and the case proceeded to trial.following trial,the jury awarded interstate in damages.the morgans then made several motions,including another motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction under rule h.the district court denied the motion to dismiss,and the morgans appealed.
interstate complaint alleged that the act gave the court subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the morgans motion to dismiss argued that the district court had no federal question jurisdiction over interstate suit because the pmpa does not authorize franchisors to maintain a cause of action against franchisees.the morgans repeated this argument in their motion to dismiss and repeat it again on appeal.
the supreme court has stated that it is the special obligation of appellate courts to evaluate not only their own subject matter jurisdiction but also the jurisdiction of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.bender williamsport area school,d internal quote omitted.in fact,we must consider questions regarding jurisdiction whenever they are raised,and even sua sponte.plyler moore,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,this case must be dismissed if we conclude that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
absent diversity,a district court has subject matter jurisdiction in a case such as this only if the action arose under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the court recent articulation of arising under jurisdiction found in franchise tax bd.const.laborers vacation trust,d,controls our inquiry into whether the district court had jurisdiction over interstate claims.congress has given the lower federal courts jurisdiction to hear only those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax,at.interstate has argued throughout the litigation,and the district court agreed,that interstate breach of contract claim and request for injunctive relief state federal questions under the act.
interstate contends that federal subject matter jurisdiction is proper pursuant to and.brief.the argument goes that since a provides for a suit by a franchisee against a franchisor who fails to comply with the statute that a majority of courts presiding over the issue have held that the act implicitly authorizes the franchisor to maintain the same cause of action and,pursue the same remedies against a franchisee in a federal court as a franchisee can maintain against a franchisor.br.that proposition was accepted by the morgans,interstate argues,to sustain jurisdiction.such position,however,is not well taken for three reasons.first,coyne delany blue cross blue shield,cir,is controlling in its holding that the grant of jurisdiction by a statute to one party to a transaction does not imply jurisdiction to other parties.so conferring jurisdiction in terms on a franchisee under a does not implicitly confer jurisdiction on a franchisor.second,hagans lavine,d,is controlling as to decisions of other courts which,as here,have presid ed over cases involving similar parties without deciding whether or not they have jurisdiction.these are not holdings by the presiding courts that they have jurisdiction.third,american fire cas.finn,is controlling so that even if a party agrees that a court has subject matter jurisdiction,such agreement is not binding on a court or on the party.in connection with these questions,none of the federal courts of appeals have held,under the same or similar facts which exist here,that federal question jurisdiction exists under the petroleum marketing practice act,et.the district courts are divided on the subject,with,in our opinion,the better reasoned decisions of those courts denying jurisdiction.
having concluded that the petroleum marketing practices act,neither directly nor by implication,confers jurisdiction upon interstate,the franchisor,the claim of federal question jurisdiction in this case by interstate then calls for an examination of whether interstate right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law,as shown by a well pleaded complaint.franchise tax board,at.the way to ascertain the proper answer to this question is by an examination of the complaint,a copy of which is appended to this opinion as exhibit 
the first mention of the petroleum marketing practices act in the complaint is on the first page thereof under a section called jurisdiction and venue,the pertinent parts of which are quoted as follows the court has subject matter jurisdiction under this act based upon federal question jurisdiction pursuant to and the petroleum marketing practices act,et.
the only other mention of the act in the complaint is on page thereof,paragraph,which is,in pertinent part plaintiff advised the defendants of its intent to terminate its contract as a result of defendants continued and breach of the contract pursuant to the petroleum marketing practices act,et.
no other mention by the pmpa is made in the complaint.neither is there any paraphrase of the statute or of any part of the statute,and the only substantive reference to the statute is in paragraph,just mentioned,which paragraph is under count of contract.no claim is made that either the morgans or interstate has violated any provision of the statute or is holding the other accountable for such a violation.
a fair reading of the complaint shows only a prayer for damages and injunctive relief because of a claim that the morgans did not comply with the terms of a contract of april,which had been amended by an agreement to terminate the same,dated december.no terms or provisions of the statute are mentioned in the complaint,except as recited above,and the judgment in this case,filed june,attached to this opinion as exhibit b,is only for a money judgment in the amount of plus a stipulated amount of,for certain charges on account of credit cards.
we are of opinion that the complaint states nothing more than a complaint for breach of contract under state law,and,indeed,we are so bold as to suggest that interstate claim of federal question jurisdiction may well be nothing more than an attempt to bring this breach of contract case in a federal,rather than a state,forum when neither the jurisdictional amount nor the citizenship requirements could be met.
even the prayer of the complaint,as best considered,is only for injunctive relief and for a money judgment for breach of contract,neither having anything to do with the provisions of the statute 
in its brief,interstate argues that its complaint requests a declaration from the district court that its termination of the franchise was proper.br.since an examination of the complaint,which was never amended,shows that such is not the fact,any such implicit request would have had to have come under.b 
rule b provides,when issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.b emphasis added.it is true that a question of declaratory relief was discussed on occasion during the course of this case however,it is clear from the record,including the complaint,answer,all the other various motions and orders,the jury instructions,the very form of the special verdict,and the absence of an order by the district court granting or denying declaratory relief,that the question of whether interstate had complied with the pmpa in terminating the franchise was never tried.
an examination of the entire record reveals only that the case is nothing more or less than a dispute under state law over a claimed breach of contract.that only was claimed by interstate,and that only was defended by the morgans.neither side sought the construction of any federal statute,the plaintiff claimed only that the contract was breached,and the defendants denied that it was.neither side stated a federal question.
even though west virginia contract law created interstate cause of action,the case might still be one arising under the laws of the united states if interstate complaint established that its right to relief under state law necessarily required resolution of a substantial question of federal law in dispute between the parties.franchise tax,at.in this regard,interstate asserted at oral argument that the pmpa was construed at trial because the jury finding of liability against the morgans also necessarily embodied a finding that interstate had not violated the pmpa in terminating the franchise.we disagree.
it is clear from the record that interstate established its right to relief to the satisfaction of the jury by proving its breach of contract claim under state law and without reference to any provision of the pmpa.at trial,neither the pleadings,nor the orders,nor the jury instructions nor the special verdict form made any mention of any provisions of the pmpa.instead,the jury was merely instructed to find whether the morgans had breached either the original franchise agreement or the termination agreement and,if so,to determine damages.neither did the district court construe any provision of the pmpa when it granted injunctive relief,nor did the judgment of the district court mention or depend upon any provision of the pmpa,or any other provision of federal law.the morgans never denied interstate right to terminate the franchise if the contract was breached they did deny that the contract was breached.
thus,the pmpa did not create interstate cause of action,nor was there a disputed question of federal law that was a necessary element of interstate claim.even if interstate intended to rely on the pmpa as a defense to a counterclaim by the morgans,or if interstate anticipated that the morgans would somehow use the pmpa to defend against interstate contract claims,the complaint rule,of course,precludes finding arising under jurisdiction on such grounds.see gully first bank.discussing complaint rule and explaining that jurisdiction will not be found in an anticipated defense.
in sum,a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.american well works layne bowler.the cause of action in this case was created under the law of west virginia,so the suit arises under that law,not federal law 
we are thus of opinion that the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction in interstate action against the morgans.accordingly,the judgment of the district court must be vacated,and the case remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the case without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
vacated and remanded with instructions.
despite the lawyers obfuscating advocacy,the question in this case is straightforward does interstate petroleum complaint,or any amendment of it,constructive or otherwise,seek to vindicate or resolve a federal right for which congress provided subject matter jurisdiction in the district court the record indicates that no such right was ever at issue and therefore that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over this case.
this jurisdictional issue does not concern whether a declaratory judgment action can be brought under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa or whether interstate petroleum constructively amended its complaint.the question,rather,is whether interstate petroleum oral suggestion that it was seeking a declaratory judgment under the pmpa,without identifying any pmpa issue sought to be resolved,could justify the federal jurisdiction conferred by the pmpa even if we can assume that any such issue was pled,tried,or decided in this case.to me,the answer is clearly no.
while morgan,green acres gas grocery morgan,was a franchisee,as that term is defined by the pmpa,see,and interstate petroleum was similarly a franchisor,see id,the dispute between them that was presented to the district court and decided by it was not one arising under the pmpa.rather,as i demonstrate,the dispute was a garden variety claim under state law over which the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.
at the outset,it is important to understand the scope of the pmpa and the scope of the federal interest protected by that act.the pmpa was enacted to protect petroleum franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory terminations and nonrenewals.mobil oil.gasoline marketers auto.repair ass n,cir.it fulfilled its purpose by establishing minimum federal standards governing the termination and nonrenewal of franchise relationships for the sale of motor fuel by the franchisor or supplier of such fuel by prohibiting a franchisor from terminating or failing to renew a franchise without satisfying certain notice provisions and without stating a reason for termination sanctioned by the act.checkrite petroleum,amoco oil,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in checkrite petroleum,the plaintiff,who was a petroleum broker acting in the marketing chain between amoco and amoco dealers,sought to assert rights under the pmpa when it was terminated by amoco.in concluding that the broker was not a distributor or retailer as used in the pmpa definition of franchisee,the court denied the broker a remedy,noting that the act should be construed strictly because the statute in question is in derogation of common law rights.id.at.the court observed that the legislative history of the act expresses no congressional intent to go beyond its plain terms.id.at.
it is only for vindication of the limited rights protected in and that the pmpa confers subject matter jurisdiction on district courts.section authorizes a franchisee to maintain a civil action against a franchisor who violates or in the district court s of the united states.a.
the facts in this case do not present a case or controversy arising under the pmpa.interstate petroleum,by a contract with morgan,dated april,agreed to sell morgan gasoline on credit,provided that morgan obtain a irrevocable letter of credit.when morgan failed to deliver the letter of credit and to satisfy its ongoing indebtedness to interstate petroleum,the parties entered into a mutual consent to termination agreement,dated december.in this second agreement,morgan again agreed to make monthly payments against its indebtedness to interstate petroleum and to obtain a letter of credit,this time by january.again,morgan breached its contractual undertakings,and interstate commenced this action for breach of both contracts.
even though interstate petroleum sought to rely on the pmpa for federal jurisdiction,no provision under the pmpa supported interstate petroleum claims for breach of contract.the pmpa provides limited rights to a franchisee who is terminated discriminatorily or without statutorily required notice.moreover,in its complaint,interstate petroleum did not seek to resolve any claim that morgan,as franchisee,had asserted under the pmpa.on the contrary,the pleadings indicate that the parties mutually agreed to terminate the relationship,rendering moot any pmpa issue,if one had ever been alive.thus,the entire dispute between the parties in this case centered on interstate petroleum efforts to enforce its contractual rights in the two contracts with morgan and to require morgan to honor its financial commitments.it is therefore understandable that this case was commenced as a breach of contract claim,tried as a breach of contract claim,and decided as a breach of contract that are conclusively established by the record.
first,in its complaint,interstate petroleum asserted solely a breach of contract claim,asking for damages and injunctive relief as a direct and proximate result of defendants breach of the contract of sale and continuous failure to specifically perform thereunder.the complaint makes no reference to any pmpa right that had been asserted by morgan and that interstate petroleum was trying to resolve.moreover,interstate petroleum never filed a motion to amend its complaint to make such a reference.this is not surprising because there was no issue ever raised between the parties that the pmpa had been violated.
second,when interstate petroleum presented the case to the jury,counsel for interstate petroleum described the nature of the action to the jury,describing it as a simple contract case 
when you go up to begin your deliberations,you will have with you a special verdict slip,which ultimately will be the papers that will reflect what you have decided to be your verdict in this case.there will be a series of a few questions for you to decide.the first question to you will be whether you find that the defendants,robert and vickie morgan,breached their contract of sale with interstate petroleum,dated april.that was exhibit and you will have that to look at and,also,whether they breached the subsequent termination agreement that the parties entered into.and you will recall the morgans having executed that on december,and that is exhibit number.
emphasis added.in explaining to the jury its burden of proof,interstate said that it must prove three things in order to recover,that there was a contract,that the morgans in this case breached a term or requirement of that contract,and we also have to prove interstate losses and expenses,what in law is known as the damages in this case.after completing his closing argument,counsel for interstate petroleum concluded with the same theme 
o n behalf of my clients,i would request that you enter your verdict in this case in favor of interstate petroleum,the plaintiff in this case,in an you find the breach of contract has occurred,in an amount that you find to be fair and reasonable to compensate my clients for the breach of promise and for their losses that they have sustained.thank you very much,ladies and gentlemen.
emphasis added.
third,in requesting jury instructions,interstate petroleum submitted requests to the court only on a theory under west virginia law.its first request is typical 
you are instructed to assume that the defendants failure to provide an irrevocable letter of credit in this case constituted a material breach of their contract with the plaintiff,interstate petroleum corporation.accordingly,your sole task will be to determine the amount of damages which you find to be fair and reasonable in order to compensate plaintiff,interstate,for its losses,expenses and lost profits.
emphasis added.
fourth,when the district court actually instructed the jury,it did so only on the common law of contracts.and,consistently,when it submitted the case to the jury,it gave the jury only one question to answer on liability,that for breach of contract 
do you find that robert morgan and vickie morgan,green acres gas grocery,breached the contract of sale dated april,or the termination agreement dated december,
emphasis added.
finally,the jury returned a verdict deciding only that morgan had breached its contracts and awarding damages,and that verdict became the judgment in the case.
in short,any pmpa claim that morgan may have had or that interstate petroleum may have said it wanted to resolve through a declaratory judgment was never pled in any complaint or amended complaint,never tried to the jury,never decided by the jury,and never reflected in any judgment.from beginning to end,the case was a state case.
the dissenting opinion suggests that the parties reached an agreement to amend the pleadings and try the case as a declaratory judgment action under the pmpa.while there can be no doubt that the parties discussed a declaratory judgment under the pmpa and even agreed that interstate petroleum could have a pmpa issue resolved in the case,presumably in an attempt to agree on subject matter jurisdiction,no such issue under the pmpa was ever articulated indeed none existed for articulation.there simply was no pmpa case or controversy.and even if there were such a controversy,the discussions between counsel and the court never matured into anything more than just talk.and their talk is all that the dissenting opinion parades.critically absent from the dissent discussion about whether this was a federal case is the articulation of a viable issue under the pmpa.even then,none was ever pleaded,tried,argued,or decided.any federal claim suggested by the dissent is therefore a phantom claim based on an unknown issue.
this case does not involve a case or controversy under federal law,nor does it have the clear invocation of federal subject matter jurisdiction that we require.there is no statement of a claim or dispute over a claim relating to any violation by interstate petroleum of or,the only claims over which the pmpa gives federal courts jurisdiction.see a.because there was no claim arising under the pmpa,the district court never had federal jurisdiction,and it could not have entered the judgment in this case.accordingly,i concur in the majority opinion and judgment.
the majority devotes most of its opinion to four propositions with which no member of this court disagrees first,that subject matter jurisdiction can not be created by agreement of the parties second,that a franchisor can not sue a franchisee under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,see west third,that interstate complaint as originally filed did not seek a declaration that interstate did not violate the pmpa in terminating the franchise agreement with the morgans and fourth,that this case involved no substantial question of federal law.
none of this,however,addresses the central issue before us whether the parties,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,agreed that interstate was in fact seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not violate the pmpa in terminating the franchise agreement.a review of the record compels the conclusion that such an agreement was clearly made,repeatedly acknowledged by the morgans,and unequivocally recognized by the district court.these repeated acknowledgments that interstate sought declaratory relief effected a constructive amendment of the pleadings and thereby relieved interstate of any responsibility to formally amend its complaint.and,interstate request for a declaration of the morgans federal rights created a federal question that was the basis for the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.
having presented their defense to a jury in federal court and lost,the morgans now are attempting to eliminate the basis for federal court jurisdiction by repudiating their numerous previous acknowledgments.of course,the law does not allow a party to escape a judgment against it with such a,post hoc change of position.because the majority decision enables the morgans to do just that,i respectfully dissent.
before considering the question of whether interstate complaint was constructively amended to include a request for a declaratory judgment that it terminated the franchise agreement in accordance with the pmpa,the jurisdictional significance of that issue should be addressed.
under the declaratory judgment act,a federal court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.a west.although the declaratory judgment act does not broaden federal jurisdiction,see,skelly oil phillips petroleum,it does allow parties to precipitate suits that otherwise might need to wait for the declaratory relief defendant to bring a coercive action.gulf states paper ingram,cir parallel citations omitted see franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d aetna cas.sur.quarles,cir.that the federal right actually litigated when declaratory relief is sought may belong to the declaratory judgment defendant rather than to the declaratory judgment plaintiff does not change the fact that the action arises under federal law.see columbia gas transmission drain,cir lowe ingalls shipbuilding,cir see also gulf states paper,at explaining that the declaratory judgment remedy allows a party to bootstrap its way into federal court by bringing a federal suit that corresponds to one the opposing party might have brought internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a person may seek declaratory relief in federal court if the one against whom he brings his action could have asserted his own rights there.standard ins.saklad,cir see columbia gas transmission,at explaining that under certain circumstances the proper jurisdictional question is whether the complaint alleges a claim arising under federal law that the declaratory judgment defendant could affirmatively bring against the declaratory judgment plaintiff hunter douglas sheet metal workers int l ass n,local,cir explaining,in context of removal from state court,that whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action is determined by reference to the character of the threatened action.
here,unquestionably an action initiated by the morgans alleging that interstate termination of the franchise agreement violated the pmpa would arise under federal law because the pmpa creates such a cause of action.see american well works layne bowler.explaining that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.it follows that the district court would also have had jurisdiction to hear an action seeking a declaration that interstate did not violate the morgans rights under the pmpa 
i now turn to the central issue of whether interstate complaint was constructively amended.it is that the parties may constructively amend the complaint by agreeing,even implicitly,to litigate fully an issue not raised in the original pleadings.stemler city of florence,cir see.b.a constructive amendment occurs when the parties recognize that an issue not presented by the pleadings entered the case at trial.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed see estate of dietrich burrows,cir holding that complaint was constructively amended when defendants treated complaint as having been amended even though plaintiffs never actually filed an amended complaint after having been granted leave to do so whitaker snow,cir explaining that b ecause both parties squarely addressed the strict liability theory in their summary judgment briefs,the complaint was constructively amended to include that claim suiter mitchell motor coach sales,cir holding that defendant answer was constructively amended to add an unpled affirmative defense when the defense was asserted in a motion for judgment as a matter of law and plaintiff treated the defense as if it had been properly pled rodriguez doral mortgage,cir stating that a complaint may be constructively amended when a claim is introduced outside of a complaint and then treated by the opposing party as having been pleaded walton jennings cmty,cir holding that the pleadings were constructively amended when the district court sua sponte injected an unpled cause of action into the case in denying defendant motion for summary judgment and both parties proceeded to prepare for trial on the new issue.
interstate did not request a declaratory judgment in its complaint.nevertheless,subsequent to interstate filing of its complaint,the parties explicitly agreed on numerous occasions that interstate entitlement to declaratory relief was part of this lawsuit.interstate complaint alleges that interstate advised the morgans of its intent to terminate the franchise agreement in accordance with the pmpa.see.the morgans denied that allegation in their answer and on the same day filed their own suit in federal district court through their company,b v enterprises,seeking to enjoin interstate from debranding their business and requesting specific performance of the franchise agreement considering that the parties were not diverse and that the pmpa specifically forbids termination of petroleum franchise agreements except under specified circumstances,see,it would appear that the morgans intended to assert that interstate violated the pmpa by terminating the franchise agreement,thus providing a basis for federal question jurisdiction.
the morgans then moved to dismiss interstate action,contending that federal question jurisdiction did not exist because interstate could not bring a cause of action under the pmpa.see mem.in supp.of def.mot.to dismiss civil action,at.in its opposition to the morgans motion,interstate asserted that federal question jurisdiction exists when the franchisor seeks an adjudication of federal claims that the franchisee may threaten to assert against him.br.in opp to def.mot.to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the,at.applying this rule,interstate stated that it anticipate d that the morgans would attempt to use the pmpa as a defense to the action asserted against them as well as a basis for their claim that their right s as a franchisee were not properly terminated.id.
before the district court ruled on the motion to dismiss,the morgans filed a motion for partial dismissal in which they sought dismissal only of interstate action to the extent that it sought damages.see defs.sic mot.for partial dismissal.in a memorandum supporting this motion,they stated,interstate filed a complaint in this action asking for declaratory judgment as to its termination of the franchise agreement between it and the morgans.defs.mem.in supp.of mot.for partial dismissal,at.the morgans also asserted that the court can determine the rights of the parties under the pmpa.id.at.the morgans argued nevertheless that interstate damage claim should be dismissed because interstate was not entitled to damages under the declaratory judgment act.see id.the district court denied the morgans motions for di
