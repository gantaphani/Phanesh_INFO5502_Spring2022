background 
procedural history 
on june,the estate of louisa and melvin hoover,margaret hayes,administratrix the estate,the original plaintiff in this case,filed its complaint against equitable in kentucky state court,which equitable then removed to federal court.the original complaint named several parties as defendants,including equitable,and sought damages of royalties and gross values of minerals extracted from several wells under an oil and gas lease the lease,originally executed on june,and under which equitable is the current lessee.the original complaint also sought punitive damages in connection with the defendants alleged misconduct.
on august,equitable moved to dismiss the original complaint,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b,c,and,on,among other grounds,the estate failure to state a claim.the estate replied to equitable motion,claiming that the estate had alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under rule b,and,alternatively,that material questions of fact existed which precluded an award of summary judgment to equitable under rule.
the estate twice amended its complaint,joining several parties as plaintiffs,the hoover heirs,all individuals identifying themselves as descendants of louisa and melvin hoover,who obtained title to the oil and gas estates at issue in april of.the estate also dismissed all corporate defendants aside from equitable,while adding individual defendants who were also heirs of the hoover estate.many of the individual defendants filed a against equitable and certain hoover heirs,raising claims parallel to those raised in the second amended complaint.on august,equitable moved to dismiss the second amended complaint and under rules b,c,and.
on october,the district court entered an order granting equitable motion to dismiss.the court reached its decision on the following grounds equitable did not breach the lease by withholding royalties due unknown lessors because equitable was entitled to verify that the royalties were paid to the true owners and was entitled to protect itself from multiple liability and plaintiffs claims regarding equitable failure to develop the lease,and failure to market oil and gas,were unavailing because such implied covenants did not apply to a lease.the court also found that the appointment of margaret hayes as administratrix of the estate was contrary to kentucky law,and that hayes could only represent herself in the action.
although the district court characterized plaintiffs breach of contract claims in terms of failure to state facts upon which relief may be granted,the court ultimate conclusion stated that plaintiffs had presented no claim upon which to terminate the l ease that n o genuine issue of material fact exists in this matter,and summary judgment is proper pursuant to.at.the district court then ordered equitable to deposit with the court all royalty payments held in escrow since for the lease,ultimately to be issued to the properly identified hoover heirs.on december,the court ordered that the royalties be invested in the court registry system.
on november,plaintiffs sought relief from the october,order pursuant to rule b,and moved to stay the execution of the order pursuant to rule b.plaintiffs argued that the district court decision under rule should have been deferred until plaintiffs were given an opportunity to respond to equitable august,motion to dismiss and present additional supporting evidence for their claims.on december,the district court stayed execution of the october,order and allowed plaintiffs until december,to file a response to equitable motion to dismiss.on december,plaintiffs filed their response,attaching fourteen exhibits.on january,the court denied plaintiffs motion for relief from the october,order,finding that plaintiffs response contained no additional information.plaintiffs now appeal.
on july and august,equitable filed motions to dismiss woodrow hoover,james allen hoover,gary edward hoover,and margaret hayes as administratrix of the estate of melvin and louisa hoover,as parties to plaintiffs appeal.this court thereafter granted equitable motions.margaret hayes continues to represent herself as a plaintiff in this action.
substantive history 
in april of,louisa hoover,wife of melvin hoover,obtained title to the surface and oil and gas estates at issue in this case.in august of,the hoovers conveyed the property to daisy dudley,apparently reserving the oil and gas rights to themselves,and ultimately obtaining those rights in a decision by the floyd circuit court in kentucky,which was later set aside,but ultimately reinstated by the kentucky court of appeals.hoover dudley.
on june,the hoovers executed the lease with the kentucky coal and coke company,a predecessor in interest to equitable.the hoovers then conveyed a interest in the oil and gas estate to third parties in august of without reserving any of the royalties from the existing oil and gas lease.
kentucky west virginia gas company kentucky gas acquired title to both the dudley and hoover leaseholds on december,following years of litigation among the hoovers,dudleys,and keystone gas company,to whom the dudleys had granted a lease interest.kentucky gas then paid royalties to the hoovers and their heirs and assigns from until january,when kentucky gas assigned its leasehold interest to eastern kentucky production company,which merged into equitable energy resources company on january,thereby vesting equitable with full possessory interest in the oil and gas leases.equitable energy resources company changed its name to equitable production company in.equitable is a west virginia corporation with its principal place of business in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.
the lease established a rental payment of per year,per well,drilled on the hoover mineral estate.following the hoovers conveyance of of their interest in the mineral estate to third parties,the rental payment,as of,was to be divided between the hoovers and two other owners per owner.at various times throughout the course of dealings between the hoovers and equitable predecessors in interest,several wells were in operation on the property.for the fifteen years prior to the filing of the second amended complaint,only one well was in operation on the property.during this same period,there were no exploring,drilling,or other productive activity by equitable related to the hoover property or the lease.the term of the lease is ten years and as long thereafter as oil or gas,or either of them,is produced from said land by the lessee.at.accordingly,equitable now holds plaintiffs mineral estate subject only to the annual rental payments and the requirement that oil or gas continue to be produced on the property.
plaintiffs contend that equitable failed to make payments on the lease from,upon the death of eva roberts,until the appointment of george hoover as administrator in.plaintiffs maintain that roberts was the original administratrix of the estate,although the district court found that george hoover was in fact the original administrator.george hoover received a payment of royalties and continued to administer the estate until his death in.plaintiffs contend that equitable,in,terminated payments upon learning of george hoover death.
in,plaintiff margaret hayes mother sent notice to equitable that it was in default of its obligations under the lease.plaintiff hayes sent a similar letter in,seeking termination of the lease for material breach caused by of the rentals due.in,hayes,who is the granddaughter of melvin and louisa hoover,filed suit against equitable and other corporate defendants as administratrix of the hoover estate,claiming rights to past royalties and breach of contract under the lease.the hoover heirs later joined the estate action as plaintiffs.
plaintiffs contend that although equitable claims that it reasonably withheld royalty payments in order to determine the proper parties for receiving payments,and that monies were escrowed during this time,equitable did not,in any correspondence,mention opening an escrow account.plaintiffs also contend that equitable has failed to offer any evidence rebutting plaintiffs factual assertions that equitable did not perform under any of the implied covenants or obligations in operation under the lease,or that additional activity on the hoover property would yield productive results to the mutual benefit of plaintiffs and equitable.plaintiffs finally contend that the record is silent as to the actual amount in controversy,aside from the annual royalty payment payable to the hoover heirs,and thus equitable has failed to meet its burden of showing that the amount in controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction has been met.

lease termination 
plaintiffs contend that the district court erred when failing to find a genuine issue of material fact regarding plaintiffs power to terminate the lease on grounds that equitable unreasonably suspended royalty payments or,alternatively,on grounds that equitable violated implied covenants in operation under the lease.
royalty payments 
the district court found that equitable did not breach the lease when suspending royalty payments because equitable instead paid the royalties into an escrow account.plaintiffs argue that equitable has provided no evidence that it actually escrowed the royalties while attempting to determine the rightful owners of such royalties,and thus there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether equitable breached the lease.
equitable,rather than insisting that it had in fact escrowed the royalties,offers the alternative response that under kentucky law,a lessor that has not received royalty payments can not forfeit the lease,but can instead bring an action for payment.thus,equitable argues,the issue of whether the royalties were escrowed is unresponsive to the question of whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to a material breach of the lease.in addition,equitable notes that plaintiffs do not seek payment of the unpaid royalties,presumably because those royalties have already been deposited with the court registry system pursuant to the december,district court order.plaintiffs instead merely reference the unpaid royalties as grounds for terminating the lease.
under kentucky law,in the event of nonpayment of royalties,a lease at most permits an unpaid lessor to seek to recover a deficiency,rather than forfeit the lease,absent clear language to the contrary.kelley ivyton oil gas,a forfeiture of the lease will not be decreed because of arrears of rent or royalty except upon clear language in the lease providing therefor.further,equitable notes,even if the lease permitted a forfeiture,t he of all forfeitures are those founded upon mere delay in the payment of money.denniston kenova oil.plaintiffs offer no authority in support of their claim that,under kentucky law,mere nonpayment of royalties empowers a lessor to terminate a lease with or without clear language providing for such termination in the lease itself.accordingly,our analysis will focus on the claim for which plaintiffs do offer precedential support namely,that a lessor may terminate a lease upon the lessee breach of implied covenants to develop property.
implied covenants 
plaintiffs contend that the lease included implied covenants of reasonable development,further exploration,market production,and protection from drainage.in doing so,plaintiffs rely upon mcmahan boggess,gregory sohio petroleum,midland gas reffitt,swamp branch oil and gas rice,and warfield natural gas allen.specifically,plaintiffs argue that under the prudent operator standard,the lessee owes a duty of diligence which would be reasonably expected of an operator of ordinary prudence,having due regard for both the interest of the lessee and the interest of the lessor.mcmahan,at.plaintiffs maintain that a question of material fact exists as to whether equitable and its predecessors,by merely making one annual payment on one producing well on the property,failed to operate the lease with due regard for the interest of plaintiffs.
in mcmahan,the kentucky court of appeals noted that it is recognized in kentucky that in leases of this nature there is an implied obligation to develop the leasehold in good faith and with reasonable diligence.see at citations omitted emphasis added.the lease in mcmahan was an oil and gas lease that required the lessees to begin drilling within one year or pay a delay rental of per acre.the term of the lease was five years and for so long thereafter as gas or oil was produced.the leases in gregory,midland gas,and swamp branch were also of the nature of the mcmahan lease,in that each provided a specified lease term,followed by an indefinite extension of the lease term in the event that gas or oil was being produced.
equitable distinguishes the leases in the mcmahan line of cases as production,rather than,leases,a distinction at issue in bruen columbia gas trans.in bruen,the west virginia supreme court of appeals found that for leases,a lessor duty is merely to pay the flat rate,rather than develop the lease as required under production leases.specifically,the court opined that if an oil and gas lease contains a clause to continue the lease for a term so long thereafter as oil and gas is produced,but also provides for rental payments,then quantity of production is not relevant to the expiration of the term of the lease if such rental payments have been made by the lessee.id.at.as an example of a rental payment,bruen described a lease in which the rental payment had no relation to the quantity of gas contemplated or actually produced.it was compensation fixed in advance of production and without any definite knowledge as to what the production would be.hence,the rental reserved was the same for wells of light production and wells of heavy production.id.at citation and emphasis omitted.
in the matter at hand,the district court,although not citing bruen,mirrored its reasoning plaintiffs implied covenant claim could not warrant relief because the lease at issue provides for the payment of a royalty of per year,rather than on production.thus,the abundance of oil and gas,or lack thereof,produced on the real property at issue has no bearing on this action.at.
plaintiffs respond that the fixed royalty payment does not exclude operation of implied covenants under the lease.however,plaintiffs case law support for this claim consists of the mcmahan line of cases discussed above,which all involved leases whose rental payments were tied to production levels.see gregory,at royalty interest in of oil produced from entire leasehold midland gas,at gas royalty of of sale price for all gas sold and marketed from the premises and swamp branch,at royalty of one eighth of all gas from every well drilled on premises,the product from which is marketed and used off the premises.moreover,the lease in mcmahan expressly required lessees to begin drilling within one year or otherwise pay a delay rental of per acre.mcmahan,at see also union gas oil gillem,requiring lessee to begin drilling within one year or pay a delay rental of ten cents per acre.
nevertheless,the lease in this case also included production clauses similar to those in the mcmahan line of cases.specifically,the lease provided for a royalty of sic part of all oil produced from the leased premises,as well as a requirement to locate and commence a well on said premises within three months or pay per acre annually.at.these production components of the lease cast doubt on the district court finding that the abundance of oil and gas,or lack thereof,produced on the real property at issue has no bearing on this action.at.moreover,the sharp distinction highlighted by equitable was made under west virginia,not kentucky,law.
accordingly,because equitable has not produced any kentucky authority for the position that implied covenants do not operate under a lease that includes a fixed rental payment,even when that lease also includes royalties tied to production,we question the district court finding,as a matter of law,that no implied covenants were in operation under the lease.however,we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record,even if different from the grounds relied on by the district court.united states allen,cir.because,as discussed below,we find plaintiffs implied covenant claim unavailing on grounds of failure to provide notice to,or make demand of,equitable regarding any implied covenant,we affirm the district court ultimate award of summary judgment.
plaintiffs have failed to show a genuine issue of fact as to their satisfaction of the clear requirement under kentucky law that notice be provided to,or demand be made of,equitable regarding the need to comply with an implied covenant 
it is well settled law of this jurisdiction that where the right to have a lease forfeited for breach of the implied covenant to develop the property diligently and prudently is asserted,the lessor must have put the lessee in default by making definite and unequivocal demand of him that he do so within a reasonable time,or by giving that character of notice that compliance with the implied covenant is required.that is a condition precedent to the maintenance of a suit to forfeit,and the burden is upon the lessor to prove it.
sapp massey.
plaintiffs contend that two letters contained in the record,one dated august,from the widow of george hoover,and one dated january,from margaret hayes,daughter of george hoover,provided equitable with requisite notice.however,these letters only alleged nonpayment of royalties,without any mention of implied covenants.plaintiffs have offered no evidence of any notice to,or demand of,equitable regarding any implied covenant.where the lessor did not,at any time,demand that the lessee begin operations and give lessee a reasonable opportunity to do so there is no basis for the contention that the lease in question was forfeited because of the lessee failure to begin operations.ohio valley oil gas irvin dev.
accordingly,under sapp and ohio valley,we find that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether plaintiffs gave notice to,or made demand of,equitable regarding the need to comply with any implied covenant.plaintiffs thus can not forfeit the lease on grounds of equitable purported breach of implied covenants because plaintiffs have produced no evidence that they satisfied the condition precedent for forfeiting a lease on those grounds.sapp,at.the district court therefore did not err in finding that no genuine issue of fact existed as to whether plaintiffs may terminate the lease under kentucky law.
nevertheless,plaintiffs offer an alternative argument in favor of their power to terminate the lease.under toyota,bug imports,the lease,being of indefinite duration,may be terminable after a reasonable period of time.toyota noted the general rule that courts avoid finding a right in perpetuity unless contract language is unequivocal.id.at.the court in toyota then applied the rule,especially applicable to distributorship contracts that the contract is terminable after a reasonable time.id.citation omitted.kentucky courts have also applied this rule in the more general context of business contracts.water plant bd.cent.bell.
first,plaintiffs fail to address why this court should apply a kentucky business contract rule to a lease of real property.second,the duration provision at issue is distinguishable from the provisions found to be indefinite in toyota and south central bell,because the lease in this case terminates upon a particular event.specifically,the lease provides that it shall remain in force for the term of ten years from this date and as long thereafter as oil or gas,or either of them,is produced from said land by the lessee.at.in contrast,the distributorship contract in toyota provided a term of one year,renewable after that one year term so long as a certain sales level was met,at which point the contract became of indefinite duration.toyota,at.the business contract in south central bell provided that notwithstanding termination of a joint use agreement,this agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to all utility poles jointly used by the parties at the time of such termination.cen.bell,at.the court in south central bell then noted that the provision provide d no time period for the agreement pertaining to the original utility poles to end.id.similarly,the court in brownsboro road restaurant,jerrico,which applied toyota to a franchise agreement,noted that there was nothing in the agreement indicating that the parties intended it to terminate upon any particular time or event.
even if we were to apply a kentucky business contract rule to a lease of real property in this case,plaintiffs have also failed to argue in support of applying toyota to a lease that terminates upon a particular event,specifically,the lessee failure to produce oil or gas on the property.because plaintiffs have not addressed why this court should apply the toyota rule to a lease of real property,or to any contract that terminates upon a particular event,we find unavailing plaintiffs claim that the lease was terminable after a reasonable time.
accordingly,because plaintiffs offer no evidence of notice to,or demand of,equitable regarding implied covenants to develop the property,and because plaintiffs offer no argument as to why toyota should apply to a lease of real property that terminates upon a particular event,the district court did not err when finding no genuine issue of material fact regarding plaintiffs power to terminate the lease under kentucky law.
ii.discovery 
plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion when declining to grant plaintiffs discovery request.however,plaintiffs discussion of the issue on appeal primarily raises a separate issue concerning the district court conversion of equitable motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment without notice to plaintiffs.we will discuss each issue in turn.

first,plaintiffs purported link between discovery and their power to terminate the lease,as well as their ability to demonstrate equitable failure to show satisfaction of the amount in controversy requirement,is unavailing.plaintiffs contend that discovery would have helped determine the reasonableness of equitable withholding of royalty payments.however,we have already determined that the question of plaintiffs power to terminate the lease in this case does not turn on the reasonableness of equitable conduct
