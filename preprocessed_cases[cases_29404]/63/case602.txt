plaintiff,christy adams,as special administrator of the estate of janice adams,brought a action in the circuit court of cook county against northern illinois gas company.the circuit court granted motion for summary judgment.the appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of and remanded the cause for further proceedings.d.we allowed petition for leave to appeal a,and now affirm the appellate court.
background 
the record contains the following pertinent evidence.since,janice adams decedent resided in a house located at greenbay avenue in calumet city.decedent mother,lucia georgevich,bought the house,but decedent paid the mortgage and the utilities.various appliances in the house,including a range,were fueled by natural gas.
on the evening of december,decedent arrived home,opened a door,and stepped inside.the house exploded and was engulfed in flames,causing her death.
first at the scene was the calumet city fire department.assistant chief dan smits and fire investigator joe ratkovich investigated the cause and origin of the explosion.smits saw the fire and saw that the walls of the house had been blown out.he observed the body of decedent just inside what had been an entrance to the house.smits inspected the gas meter,gas piping,and gas appliances and directed that all those items be removed and preserved.
the calumet city fire department determined that the cause of the explosion and fire was the failure of the flexible brass gas connector that connected the kitchen range to the gas supply.the brand name of the connector was cobra.failure of the connector permitted a large amount of natural gas to escape and accumulate in the house.when decedent entered the house and turned on an electric light,a small spark from the switch ignited the gas.the illinois state fire marshall,the united states bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms,and the private fire investigator employed by the homeowner insurance carrier also investigated the explosion and all agreed that it was caused by the failure of the gas connector to the range.
plaintiff,one of decedent daughters,brought a action in a,first amended complaint.count ii named as a defendant plaintiff alleged that knew that cobra brand natural gas appliance connectors were defective and prone to failure resulting in natural gas leaks and explosions.plaintiff alleged that had a duty to warn its customers,including plaintiff decedent,about the existence of cobra brand natural gas appliance connectors and the dangers of natural gas leak,explosion and fire associated with these connectors.plaintiff alleged that breached this duty to warn in that failed to provide a any or b adequate warning c used an ineffective means to inform customers d failed to initiate an inspection program to identify and remove cobra brand natural gas appliance connectors from customer homes and businesses and e failed to properly inspect decedent home to cause the removal of the aforesaid cobra brand connector.
the record includes the depositions of several opinion witnesses,including charles lamar,wayne genck,norman breyer,and edward karnes.their testimony adduced the following additional evidence.
the connector in this case was manufactured by the cobra hose company,which has been out of business since.made as early as,cobra connectors were widely used in illinois and other states.the cobra connector essentially was a corrugated flexible brass tube with threaded brass connectors at each end that connect a gas appliance to the hard pipe gas source.the threaded connectors were telescoped and fastened to the ends of the corrugated brass tube by a process known as brazing.the compound used in the brazing process is composed of phosphorized brazing alloys containing a substantial portion of phosphorous and a high percentage of copper.
it is undisputed that natural gas,in its original state,is odorless.the chemical ethyl mercaptan,which is a sulfur component,is added as an odorant to give natural gas its distinctive smell.in addition to sulfur that is intentionally added,natural gas itself produces sulfur compounds through intrinsic chemical reactions.by law,is required to supply odorized gas to its customers as a safety precaution,so that customers more easily can detect a gas leak.the natural gas that supplied to decedent was as the law required it to be.
however,when sulfur is added to natural gas,as in the present case,a chemical reaction begins to occur between the phosphorous brazing alloy and the sulfur.this chemical reaction causes the brazed joint to corrode and deteriorate.over time,the deterioration of the brazed joint results in its separation from the corrugated tube and the consequent release of natural gas into the home.even the naturally occurring sulfides in the gas are sufficient to cause the brazed connector eventually to fail.
in,the american national standards institute ansi revised its standards on gas connectors and banned phosphorous brazing.ansi subcommittee on connectors is the committee that has jurisdiction over all domestic standards for natural gas ranges,furnaces,water heaters,and connectors.the specifications were modified to warn that the use of brazing compounds that contain phosphorous can result in a brittle joint and can be deadly.
the record contains evidence that was aware of the potential danger in homes using cobra connectors.in may,supervisor of research services reported to the subcommittee that the sudden,mysterious separation of brass connectors and their end fittings has been a concern of gas utility people for several years.in a letter dated december,the united states consumer product safety commission informed the american gas association aga that cobra connectors allegedly caused a number of fires in homes.according to the letter,while some jurisdictions did not allow the installation of cobra connectors,many such connectors may still be in service,and therefore may be susceptible to creating a significant hazard to the occupants of those residences equipped with such connectors.on december,the president of the aga sent a letter to all its member companies,including,stating that the commission had notified aga that cobra connectors had an increasing potential to fail over time.
the record also includes copies of consumer news notices that sent to its customers.the,and december notices indicated that an old connector could crack,creating an unsafe condition,when the appliance was moved.the december,january,may,and june notices warned the consumer product safety commission has warned that certain appliance connectors manufactured prior to may be unsafe.if you are concerned,do not try to move the appliance to inspect the connector.instead,call a qualified service agency of to make the inspection.
also,knew that failed cobra connectors were determined to have caused many explosions and fires within its service area,including aurora,evanston,and rockford.in the there were a series of fires in the village of south holland associated with brazed connectors.wayne kortum,a volunteer firefighter in south holland and a employee,informed supervisors at the glenwood district office,the district that includes the decedent home,about the connectors involved with these fires.thereafter,kortum attended a general meeting at the glenwood office where supervisors informed him and other service employees that there were problems with brazed connectors and that the service employees should look for these connectors in customers homes.
in november,representatives participated in a meeting with officials from the village of skokie.the skokie fire department had determined that several fires and an explosion in the village were related to brazed connector failures.carol anderson,one of the attendees,testified that in the she was aware that brazed connectors were a hazard.according to john agosti,a skokie fire official,represented that it would notify its service and construction personnel about replacing brazed connectors.in turn,these employees would warn the customers with whom they came in contact.
charles henry,a trained serviceman,testified in a deposition as follows.instructed its service employees on the potential danger of cobra connectors.when a employee encountered a brazed connector,the employee was required to tag the connector and advise the customer that the connector needed to be replaced as soon as possible.
decedent,leonard adams,testified in a deposition as follows.he had observed employees read the gas meter in the utility room of decedent home on occasion,but they did not examine anything in the house other than the meter.in or,after having a new clothes drier installed by the appliance retailer,a gas leak was detected.decedent telephoned.a employee came to the house and checked the gas pipe between the meter and the clothes drier.the employee discovered that the pipe was leaking and tightened it he did not do anything else.
moved for summary judgment against plaintiff.contended that it did not owe decedent a legal duty to warn her that her cobra connector was potentially hazardous because decedent owned the connector and not.the circuit court granted motion for summary judgment against plaintiff 
plaintiff appealed.initially,the appellate court,with one justice dissenting,affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of,holding that did not owe decedent a legal duty.however,the appellate court modified its opinion upon denial of plaintiff petition for rehearing.in its modified opinion,the appellate court,inter alia,reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of.the appellate court held,as a matter of law,that a utility company that has actual knowledge of a dangerous condition associated with the use of its product has a responsibility to its customers to warn them of that danger.d at.

common law 
american consumers have been using gas as fuel for illumination or heat for over a century.courts from across the nation,including illinois courts,long ago considered the factors in determining the existence of a duty with respect to the duties that gas distributors owe to their customers concerning escaping gas.the common law,which is always heedful of realities when it formulates rules to govern conduct graham north carolina butane gas,has established the following principles.
gas is a dangerous substance or commodity when it is not under control.metz central illinois electric gas,mcclure hoopeston gas electric,accord suiter ohio valley gas,ohio,bellefuil willmar gas,graham,at,at.however,a gas company is not liable as an insurer for injuries sustained as the result of the escape of gas.rather,the company is liable for its negligence in permitting the gas to escape.pappas peoples gas light coke,accord bellefuil,at,at graham,at,at.energy power sources,at gas,at.expressions of the degree of care that a gas company must exercise range from reasonable see,graham,at,at to high see,mcclure,at.this variety of expression simply means that a gas company must exercise a degree of care to prevent the escape of gas from its pipes commensurate with or proportional to the level of danger which it is the company duty to avoid.metz,at,cosgrove commonwealth edison,d,accord lewis vermont gas,doxstater northwest cities gas,idaho,bellefuil,at,at d energy power sources,at gas,at tellier,annotation,liability of gas for injury or damage due to defects in service lines on consumer premises.
while a gas company must exercise the requisite degree of care so that no injury occurs in the distribution of gas while it is under the company control,such responsibility is limited to the time the gas is in the company own pipes.doxstater,idaho at,at collecting cases.in illinois,the seminal example of the common law rule pertaining to gas distribution in a consumer pipes and fixtures is clare bond county gas.
in clare,the plaintiff opened a shop and hired a plumber to install a gas stove for heat.after the installation,she noticed an offensive odor that irritated her eyes and gave her a headache.she notified the gas company.the president of the gas company visited the shop several times and made suggestions to remedy the situation.his suggestions were followed,but the problem continued.the smell was so strong in the closet where the gas meter was located that the plaintiff kept the door to the closet closed.several weeks after the unsuccessful attempts to locate the source of the problem,a friend of the plaintiff was looking for a screwdriver.he lit a match to help him look for it in the dark closet.he opened the closet door and an explosion occurred.it was subsequently discovered that the gas pipe that ran beneath the floor contained holes caused by rust.the gas that escaped from the pipe had accumulated in the closet.clare,at.appealing a judgment in favor of plaintiff,the gas company contended that there was no evidence in the record to warrant the finding that it the gas company had notice and knowledge that the pipes were leaking and gas was escaping into the building that without such notice or knowledge there was no duty incumbent upon it to shut off the gas supply.clare,at.
reversing the judgment in favor of plaintiff,clare relied on established common law in the absence of notice of defects it is not incumbent upon a gas company to exercise reasonable care to ascertain whether or not service pipes under the control of the property owner or the consumer are fit for the furnishing of gas.clare,at.where a gas company does not install the pipes or fixtures on a customer premises,and does not own them and has no control over them,the company is not responsible for their condition or for their maintenance,and as a result is not liable for injuries caused by a leak therein of which the company had no knowledge.clare,at,collecting cases.clare looked to the common law as evolved up to that time and today continues to accord with our understanding of the common law rule.accord oliver peoples gas light coke,d,accord bellefuil,at,at discussing rule in context of gas appliances doxstater,idaho at,at,quoting kelley public service of northern illinois,d energy power sources,stating rule in context of appliances d energy power sources stating general rule gas,at at.
courts reason that a person duty can extend no further than the person right,power,and authority to implement it.gas company employees do not have the right to enter the premises of their customers to inspect pipes or fixtures except upon the license or permission of the owner.clare,at.the consumer,by application for gas service,assumes the burden of inspecting and maintaining the pipes and fittings on the consumer property in a manner reasonably suited to meet the required service.the company has the right to assume that the customer interior system of pipes and fittings is sufficiently secure to permit the gas to be introduced with safety.clare,at,collecting cases accord bellefuil,at,at graham,at,at moran junior college standard oil of california,d energy power sources.
courts also reason that,in a negligence action,knowledge of the facts out of which the duty to act arises is essential.in order that an act or omission may be regarded as negligent,the defendant must have knowledge,or ought to have known from the circumstances,that the allegedly negligent act or omission endangered another.weber interstate light power.accordingly,the common law rule of no duty of a gas company with respect to a consumer pipes or fittings is premised on the gas company lack of knowledge or notice of a gas leak.see,clare,at,stating rule with proviso of gas company lack of knowledge or notice bellefuil,at,at the duty,by reason of actual or constructive notice of some dangerous condition,must arise before the gas company can be found negligent for its failure to inspect or shut off the gas supply.
considering the requirement of the gas company knowledge or notice of a gas leak,the exception to the common law rule is evident 
where it appears that a gas company has knowledge that gas is escaping in a building occupied by one of its consumers it becomes the duty of the gas company to shut off the gas supply until the necessary repairs have been made although the defective pipe or apparatus does not belong to the company and is not in its charge or custody.clare,at.
accord graham,at,at citing clare d energy power sources,at gas,at at.in the specific context of gas appliances,courts have gone so far as to impose on a gas company that has knowledge of a gas leak a duty to inspect 
w henever a gas company is in possession of facts that would suggest to a person of ordinary care and prudence that an appliance of a customer is leaking or is otherwise unsafe for the transportation of gas,the company has a duty to investigate,as a person of ordinary care and prudence similarly situated and handling such a dangerous substance would do,before it continues to furnish additional gas.the duty to exercise reasonable diligence to inspect or shut off the gas supply is measured by the likelihood of injury.circumstances may be such as to require a gas company to investigate immediately and shut off the gas supply until repairs are made.the nature of the notice may also affect the extent of inspection necessary.bellefuil,at,at.
it is clear that the knowledge that would impose on a gas company this duty is not limited to actual knowledge,but may include constructive knowledge or notice.it is sufficient if the gas company received facts which would have made the defects known to an ordinary prudent person.for example,clare was rendered in the context of the gas company denial of notice or knowledge.emphasis added.clare,at.further,this court the common law rule with the accepted proviso of a gas company lack of knowledge clare,at,where it appears that a gas company has knowledge or notice clare,at,in the absence of notice.see mrdalj public service of northern illinois,kelley.at,kilmer browning,ruberg skelly oil,fore united natural gas,bellefuil,at,at.
further,clare was directed not only to actual gas leaks,but also to defects.clare,at,in the absence of notice of defects emphasis added.the rule in illinois as to the liability of a gas company is such company is responsible for a customer pipe if it has knowledge of a leak or of a possible defect therein.emphasis added.oliver,d at,accord bellefuil,at,at speaking of a customer gas appliance that is leaking or is otherwise unsafe for the transportation of gas emphasis added d energy power sources,at stating that if a gas company has notice of a leak or defect in pipes or lines owned or controlled by a consumer,it is under a duty to notify the consumer and see that the leak or defect is repaired,or shut off the gas.
this common law rule and corresponding exception serve the concept that a gas company is not an insurer for any injury sustained as a result of escaping gas,but rather is liable only for its negligence.to apply any other rule would make the gas supplier an insurer if anything went wrong with any of the appliances over which it had no control.wilson home gas.
as the appellate court in this case recognized,illinois courts have not addressed a gas company duty to warn its customers of the possible deterioration of the customer fixtures when they are damaged,in part,due to the gas product itself.d at.however,addressing the same facts as in this case,two decisions from other jurisdictions recognize that gas companies who have notice of the danger caused by sulfides in their gas coming in contact with brazed connectors owe common law tort duties lemke metropolitan utilities district,and halliburton public service of colorado.we agree with the appellate court that these cases are instructive.d at.
in lemke,a gas explosion destroyed the home of lorraine and kenneth lemke and severely injured lorraine.lemke,at,at.the trial court found that the cause of the explosion was a cobra connector,which failed due to the interaction of the phosphorous brazing alloy and the gas.although there was evidence that the metropolitan utilities district mud installed thousands of cobra connectors in the homes of mud customers,there was no evidence that mud installed the cobra connector to the plaintiff gas range.the court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs.lemke,at,at.
appealing from the judgment,mud contended that it had no duty to notify its customers concerning a potential hazard from cobra connectors,especially a customer who may not have purchased the connector from mud.lemke,at,at.the nebraska supreme court rejected this contention.
the lemke court reviewed its past statements of the common law principles.the court concluded 
because a gas company has a nondelegable duty to exercise due care regarding natural gas supplied to a customer,a gas company duty of care not only pertains to the company distribution of gas through its pipelines,but extends to distribution through a customer service line or gas appliance that the company knows,or should know,is unsafe for conducting or using gas.lemke,at,at.
the court noted,as the record in this case shows,that the american gas association warned all of its members,including mud,that cobra connectors presented a danger in the distribution of natural gas.the court reasoned 
when mud received information about the dangerous condition or potential hazard involving cobra connectors but did not disseminate this critical information to its customers who were using gas appliances with cobra connectors,mud effectively exerted control in a situation that could eventually culminate in injury to customers who continued to use gas supplied by mud.lemke,at,at.
according to the court,that information 
placed mud on notice that its customers who had gas appliances with cobra connectors would be endangered when the connector separated from a gas service line or appliance.consequently,when mud became aware that the distribution of gas through a cobra connector presented a risk of injury to customers,mud had the duty to use due care,such as issuance of a warning,to protect customers.lemke,at,at.
as in lemke,superior knowledge of the risks pertaining to cobra connectors begat a duty of due care,such as issuing a warning to its customers.
in halliburton,the public service company of colorado,similar to here,knew at least since the that a large number of brazed connectors failed because of the interaction of the brazed connector and the sulfides in the gas.the court cited four reasons to impose a duty on the gas company to inspect plaintiff brazed connector the relatively insignificant amount of time and expense that defendant would have expended to evaluate the connector and take corrective action two service calls at plaintiff home after the gas company knew of this hazard,which affected approximately homes in the denver area the likelihood of the connector failing and possibly causing an explosion unless corrective action were taken and defendant expertise in dealing with such problems.the court continued the most compelling reason,however,for imposing a duty upon defendant is that its product,natural gas,which contained the corrosive ethyl mercaptan,was a substantial factor in causing the deterioration of the connector tube.emphasis in original.halliburton,at.
at oral argument,plaintiff expressly clarified that the extent of duty of reasonable care in this case should be to warn its customers of the dangers presented by its gas coming in contact with the brazed connectors.thus,while no issue exists in this case regarding a duty to inspect every connector,we agree with the following from halliburton when a party can reasonably foresee that its product will be used as an integral component of a defective and unreasonably dangerous product,there is a duty upon that party to undertake corrective action to alleviate,if possible,the hazard.halliburton,at.the duty is simply to use reasonable care in dealing with the hazard,including a duty to warn.halliburton,at.we agree with the appellate court that,while not controlling,halliburton is also instructive.d at.
halliburton and lemke acknowledged the common law rule of a gas company lack of duty toward a customer equipment absent knowledge of a defect,but recognized that the gas suppliers in those cases had knowledge of the danger of their product being in contact with brazed connectors.those cases also noted that the danger in question was not one normally associated with the product and consumers were not in a position to be aware of the danger without adequate warnings.since the gas companies helped create the danger and had superior knowledge of the hazard,they owed a responsibility to their customers with respect to that danger.
we consider halliburton and lemke to represent a reasoned adaptation of the common law to address the exigency presented by brazed connectors.we recognize that t he growth and adaptation of the common law to our contemporary concerns should not impose impractical burdens or impossible duties.hensley montgomery county.however,it is equally clear that r easonable care is not a standard beyond the reach of any enterprise.weinberg dinger.
in the present case,as in halliburton and lemke,there is no dispute that had actual knowledge of the danger.knew that sulfides in the gas corroded brazed connectors,ultimately causing the connectors to leak gas it was only a question of when the connector would fail.based on its superior knowledge and the fact that it helped to create the dangerous condition,we hold that owed a common law duty of reasonable care with respect to the brazed connectors.
this holding is directed exclusively to the element of duty and is limited to the evidence contained in the present record.we repeat plaintiff clarification at oral argument that duty of reasonable care in this case consists only of warning and not inspection.we express no opinion as to the adequacy of conduct in this case.it is for the trier of fact to determine whether conduct met the standard of care required of it under the circumstances.based on our disposition of this issue,we do not discuss other tort theories raised by the parties.
and supporting amici contend that tariff on file with the illinois commerce commission is the sole source of its duties to its customers.points to the following provision of its tariff on file with the commission at the time of the explosion 
equipment furnished and maintained by customer.
all gas utilization equipment,piping,and vents furnished by the customer shall be suitable for the purposes hereof and shall be installed and maintained by the customer at all times in accordance with accepted practice and in conformity with requirements of public health and safety,as set forth by the properly constituted authorities and by the company.
the company assumes no responsibility in connection with the installation,maintenance or operation of the customer equipment and reserves the right to discontinue service if such equipment is in unsatisfactory condition.
contends that the plain language of this provision bars imposition of a duty in this case.
a tariff is a public document setting forth services being offered rates and charges with respect to services and governing rules,regulations,and practices relating to those services.north river insurance jones,d.the public utilities act requires public utilities such as to file tariffs with the illinois commerce commission.ilcs west.a tariff is usually drafted by the regulated utility,but when duly filed with the commission,it binds both the utility and the customer and governs their relationship.see danisco ingredients usa,kansas city power light.once the commission approves a tariff,it is a law,not a contract,and has the force and effect of a statute.illinois central gulf sankey brothers,d,aff.
illinois law in this area originates in federal law.in western union telegraph esteve brothers,the united states supreme court considered the legal effect of tariffs filed pursuant to the interstate commerce act 
the act of stat,introduced a new principle into the legal relations of the telegraph companies with their patrons which dominated and modified the principles previously governing them.before the act the companies had a liability from which they might or might not extricate themselves according to views of policy prevailing in the several states.thereafter,for all messages sent in interstate or foreign commerce,the outstanding consideration became that of uniformity and equality of rates.uniformity demanded that the rate represent the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.it could not be varied by agreement still less could it be varied by lack of agreement.the rate became,not as before a matter of contract by which a legal liability could be modified,but a matter of law by which a uniform liability was imposed.
accord in re illinois bell switching station litigation,miller,specially concurring meyer illinois bell telephone,d,both citing esteve brothers.
the united states supreme court has described the federal doctrine as follows the rights as defined by the tariff can not be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier.american telephone telegraph central office telephone,d,quoting keogh chicago northwestern ry.the doctrine serves two goals prevention of price discrimination among rate payers,and preservation of the role of regulatory agencies in deciding reasonable rates for public utilities and services.fax telecommunicaciones,v.at t,cir wegoland nynex,cir qwest kelly,and cases cited therein lovejoy,th,d.
tariff provisions,such as tariff,are usually referred to as liability limitations.see,illinois bell switching station litigation,at,miller,specially concurring danisco,at,at.liability limitations reflect the status of public utilities as regulated monopolies whose operations are subject to extensive restrictions the requirements of uniform,nondiscriminatory rates and the goal of universal service,achieved through the preservation of utility prices that virtually all customers can afford.illinois bell switching station,at,miller,specially concurring.the underlying theory of liability limitations is that,because a public utility is strictly regulated,its liability should be defined and limited so that it may be able to provide service at reasonable rates.a reasonable rate is in part dependent on a rule limiting liability.illinois bell switching station,at,and cases cited therein danisco,at,at collecting cases.the goal is to secure reasonable and just rates for all without undue preference or advantage to any.since that end is attainable only by adherence to the approved rate,based upon an authorized classification,that rate represents the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.western union telegraph priester,quoting esteve brothers,at.at.at.
to be sure,in an action for negligence,the issue of a legal duty is generally distinguished from the issue of liability for breach of that duty.see,thompson,at.however,a plaintiff can not prevail against a defendant who is under no duty and equally can not prevail against a defendant who is immune and to that extent the two concepts are the same.dobbs,law of torts,at.illinois courts have long held that a tariff provision such as the one at issue in this case provides the source for,and determines the nature and extent of,a public utility service obligations to its customers.illinois bell switching station,at,miller,specially concurring meyer,d at,sarelas illinois bell telephone,d.
nonetheless,all state law causes of action are not necessarily precluded.pink dot,teleport communications group,th,d.as explained in adamson worldcom communications,
the doctrine bars only an action that seeks to vary the terms of an applicable tariff.citation.thus,the effect of a tariff on a particular claim depends on the nature of the claim and the specific terms of the tariff.if the claim is one that implicates the provisions of a tariff,then the tariff controls according to its terms,which may either limit relief available or bar a claim entirely.but if the claim is unrelated to the tariff,then the claim is not limited or barred.in other words,merely because a tariff exists does not necessarily mean that a claim is barred.
in the context of the federal doctrine,we are reminded in order for the filed rate doctrine to serve its purpose,therefore,it need only those suits that seek to alter the terms and conditions provided for in the tariff.central office,at.at,d at rehnquist,concurring.further 
the tariff does not govern the entirety of the relationship between the common carrier and its customers.for example,it does not affect whatever duties state law might impose.the filed rate doctrine purpose is to ensure that the filed rates are the exclusive source of the terms and conditions by which the common carrier provides to its customers the services covered by the tariff.it does not serve as a shield against all actions based in state law.central office,at.at,d at rehnquist,concurring.
illinois law accords with this reasoning.
in,the general assembly enacted the public utilities act,ch,par.et.this court has described the legislative intent of the act as follows 
the public utilities act citation,under which the commerce commission regulates all public utilities,was enacted to assure the provision of efficient and adequate utility service to the public at a reasonable cost.because unrestrained competition prior to adoption of the act had often resulted in the financial failure of many utilities,the act adopted a policy of regulated monopoly to assure that utilities would be able to earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment and thus would be able to provide the required service.local,duoc,seafarers international union of north america illinois commerce comm n,and cases cited therein.
this court also has observed it can not be doubted that the public utilities act supersedes the common law liability of the carrier so far as rates and unreasonable discrimination are concerned.emphasis added.terminal ass of louis public utilities comm n.this court recognized the law is well settled in this state that the matter of rate regulation is essentially one of legislative control.the fixing of rates is not a judicial function.illinois bell telephone illinois commerce comm n,quoting produce terminal illinois commerce comm ex rel.peoples gas light coke.
however,this court in pioneer corn of illinois northern illinois gas,applied the established common law duty analysis as explained in clare to the defendant utility,which is the same defendant utility in this case.pioneer,at.in pioneer,plaintiff customer brought an action against to recover damages for an explosion and fire due to the failure of plaintiff equipment.plaintiff alleged,inter alia,common law negligence.the trial court refused plaintiff proffered jury instruction that was negligent in that it failed to inspect the plaintiff equipment.the jury found for.the appellate court reversed,holding that the trial court erred in refusing plaintiff proffered jury instruction.this court reversed the appellate court and affirmed the judgment in favor of.citing clare,this court held that did not have a duty to inspect plaintiff equipment and,therefore,plaintiff proffered instruction was erroneous.pioneer,at.
we presume that the court in pioneer was not unaware of the federal doctrine as explained in the priester and esteve brothers decisions from the united states supreme court.additionally,according to,the tariff at issue in this case has been on file with the commission s ince at least.
however,despite this court prior decisions interpreting the public utilities act and recognizing that rate regulation is not a judicial function,despite prior decisions from the united states supreme court establishing the federal doctrine,and despite the existence of the specific tariff in this case,this court applied the established common law duty analysis to.neither this court nor believed that this tariff precluded a common law analysis in a negligence action for personal injury.
similarly,this court in metz applied the common law doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to the defendant utility.metz,at.why did the appellate court and this court in each of these cases fail to mention the public utilities act,the doctrine,or any particular tariff because illinois courts have recognized that where a utility tariff speaks to a specific duty,the tariff may be controlling however,where the tariff does not address a particular situation,the common law applies and a common law duty analysis must be applied.
for example,in sarelas,the defendant telephone company,due to a clerical error,disconnected one of the extensions of the plaintiff office telephone for hours.the plaintiff sued the telephone company and its president for damages,alleging that defendant owed him a duty of continuing service,and that defendant violated this duty by interrupting service.the trial court dismissed plaintiff complaint.sarelas,d at.
on appeal,the appellate court held that the defendant duty to plaintiff was based on the tariff that the defendant filed with the illinois commerce commission.in so holding,the court reasoned 
t he extent to which defendants owed plaintiff a legal duty is determined by the particular provisions of the tariff on file with the commission there is no contract in this case on which plaintiff can rely,nor are his allegations of a breach of duty sufficient to constitute a claim in tort.he complains simply of the disconnection of his telephone extension,and claims a breach of duty which arises either from the tariff or not at all.emphasis added.sarelas,d at.
in sarelas,since the plaintiff could not plead a breach of duty sufficient to constitute a claim in tort,his duty was defined by the tariff.sarelas clearly leaves open the existence of common law duties had the plaintiff been able to plead them.
more recently,in cosgrove,our appellate court,applying a common law analysis,reinstated negligence and res ipsa loquitur counts against.cosgrove,d at.the court concluded is subject to liability in tort pursuant to section of the joint tortfeasor contribution act.cosgrove,d at,quoting ilcs west.
indeed,illinois case law reveals that illinois courts have long applied common law principles to defendant utilities subsequent to the enactment of the public utilities act and despite the existence of tariffs filed with the illinois commerce commission.see,metz,clare,cosgrove,d,oliver,d,mrdalj.thus,whether tariff bars plaintiff cause of action depends on the nature of plaintiff lawsuit and the meaning of the tariff language.
in this case,contends that the appellate court decision can not stand in light of illinois bell switching station.we disagree,finding that case to be distinguishable.in illinois bell switching station,a telephone switching station caught fire,allegedly due to the negligent or willful failure of illinois bell to take fire prevention measures.the fire left many customers without telephone service for about a month.the customers filed a class action to seek to recover economic losses incurred due to that loss of service.illinois bell argued that its filed tariff defined the limits of its liability for interruptions in service.the class plaintiffs contended that the tariff should not bar their claims because the tariff was against public policy and conflicted with provisions of the public utilities act.illinois bell switching station,at.
in holding that the tariff controlled in that case,this court found no duty on which to base the class plaintiffs claims.this court initially noted that illinois bell was nowhere charged with the duty to provide completely uninterrupted service.rather,its duty was to provide adequate,efficient,and reliable service,which is not tantamount to infallible service.temporary disruptions may occur without reducing bell service to a level less than adequate,efficient,or reliable.further,this court held that the exculpatory language in bell tariff properly limited claims from disruption of service to a rebate of the costs for the missed service,and concluded that the tariff provision,which limited bell liability in the event of a service disruption,was not contrary to the act.illinois bell switching station,at.
unlike illinois bell switching station,where no duty existed on the part of illinois bell,we have concluded in this case that owed a duty to plaintiff.further,in illinois bell switching station,the class plaintiffs contended that the tariff applied,but conflicted with the public utilities act.however,in this case,plaintiff contends that tariff,as written,does not apply to her claim,an issue that was never addressed in illinois bell switching station.
turning to the tariff provision in this case,it is evident that the tariff essentially codifies the common law rule that a gas company has no duty with respect to a consumer gas pipes and fittings,based on the consumer responsibility for maintaining his or her own equipment and the company lack of control and knowledge.see,clare,at,stating common law rule.however,contends that the tariff provision eliminates the common law exception to this rule.according to,the tariff provision absolves it from any duty with respect to a consumer pipes and equipment even if it has knowledge that a customer appliance is leaking or is otherwise unsafe for the transportation of gas.see,bellefuil,at,at stating common law exception.
we agree with the appellate court rejection of this contention.d at.position is untenable for several reasons.
initially,allowing this cause of action to proceed would not contravene the policies underlying liability limitations.plaintiff is not seeking rate preferences that are not accorded to other customers she is not seeking to enforce side agreements which vary from our interpretation of the tariff.rather,if proved,awarding damages on plaintiff claim would neither discriminate against other customers nor involve the court in tariff setting.see,lovejoy,th at,d at day v.at t,th,d.
although a utility tariff is not a legislative enactment,its interpretation is governed by the rules of statutory construction.bloom township high school illinois commerce comm n,d,accord danisco,at,at.the cardinal rule of interpreting statutes,to which all other canons and rules are subordinate,is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.mcnamee federated equipment supply,illinois bell switching station,at.although a court should first consider the statutory language,a court must presume that the legislature,in enacting a statute,did not intend absurdity or injustice.mcnamee,at,state farm fire casualty yapejian,illinois crime investigating comm buccieri.a statute or ordinance must receive a sensible construction,even though such construction qualifies the universality of its language.illinois bell switching station,at.
specifically,as earlier noted,rate regulation is one of legislative control and is not a judicial function.therefore,the right to review the conclusion of the commission acting under authority delegated by the legislature is accordingly limited.this deference to the judgment of the commission is especially appropriate in the area of setting rates.illinois bell,at,and cases cited therein.
applying these principles to the tariff provision at issue in this case,we conclude that the commission did not intend to completely immunize with respect to a gas leak of which it has notice.it must be remembered 
public utilities do not enjoy a general tort immunity they owe a duty of care to the general public.thus,if a utility company recognizes that its conduct under certain circumstances creates an unreasonable risk of harm to another,it has a duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent that risk of harm from occurring.d public utilities,at.
remembering that gas is a dangerous substance and commodity metz,at,mcclure,at,the consequences of interpretation of this tariff provision are readily apparent.in effect,argues that if it had omitted language regarding duty and liability from its tariff,it would owe no duty whatsoever to anyone under any circumstances.the commission own decisions and orders belie such an unreasonable contention.see nordine illinois power,observing that orders and decisions of the illinois commerce commission are public records and as such we take judicial notice of them.
for example,in citizens utilities of illinois,wl illinois commerce comm september,the utility company cuci filed with the commission a revised tariff which proposed,inter alia,changes to its conditions of service.regarding one such condition,the commission observed cuci proposes sweeping language for its fire protection service which would absolve it from any liability for damages of any nature to persons or property caused by fire.the commission agrees with staff criticism of this proposal.
indeed,the commission has rejected the very argument that makes before this court.in teleport communications group,wl illinois commerce comm november,teleport communications group,tcg,filed a petition for arbitration with the commission,seeking arbitration of the disputed portions of an interconnection agreement with ameritech.
one disputed provision in the agreement required each party to indemnify the other against losses suffered by customers of the ultimate service provider.ameritech proposal would require ameritech and tcg each to limit its liability,in the event of a transmission delay or defect,to an amount equivalent to the proportionate charge to the end user customer for the period of service during which the delay or defect occurred.
tcg responded that it should not be required to include a limitation of liability provision in contracts with its customers.the commission noted that tcg intention was to assign the responsibility for loss to the party that has the ability to control or prevent the loss from occurring in the first place.further,tcg viewed ameritech proposal as insulating ameritech from any harm caused by its actions.ameritech would have no liability or responsibility to tcg or its customers,even if they are harmed by grossly negligent or deliberate wrongdoing.tcg believed that ameritech position would give ameritech the right to dictate,unilaterally,an important aspect of tcg relationship with its customers.the commission noted that its staff believed that ameritech proposal was improper and should not be adopted.
the commission rejected ameritech proposed indemnity provision,disagreeing with ameritech portrayal of its risks.the commission reasoned that any claim against ameritech by a tcg customer would have to be founded on contract or tort.the evidence showed that ameritech did not anticipate having a contractual relationship with tcg end users.thus,the commission reasoned,a tcg customer could not maintain a successful lawsuit against ameritech based on a contract claim.
the commission continued as follows 
with respect to tort claims against ameritech,the illinois supreme court has spoken authoritatively on this very point.the court in in re illinois bell switching station litigation reaffirmed the moorman doctrine.this doctrine stands for the proposition that under the common law purely economic damages are generally not recoverable in tort actions.three exceptions were articulated where the plaintiff has sustained damage resulting from a sudden or dangerous occurrence where the plaintiff damages are the proximate result of a defendant intentional,false representation and where the plaintiff damages are a proximate result of a negligent misrepresentation by a defendant in the business of supplying information for the guidance of others in their business transactions.the court held that a tort claim for economic damages incurred from a loss of service arising from a fire at an illinois bell switching station was precluded in the absence of any exceptions to the moorman doctrine.
the commission believes that the moorman doctrine provides ameritech with ample protection in the vast majority of situations it has identified in the record.
in its brief ameritech maintains that the proposed arbitration decision overlooks the substantial exposure to direct damages in tort left open by the moorman doctrine.essentially,ameritech turns to potential claims for personal injury and property damage to demonstrate its exposure.providing telecommunications services is not an inherently dangerous activity and it is difficult to imagine many scenarios in which ameritech provision of interconnection services will put third parties at risk.even if such situations do arise,the public interest does not require that we attempt to insulate either party from the effects of its own improper conduct.we believe that it is entirely appropriate that a telecommunications carrier remain responsible for personal injury or property damage which results from its own negligence or willful misconduct.moreover,as staff noted there is no general rule or policy which allows the commission to grant utilities limitations on liability for personal injury and property damage.this is particularly true with respect to utilities conduct toward individuals who are not customers of the utility under tariff.emphasis added.
the commission concluded there is potential that ameritech proposal would shield ameritech from responsibility for actions far beyond what is intended by the commission discretionary approval of limitations of liability in ameritech tariffs.
we agree with the commission.the commission stated it is entirely appropriate that a utility remain responsible for personal injury or property damage that results from its own negligence or willful misconduct,and there is no general rule or policy that allows the commission to grant utilities limitations on liability for personal injury and property damage.although the dispute in teleport involved ameritech relationship with third parties,tcg customers,the commission general statement of the public interest clearly refers also to a utility relationship with its own customers.
these administrative decisions are examples of the commission rejection of the theory of absolute immunity that now proposes.we do likewise.
additionally,if this tariff provision were a private contract,it would not be interpreted as permitting to absolve itself of any duty to its customers.see reeder western gas power,stating that it would be unreasonable and against public policy to approve such a contractual limitation on the duty to inspect in cases where the facts themselves suggest a duty to inspect.although a utility tariff is considered as a statute and not as a contract,we can not interpret the tariff provision that wrote to completely absolve it of any duty in this regard,when we would not so interpret the same provision in a contract that wrote.see bloom township high school,d at.
also,this court has held that the public utilities act is in derogation of the common law accordingly,the act is to be strictly construed in favor of persons sought to be subjected to its operation.barthel illinois central gulf.thus,the statute is to be strictly construed in favor of the utility company.tucker illinois power,d.however,because the utility company drafts a tariff,it is generally accepted that language in a tariff,especially exculpatory language,is to be strictly construed against the utility company and in favor of the customer.see,pink dot,th at,d at krasner new york state electric gas,state farm fire casualty southern bell telephone telegraph.
further,a court can not construe a statute in derogation of the common law beyond what the words of the statute expresses or beyond what is necessarily implied from what is expressed.in construing statutes in derogation of the common law,a court will not presume that an innovation thereon was intended further than the innovation which the statute specifies or clearly implies.russell klein,cedar park cemetery ass cooper,water city of peoria,d,although the public utilities act is in derogation of the common law and is to be strictly construed in favor of those sought to be subjected to its operation,the act will not be extended any further than what the language of the statute absolutely requires by its express terms or by clear implication.illinois courts have limited all manner of statutes in derogation of the common law to their express language,in order to effect the than the in the common law.see,bush squellati,interpreting,ch,par.b bagcraft industrial comm n,d,interpreting ilcs west.
for example,in barthel,the plaintiffs brought a statutory cause of action against the defendant railroad seeking damages for personal injuries and wrongful death.plaintiffs alleged that the railroad violated several regulations pertaining to the safety of railroad crossings.relying on a strict and literal interpretation of the statutory language,the plaintiffs argued that the statute abrogated the common law defense of contributory negligence.as observed in barthel 
they plaintiffs argue that the cause of action,being a creature of the statute,bears no relation to the common law concepts of negligence and contributory negligence,and they conclude that since the statute does not provide that contributory negligence shall be a defense,it imposes strict liability on the utility for any violation.barthel,at.
the barthel court rejected this argument.noting that the act is in derogation of the common law,the court reasoned that tort principles would not be deemed abrogated unless it plainly appears that the intent of the statute is to do so.this court held that the statute did not abrogate the common law defense of contributory negligence,and that this common law defense was available to the railroad.barthel,at.
in this case,applying the exact reasoning as applied in barthel,we must conclude that tariff did not abrogate the common law exception to the rule of a gas company nonliability.just as the statute in barthel did not abrogate a common law defense,tariff does not abrogate the common law exception.this rule of statutory construction can not be used to provide common law doctrines to assist defendants,but withhold common law doctrines that assist plaintiffs.
specifically,courts in other jurisdictions have avoided interpretations of utility tariffs that would abrogate the common law.for example,in national food stores,union electric,the missouri court of appeals found that the defendant electric utility owed a common law duty to plaintiff utility customer.national food stores,at.the court then rejected the utility contention that its filed tariff immunized it from common law liability for damages.the court strictly construed the tariff,and found that the plaintiff allegations fell outside of the tariff ambit.acknowledging the tariff,the court emphasized the crucial point is that the utility can not divorce itself from the consequences of its own failure to use ordinary care to avoid harm to its consumers.national food stores,at.see also satellite system,birch telecom of oklahoma,holding that oklahoma legislature had not expressed intent that doctrine abolished common law fraud claim against utility state farm,at,at holding that utility tariff limitations period did not abrogate general state law hall consolidated edison,misc d,holding that tariff did not relieve defendant utility company from its common law tort liability for termination of electrical service kroger appalachian power,interpreting utility tariff in accord with common law rule,observing that tariff would not shield utility company from all liability in providing power to a customer beyond the delivery point.
as we earlier observed,the tariff provision in this case essentially codifies the common law rule that a gas company has no duty with respect to a consumer gas pipes and fittings,based on the consumer responsibility for his or her equipment,and the company lack of knowledge and control.absent express language that disavows the common law exception based on notice,we can not say that it was eliminated by the tariff provision.see,bush,at,holding that the statutory provision can not,by its silence,be construed to change the applicable common law bagcraft,d at,holding that without specific language directing application of a statutory provision to a scenario governed by the common law,we can not conclude that the legislature intended to abrogate an entire body of case law.we note that our appellate court long ago rejected a gas company invocation of the public utilities act as a defense to its common law duty.see mrdalj public service of northern illinois,holding where gas company had been notified of odor of gas prior to explosion which killed property owner,gas company could not defend on ground that public utilities act prohibited company from shutting off gas to make inspection,since where gas company has knowledge that gas is escaping in a building occupied by consumer it is gas company duty to shut off gas supply until necessary repairs have been made.based on the principles of statutory interpretation,this is precisely the situation for the general assembly and not this court to abrogate common law duty.see bush,at.
we hold that tariff provision did not absolve the company of its common law duty owed to plaintiff.while a gas company is not an insurer for any injury sustained as the result of escaping gas,the company is nonetheless liable for its negligence.see pappas.at.
conclusion 
based on the present record,we have concluded solely that owed a duty to warn in this case.accordingly,there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether breached this duty and,if so,whether this breach proximately caused plaintiff injuries.summary judgment was thus improper.see happel,at.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court,which reversed the circuit court grant of summary judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.
i respectfully dissent.i believe that our analysis should begin and end with the tariff filed by and approved by the illinois commerce commission.as a result,i do not think it necessary to reach the question whether the common law governing the duties of gas companies should be expanded to recognize a duty to warn of the risk that a connector neither owned nor installed by the company may deteriorate from exposure to the odorant that must,by law,be added to the natural gas delivered by to its customers.
the general assembly enacted the public utilities act act in.an act concerning public utilities.laws,approved june,eff.july.then,as now,the policy of the state is expressed in the act 
it is therefore declared to be the policy of the state that public utilities shall continue to be regulated effectively and comprehensively.it is further declared that the goals and objectives of such regulation shall be to ensure 
iv tariff rates for the sale of various public utility services are authorized such that they accurately reflect the cost of delivering those services and allow the utilities to recover the total costs prudently and reasonably incurred.ilcs a iv west.
in return for the protections provided,the act imposes certain duties upon the utilities it regulates 
every public utility shall furnish,provide and maintain such service instrumentalities,equipment and facilities as shall promote the safety,health,comfort and convenience of its patrons,employees and public and as shall be in all respects adequate,efficient,just and reasonable.
all rules and regulations made by a public utility affecting or pertaining to its charges or service to the public shall be just and reasonable.
every public utility shall,upon reasonable notice,furnish to all persons who may apply therefor and be reasonably entitled thereto,suitable facilities and service,without discrimination and without delay.ilcs west.
in addition,regarding the duties of public utilities to providing services and facilities,the act requires that 
every public utility subject to this act shall provide service and facilities which are in all respects adequate,efficient,reliable and environmentally safe and which,consistent with these obligations,constitute the means of meeting the utility service obligations.ilcs west.
this court has long acknowledged that the policy established by legislation for the regulation of public utilities is to provide the public with efficient service at a reasonable rate by compelling an established public utility occupying a given field to provide adequate service and at the same time to protect it from ruinous competition.illinois power light commerce comm n.more recently,this court reiterated the public utilities act citation,under which the commerce commission regulates all public utilities,was enacted to assure the provision of efficient and adequate utility service to the public at a reasonable cost.local illinois commerce comm n.see also bloom township high school illinois commerce comm n,d.
the act requires the utility to file a tariff with the illinois commerce commission.ilcs west.the tariff plays an integral role in allowing the utility to meet the expectations of the general assembly.in re illinois bell switching station litigation.the liability limitations contained in an approved tariff serve the public policies of establishing uniform affordable rates and providing universal service by limiting the utility exposure to liability.thus,although the tariff may be seen as stating the terms of the contract between the utility and its customers,it is more than a mere contract between buyer and seller.there is a third party to the state,which as a matter of public policy has chosen to limit the liability of utilities in return for regulation of their rates.as this court has noted 
the theory underlying decisions upholding the right of regulated utilities to limit their liabilities is that a public utility,being strictly regulated in all operations with considerable curtailment of its rights and privileges,shall likewise be regulated and limited as to its liabilities.in consideration of its being peculiarly the subject of state control,its liability is and should be defined and limited.citation.there is nothing harsh or inequitable in upholding such a limitation of liability when it is thus considered that the rates as fixed by the commission are established with the rule of limitation in mind.reasonable rates are in part dependent upon such a rule.illinois bell switching station,at,quoting waters pacific telephone,cal d,quoting cole pacific telephone telegraph,d.
the tariff limits liability by narrowly defining the duties undertaken by the utility and disclaiming any additional duties.the majority acknowledges our prior case law,which requires that any duty other than those specifically imposed upon the utility by the act itself must be found in the tariff 
illinois courts have long held that a tariff provision such as the one at issue in this case provides the source for,and determines the nature and extent of,a public utility service obligations to its customers.at.at,at,citing meyer illinois bell telephone,d,and sarelas illinois bell telephone,d.
see also illinois bell switching station,at,miller,specially concurring.
as the majority also acknowledges,illinois law on the subject of tariffs has its roots in federal law,specifically,the federal doctrine.at.at,at.although this doctrine is no longer in effect in the federal courts see tempel steel landstar inway,cir noting that the icc termination act,stat,abolished the tariff filing requirement and the doctrine,it is still a useful starting point for any analysis of the legal effect of a utility tariff filed and approved pursuant to state law.
in western union telegraph esteve brothers.cited in at.at,at,the issue was whether the was without assent in fact,bound as matter of law by the provision limiting liability,because it is a part of the lawfully established rate.esteve brothers,at.at.at.the court held that limitation of liability was an inherent part of the rate.the company could no more depart from it than it could depart from the amount charged for the service rendered.esteve brothers,at.at.at.as the majority notes,the federal act at issue in esteve brothers 
introduced a new principle into the legal relations of the telegraph companies with their patrons which dominated and modified the principles previously governing them.before the act the companies had a common law liability from which they might or might not extricate themselves according to views of policy prevailing in the several states.uniformity demanded that the rate represent the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.it could not be varied by agreement still less could it be varied by lack of agreement.the rate became,not as before a matter of contract by which a legal liability could be modified,but a matter of law by which a uniform liability was imposed.esteve brothers,at.at.at.
later,in western union telegraph priester,the court stated that once the interstate commerce commission approved a tariff,the established rates became the lawful rates and the attendant limitation of liability became the lawful condition upon which messages might be sent.priester,at.at.at.what had previously been a matter of common law liability,with such contractual restrictions as the states might permit,then became the subject of federal legislation to secure reasonable and just rates for all without undue preference or advantage to any.since that end is attainable only by adherence to the approved rate that rate represents the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.priester,at.at.at,quoting esteve brothers,at.at.at.in response to plaintiff argument that the company tariff could not limit its liability for gross negligence,the court concluded we may not disregard a lawful exercise of the regulatory power which has made no distinction between degrees of negligence,nor may we,upon any theory of public policy,annex to the rate as made conditions affecting its uniformity and equality.priester,at.at.at.
more recently,the court stated that the rights as defined by the tariff can not be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier.emphasis added.american telephone telegraph central office telephone,d,quoting keogh chicago northwestern ry.the majority quotes this language,but overlooks the significance of the mention of torts as well as contracts.at.at,at.
the general assembly,by enacting the public utilities act and creating the illinois commerce commission with the power to approve tariffs filed by public utilities,has made clear the public policy of the state,which is to hold public utilities to those duties expressly set out in the act and the approved tariffs,and to preclude the judicial recognition of additional duties on the basis of common law reasoning.thus,the majority is correct that whether the tariff bars plaintiff cause of action depends on the nature of plaintiff lawsuit and the meaning of the tariff language.at.at,at.
nature of the lawsuit 
the majority correctly states that all state law causes of action are not necessarily precluded by the existence of a filed and approved tariff.at.at,at,quoting pink dot,teleport communications group,th,d.the nature of a lawsuit may place it outside the scope of the tariff limitation of liability provisions.
thus,although pink dot acknowledged that teleport liability for gross negligence was limited by the applicable tariff,pink dot argued that its claims against teleport for breach of contract,fraud,willful misconduct,intentional interference with economic relations,and unfair competition were not barred.pink dot,th at,d at.this argument was supported by a state statute providing that all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of the law,whether willful or negligent,are against the public policy of the law.pink dot,th at,d at,quoting cal.further,the teleport tariff was silent as to the required liability for any willful misconduct,fraud,or violations of law,although it did contain clauses intended to limit its liability to its customers for damages caused by its conduct.pink dot,th at,d at.in the end,pink dot stands for the unremarkable proposition that when a state statute expressly precludes such a limit,a tariff limit on liability can not eliminate the utility liability for willful misconduct,fraud or violations of law by merely omitting the acknowledgment of such liability from its tariff.pink dot,th at,d at.
in adamson worldcom communications,quoted in at.at,at,plaintiff claim for unfair trade practices was not barred where the tariff limited the defendant liability unless such damages are a result of company willful misconduct.adamson.at,at.
the tariff at issue in the present case expressly states that assumes no responsibility in connection with the installation,maintenance or operation of the customer equipment.plaintiff has not cited either a state statute as in pink dot or language of the tariff as in adamson that precludes the limitation of liability claimed by.nor has she brought a claim for fraud,negligent driving of a vehicle owned by the utility,or other tortious conduct of the sort that would place it outside the scope of the limitation of liability clause of the tariff.thus,the duty claimed by plaintiff must be found to exist on the basis of the language of the tariff,or not at all.
construction of the tariff 
the act is in derogation of the common law.illinois bell switching station,at.the majority acknowledges that,as a result,the act it is to be strictly construed in favor of persons sought to be subjected to its operation,that is,in favor of the utility.at.at,at.as the majority also notes,once the tariff is approved by the commission,it has the force of law.at.at,at citing illinois bell switching station,at,and illinois central gulf sankey brothers,d,stating that a tariff is a law,not a contract,and has the force and effect of a statute,affirmed.further,the majority states that interpretation of the tariff is governed by the rules of statutory construction.at.at,at.
nevertheless,the majority,citing cases from california,new york,and georgia,states that the language of the tariff,especially any exculpatory language,should be strictly construed against the utility,based on the canon of construction of contracts that contract terms should be construed against the drafter.at.at,at.although it may be generally accepted at.at,at in some jurisdictions that a tariff should be construed as a mere contract,there is also contrary authority.the courts of washington and oregon,for example,apply the standard principles of statutory construction to the interpretation of a tariff,including applying the rule of construction that the court is to ascertain the drafters intent when they promulgated the language.see,national union insurance puget sound power light,west communications,city of longmont.
even in a jurisdiction in which the construe against the drafter canon is applied to public utility tariffs,it has been said that a strict construction against a tariff author is not justified where the construction would ignore a permissible and reasonable construction which conforms to the intentions of the framers of the tariff.info tel communications,llc west communications.
this court has never held that a public utility tariff should be construed against the utility that drafted the language.there are valid arguments to be made on both sides because the tariff has characteristics of both contract and statute.this court may in some future case be called upon to decide whether ambiguous language in a tariff should be construed in favor of or against the drafting utility.this is not such a case.the language at issue is unambiguous.assumes no responsibility in connection with the installation,maintenance or operation of the customer equipment.our duty is to apply the plain meaning of these words,in light of the underlying purpose of the act,which is to provide citizens of illinois with utility service at reasonable rates and,as a necessary part of that scheme,to limit the liability of utility companies.
the majority also suggests that the tariff provision should not be given effect because,if it were a private contract,it would not be interpreted as permitting to absolve itself of any duty to its customers.at.at,at.this statement misses the point in several respects.first,it defies logic to say that a tariff should be enforced under the same rules as a private contract.the entire concept of a tariff is that it supercedes any contract between the utility and the individual customer.indeed,the utility is forbidden from privately contracting around the terms of the tariff.second,the act and the tariff do not permit the utility to absolve itself of any duty.they permit,indeed they require,that the utility undertake precisely defined duties to its customers.finally,unlike a private company,a public utility can not adjust its prices to compensate for increased exposure to liability when the courts recognize a new common law duty.
for example,in sarelas the plaintiff claimed that illinois bell telephone owed him a duty of continuing service,which it violated by interrupting his service for hours as the result of a clerical error.the appellate court noted that in the case of an ordinary corporation this would be nothing of which to complain,for in general a corporation is entitled to refrain from doing business with its customers unless it is otherwise bound by contract but a utility is different.it has a duty to its subscribers that goes beyond that of an ordinary corporation.however,this duty has but one source,the tariff,which in this instance is on file with the illinois commerce commission.emphasis added.sarelas,d at.thus,the court observed,the extent to which defendants owed plaintiff a legal duty is determined by the particular provisions of the tariff on file with the commission there is no contract on which plaintiff can rely,nor are his allegations of a breach of duty sufficient to constitute a claim in tort.sarelas,d at.in the end,a breach of duty by the utility arises either from the tariff or not at all.sarelas,d at.
following the mandate to construe the act strictly in favor of the regulated utility,the court in barthel illinois central gulf,held that section of the act,which allows the utility to be held liable for certain acts and omissions,did not abrogate the common law defense of contributory negligence because it did not plainly appear that the intent of the statute was to impose strict liability.barthel,at.see also tucker illinois power,d,construing act as not authorizing award of punitive damages in action for negligent termination of gas service in below freezing weather when plaintiff would not have been entitled to punitive damages under common law theory of liability.
the majority purports to apply the exact reasoning of barthel at.at,at,when it concludes that just as the statute in barthel did not abrogate a common law defense,the tariff at issue here does not abrogate the common law exception.at.at,at.plaintiff,however,does not seek to hold liable under an existing exception to the common law rule that gas companies have no duty with regard to the fixtures and equipment of their customers.she seeks to expand the existing exception to recognize an entirely new duty to warn.
the majority observes that has had opportunities in the past to assert that the tariff precludes imposition of a duty,yet has not done so.at.at,at.this observation is not persuasive for two reasons.first,simple logic dictates that a party decision to raise a particular issue or assert a particular defense in one litigation has no preclusive effect in later litigation with an entirely different party.second,the cases cited by the majority are inapposite.in pioneer corn of illinois northern illinois gas,the plaintiff theory of liability was that negligently performed an inspection.there was no leak or defect in the plaintiff equipment.rather,employees purportedly inspected plaintiff equipment for the specific purpose of determining the proper pressure for the delivery of gas to the plaintiff premises.pioneer,at.previously,in clare,this court had noted that a gas company has no duty to inspect the pipes or fixtures belonging to a customer in the absence of notice of a defect.clare,at.indeed,the gas company has no right to go upon the premises of one of its customers for the purpose of inspecting his pipes or other fixtures except upon the invitation,license or permission of the owner.clare,at.in pioneer,as in clare,a gas company employee was invited to enter the plaintiff premises for the purpose of making an inspection.the inspections served different purposes in clare,to determine the source of an offensive odor in pioneer,to calculate the proper pressure for the delivery of gas.in clare,the gas company was not liable for the eventual damages and injuries because the evidence showed that the inspection,which was not negligently or unskillfully made,did not reveal the source of the leak.clare,at.in pioneer,the gas company might have been held liable for negligently conducting an inspection had the plaintiff proven that an inspection actually took place.pioneer,at.this court agreed with that the trial court properly refused to give the requested instruction on negligent inspection to the jury,because the tendered instruction assumed a fact in there had actually been an inspection.pioneer,at.the majority statement that n either this court nor believed that this tariff precluded a common law analysis in a negligence action for personal injury in pioneer at.at,at,although true,is irrelevant.the common law duty asserted in pioneer had already been recognized in clare.
the majority also points to this court decision in metz central illinois electric gas,as further support for its statement that where a utility tariff speaks to a specific duty,the tariff may be controlling however,where the tariff does not address a particular situation,the common law applies and a common law duty analysis must be applied.emphasis added.at.at,at.when a tariff speaks to a specific duty,as in this ca
