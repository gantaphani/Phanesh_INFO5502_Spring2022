in these consolidated appeals,jack grynberg appeals the district court dismissal of a large number of coordinated qui tam cases relator had brought against numerous natural gas pipelines and other companies involved in measuring natural gas produced from federal or indian lands the district court dismissed the cases for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under e,holding that relator complaints were based upon publicly disclosed allegations and that relator was not an original source of the information upon which the allegations in his complaints were based.we affirm.
background 
beginning in june of,relator filed a series of lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act against a large number of natural gas pipeline companies and their various parents,subsidiaries,and affiliates,accusing them of underpaying royalties to the government in violation of a.each complaint accused the defendants named therein of utilizing several identified mismeasurement techniques to knowingly underreport or cause others to underreport the heating content and volume of gas,with a resultant underpayment of federal royalties.most of the alleged mismeasurement techniques were common to all cases.
the cases were transferred as multidistrict litigation to the district of wyoming,where defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.under the direction of a special master,the parties conducted limited discovery on this issue.because the special master and district court considered evidentiary materials and because the jurisdictional question was intertwined with the merits,the special master and district court properly treated defendants motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.see united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir.
in his report and recommendations,the special master concluded that forty of the cases should be dismissed under e because the allegations in these cases had been publicly disclosed and relator was not an original source of the information upon which the allegations were based.the special master concluded that the remaining cases were not jurisdictionally barred because none of the defendants in these cases were identified in any public disclosure alleging mismeasurement of natural gas.the district court adopted in part and modified in part the special master report,holding that all of the cases were barred under e because the publicly disclosed allegations of widespread mismeasurement were sufficient to set the government on the trail of the fraud as to all defendants and relator did not fit within the original source exception to the public disclosure bar.the court therefore entered judgment in favor of defendants in each of the seventy three cases 
on appeal,relator challenges the district court conclusions that the public disclosure bar was triggered as to all defendants and that relator was not an original source of the information upon which the allegations were based.we review these issues of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,employing the same legal standard as the district court.see united states ex rel.grynberg praxair,cir.
discussion 
the false claims act imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government.a.the fca qui tam provisions allow a private individual,known as a relator,to bring a civil action on behalf of the government against such persons and to share in any resulting government recovery.see kennard comstock,cir citing b and d.the purpose of the fca is to enhance the government ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the government.praxair,at quoting,at,reprinted in.to further that purpose,congress has sought through the qui tam provisions to achieve the golden mean between adequate incentives for insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own.united states ex rel.fine sandia,cir quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.accordingly,a relator action will be jurisdictionally barred if it is based on allegations or transactions already in the public domain unless the relator can show that he is an original source of the information on which the allegations are based.e a.if jurisdiction is challenged,the burden is on the party claiming jurisdiction to show it by a preponderance of the evidence.hafter,at.
to determine whether the fca public disclosure bar has been triggered,we consider whether the alleged public disclosure contains allegations or transactions from one of the listed sources whether the alleged disclosure has been made public within the meaning of the fca and whether the relator complaint is based upon this public disclosure.united states ex rel.holmes consumer ins.group,cir.if each of these three questions is answered in the affirmative,the public disclosure bar is triggered and the relator must demonstrate original source status in order to proceed with his qui tam action.united states ex rel.fine advanced,cir.
public disclosure 
the district court concluded that the public disclosure bar had been triggered as to all defendants based upon two main sets of documents several documents related to an investigation conducted in the by the united states senate select committee on indian affairs and court documents from and newspaper reports describing a qui tam action relator had filed in against natural gas pipeline companies in the district of columbia,which the court dismissed in march for failure to plead fraud with specificity and improper joinder of parties.the senate committee documents disclosed the mismeasurement of oil and gas on a large scale but did not identify any specific companies that engaged gas mismeasurement,while the defendants named in the qui tam action overlapped with defendants or affiliates of defendants in approximately half of the complaints.rejecting the special master conclusion that the public disclosure bar was only triggered by public disclosures that specifically named defendants or affiliates of defendants,the district court concluded that the senate committee documents and the action had triggered the public disclosure bar as to all defendants because these documents alerted the government to the nature of the fraud and enabled the government to readily identify wrongdoers through an investigation of the companies measuring gas produced from federal or indian lands.
on appeal,relator does not dispute that the action and senate committee documents were publicly disclosed and were from sources listed in e a rather,he disputes the applicability of the third prong of the public disclosure test to his complaints.this prong of the analysis asks whether the qui tam complaint was based upon,meaning supported by,the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.see united states ex rel.fine,cir.the test is whether substantial identity exists between the publicly disclosed allegations and the qui tam complaint.id.relator argues that this prong was not satisfied as to at least some defendants and some mismeasurement techniques because these defendants and techniques were not identified in any public disclosed allegation.
as an initial matter,we address relator argument that each alleged mismeasurement technique was a separate and unique claim of fraud that should not be barred unless specifically alleged in a public disclosure.relator correctly points out that we use a analysis to determine whether the allegations in a complaint were publicly disclosed.see,id.at see also united states ex rel.boothe sun healthcare group,cir holding that courts must analyze the jurisdictional status of each reasonably discrete claim of fraud in a qui tam action.after reviewing the qui tam complaints at issue here,however,we agree with the district court that the alleged mismeasurement techniques are not separate claims of fraud but are rather interrelated parts of the alleged fraud of deliberately mismeasuring natural gas volume and misanalyzing gas heating content in order to underpay royalties to the united states.we conclude that the district court correctly considered whether there was substantial identity between the complaints and the publicly disclosed documents based on the overall fraudulent mismeasurement scheme rather than each mismeasurement technique allegedly employed in the scheme.we further agree with the district court that the fraudulent scheme alleged in the complaints shares substantial identity with the allegations publicly disclosed in the senate committee documents and lawsuit.see,at holding that inclusion of additional details in qui tam complaint does not prevent application of public disclosure bar see also praxair,at holding that qui tam actions only partially based upon publicly disclosed allegations or transactions may still be barred.
the next question we must address is whether the public disclosures of natural gas mismeasurement by other industry members and in the industry as a whole were sufficient to trigger the public disclosure bar as to defendants not named in these disclosures.a handful of relevant cases provide us with guidance on this issue.
the first circuit to squarely address this issue was the eleventh circuit in cooper blue cross blue shield of florida,cir.in cooper,a relator sued blue cross blue shield of florida for incorrectly instructing him that medicare and not bcbsf should pay on his claims first,thus causing medicare to make payments that should have been covered by bcbsf as his primary insurer.the eleventh circuit rejected the district court conclusion that the relator allegations had been publicly disclosed in several sources,including a general accounting office report describing widespread medicare secondary payer fraud throughout the insurance industry,newspaper accounts publicizing similar wrongful practices committed by other insurance companies,and a prior qui tam action against blue cross blue shield of georgia alleging the same type of conduct.stating that it was crucial whether the defendant was mentioned by name or otherwise specifically identified in public disclosures,the eleventh circuit held that r equiring that allegations specific to a particular defendant be publically disclosed before finding the action potentially barred implemented the goals of the statute by encourag ing private citizen involvement and increas ing the chances that every instance of specific fraud will be revealed.id.at.
we distinguished cooper in united states ex rel.fine sandia,cir.in sandia,the relator sued sandia corporation under the fca for misappropriating nuclear waste funds.a prior general accounting office report and a congressional hearing had disclosed that contractors operating at two of the department of energy nine laboratories were engaging in this practice.although sandia was not named in these public disclosures,we held that the public disclosure bar had been triggered as to sandia because the report and hearing set the government squarely on the trail of the alleged fraud without the relator assistance.id.at.because these disclosures detailed the mechanics of the practice,revealed that at least two of sandia eight sister laboratories were engaged in it,and indicated the doe acquiescence,we concluded that they sufficiently alerted the government to the likelihood that sandia would also engage in the practice.id.at.we held that cooper was distinguishable because,w hen attempting to identify individual actors,little similarity exists between combing through the private insurance industry in search of fraud and examining the operating procedures of nine,easily identifiable,and laboratories.id.at.in light of congress twin goals of rejecting suits which the government is capable of pursuing itself,while promoting those which the government is not equipped to bring on its own,we concluded that it would be contrary to the purposes of the fca to exercise jurisdiction over the relator claim in this case.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
other circuits have followed the sandia reasoning and similarly distinguished cooper where the public disclosures at issue are sufficient to set the government squarely upon the trail of the alleged fraud.for instance,in united states alcan electrical and engineering,cir,the ninth circuit held that a qui tam action making identical allegations to a prior lawsuit was barred by the public disclosure bar because,although only one of the defendants had been named in the prior lawsuit,the qui tam defendants were all part of a narrow class of suspected electrical contractors who worked on federally funded projects over a period and filed weekly payrolls with the government during this period.the ninth circuit held that the instant case is similar to sandia,in that the government,as regulator and owner,presumably would have ready access to documents identifying those contractors.this ready access makes it highly likely that the government could easily identify the contractors at issue.id.
likewise,in united states ex rel.findley employees club,the circuit held that publicly disclosed allegations that federal employees clubs inappropriately retained revenue from vending services on federal property triggered the public disclosure bar as to the relator qui tam action against employees clubs of the bureau of prisons.noting that the public disclosures at issue disclosed that the practice occurred throughout the federal government,identified the nature of the fraud,and identified the types of actors engaged in the allegedly fraudulent activity,the court concluded that the relator allegations substantially repeat what the public already knows and add only the identity of particular employees clubs engaged in the questionable and previously documented generic practice.id.at.the court rejected the relator argument that the public disclosures at issue were similar to a generic disclosure of fraud by defense contractors,stating that l ittle similarity exists between combing through the myriad of transactions performed by the various defense contractors in search of fraud and finding easily identifiable federal employee organizations that provide vending services on federal property.id.
applying the reasoning from these cases to the facts before us,we hold that the senate committee documents and qui tam action publicly disclosed the allegations against all defendants named in relator complaints.we note that,as in sandia,the public disclosures at issue named a significant percentage of industry participants as wrongdoers and indicated that others in the industry were very likely engaged in the same practices the action alleged mismeasurement by natural gas pipeline companies in general and did not suggest that the alleged practices were limited to the named defendants.indeed,the complaint indicated that further investigation might lead to knowledge of more mismeasurement techniques and participation in this type of activity by other companies.newspaper reports regarding this action also disclosed the industrywide nature of this action broad allegations.
as in findley,alcan,and sandia,the public disclosures provided specific details about the fraudulent scheme and the types of actors involved in it,removing this from a situation where the government would need to comb through myriad transactions performed by various types of entities in search of potential fraud.a general allegation of medicare even more a specific allegation of medicare fraud through the practice of incorrectly informing patients or healthcare providers that claims should be submitted first to medicare and not the primary not help the government know where to focus in an investigation of the countless individual medicare claims submitted to the government by vast numbers of health care providers and individuals.by contrast,the specific allegation that measurers of natural gas on federal and tribal lands engage in identified techniques to mismeasure gas obtained from federal or tribal properties allows the government to target its investigation toward specific actors and a spe
