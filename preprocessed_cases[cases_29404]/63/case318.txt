gallo winery gallo alleged that encana,a natural gas supplier,and wd energy services,a marketing subsidiary of encana collectively encana,along with multiple unnamed coconspirators,inflated the price gallo paid for natural gas through their violations of state and federal antitrust laws.encana sought summary judgment on the ground that the filed rate doctrine and federal preemption bar gallo claims as a matter of law.the district court denied encana summary judgment motion.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,and we now affirm the district court.
gallo claims and procedural history 
gallo is a wine producer and distributor headquartered in california that purchased natural gas for use in its wineries and glass plant.during the period between june,and december,gallo purchased its gas at the california border market known as pg e citygate from encana,an energy trader during this period,the purchase and sale contract between gallo and encana did not specify how the parties would calculate the price of the natural gas.however,both parties concede that,as a matter of practice,the purchase price was pegged to indices published in two trade publications,natural gas intelligence ngi and gas daily.
beginning in the summer of,both natural gas and electricity prices at the california border markets were subject to widespread manipulation by energy traders that dramatically raised the price of natural gas.see final report on price manipulation in western markets final report,federal energy regulatory commission.one of the key elements of the market misconduct was the manipulation of prices reported to private indices published by natural gas trade publications.these indices,including ngi and gas daily,reported the sales price for wholesale transactions at market rates.as explained by the district court 
the indices published in the ngi or the gas daily index are closely linked to rates,but are not rates themselves.the published index represents a compilation of submitted and verified information gathered from voluntary submissions of trading activity and is published as a price representing trading activity at each location.
gallo winery encana,no,wl at,memorandum order and opinion denying defendant motion for summary judgement.
buyers and sellers relied on these indices to determine the market price for natural gas transactions.see final report,at.however,there was neither a formal process for reporting pricing data to the publishers of the indices,nor any oversight by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,which has jurisdiction over certain natural gas wholesale transactions.see gallo winery,wl,at.the process by which the prices in natural gas transactions were reported to the publishers of indices was left largely to the traders themselves.after investigating the operation of the indices,ferc explained that 
m ost of the largest natural gas marketing companies in the country had no formal process for reporting trade data to the publishers of the price indices the process was left to the trading desks and the traders themselves.traders from all companies describe a typical trading day as hectic,pressure packed,and frenetic.one of their many tasks was to report trading data to the trade press this was viewed as bothersome but necessary.often it was a job given to the newest employee.many companies report passing around a form or using a spreadsheet on a shared drive.the last person who filled out the form or spreadsheet may have been required to total the numbers and send them to the trade press.there was nothing to stop a trader from changing the numbers someone else had entered.in other cases,traders took an oral survey to get a sense of where the market was trading.sometimes they represented it to the trade press as an actual survey,but in other cases they made up trades to average out to a number that was consistent with this survey.
final report,at.thus,despite their wide use as reference points in pricing natural gas sales and derivatives,including most of the transactions subject to ferc jurisdictional authority,the information used to calculate the indices was reported in a less than meticulous manner.not only were the indices ripe for manipulation,but also ferc investigation confirmed that such abuse actually occurred.market participants had provided false reports of natural gas prices and trade volumes,and had engaged in other misconduct.id.at.
as a purchaser in the wholesale market,gallo alleges it was affected by the widespread price manipulation identified by ferc in such markets.specifically,gallo claims that encana and its competitors engaged in a number of illegal practices designed to manipulate the indices,including agreeing to set the basis price of natural gas at an inflated rate,misreporting natural gas prices paid to the indices,and engaging in wash trades.because gallo paid encana for natural gas at rates pegged to the indices,gallo claims it was injured by the illegal practices that artificially inflated the indices.gallo seeks to recover as damages the amount it was overcharged due to the allegedly illegal conduct.gallo states it can establish its damages by determining a hypothetical fair index price and then subtracting that price from the actual price gallo paid for natural gas.
on april,gallo filed a complaint against encana,consisting of federal and state antitrust actions and state law damage claims arising under various statutes the sherman act,california cartwright act,cal.bus.code et,california unfair competition law,cal.bus.code et,california uniform fraudulent transfer act,cal.civ.code et,and under a theory of unjust enrichment.gallo sought treble damages,disgorgement or restitution,and injunctive relief,as well as a constructive trust for fraudulently transferred assets.
on february,encana moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that,among other things,the filed rate doctrine barred all of gallo federal claims and that federal preemption barred gallo state law claims.the district court denied the motion because it determined that its status as a retail purchaser for be able to prove its damages in a way that would not impinge on ferc authority over wholesale rates.after gallo filed an amended complaint,encana filed a second motion to dismiss,which was also denied.then,on july,encana moved for summary judgment,contending that gallo damage claims are barred because they require a court to determine a hypothetical fair rate in the wholesale natural gas market,a determination barred by the filed rate doctrine and associated principles of federal preemption.the district court denied this motion,holding that gallo could prove its damages without requiring the court to examine the fairness of a rate or tariff that has been filed by ferc.gallo winery,wl,at.however,the district court certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b because the applicability of the filed rate doctrine is a controlling question of law in this case,and it stayed the mandate pending this court decision on this issue.on october,encana filed a timely petition for interlocutory review,which we granted on december.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of summary judgment.see lee gregory,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.therefore,this court must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.suzuki motor consumers union of,cir,cert.denied,d.we also review de novo the district court analysis of preemption and the filed rate doctrine.see cal.ex rel.lockyer dynegy,cir.
gallo damage claims are based on the theory that the rates it paid encana were unfairly high because they were pegged to indices that were artificially inflated due to illegal practices.encana argues that gallo is challenging rates that were authorized by ferc,and thus gallo claims are barred by two legal principles the filed rate doctrine and associated principles of federal preemption.we start by explaining these legal principles,which are central to our analysis.
the filed rate doctrine 
the filed rate doctrine and associated principles of federal preemption bar challenges under state law and federal antitrust laws to rates set by federal agencies.see transmission agency of cal.sierra pac.power,cir s tate law,and some federal law antitrust law,may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.the doctrine is a judicial creation that arises from decisions interpreting federal statutes that give federal agencies exclusive jurisdiction to set rates for specified utilities,originally through procedures involving the filing of rates with the agencies.the filed rate doctrine was first applied to rates filed with the interstate commerce commission under the interstate commerce act,see keogh chicago nw.ry,and was subsequently extended to the natural gas act,ch,stat.codified as amended at nga,see.gas hall arkla,d,the federal power act,see nantahala power and light thornburg,d,and the communications act,see at t cent.office,d,among others.
in its first delineation of the filed rate doctrine,the supreme court held in keogh that a plaintiff could not recover for damages caused by paying transportation rates that had been allegedly set in violation of the sherman act,because the rates had been filed with and approved by the interstate commerce commission icc.keogh.the sherman act permits any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws to recover threefold the damages by him sustained,and the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.a.the court held that a plaintiff could not be injured in his business or property for purposes of the sherman act by paying rates that had been approved by the icc and were thus the legal rates.keogh,at.quoting a.the court noted that i njury implies violation of a legal right,and that a lawful rate could not cause such a violation.
when the court revisited keogh years later,it reaffirmed that keogh interpretation of injury under section of the sherman act precluded an award based on lawful rates approved by the icc.see square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,d.the court noted that keogh represents a longstanding statutory construction that congress has consistently refused to disturb,even when revisiting this specific area of law.id.at.
the logic underlying the court statutory construction in keogh is equally applicable to the nga,which provides the framework for federal regulation of the natural gas industry.arkla,at.see also fed.power comm hope natural gas.section of the nga provides that rates in natural gas transactions subject to the nga scope shall be just and reasonable.a.section also provides that natural gas companies must file their rates for transportation or sale with the federal power commission now ferc and allows ferc to hold hearings to determine the lawfulness of the rates.e.in finding a rate just and reasonable,ferc conclusively determines that the rate is lawful for transactions subject to its jurisdiction under the nga.as a result,n o court may substitute its own judgment on reasonableness for the judgment of ferc.the authority to decide whether the rates are reasonable is vested by section of the nga solely in ferc,and the right to a reasonable rate is the right to the rate which ferc files or fixes.arkla,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
consistent with the logic of the filed rate doctrine,the supreme court determined that the supremacy clause precludes a state court from awarding damages that,in effect,give the plaintiff a rate different from the rate filed with and approved by a federal agency.see id.at.in the leading case of arkla,a purchase contract between arkla and certain gas producers included a favored nations clause providing that if arkla paid more for gas from some other seller,arkla would also pay the producers that higher price.id.at.the contract rates were filed with and approved by ferc or its predecessor agency.id.at.after arkla allegedly began paying higher rates to another provider of natural gas,the gas producers brought an action against arkla claiming a breach of the favored nations clause.id.the state supreme court awarded the producers damages.id.at.
the supreme court reversed this judgment,holding that the nga barred the producers from collecting a rate other than the one filed with ferc.id.at.ferc determination of the lawful rate preempted any conflicting state determination,and thus the supremacy clause precluded a state court from using a action to grant producers a rate higher than ferc allowed.id.at.by awarding damages,the state supreme court had usurped a function that congress has assigned to a federal regulatory body,which the supremacy clause will not permit.id.at.put succinctly,w hen the filed rate doctrine applies to state regulators,it does so as a matter of federal through the supremacy clause.entergy.pub.serv.comm n,d.
from the foregoing review of the filed rate doctrine and associated principles of federal preemption,we can derive the following principle to the extent congress has given ferc authority to set rates under the nga and ferc has exercised that authority,such rates are just and reasonable as a matter of law and can not be collaterally challenged under federal antitrust law or state law.for convenience,we will refer to such just and reasonable rates as rates.we will refer to the statutory interpretation of the sherman antitrust act that bars federal antitrust challenges to rates and the preemption analysis set forth in arkla that bars state law challenges collectively as the filed rate doctrine.
rates and the indices 
the underlying issue in this appeal is whether gallo is challenging rates.if so,gallo claims would be barred by the filed rate doctrine and encana would be entitled to summary judgment.
this issue requires the analysis of several factors.first,because ferc no longer authorizes rates through a formal mechanism,we must determine whether rates can be rates.this determination requires consideration of the significant changes in the natural gas regulatory regime from the time the supreme court decided keogh and arkla to the present.
second,gallo paid encana retail rates pegged to indices that reflected the wholesale market in natural gas.we must consider whether the filed rate doctrine can bar damage claims based on an index that represents wholesale rates,but that is not a rate itself.we must also consider whether gallo damage claims can be barred by the filed rate doctrine when gallo purchases were retail purchases,which are outside of ferc jurisdiction.
in analyzing these issues,we must be mindful that under the summary judgment standard,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to gallo,the party.
transition from filed rates to rates.as explained above,courts originally developed the filed rate doctrine in light of ferc exclusive jurisdiction to set rates through a rate filing procedure.see arkla,at.we briefly review the changes in ferc natural gas jurisdiction and procedure to provide the context for determining whether rates can be rates.
congress originally gave ferc jurisdiction over certain segments of the natural gas market to address concerns about monopolization in the natural gas market.before congress enacted the nga,the natural gas market consisted of three segments producers,interstate pipelines,and local distribution companies.producers drilled for the natural gas at the wellhead and then sold the gas to interstate pipelines.interstate pipelines then transported the gas to various locations throughout the country where it was purchased by local distribution companies,who,in turn,sold the natural gas to consumers.as a result of their control over the transportation of natural gas,interstate pipelines developed monopoly power over both purchases of natural gas at the wellhead and sales to local distribution companies.general motors tracy,d.
in order to curb the market power of interstate pipelines,congress passed the nga.by its terms,the nga is applicable to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce its sale in interstate commerce for resale,wholesale sales and natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale.panhandle pipe line pub.serv.comm of.footnote added.the nga is expressly inapplicable to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.b the supreme court confirmed that this statutory language excluded retail sales.see panhandle pipe line,at.the line of the statute is thus clear and complete.it cut s sharply and cleanly between sales for resale and direct sales for consumptive uses.however,the language included sales by gas producers at the wellhead.see phillips petrol.wisconsin.interpreting the nga definition of natural gas companies to include independent gas producers at the wellhead.as a result,during this period ferc jurisdiction reached sales by producers at the wellhead and sales by interstate pipelines,but not sales by local distribution companies to consumers,retail sales.see gallo winery,wl,at.ferc exercised its jurisdiction through the statutory mechanism previously discussed.
as a result of an overburdened federal regulatory system and low price ceilings on wellhead sales imposed by ferc,there were acute shortages of natural gas during the.to ameliorate the shortages,congress began the process of deregulating much of the natural gas industry,beginning in with the passage of the natural gas policy act ngpa,stat.codified as amended at.the ngpa eliminated the low price ceilings on wellhead sales,replacing them with maximum price ceilings for wellhead sales of natural gas that would encourage natural gas production.id.
in,congress passed the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of wda,stat,which completely eliminated ferc authority to set prices at the wellhead by removing first sales from ferc jurisdiction despite the complexity of the statutory definition of first sales first sales are,in essence,merely sales of natural gas that are not preceded by a sale to an interstate pipeline,intrastate pipeline,local distribution company,or retail customer.in other words,sales by pipelines,local distribution companies,and their affiliates can not be first sales unless these entities are selling gas of their own production.b.additionally,to give effect to the north american free trade agreement,on october,congress amended the nga to provide that all sales of canadian and mexican natural gas are also first sales.energy policy act of,stat.codified at b.congress decision to remove ferc authority to set prices for first sales left the determination of natural gas prices at the wellhead to market forces.see regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol.
although the wda elimination of low price ceilings encouraged a more competitive market at the wellhead,pipeline companies continued to bundle their transportation service with their own natural gas sales and require customers to purchase both.because consumers lacked the means of transporting the gas to their facilities,consumers could not benefit from the more competitive market at the wellhead.see gallo winery,wl,at.
to further the deregulation process started by congress,ferc began its own process of deregulating the natural gas market by giving consumers more access to wellhead markets and by moving toward rates.in ferc promulgated order,which required all interstate pipelines to unbundle their transportation from their own natural gas sales and to provide common carriage services to buyers from other sources that wished to ship gas in their pipelines.general motors,at.see also pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation and regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol.april.as a result of order which limited the monopoly power of the pipelines,consumers could purchase natural gas at the wellhead in an unregulated first sale and then arrange to transport the natural gas via the interstate pipelines,paying separately for the product natural gas and the service transportation.in addition,ferc issued blanket sale certificates to interstate pipelines that allowed them to sell unbundled natural gas at rates rather than at rates filed with ferc.at.
following order,ferc continued the deregulation of rates for the transactions that remained subject to its jurisdiction.after determining that no seller of natural gas could obtain market power and that rates would be just and reasonable,see id.at see also regulations governing blanket marketer sales certificates,ferc issued blanket certificates for sales for resale of natural gas to all persons except interstate pipelines this resulted in the suspension of ferc requirements for such sales.at.these blanket certificates allowed all companies subject to ferc jurisdiction to charge rates for gas determined by market demand and freed the blanket certificate holders from other regulation under the natural gas act jurisdiction of ferc.a.however,ferc advised the regulated natural gas industry that it would continue to monitor the operation of the market through the complaint process.at.this ongoing monitoring resulted in ferc exercising its oversight authority in,when it revoked enron blanket market certificate.see enron power.in further exercise of its oversight authority,ferc subsequently amended its blanket market certificates to explicitly prohibit anticompetitive behavior and other market abuses,based on ferc determination that price manipulation had occurred in prior years.amendments to blanket sales certificates.
in sum,the actions of congress and ferc have effected a substantial deregulation of the natural gas market from the to the present.since the,congress has limited ferc jurisdiction over wholesale sales to those wholesale sales not including sales of canadian and mexican natural gas that are preceded by a sale to an interstate pipeline,intrastate pipeline,local distribution company,or retail customer.see.at.a market in which retail consumers such as gallo can participate has replaced the original wholesale market interstate pipelines under ferc jurisdiction buying natural gas from producers and selling it at filed rates to local distribution companies.finally,ferc replaced filed rates with rates.
ferc authorization of market rates.within this historical context,we turn to the question whether ferc authorization of market rates for certain wholesale natural gas transactions bars damage actions based on those rates to the same extent as ferc authorization of filed rates barred claims based on those rates.gallo contends that only rates that have been literally filed with and approved by ferc pursuant to c can bar damage claims by plaintiffs.we disagree.
as we previously noted,the filed rate doctrine is based on the principle that rates authorized by ferc are just and reasonable as a matter of law and accordingly can not be the basis of a damage action.we have held that this principle can apply to rates.see pub.util.dist.of grays harbor county idacorp grays harbor,cir w hile rates may not have historically been the type of rate envisioned by the filed rate doctrine,we conclude that they do not fall outside of the purview of the doctrine.pud of snohomish county dynegy power mktg,snohomish,cir this court has rejected snohomish argument that the doctrines at issue do not apply when rates are involved.although historically ferc set rates through the statutory filed rate mechanism,the nga does not require ferc to use any particular form of regulation in its quest to ensure reasonable rates.rather,it has wide latitude to determine the most effective way to carry out its charge from congress.see mobil oil exploration and producing se.united distribution,d the court has repeatedly held that the just and reasonable standard does not compel ferc to use any single pricing formula.gallo does not contend that ferc decision to issue blanket market certificates exceeded ferc authority under the nga.nor could gallo raise such an argument in this action,because the nga requires that such challenges be first brought before ferc.see,cal.ex rel.lockyer,at 
moreover,although the supreme court initially applied the filed rate doctrine to actual filed rates,courts have held that the principles underlying this doctrine preclude challenges to a wide range of ferc actions,not just the act of literal rate filing.as the district court pointed out,the principle of barring challenges to ferc decisions extends to such regulatory determinations as allocation of costs,penalties for violations of the tariff provisions,and market protocols governing sales through state regulatory structures,gallo winery,wl,at internal citations omitted,as well as the services,classifications,charges,and practices included in the rate filing.id.by the same token,the filed rate doctrine would extend to ferc decision to approve rates.
we have indicated in the electricity arena that so long as ferc continues to engage in regulatory activity and has not effectively abdicated its authority,ferc approval of rates under the fpa would have the same preclusive effect on antitrust claims and state damage actions as did ferc approval of literally filed rates.see grays harbor,snohomish,at.in grays harbor,a public utility district argued that its action against an energy wholesaler was not barred by the filed rate doctrine because the doctrine did not apply in the deregulated market where prices are negotiated between parties and the rates are not filed and approved in advance by ferc.at.using the principles underlying the filed rate doctrine,we rejected this argument on several grounds.
first,we held that the state law contract claims were barred by principles of field preemption because the plaintiff requested relief seems to require the district court,at some point,to determine the fair price of the electricity that was delivered under the contract.id.at.we concluded that the requested relief intrudes on an identifiable portion of a field that the federal government has occupied and addresses a matter that the federal government regulates.id.we also held that conflict preemption barred state law claims grays harbor damage action created an actual conflict between federal and state law because by asking the court to set a fair price,grays harbor is invoking a state rule specifically,contract law that would interfere with the method by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goals specifically,ferc regulation of wholesale electricity rates.id.at.we next held that the federal antitrust claims would also be barred by the filed rate doctrine because the relief sought by grays harbor would require the court to set damages by assuming a hypothetical rate,the fair value,in place of the rate regime established by ferc.id.at.this would violate the filed rate doctrine because the ferc rates were the lawful rates.id.
finally,a failure by ferc to exercise its statutory authority to approve rates would cast doubt on the underlying premise of the filed rate doctrine,that rates are just and reasonable as a matter of law and thus are not subject to collateral challenge.in response to grays harbor claim that ferc simply did not set any rates,we relied on ferc assertions that it was continuing to exercise its authority in the electricity arena.we noted ferc statement that it continued its market oversight by granting permits to sell at rates only after making a determination that the seller lacked market power and could not erect other barriers to entry.we noted that a ccording to ferc,these conditions assure that the rates charged comply with the fpa requirement that rates be just and reasonable.see also snohomish,at.we further noted that ferc oversight was ongoing,that ferc imposed various reporting requirements on sellers,and that ferc has clearly stated its belief that these procedures satisfy the filed rate doctrine for rates.grays harbor,at quotation marks omitted.we concluded that rates do not fall outside of the purview of the filed rate doctrine.id.snohomish relied on grays harbor in concluding that ferc was doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws.at.
because the fpa and the nga are substantially identical,and there is an established practice of citing interchangeably decisions interpreting the pertinent sections of the two statutes,grays harbor,at quoting arkla,at,the filed rate doctrine analysis in grays harbor is also applicable to rates under the nga.first,federal preemption of state damage claims applies to the natural gas arena as well as to the electricity arena.a challenge to natural gas rates established pursuant to ferc blanket market certificate would require a court to reconsider natural gas rates that ferc had already determined to be reasonable.because congress preempted the field by giving ferc exclusive jurisdiction over such rates,challenges to such rates are barred by field preemption,as in grays harbor.see id.see also schneidewind anr pipeline,d congress occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.
second,permitting a state court to grant an aggrieved party a refund in natural gas rates under ferc jurisdiction would create a conflict with ferc authority to approve rates,and thus is similarly preempted by conflict preemption.grays harbor,at.such a refund may also conflict with the authority ferc has to order retroactive refunds if the conduct of sellers under ferc jurisdiction violated the terms of the certificates.see cal.ex rel.lockyer,at finding in the context of the fpa that t he power to order retroactive refunds when a company has been so egregious that it eviscerates the tariff is inherent in ferc authority to approve a tariff in the first instance.
the filed rate doctrine bars federal antitrust claims in the natural gas arena just as it does in the electricity arena.because ferc is implementing a rate regime for natural gas,a court action challenging rates subject to ferc jurisdiction under federal antitrust law would violate the scope of authority given to ferc by congress.
finally,we can also conclude that ferc exercised its statutory authority under the nga to approve natural gas rates,so that the underlying premise of the filed rate doctrine remains applicable.similar to its analysis in the electricity arena,ferc determined that the best way to ensure just and reasonable rates in the evolving natural gas market was to allow natural gas sales to proceed at market prices.at.as noted in our foregoing historical review,supra,in order to ensure that market power was adequately mitigated in the natural gas arena,ferc reviewed the natural gas market and determined it was competitive.see.at.at.although ferc did not impose individualized reporting requirements on sellers of natural gas,ferc maintained ongoing oversight of the market and took corrective responses to evidence of market manipulation.see supra.in describing its exercise of authority,ferc asserted that the commission is instituting regulation,relying upon market forces at the wellhead or in the field to constrain unbundled pipeline sale for resale gas prices within the nga just and reasonable standard.at see also.at.because ferc has not abdicated its responsibilities but has acted,albeit with a light hand,to authorize just and reasonable rates in the natural gas arena,the filed rate doctrine continues to preempt any activities by the courts and bar federal antitrust claims under the filed rate doctrine 
gallo argues that ting v.at t,cir,stands for the proposition that once a federal regulatory agency replaces filed rates with rates,the filed rate doctrine and federal preemption no longer apply.gallo reliance on ting is misplaced.in ting,we held that the filed rate doctrine did not bar a plaintiff from challenging telephone rates permitted by the federal communications commission fcc under the recently amended federal communications act.id.at.although the federal communications act had previously included a filed rate procedure similar to that in the fpa and nga,congress fundamentally altered the filed rate procedure in through statutory amendments that authorized the fcc to eliminate the rate filing requirement and rely solely on market rates.id.at.we determined that in enacting the amendment,congress intended to replace the filing mechanism with a mechanism that expressly encompassed state law.id.at.because congress did not intend to preempt state law,we allowed the plaintiff to pursue its state law claim.the legislative changes to the federal communications act,reflected in ting,did not occur in the energy arena.congress has not made a similar statutory change to the nga or fpa such that ferc is permitted to abdicate its authority and,without any oversight,leave rate setting entirely to the markets remaining within ferc jurisdiction.
we conclude,therefore,for purposes of a challenge to rates for natural gas transactions under ferc jurisdiction,the principles of the filed rate doctrine are applicable.this means that the rate for natural gas transactions under ferc jurisdiction are rates,and can not be the basis of a federal antitrust or state damage action.
whether gallo claims based on retail rates and the indices are barred by the filed rate doctrine.having determined that the rates for transactions within ferc jurisdiction are rates,we must consider the second question,whether gallo specific claims are barred.to answer this question we must consider two additional issues.first,we must consider whether the filed rate doctrine can bar damage claims based on an index that represents wholesale rates,but that is not a rate itself.and second,we must consider whether gallo damage claims that challenge rates can be barred by the filed rate doctrine,given that gallo is making retail purchases which are outside ferc jurisdiction.
whether the filed rate doctrine bars damage arising from retail purchases.now that we have determined that rates can be rates,our decision in county of stanislaus pac.gas and,cir,readily resolves the second issue whether gallo status as a retail purchaser would allow it to challenge rates.in county of stanislaus,retail customers brought a class action against pacific gas electric company pg e,pg e pipeline company,pacific gas transportation pgt,and pg e aggregator and exporter of canadian gas,alberta southern gas company a s.among other claims,plaintiffs sought treble antitrust damages for injuries caused by the defendants price fixing activities.id.at.specifically,the plaintiffs claimed that a s conspired with canadian producers to increase the price a s paid for gas above the market rate a s sold the gas to pgt,which subsequently sold the gas to pg id.at.pg e in turn sold to the retail purchaser plaintiffs,who sought as damages the overcharge that resulted from the fixed prices.id.at.we held that because the price pg e paid to pgt for gas had been approved by ferc,that price was just and reasonable.see id.at.therefore,the retail plaintiffs could not claim an injury under the federal antitrust laws,because an award of treble damages is not an available remedy for a plaintiff claiming that the rate submitted to,and approved by,ferc was the product of an antitrust violation.id.at quoting square d,at.alteration in original.we also held that plaintiffs state claims were barred i t makes no difference that plaintiffs choose to bring some of their claims under state law on the facts of this case,the filed rate doctrine acts to bar all the challenges that plaintiffs assert.id.at.in barring plaintiffs claims,we implicitly held that retail purchasers whose damages arose from upstream wholesale this case,the rates charged by pgt to pg not challenge such rates.by the same token,if gallo damage claims are based on upstream rates within ferc jurisdiction,such claims are likewise barred even though gallo is a retail purchaser.
cases holding that states can not promulgate regulations that would penalize wholesale energy or natural gas purchasers for having paid wholesale rates further support this conclusion.for example,in nantahala power and light,d,the supreme court determined that principles of federal preemption prevented the north carolina utilities commission from in effect forcing nantahala power to sell power to retail customers at rates that would not allow it to recover its costs of purchasing wholesale power at rates.see also.power light ex rel.moore,d in this case as in nantahala we hold that a state utility commission setting retail prices must allow,as reasonable operating expenses,costs incurred as a result of paying a wholesale price once ferc sets such a rate,a state may not conclude in setting retail rates that the wholesale rates are unreasonable.quoting nantahala,at.entergy,at.w e conclude that the challenged state regulation impermissibly traps costs that have been allocated in a ferc tariff.although these cost trapping cases so called because the state agency tried to preclude the utility from recovering trapped wholesale costs do not involve a retail customer attempting to bring a damage action against the utility,they support encana position that wholesale sellers such as encana may raise the filed rate doctrine as a defense to actions putatively attacking retail rates,but having the effect of disallowing wholesale rates.
in light of county of stanislaus and the cases,gallo can not challenge its retail rates by claiming that rates were the result of misconduct,any more than the retail purchasers in county of stanislaus could claim they were injured by pg e purchases from pgt.it is irrelevant in this case that gallo purchased natural gas for its own consumption,because the lesson of county of stanislaus is that a retail purchaser can not recover damages based on a theory that rates were unfair.therefore,we must partially disagree with the district court conclusion that gallo could challenge its retail rates because the court was not required to undo or second guess a determination that was specifically made by ferc.gallo winery,wl,at.to the extent gallo challenge to the indices is a challenge to those wholesale rates subject to ferc jurisdiction that are included in the indices,gallo claim would be barred by the filed rate doctrine 
gallo contends that such a ruling could leave it without a remedy for encana misconduct.this equitable consideration does not compel a different result.any lack of remedy arises from the principle of statutory construction announced in keogh,namely,that gallo can not be damaged by a rate even if that rate were artificially inflated.see keogh,at.the supreme court has acknowledged that a finding that federal law provides a shield for the challenged conduct will almost always leave the violation unredressed.arkla,at.see also utilities nw.public service.
whether the filed rate doctrine bars damage claims based on indices.the conclusion that gallo damage claims are barred to the extent they challenge rates leads us to the next,more complicated issue whether the filed rate doctrine bars claims based on rates reported in the indices.
encana first argues broadly that because the indices constitute a compilation of rates,the filed rate doctrine bars damage actions based on rates reported in the indices.under our analysis,encana argument could prevail only if all the rates reported in the indices are rates or there is some other bar to challenging such rates or the filed rate doctrine bars a challenge to a compilation of both rates and rates that are not under ferc jurisdiction.
with respect to the first argument,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to gallo,encana has not carried its burden of establishing that all the transactions that comprise the indices were transactions or otherwise shielded from challenge.the district court did not determine the exact nature of the transactions that comprise the indices upon which gallo bases its damage claim.however,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to gallo,the record reflects that the indices potentially include transactions that are under ferc jurisdiction as well as transactions outside ferc jurisdiction.first,there is evidence in the record some index pricing inputs were misreported or wholly fictitious.final report,at.misreported rates and rates reported for fictitious transactions are not rates,and barring claims that such fictitious transactions damaged purchasers in the natural gas market would not further the purpose of the filed rate doctrine.see gallo winery,wl,at.
moreover,as part of its investigation of the indices,ferc concluded that it has jurisdiction over most of the transactions that form the basis for the indices.final report at emphasis added.this language indicates that at least some of the transactions included in the indices are not subject to ferc jurisdiction,and thus would be subject to challenge by gallo.in addition,ferc description of the haphazard manner in which the indices are assembled indicates that the traders reporting their transactions did not differentiate between jurisdictional and transactions within the wholesale market.final report,at.as discussed above,see supra,during the time period for which gallo seeks damages,consumers participated in the wholesale market.gallo winery,wl,at.these consumer transactions,which are not regulated by ferc,were potentially included in the indices.in addition,first sales transactions,either at the wellhead or via imports from canada and mexico,were potentially included in the indices.these first sales are also outside of ferc jurisdiction.
encana argues that even if first sales were reported in the indices,principles of federal preemption nevertheless bar any damage claims based on such rates encana relies on transcontinental gas pipe line state oil and gas board of mississippi,d,which established that in deregulating first sales in the ngpa,congress intended to keep the field clear of state regulations of first sales.by extension,encana argues,principles of preemption would prevent gallo from bringing damage claims that have the effect of reducing the purchase price of first sales.
encana analysis is incomplete and therefore incorrect.our review of the ngpa and wda leads us to conclude that congress removal of ferc jurisdiction over first sales does not preempt the type of claims brought by gallo in this action.in enacting the ngpa and the wda,congress is assumed to be aware of the existing context of state and federal antitrust and damage laws.united states hunter,cir a s a matter of statutory construction,we presume that congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts.quotation marks omitted.we ordinarily do not deem congress to preempt laws of general applicability.see total tv palmer commc ns,cir.neither the ngpa nor the wda,the two statutory enactments that removed first sales from ferc jurisdiction,includes language suggesting that congress intended to displace state antitrust or damage laws by withdrawing first sales from the nga.congress decision not to expressly preempt such damage claims indicates a lack of intent to do so.see id.although congress withdrawal of first sales from ferc jurisdiction does reflect congress intent to move toward a less regulated national natural gas market,at,state and federal antitrust and fair competition laws complement rather than undermine such a goal,see total tv,at,because they support fair competition.by enabling private parties to combat market manipulation and other actions,the laws under which gallo brought its claim support congress determination that the supply,the demand,and the price of first sale gas be determined by market forces,transcon,at.just as congress direction to ferc to determine just and reasonable rates gave rise to the inference that congress preempted damage claims per the filed rate doctrine,the withdrawal of ferc authority to determine such rates gives rise to the opposite inference,that normal market forces,including the tug and pull of private lawsuits,will hold sway.therefore,we conclude that congress did not preclude plaintiffs from basing damage claims on rates associated with first sales.
encana also argues that,even though first sales are exempted from ferc jurisdiction,congress has determined that all first sales occur at rates that are just and reasonable as a matter of law.for this proposition,encana relies on a provision of the wda,which states except as otherwise provided in this subsection,for purposes of sections and of the natural gas act,any amount paid in any first sale of natural gas shall be deemed to be just and reasonable.b a.sections and of the nga,and,govern the rates that can be charged under ferc jurisdiction.encana interpretation of section b is incorrect.section a provides that the nga shall not apply to any natural gas solely by reason of any first sale of such natural gas.a a.because ferc jurisdiction is limited to the scope of the nga,this language eliminates ferc general authority over first sales.
however,section b a general statement that any amounts paid in first sales are just and reasonable is not inconsistent with section a exclusion of first sales from the nga.rather,section b can be understood as ensuring that ferc will not exercise its jurisdiction in a way that prevents regulated entities from recovering amounts paid in first sales.in other words,after an interstate pipeline,intrastate pipeline,or local distribution company purchases natural gas in a first sale,any subsequent sale of that gas is not a first sale.to the extent ferc has authority with respect to those subsequent sales,ferc could determine that the just and reasonable rate for such sales was lower than the rate that would be necessary for the regulated entities to recover the prices they paid for the natural gas in their first sale transactions.this would allow ferc to create its own scenario.section c,however,ensures that such will not occur,because it provides that for purposes of sections and of the natural gas act,any amount paid in any first sale of natural gas shall be deemed to be just and reasonable.b a see also c.this language ensures regulated entities that they can set their sales prices for natural gas in a manner that will allow them to recover the just and reasonable amounts they previously paid in first sales.however,sections b a and c do not mean that first sales are just and reasonable for other purposes,particularly because other first sales are not subject to the nga.
encana raises the additional argument that the transactions comprising the indices were transactions or otherwise shielded from challenge because ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.b.in essence,encana argues that all sales of natural gas transported in interstate pipelines are subject to ferc jurisdiction and shielded from challenge by the filed rate doctrine because such sales reflect interstate transportation costs.it is true that in today natural gas marketplace w hen the gas sales element is,the transaction,ferc retains jurisdiction over the interstate transportation component.united distrib,per curiam emphasis omitted.however,encana argument goes too far a determination that ferc jurisdiction covered any sale of natural gas with an interstate transportation component would extend ferc authority over virtually all natural gas that was not produced,sold and used in a single state.such an interpretation would conflict with b providing that the nga does not apply to sales of natural gas other than sales for resale and a a providing that ferc jurisdiction does not extend to natural gas solely by reason of any first sale of such natural gas,and we therefore reject it.we agree that to the extent ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and exercises that authority to approve interstate transportation rates,the filed rate doctrine would prevent gallo from basing damage claims on such rates.however,as previously discussed,gallo is challenging at least some conduct that is not approved by ferc,and thus not barred by ferc jurisdiction over interstate transportation.
