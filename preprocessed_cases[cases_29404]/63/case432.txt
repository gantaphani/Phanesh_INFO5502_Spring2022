the natural gas act nga,grants ferc jurisdiction over rates charged by any company for or in connection with the transportation or sale of natural gas.id.a.a company,in turn,includes any firm engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.id.the gathering of gas generally defined as the process of taking natural gas from the wells and moving it to a collection point for further movement through a pipeline principal transmission system,williams gas processing gulf coast,ferc,internal quotation marks omitted is explicitly excluded,however,from ferc jurisdiction.see b this chapter shall not apply to the production or gathering of natural gas.notwithstanding that jurisdictional limitation,ferc historically exercised jurisdiction over gathering services provided directly by interstate pipelines on the theory that such gathering services are provided in connection with the interstate transportation of gas.see,northern natural gas,ferc,wl,reh g denied,ferc,wl citing,see also conoco ferc.ferc,however,has never claimed jurisdiction over gathering entities,gathering facilities that are neither owned by nor affiliated with a pipeline within ferc jurisdiction.
in response to this regulatory environment,several jurisdictional pipelines that provided gathering services sought either to spin off their gathering facilities as unrelated corporations or to spin down the gathering operations to corporate affiliates by transferring ownership of the gathering facilities from the pipeline to a subsidiary.while a gathering service spun off from a jurisdictional pipeline into a separate corporation was clearly beyond ferc nga jurisdiction,the jurisdictional status of gatherers spun down from an interstate pipeline was less clear.ferc had claimed that it retained in connection with jurisdiction over the rates charged by gatherers.see natural gas gathering services performed by interstate pipelines and interstate pipeline affiliates issues related to rates and terms and conditions of service,ferc,wl citing northwest pipeline,ferc,wl.but ferc never found occasion to exercise its authority over such an entity.in fact,when the gathering affiliate in northwest pipeline challenged ferc statutory authority for such jurisdiction in the court of appeals,t he commission represented that its orders neither assert ed jurisdiction nor impl ied that it ha d jurisdiction over the gathering affiliate at the present time.williams gas processing ferc,cir.the tenth circuit therefore dismissed the petition for review for lack of a case or controversy.see id.
the commission sought to resolve the jurisdictional status of gathering entities in arkla gathering services company,ferc,wl.ferc there reviewed a jurisdictional pipeline proposal to spin down its gathering facilities to an affiliate and various objections to that application.the commission concluded that,as a general matter,it lacked jurisdiction over companies that perform only a gathering function whether they are independent or affiliated with an interstate pipeline,such gathering entities are not natural gas companies under the nga.id.at.the commission,though,found it hard to let go ferc still maintained that it could,in particular circumstances,reassert jurisdiction over a jurisdictional pipeline gathering affiliate where such action is necessary to accomplish the commission policies for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.id.the commission warned that if an affiliated gatherer acts in concert with its pipeline affiliate and in a manner that frustrates the commission effective regulation of the interstate pipeline,the commission would set aside the separate corporate structures and treat the pipeline as it would if the gathering facilities were owned directly by an interstate pipeline.id.
the commission went on to explain,however,that only certain types of affiliate abuses those arising specifically from the interrelationship between the pipeline and its affiliate would trigger the commission authority to disregard the corporate form and permit it to assert jurisdiction over a gathering affiliate.id.such abuses included the affiliate giving preferences to market affiliate gas or tying gathering service to the pipeline jurisdictional transmission service the pipeline giving transportation discounts only to those utilizing the affiliate gathering service and actions resulting in between the affiliate gathering rates and the pipeline transmission rates.id.while the commission acknowledged that an affiliate could undertake other types of activities,the commission viewed its residual jurisdiction as reaching only scenarios where the abuse is directly related to the affiliate unique relationship with an interstate pipeline.id.only that brand of behavior breached the arm length relationship between the pipeline and an affiliated gathering company and thereby authorized the commission to treat a jurisdictional pipeline and its gathering affiliate together as a single natural gas company subject to ferc jurisdiction.id.
we affirmed ferc approval of the of the arkla gathering facilities.see conoco,at.specifically,we rejected the objections of various gas producers to the commission determination that it generally lacked nga jurisdiction over gathering affiliates.id.at.we also approved a s an abstract matter the commission new policy concerning nga gathering affiliates,stating we have no reason to doubt the commission conclusion that a nonjurisdictional entity could act in a manner that would change its status by enabling an affiliated interstate pipeline to manipulate access and costs of gathering.id.at.we explicitly acknowledged,however,that the question had not yet been squarely presented for resolution because the commission has yet to assert its jurisdiction over a gathering affiliate.id.that time has now come.
transcontinental gas pipe line corporation transco is a natural gas transportation company that operates approximately miles of natural gas pipeline extending from the gulf of mexico to new york.in november,transco sought permission from ferc to spin down its gathering facilities in the gulf of mexico located offshore of north padre island,texas to its gathering affiliate williams gas processing gulf coast company,wgp the north padre island npi gathering facilities consist of two small offshore legs miles of pipeline and miles of pipeline both of which gather and move gas before converging offshore and connecting to transco separate pipeline that provides to an onshore processing facility and eventually to transco main pipeline in texas.
ferc approved the of the npi gathering facilities to wgp over the objections of numerous producers and shippers,including shell offshore,an intervenor in this proceeding.see transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,wl order,aff,williams gas processing gulf coast,at.moreover,as wgp engaged only in gathering and other nonjurisdictional activities,the commission concluded that once ownership of the npi facilities was transferred from transco to wgp,those facilities would become exempt from ferc nga jurisdiction.order,ferc at.the commission,however,noted on several occasions that,as the npi gathering facilities were located offshore,they would remain subject to ferc jurisdiction under the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,and ocsla requirement that service be provided on an open access and nondiscriminatory basis,id.f a.order,ferc at.transco closed the of the npi gathering facilities to wgp on december,and those facilities are now operated by williams field services wfs,a subsidiary of wgp.
intervenor shell offshore shell produced gas offshore of north padre island,texas and delivered its gas into the npi gathering pipeline at an interconnection miles from that pipe interconnection to transco line.prior to the of the npi facilities,transco charged shell per dekatherm to gather and transport shell gas miles from shell npi interconnection to transco main line.after the,wfs informed shell that it intended to charge shell per dekatherm to gather and move shell gas just the miles from shell npi interconnection to transco line.for its part,transco proposed to maintain its transportation rate of per dekatherm for the remaining miles of service.shell was thus being asked to pay per dekatherm to move its gas to transco main line,whereas before the it had paid per dekatherm for the same haul.
unable to reach an agreement with wfs on an appropriate gathering charge,on november,shell filed a complaint with the commission against transco,wgp,and wfs,and shortly thereafter shut in its gas.see shell offshore transcontinental gas pipe line,docket no,complaint requesting fast track processing and request for interim relief.the complaint alleged that transco and wfs were unlawfully leveraging their dominance in the north padre island gathering and transportation markets in an effort to force shell to pay unjust and unreasonable gathering rates and to accept anticompetitive terms and conditions of gathering service,such as promising to dedicate its north padre gas reserves to wfs gathering for the life of production.id.at.the complaint urged the commission to find that transco and wfs were acting in concert and in an manner that frustrated the commission ability to regulate transco jurisdictional pipeline,and further requested that ferc reassert jurisdiction over the npi gathering facilities pursuant to its arkla gathering theory of residual jurisdiction.id.at.
shortly thereafter,superior natural gas superior,a marketer,and walter oil gas walter,a producer,filed their own complaint against wgp and wfs,alleging violations of oclsa.see superior natural gas williams gas processing gulf coast,docket no,complaint of superior natural gas corporation and walter oil gas corporation.specifically,superior and walter alleged that wfs was imposing anticompetitive and discriminatory rates and terms and conditions for gathering service,id.at,in violation of ocsla requirement of open and nondiscriminatory access.f a.
wfs attempted to reach a settlement with shell,offering to provide gathering service for per dekatherm.shell countered with an offer of per dekatherm,which wfs rejected.with the parties at loggerheads,the dispute was thrown to the commission for resolution.the commission set both the shell and the complaints for expedited hearing before an administrative law judge.see shell offshore transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,wl.in doing so,the commission reaffirmed its ability to reassert jurisdiction over gathering affiliates whenever an affiliated gatherer acts in concert with its pipeline affiliate in connection with the transportation of gas in interstate commerce and in a manner that frustrates the commission effective regulation of the interstate pipeline.id.at quoting arkla gathering,ferc at.the commission directed the alj to develop a record on that issue and also on whether wfs violated ocsla open access and nondiscrimination provision.id.at.
the hearing before the alj commenced in april.within three days,wfs had reached a settlement with superior and walter disposing of their ocsla complaint.see shell offshore transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,wl.superior and walter accordingly withdrew their testimony and did not participate further in the hearing.id.at.shell,though,carried on,and in june the alj ruled in shell favor,concluding that transco and wfs in fact have acted in concert in offering gathering services and have abused their monopoly market power in a manner that frustrates the commission effective regulation of transco and the interstate transportation of natural gas from the north padre island npi system.id.at see also id.at.consistent with the commission instructions,the alj left it for the commission to decide whether or not to reassert nga jurisdiction over the npi gathering facilities.id.at.
the commission affirmed the alj factual findings,concluding that the alj analysis was generally and provide d a sound basis for reasserting nga jurisdiction over the spundown npi gathering facilities.see shell offshore transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,wl order.the commission applied the test set forth in arkla gathering,though it did so in a manner that diverge d slightly from the alj.id.at.as to the first part whether transco and wfs had acted in concert the commission adopted the alj finding that they had.id.to address the second half of the test whether the concerted action frustrated the commission effective regulation of transco the commission first made a predicate finding because transco and wfs actions were conducted on a concerted basis,the actions of wfs can be attributed to transco,and vice versa,as if the facilities were still part of the transco system.id.the commission therefore reframed the second question,asking whether the rates and terms and conditions of service exacted directly by wfs,and indirectly by transco,for the subject gathering services,are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory id.the answer was yes,and the commission thus concluded that b y demanding a monopolistically egregious rate in conjunction with anticompetitive terms and conditions of service,the single entity,frustrated the commission regulation over the rates and services provided on transco.id.at.based on these findings,the commission reasserted nga jurisdiction over the npi gathering facilities and established per dekatherm as a just and reasonable unbundled gathering rate for shell.id.at.
even though wfs had settled the complaint and the alj neither accepted evidence nor reached any conclusion as to whether wfs actions violated ocsla,the commission nevertheless addressed superior and walter ocsla claim.the commission analysis was curt,concluding that i n light of our findings that transco and wfs,in concert,have abused their monopoly power,transco had violated the open access and nondiscrimination requirements of oclsa.see id.at.the commission thus also assert ed ocsla jurisdiction over the rates and services provided by.id.at.
on rehearing,transco and wfs argued,inter alia,that the commission lacked any authority under the nga to assert jurisdiction over an affiliated gatherer,misapplied its arkla gathering test,erred in finding a violation of ocsla,and erred in setting a rate as a remedy.see shell offshore transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,wl order on rehearing.calling the npi a sham designed to circumvent the commission regulation,the commission denied rehearing,affirming its previous order in all respects.id.at.
wgp now seeks review in this court,raising substantially the same arguments as in its petition for rehearing before the commission.we vacate the commission order and order on rehearing and remand for further proceedings.
we review orders of the commission under the standards of the administrative procedure act,upsetting agency action only when it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this standard,while we will defer to an agency reasonable application of its own precedents,see,vernal,fcc,we will not countenance an agency departure from its precedent without explanation,see,ramaprakash faa.under the nga,the commission factual findings will be upheld so long as they are supported by substantial evidence.see b.
in this case,the commission posited two statutory bases for reasserting jurisdiction over the npi gathering facilities and setting a gathering rate the nga and ocsla.we address each in turn.
nga jurisdiction 
as discussed above,the nga expressly disclaims jurisdiction over gas gathering.see b.where,however,the gathering entity is a corporate affiliate of a jurisdictional pipeline,the commission,in its arkla gathering order,reserved the right to reassert jurisdiction over the gathering affiliate in particular circumstances pursuant to its in connection with jurisdiction under sections and of the act,id.ferc at.in fleshing out the particular circumstances that might give rise to a reclamation of jurisdiction,the arkla gathering decision established a test concerted action between the jurisdictional pipeline and its gathering affiliate,undertaken in a manner that frustrates the commission ability to regulate the jurisdictional pipeline.id.
but the arkla gathering decision did not end there.the commission went on to elab
