energy transfer partners,and related entities to which we will refer individually and collectively as etp petition for review of an order of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission denying rehearing of an order that alleges etp violated the natural gas act nga,the natural gas policy act ngpa,and ferc implementing regulations and in which ferc proposed substantial penalties.etp also petitions for review of a ferc order requiring an adversary hearing on these issues before an administrative law judge alj.because the issues presented are not ripe for review,we dismiss the petition.
after two years of investigation,ferc issued a show cause order that included its preliminary determinations that etp had manipulated wholesale prices,in violation of ferc regulations under the nga,and etp pipeline companies had unduly discriminated against nonaffiliated pipeline shippers,unduly preferred affiliated pipeline shippers,and charged rates for pipeline transportation service in excess of the maximum lawful rate,in violation of ferc regulations under the ngpa as the consequence for the alleged nga violations,ferc proposed a civil penalty of,disgorgement of unjust profits in the amount of plus interest,and revocation of etp blanket certificate to sell natural gas additional penalties were proposed for the alleged ngpa violations,and ferc directed etp to respond to the specific allegations detailed in the show cause order 
etp filed an expedited request for rehearing and for a stay of the show cause order,contending that adjudication of civil penalties under the nga or ngpa should proceed in a de novo trial before a federal district court rather than in administrative proceedings.etp also asserted that ferc statements in the show cause order gave the appearance of prejudgment,depriving etp of due process of law.in an order denying rehearing,ferc rejected etp arguments and denied the request to stay the show cause order 
etp subsequently filed a petition for review of the show cause order and order denying rehearing in this court.ferc moved to dismiss the petition,contending that the orders were not final because the ferc proceedings initiated therein were ongoing.we granted ferc motion and dismissed etp first petition for lack of jurisdiction 
meanwhile,in response to the show cause order,etp filed its answer to the commission allegations,asserting that it had not violated the nga or the ngpa,and requested summary disposition.the commission thereafter issued an order establishing hearing in which it found that there are genuine issues of fact material to the decision of this proceeding that require a hearing before an alj and accordingly denied etp motion for summary disposition that order initiated what ferc described as a evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge,specifying that an alj should determine whether etp violated ferc rule and whether etp unjustly profited from its activities,and,if so,the level of unjust profits.ferc reserved to itself the issue of whether civil penalties,other remedies,or both should be imposed.etp again filed a request for rehearing and a stay on the same grounds as in its earlier request for rehearing of the show cause order.
ferc denied etp request for rehearing and a stay etp then filed a second petition for review before this court,now challenging the order establishing hearing and subsequently filed an amended petition adding the show cause to its petition.etp voluntarily withdrew its challenge of issues after a settlement of those issues was reached.
in order to determine whether the issues presented are ripe for review,it is necessary to understand the parties respective positions.etp contends that it has the statutory right to have its civil penalty liability determined,in the first instance,by a federal district court.etp relies on language in of the nga,which states that federal district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules,regulations,and orders thereunder,and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by,or to enjoin any violation of,this chapter or any rule,regulation,or order thereunder.etp contends that federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine if it has violated the nga and is liable for civil penalties.etp apparently concedes that ferc is empowered by of the to propose and assess a civil penalty for violations of the nga or regulations promulgated under the nga authority.etp asserts,however,that it is entitled to a de novo proceeding in a federal district court by virtue of of the act,quoted above,to challenge the assessment of a penalty,and etp maintains that ferc does not have the authority to require proceedings before an alj to resolve whether violations of the nga occurred.
ferc has taken the position in its motion to dismiss this petition and in its underlying order denying expedited request for rehearing and stay and addressing future civil penalty procedures that there is no de novo review of civil penalties in a federal district court.ferc points out that unlike the and the federal power act the nga does not provide for de novo review of a penalty in a federal district court and that the absence of de novo review language in the nga evinces congressional intent.ferc takes the position that it is authorized by to require a public hearing,including an adversarial proceeding before an alj,and that upon finding that the nga has been violated,ferc may assess a civil penalty.the commission maintains that etp would then be entitled to petition for review by a court of appeals pursuant to b of the nga,b,and that the standard of review would be for substantial evidence.ferc argues that it is only in a collection action,once penalty proceedings are final,following appellate review in a court of appeals if review is sought,that a federal district court would have exclusive jurisdiction.the standard of review in a collection action before a district court would be substantial evidence,according to ferc.
etp contends in this court that ferc construction of the nga is incorrect and that being compelled to participate in an invalid administrative process is an injury that confers standing for it to pursue the present petition for review.the crux of etp argument is that ferc has ordered an unlawful hearing before an alj and that there is no adequate remedy for being required to participate in that hearing.only a petition for review at this juncture,etp asserts,will provide meaningful relief.
the parties agree that the statute governing this court jurisdiction to consider etp petition is b of the nga no party contends that a federal district court has jurisdiction to review ferc order requiring a hearing in this case,and we are aware of no authority to that effect.accordingly,we will analyze whether this petition for review should proceed under b of the nga and the precedents construing and applying that statute.
section b of the nga provides in pertinent part any party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the commission in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of the united states our court has long recognized that this section of the nga does not require that an order be a final one rather,the inquiry is whether a party has been aggrieved by an order of the commission.we have,however,declined to review orders that are not definitive in their impact upon the rights of the parties and do not threaten the petitioner with irreparable harm.we have said that this is a requirement that the order have some substantial effect on the parties which can not be altered by subsequent administrative action.we have reasoned that a party has not been aggrieved by a ferc decision unless its injury is present and immediate,and that r elatedly,the dispute must be ripe for review.
in determining whether a ferc order is ripe for review,our court has utilized the factors set forth by the supreme court in abbott laboratories gardner in that case a regulation promulgated by the secretary of health,education,and welfare pursuant to the food,drug,and cosmetic act was challenged,and the supreme court concluded that the issue of ripeness of agency action for judicial review is best seen in a twofold aspect,requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.from abbott laboratories,this court has distilled four factors in its ripeness analysis of ferc orders 
whether the issues presented are purely legal whether the challenged agency action constitutes final agency action,within the meaning of section of the administrative procedure act whether the challenged agency action has or will have a direct and immediate impact upon the petitioners and whether resolution of the issues will foster,rather than impede,effective enforcement and administration by the agency 
the regulations at issue in abbott laboratories required manufacturers of prescription drugs to print certain information on drug labels and advertisements.the supreme court held that the regulations were definitive statements of the commission and had a direct and immediate effect on the business of the complaining parties the court determined that the regulations had the status of law and immediate compliance with their terms was expected.the court observed that i f petitioners wish to comply they must change all their labels,advertisements,and promotional materials they must destroy stocks of printed matter and they must invest heavily in new printing type and new supplies.the court recognized that the alternative to use of material which they believe in good faith meets the statutory requirements,but which clearly does not meet the regulation of the be even more costly and would risk serious criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful distribution of misbranded drugs.the regulations were ripe for review.
in federal trade commission standard oil company of california,the supreme court subsequently contrasted the regulations under consideration in abbott laboratories with an agency complaint alleging statutory violations in standard oil,the federal trade commission ftc issued an administrative complaint against standard oil company of california socal alleging that socal had violated the federal trade commission act by conspiring with other oil producers to contrive gasoline shortages while an adjudication of these charges was pending before an alj,socal sought an order in federal district court declaring that the issuance of the ftc complaint was unlawful and requiring that the complaint be withdrawn 
the supreme court concluded that issuance of the complaint by the ftc was not a final agency action within the meaning of the apa the court reasoned that the complaint was not a definitive ruling or regulation and had no legal force or practical effect on socal daily business other than the burden of responding to the allegations the supreme court also concluded that j udicial intervention into the agency process denies the agency an opportunity to correct its own mistakes and to apply its expertise judicial review would delay resolution of the ultimate question whether the act was violated and j udicial review of the averments in the commission complaints should not be a means of turning prosecutor into defendant before adjudication concludes.the supreme court required dismissal of socal request for review 
the ferc orders at issue in the present petition for review lie on a continuum between the regulations considered in abbott laboratories and the agency complaint under scrutiny in standard oil.but on balance,ferc orders alleging violations of the nga and setting the matter for hearing before an alj are more analogous to the agency action in standard oil.ferc order initiating administrative proceedings is not a definitive ruling or regulation.the requirement that the reviewable order be definitive in its impact upon the rights of the parties is something more than a requirement that the order be unambiguous in legal effect.it is a requirement that the order have some substantial effect on the parties which can not be altered by subsequent administrative action.we note that after ferc allegations that etp had violated the ngpa were heard by an alj,the alj dismissed the primary claim pending against etp.ferc then reached a settlement with etp regarding the ngpa issues.etp may similarly prevail on the merits in the administrative action regarding the nga,thereby mooting its judicial challenge.the possibility that etp may prevail warrants the requirement that etp pursue administrative adjudication,not shortcut it.at this juncture,no statutory violation has been finally determined by ferc.
etp primary argument is that it should not be required to participate in adversary proceedings before an alj.the supreme court reasoning in standard oil counsels that we reject this contention as well.ferc intermediate decision has no legal force or practical effect on etp daily business other than the disruption caused by litigation as the supreme court has stated,while the burden of defending an administrative proceeding would be substantial,the expense and annoyance of litigation is part of the social burden of living under government.although this burden certainly is substantial,it is different in kind and legal effect from the burdens attending what heretofore has been considered to be final agency action.here,etp legitimate concern about expected litigation expenses does not constitute irreparable injury that would be one factor in determining if an order should be accorded finality etp also contends that the rules of evidence are more relaxed in administrative proceedings than they would be in a de novo review in district court.however,if etp is correct that it is entitled to de novo review of any finding by ferc that the nga has been violated and de novo review of any penalty assessed,then etp would be entitled to de novo review.the proceedings before an alj,including any evidentiary rulings or determinations,would not bind the district court.
etp argues that our decision to review an interlocutory decision in mississippi valley gas governs the instant case.in mississippi valley,the commission accepted a proposed rate increase for natural gas transportation costs over objection by mississippi valley that such a rate increase would violate a prior stipulation in rate proceedings applying the factors for assessing ripeness found in abbott laboratories,we concluded that ferc decision was ripe with regard to the third factor in abbott laboratories,which is that the impact of the order must be definitive and have some substantial effect on the parties that can not be altered by subsequent administrative action,our reasoning in mississippi valley may not be entirely clear.however,we did not rely on the burden and costs of proceeding before an alj to establish the third factor as etp does in the present case.
etp relies on our recent opinion in texas united states in texas,the secretary of the interior promulgated regulations pertaining to indian gaming procedures that applied if a state asserted sovereign immunity in a suit by an indian tribe in which the tribe alleged that the state had failed to negotiate in good faith a voluntary compact governing the conduct of gaming activities we held that the challenged regulations were final agency action and therefore reviewable because they were final rules that were promulgated through a formal,rulemaking process after announcement in the federal register.this court reasoned that the state of texas would otherwise be forced to choose between two options participate in an allegedly invalid process that eliminates a procedural safeguard promised by congress,or eschew the process with the hope of invalidating it in the future,which risks the approval of gaming procedures in which the state had no input.
we perceive a difference between a challenge to final regulations that apply to all in a regulated industry after notice and hearing and a challenge to an order requiring an evidentiary hearing in a particular case.we recognize that in the present case the commission has construed t
