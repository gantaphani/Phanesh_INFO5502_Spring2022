primrose operating company primrose and cada operating,cada collectively,plaintiffs,filed suit in texas state court against national american insurance company naico,seeking damages for an alleged breach of naico duty to defend plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against them in texas state court.naico removed to federal court based on complete diversity between the parties.a jury found for plaintiffs and awarded damages against naico.naico filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court denied.following the district court entry of judgment,naico filed a motion to alter or amend judgment and a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied these motions as well.naico now appeals the orders entering judgment and denying naico motions.
background procedural history 
the senn family owns a ranch in west texas.primrose operated an oil and gas lease on the ranch from to,and cada succeeded primrose in as the operator of that lease.in september,the senns sued plaintiffs and several other oil companies,for polluting their ranch,asserting claims including,inter alia,negligence,gross negligence,trespass,and nuisance.primrose was insured during the time it operated the senns lease by three insurance companies chubb insurance group chubb from april,to april,casualty company from april,to april,and naico from april,until the time cada succeeded primrose as the lease operator in december.cada was solely insured by naico from december until april.
primrose reported the suit to all three insurers and requested a defense.chubb and agreed to defend primrose under a reservation of rights and retained,and agreed to pay the bills of,kathleen mcculloch of shafer,davis,ashley,stoker the shafer firm.naico,however,denied coverage and refused to provide a defense for primrose.naico also refused cada request for a defense.cada,in turn,retained ackels ackels the ackels firm for its defense in the senn litigation.in march,primrose retained rick strange of the law firm of cotton bledsoe tighe dawson the cotton bledsoe firm,in addition to the representation primrose was then receiving from the shafer firm 
at the time the senn litigation went to trial in october,a number of the other defendant oil companies,although it is unclear if all,had been dismissed.during the first week of trial,cada settled with the senns and was dismissed from the suit.although primrose received a judgment substantially in its favor,the state court granted the senns a partial new trial limited to surface contamination issues.the case was retried against primrose in october.the jury in the second state action found that primrose had negligently damaged the senns ranch,awarding the senns damages in the amount of.primrose has appealed this judgment 
plaintiffs filed the present lawsuit in texas state court in march,seeking damages for naico alleged breach of its duty to defend plaintiffs in their suit with the senns.plaintiffs,both citizens of texas with their principal places of business in texas,specifically asserted breach of contract claims under the insurance policies issued to them by naico,in addition to claims under the texas insurance code,and the texas deceptive trade practices act the dtpa.naico,a foreign corporation with its principal place of business in oklahoma,thereafter removed the case to federal court based on complete diversity.the case was presented to a jury,and after the close of all evidence,both plaintiffs and naico moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied plaintiffs motion in its entirety,while granting in part naico motion as it related to plaintiffs failure to offer any evidence to support their dtpa claims and cada inability to present sufficient evidence supporting its claims under the texas insurance code.
the jury awarded plaintiffs damages for naico breach of contract and for primrose claim under article of the texas insurance code.naico filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and an alternative motion for a new trial,both of which were denied by the district court.after the district court entered judgment for plaintiffs,naico filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,arguing that the district court miscalculated prejudgment interest and the statutory penalty under article.naico also renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.the district court also denied these motions.naico timely filed the instant notice of appeal with respect to the district court orders entering judgment and denying naico motions for judgment as a matter of law and to alter or amend the judgment.
discussion 
naico duty to defend 
naico first contends that the district court erred by failing to grant its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether naico had a duty to defend plaintiffs.this court reviews a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.pineda united parcel,cir.a motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for a party.id.quoting.a.i f reasonable persons could differ in their interpretations of the evidence,then the motion should be denied.a motion for judgment as a matter of law should only be granted when the facts and inferences point so strongly in favor of the movant that a rational jury could not reach a contrary verdict.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.

the eight corners rule is to be applied liberally in favor of the insured,with any doubts resolved in favor of the insured.guaranty ins.azrock,cir.if any allegation in the complaint is even potentially covered by the policy then the insurer has a duty to defend its insured.enserch shand morahan,cir emphases added terra int l,commonwealth lloyd ins,writ denied observing that courts are to liberally construe the allegations in the complaint to determine if they fall within the provisions of the insurance policies,and i f there is any doubt about whether the allegations reflect a potential liability,such doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured.
to determine if naico had a duty to defend,this court must first look to the allegations in the underlying suit filed by the senns.as an amended pleading completely supersedes prior pleadings,the duty to defend rests on the most recent pleading.guaranty ins.vic,cir.therefore,the operative pleading for purposes of our analysis is the senns fourth amended original petition,in which the senns alleged that primrose and cada,along with several other oil companies,polluted their ranch through releases of saltwater,oil,and other fluids.specifically,the senns contended that these releases contaminated the surface,subsurface,and groundwater of their ranch.
in an insurance coverage dispute analyzed under the eight corners rule,t he insured bears the initial burden of showing that there is coverage,while the insurer bears the burden of proving the applicability of any exclusions in the policy.once the insurer has proven that an exclusion applies,the burden shifts back to the insured to show that the claim falls within an exception to the exclusion.guaranty,at citation and footnote omitted.the insurance policies at issue here contain three relevant sections exclusion f of the general commercial liability cgl policy,the pollution exclusion clause the contamination or pollution coverage,the pollution endorsement and the saline substance contamination coverage,the saline endorsement plaintiffs argue and naico concedes that the cgl policy purchased from naico covers the senns allegations.naico contends,however,that an exclusion to the cgl policies,the pollution exclusion clause,by itself excludes coverage.in response,plaintiffs argue that by purchasing two endorsements,the pollution endorsement and the saline endorsement,the claims represented by the senns allegations are brought back within the language of the cgl policy.
a.the pollution exclusion clause 
the pollution exclusion does not afford coverage for 
bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants 
a at or from any premises,site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by,or rented or loaned to,any insured 
d at or from any premises,site or location on which any insured or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on any insured behalf are performing operations 
any loss,cost or expense arising out of any 
a request,demand or order that any insured or others test for,monitor,clean up,remove,contain,treat,detoxify or neutralize,or in any way respond to,or assess the effects of pollutants.
naico contends that section f a of the pollution exclusion applies to the senns claims because plaintiffs occupied the land upon which pollutants were released.plaintiffs do not dispute that the pollution exclusion,by itself,would bar coverage however,according to plaintiffs,the pollution endorsement specifically operates to eliminate the pollution exclusion clause,subject to six listed conditions.plaintiffs argue,therefore,that the pollution exclusion precludes naico duty to defend only if one of the six conditions is not met.we agree.
b.the pollution endorsement 
only three of the six conditions necessary for the application of the pollution the effective elimination of the pollution contested.specifically,naico argues that condition b sudden accidental condition d prior incidents and condition f violation of law,are not satisfied on the basis of the senns allegations.
condition b sudden,accidental,and unexpected 
condition b requires that the pollution incident be an accident and unintentional release,discharge,emission or escape of pollutants and that such an incident be sudden and accidental and is neither expected nor intended by any insured.naico contends that the pollution incidents of which the senns complain were expected by plaintiffs and were neither sudden nor accidental.
this court has held that under texas law,the sudden and accidental clause contains a temporal element in addition to the requirement of being unforeseen or unexpected.guaranty,at.the sudden and accidental requirement unambiguously exclude s coverage for all pollution that is not released quickly as well as unexpectedly and unintentionally.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.
texas law defines accidental as an unforeseen and unexpected event.gulf metals,chicago ins,pet.denied.the senns do not allege that plaintiffs expected the pollution incidents of which the senns complain or that the incidents were accidental.the senns,however,alleged that plaintiffs were negligent,causing potentially permanent groundwater contamination,among other damage,because plaintiffs failed to exercise ordinary care in the conduct of its oil and gas operations.not expecting a particular incident to occur and an accidental occurrence are completely consistent with a claim of negligence.t here is an accident when the action is intentionally taken,but is performed negligently,and the effect is not what would have been intended or expected had the action been performed.harken exploration sphere drake ins.plc,cir emphases added hallman allstate ins,pet.filed.
this court has previously held that t he operation of the oil facilities is the action deliberately taken,but alleged to have been performed negligently.the contaminated water caused by the pollutants is the unintended and unexpected effect of the operation of an oil facility.harken,at moreover,a pollution incident is defined in the pollution endorsement as a n occurrence consisting of any actual emission,discharge,release or escape of pollutant which results in environmental damage.emphasis added.therefore,at least one of the senns negligence allegations could have potentially resulted in an unexpected and accidental pollution incident,thereby resulting in coverage under naico policies.
the temporal requirement of sudden and accidental requires that the pollutant be released quickly.guaranty,at.texas law defines sudden as an abrupt or brief event.pioneer chlor alkali royal indem,dist,no writ.the senns do not allege that any of the pollution incidents resulted in a quick or sudden release of damaging pollutants,and therefore,it is impossible to discern from the complaint alone if the sudden requirement is satisfied.as the complaint does not contain sufficient facts to enable the court to determine if coverage exists,it is proper to look to extrinsic evidence to determine whether the senns claims were potentially covered by the policy.western heritage,at.
naico argues the senns alleged that the spills repeatedly occurred in plaintiffs operations and that primrose president testified that all the spills of which the senns complain are the typical type of spills that you would expect to see in primrose normal operations.naico contends that because of plaintiffs multiple spills over three years,a duty to defend can not be created by microanalyzing the case and finding a single spill that may have been sudden and accidental.guaranty,at.the alleged polluting,concludes naico,was anything but sudden.we disagree.
naico reliance on guaranty national is misplaced.in guaranty national,as here,the pleadings did not assert a sudden and accidental pollution,thus enabling the court to look outside the pleadings to determine if coverage existed.id.at.the underlying plaintiff in guaranty national listed in its answers to interrogatories that there were spills at nineteen of the facilities occurring over a period of approximately forty years.several of the listed spills actually were multiple spills,so that the pollution was the result of over a hundred separate events.id.at.the contamination was attributed to both small and large spills that occurred at dry cleaning facilities as a result of allegedly defective dry cleaning equipment manufactured by the insured.id.the guaranty national court first acknowledged that a single covered claim will suffice to require the insurer to defend the entire case.id.nevertheless,it held that the insured could not create a duty to defend by microanalyzing the case and finding a single spill that may have been sudden and accidental.id.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied on a pollution exclusion in the policy that prevented coverage where the insured has engaged in the deliberate discharge of contaminants in the routine course of business over many years.id.emphasis added internal quotations omitted.because of this exclusion,the fact that the insured may have also experienced isolated spills or minor accidents over the same period is irrelevant.id.citation omitted.such is not the case here where the policy at issue does not have a routine business pollution exclusion.
in addition,the senns fourth amended petition does not allege that the spills at issue occurred only in plaintiffs operations.rather,the senns allege that plaintiffs,i n their operations,have failed to prevent have caused to occur certain spills.emphasis added.plaintiffs here were not engaged in activities involving their deliberate discharge of contaminants in the routine course of business the failure to prevent spills leaves open the possibility,which the jury was certainly entitled to consider,that the alleged spills could been have sudden,quickly released.
moreover,there was testimony elicited at trial revealing that the oil companies flow lines carry their contents under extreme pressure and that when the lines burst,the event occurs suddenly,sometimes resulting in a spray of water as high as forty feet in the air.there was also testimony establishing that the pressure in the tank batteries and flow lines were checked at least daily,therefore,plaintiffs were made aware of any compromise in the production equipment almost immediately.while the breaks causing the leaks and spills were undoubtedly caused by conditions created over a number of years,the policy sudden requirement is satisfied as long as the actual break is sudden and accidental.see pioneer,at rejecting the argument that an incident was not sudden and accidental based on the extended period of time during which corrosion damage to three liquefier tubes developed.this evidence supports the jury finding that at least one of the alleged spills could have potentially occurred suddenly.liberal application of the eight corners rule in favor of plaintiffs,in concert with the deference given to the jury verdict,support a finding that condition b was satisfied.
condition d incidents prior to the policy period 
condition d provides that the injury or damage from a pollution incident must not be caused or contributed to in any degree by any pollution incident that commenced prior to the beginning of the policy period.in their pleadings,the senns lumped plaintiffs together and alleged a wide variety of negligent acts of the two,but did not distinguish which of the two plaintiffs had done what.the senns further alleged that such acts of negligence have produced an indivisible injury to the senns property.
naico argues that the allegation of an indivisible injury is fatal to plaintiffs claims.first,with respect to cada,assuming the injury to be indivisible,naico argues that the damage caused by cada was thus indivisible from that caused by primrose.naico argues,therefore,that because the damages caused by primrose obviously took place prior to naico coverage of cada,this necessarily means that the alleged damage was caused or contributed to by a pollution incident that commenced prior to the beginning of the policy period.the coverage for primrose,according the naico,fails for the same reason.the senns do not distinguish between damages caused by primrose before naico coverage began for primrose and after the coverage began.because the acts of negligence caused indivisible damage,naico contends,the damages occurring after naico coverage of primrose are also necessarily caused or contributed to by pollution incidents prior to the beginning policy.
we find naico argument unpersuasive.naico fails to distinguish among the alleged negligent acts,the resulting pollution incidents,and the injury arising from the pollution incidents.the allegations state that the acts of negligence have produced an indivisible injury,not that the negligent acts or the pollution incidents themselves are indivisible.emphasis added.the allegation of an indivisible injury does not compel the conclusion that a pollution incident caused by either primrose or cada during naico coverage was necessarily caused,or contributed to,by a pollution incident attributed to a negligent act of primrose prior to naico coverage.from the allegations alone,it is fully possible that a pollution incident caused entirely by primrose during naico coverage resulted in an injury that is now completely indivisible from an injury resulting entirely from a pollution incident caused by cada 
because the senns do not specifically allege when the pollution incidents occurred,it is impossible to determine from the pleadings alone whether any pollution incident occurred during naico coverage of primrose this court,therefore,may look to extrinsic evidence to answer this question.western heritage,at.as the parties have stipulated that some spills occurred after april,when naico coverage of primrose began,and because naico does not contend there were no pollution incidents that occurred during its coverage of primrose,the allegations represent claims that are potentially covered by naico policy.enserch,at concluding that i f any allegation in the complaint is even potentially covered by the policy then the insurer has a duty to defend its insured emphasis added.because plaintiffs have established coverage during all relevant time periods,they have accordingly satisfied the requirements for condition 
condition f failure to comply with laws.
condition f states that the pollution incident must not result from or must not be contributed by the insured failure to comply with any government statute,rule,regulation,or order.naico claims that because the senns state in the introduction to their allegations that the laws of texas mandate that any spill be cleaned up,and that because the failure to clean up the spills resulted in the continued migration of the pollutants,the alleged pollution incidents are necessarily contributed to by plaintiffs failure to comply with texas laws.
naico argument is meritless.the senns negligence allegations are completely independent of any allegation of statutory or regulatory senns alleged that plaintiffs committed several acts of negligence,none of which involved a duty based on any statute or regulation further,because c ompliance with industry and statutory standards is evidence of the use of reasonable care,but it is not dispositive of that issue,the senns may prevail on their negligence claims even if plaintiffs are found not to have violated any law at all.see morris jtm materials,worth,pet.filed.
saline endorsement 
naico argues that the saline endorsement,as part of the entire cgl policy,is subject to both the pollution exclusion and the pollution endorsement.plaintiffs contend that because they purchased the saline endorsement,naico duty to defend is triggered when the senns specifically alleged that plaintiffs polluted their ranch through the releases of saltwater.because we have determined,as discussed supra,that all six conditions of the pollution endorsement have been satisfied,the pollution endorsement can not have a limiting effect on the saline endorsement creation of coverage for the senns allegations relating to saltwater contamination.nevertheless,we further conclude that the saline endorsement is not conditioned either on the pollution exclusion or the pollution endorsement.
under texas law,an insurance policy must be considered as a whole,and each part given effect and meaning.valmont energy steel,commercial union ins,cir.further,under texas law a n endorsement can not be read apart from the main policy,and the added provisions will supersede the previous policy terms to the extent they are truly in conflict.texas,star indem,d.
the cgl base policy excludes coverage for injuries and damages caused by the release of pollutants.pollutants are defined as any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.waste includes materials to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.saline substances,however,are not included in the pollution exclusion definition of pollutants.the pollution endorsement defines pollutants in exactly the same terms as the pollution exclusion,except that the pollution endorsement explicitly adds saline substances as being a covered pollutant.
interpreting the insurance policy as a whole,including the two endorsements,the intent of the parties was to have the cgl base policy bar coverage for a claim involving any pollutant,as that term was defined in the pollution exclusion clause to have the pollution endorsement offer coverage for pollution incidents,including those involving saline substances,subject to the six listed conditions and to have the saline endorsement increase the amount of plaintiffs coverage for damages caused by saline substances,while also expressly defining property damage covered under this endorsement as including property damage caused directly or indirectly by a saline substance.
naico asserts that the saline endorsement was limited by the six conditions found in the pollution endorsement,and therefore argues that plaintiffs must satisfy those conditions before enjoying the benefits of the saline endorsement.we first note the language of the saline endorsement,which provides that t his endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following commercial general liability coverage form.there is no mention anywhere in the policy that the saline endorsement is modified or conditioned on the pollution endorsement.also,it follows that because plaintiffs paid two separate premiums for two separate coverages,one endorsement can not be read to be dependent on the other.either endorsement could have been purchased separately,as there was no requirement that an insured was compelled to purchase both together.moreover,if there were any confusion as to the applicability of these endorsements to plaintiffs request for a defense in the underlying senns litigation,it is important to note that naico wrote plaintiffs policies.if it had wanted to,naico could have drafted the endorsements in a manner so as to make the saline endorsement subject to the conditions found in the pollution endorsement.by not doing so,naico can not now read such a condition precedent into the policies.
naico also suggests that the saline endorsement operated only to increase the amount of coverage to million,not provide for additional covered events,property damage resulting from saltwater contamination.if we were to accept naico argument here,the million coverage limit would render the entire saline endorsement meaningless because essentially everything covered by the endorsement would necessarily be excluded by the pollution exclusion clause.we see no reason why plaintiffs would elect to purchase an endorsement that increased the amount payable to them on a coverage claim,but failed to provide a basis upon which they could make such a claim.
ii.damages sustained by primrose for hiring extra counsel 
having determined that naico had a duty to defend plaintiffs,we next address the propriety of the damages awarded primrose for its hiring of the cotton bledsoe firm.the jury awarded primrose in amount of the attorney fees charged by the cotton bledsoe firm.naico contends that primrose did not sustain any damages because primrose received a defense from its other insurers through the shafer firm.naico argues that it was unnecessary for primrose to hire the cotton bledsoe firm to ensure an adequate defense against the senns claims.
on the issue of whether damages should be awarded at all,this court treads lightly upon jury verdicts,as the standard of review is very deferential.vogler blackmore,cir.absent an error of law,this court will sustain the amount of damages awarded by the fact finder,unless the amount is clearly erroneous or so gross or inadequate as to be contrary to right reason.id.thus,reversal is proper only if no reasonable jury could have arrived at the verdict.id.
the potential error of law focuses on whether the award of damages for primrose retention of the cotton bledsoe firm exceeded the scope of naico duty to defend.when an insurer has a duty to defend,even where a claim falls partially within and partially outside of a coverage period,the insurer duty is to provide its insured with a complete defense.prop.and cas.ins.guar.ass aggregates,southwest aggregates,no pet.emphasis added.a breach of the duty to defend entitles the insured to the expenses it incurred in defending the suit,including reasonable attorney fees and court costs.willcox am.home assurance,emphasis added see also.united ins.burt ford,no writ.to find an error of law with respect to the scope of the duty to defend,this court is faced with determining whether the duty to provide a complete defense is necessarily satisfied when other insurers provide one law firm to defend the insured or whether the cost of hiring an additional firm is unreasonable as a matter of law.naico does not provide this court with any authority to suggest that either is the case whether any one firm in a particular case would constitute a complete defense is a question,not a matter of law.see satterwhite safeco land title,worth,writ denied r easonable attorneys fees is a question of fact for the jury.
naico contends that primrose is not entitled to recover any damages as a result of naico refusal to provide a defense in the underlying senns suit because primrose actually received from its other insurance carriers the very defense primrose expected to receive from naico.naico also suggests that primrose never criticized or called into question the competency of kathleen mcculloch,the shafer firm lead counsel,in defending it in the underlying case.
primrose responds that its concern was not with mcculloch quality of representation,but rather with the uninsured exposure with which primrose was faced.according to testimony elicited at trial,primrose president indicated that he chose to retain additional counsel,the cotton bledsoe firm,because of several factors,including,inter alia,the major oil companies that were defendants in the underlying suit had been dismissed,leaving primrose as the target defendant primrose was facing demands in excess of its limits with chubb and primrose was essentially left uninsured for any pollution incident that occurred subsequent to april,the time period during which naico insured primrose the senns were alleging damages that occurred subsequent to april,and primrose was being defended by chubb and under a reservation of rights and primrose realized that either carrier could withdraw its defense at any time.primrose president also testified that if naico had agreed to provide a defense,he would have had the assurance that naico would stand behind its policy of insurance,indicating that it was naico ultimate refusal to share in the exposure to liability,not the sharing of expenses,that triggered primrose decision to retain the cotton bledsoe firm 
in sum,the evidence presented by primrose establishes that while the shafer firm may have provided an adequate defense,a reasonable jury could nevertheless have found that the cotton bledsoe firm was necessary to ensure that primrose received a complete defense against the finding that is neither clearly erroneous nor so gross as to be contrary to right reason.
iii.chris boyer testimony as an expert 
at trial,chris boyer testified as to the reasonableness of the attorney fees charged plaintiffs by the two law firms retained independently of any cotton bledsoe firm for primrose and the ackels firm for cada.boyer was the only witness to testify as to the reasonableness of these fees.naico argues that the district court erred in two respects boyer should not have been allowed to testify as an expert because he lacked the necessary factual foundation for his opinions and the district court should have excluded boyer testimony because plaintiffs did not provide a required written report about boyer,they did not properly respond to naico discovery requests regarding boyer testimony,and because boyer relied on previously undisclosed information and documents in forming his opinion as to the reasonableness of the attorneys fees.
this court reviews the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.vogler,at.the discretion of the district judge and their ultimate decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless manifestly erroneous.united states tucker,cir.if it is found that the district court abused its discretion in denying the admission of expert evidence,this court must then consider whether the error was harmless,affirming the judgment unless the ruling affected a substantial right of the complaining party.id.
with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony,the district court is to ensure that an expert testimony rests upon a reliable foundation.guillory domtar indus,cir.naico argues that boyer testimony lacked the proper foundation to qualify as expert testimony.naico contends that boyer could not give his opinion about the reasonableness of the fees charged by the cotton bledsoe firm because he did not know to what extent those fees were duplicative of the work performed by the shafer firm.with regard to cada and its additional counsel,naico contends that the general descriptions of the work performed by the ackels firm were insufficient for boyer to express any expert opinion as to the reasonableness of the work completed or the charged fees.
federal rule of evidence provides for the admissibility of an expert opinion if the sources underlying that opinion are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.boyer was provided with complete copies of the bills from both the cotton bledsoe firm and the ackels firm,which contained the hourly rates charged and the total number of hours worked by each firm.because trial courts are considered experts as to the reasonableness of attorney fees,the district court was properly qualified to conclude that the information upon which boyer relied was of a type reasonably relied on by such expert witnesses.in re tmt trailer ferry,cir a ppellate courts,as trial courts,are themselves experts as to the reasonableness of attorneys fees citation omitted.
further,the problems naico cites with boyer testimony go to the weight of the evidence,not to its admissibility.while boyer admittedly did not review the bills of the shafer firm in determining the reasonableness of the fees charged by the cotton bledsoe firm,the jury was also presented with the testimony of mcculloch,who described how she and strange worked on separate facets of the case in an effort to avoid double billing,while also providing primrose the best defense that mcculloch and strange possibly could.in addition,although the descriptions in the ackels firm bills were general in nature,this contention merely weakens,to some extent,boyer testimony.nevertheless,a s a general rule,questions relating to the bases and sources of an expert opinion affect the weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its admissibility and should be left for the jury consideration.united states acres of land,more or less situated in leflore county,cir emphasis added internal quotations and citations omitted.it is the role of the adversarial system,not the court,to highlight weak evidence

moreover,the fair and reasonable compensation for the professional services of a lawyer can certainly be ascertained by the opinion of members of the bar who have become familiar through experience and practice with the character of such services.boyer,who has been a practicing attorney since,is certified by the texas board of legal specialization in the oil and gas industry and was a participating attorney in the underlying senns suit it is clear that boyer was qualified to give his opinion regarding the value of the services rendered,both from his own general knowledge in the practice area,as well as from his personal experience relating to the nature and extent of the services rendered in this particular litigation.
naico also claims that boyer testimony should have been excluded because plaintiffs did not comply with the disclosure rules in.a,which govern the disclosure of information relating to an expert witness.under rule,a party must disclose expert witnesses who may testify at trial.a a.the disclosure must be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness.id.a b.rule provides that a party who fails to disclose information required by rule a is not permitted to use the information as evidence at a trial,unless such failure is harmless.id.c.

plaintiffs concede that they failed to provide a written report to naico regarding boyer expert testimony.they do point out,however,that they did notify naico in a letter dated november,and again in the disclosure,that boyer would be an expert witness on the reasonableness of the attorney fees in question.the content of the letter disclosure included the following

as plaintiffs failed to provide required information regarding boyer expert testimony,the sole issue before us is whether such failure was harmless to naico.in performing a rule c harmless error analysis to determine whether the district court properly exercised its discretion in allowing boyer testimony,this court looks to four factors the importance of the evidence the prejudice to the opposing party of including the evidence the possibility of curing such prejudice by granting a continuance and the explanation for the party failure to disclose.research,at.
the focus of our inquiry is whether naico was prejudiced by plaintiffs failure to comply with discovery rules requiring the disclosure of information about boyer and the testimony he was to provide at trial.plaintiffs notified naico almost six months before trial that they intended to call boyer as an expert witness.plaintiffs also revealed to naico the nature of the testimony boyer was going to provide.naico also received copies of all the billing invoices upon which boyer was to rely for his testimony.moreover,boyer ultimate calculations merely involved dividing the total fees charged by the additional firms by the total hours worked.naico,which had previously received the bills,certainly could have performed the same calculations.naico knew,or should have known,that boyer was going to testify as to the reasonableness of the attorney fees incurred by primrose and that boyer was basing his opinion primarily on a review of the bills of the cotton bledsoe and ackels firms.naico,therefore,was not prejudiced by boyer testimony,and thus plaintiffs failure to disclose information about boyer amounts to harmless error.
as such,the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing boyer to offer expert testimony as to the reasonableness of the attorney fees,and thus the corresponding amount of damages awarded by the jury was proper.
iv.calculation of prejudgment interest 
naico argues that the district court erred in assessing prejudgment interest.naico contends that the district court improperly calculated the interest by basing the date of the alleged breach of naico refused to defend the accrual date even though plaintiffs,at that time,had not incurred any damages in the form of attorney fees.naico asserts that the prejudgment interest for damages incurred by plaintiffs should be calculated from the time plaintiffs actually paid each bill for attorney fees.
