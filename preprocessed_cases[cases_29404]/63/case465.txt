on october,northwest pipeline corporation northwest filed for a general rate increase under of the natural gas act,to cover costs associated with a previously authorized expansion of its natural gas pipeline facilities.the federal energy regulatory commission rejected certain proposed tariffs,accepted and suspended other proposed tariffs subject to refund,and set an evidentiary hearing.almost a decade later,in two different consolidated cases,petitioners are seeking review of the relevant rate increase,which because of later filings by northwest was in effect only from april,through october.
one of the cases involves issues that were resolved before we remanded to the commission to consider the effect of a commission policy change,the other involves issues resolved in the course of that remand.the first,and concerns five orders,the last of which issued in the next year,in another proceeding,the commission shifted positions on an important issue relating to the equity rate of return.see transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc at,order on reh g,ferc,aff sub nom.north carolina utilities comm ferc,unpublished opinion.because of that shift,we remanded another case to the commission for consideration of its possible effect.williston basin interstate pipeline ferc.the commission then sought a remand in this case,which we granted.
the later consolidated case,et,involves the five orders issued after the remand on july,the commission promulgated the first such order,finding that northwest was entitled to a of the short and growth rates in the equity return calculation.ferc initial post remand order.the commission ordered northwest to file a recalculation of its rates,a plan to impose surcharges to recover excess refunds under the previous rates,and pro forma tariff sheets that established the appropriate surcharges.id.at.the commission denied requests for rehearing.ferc initial post remand order on rehearing.northwest filed its tariff sheets in august,using for its rate of equity return the median rate of the proxy group.on february,the commission rejected northwest compliance filing because it used the wrong growth rate,but approved its use of the median return on equity,stating that current commission policy required the commission to select the median of the range of reasonable returns on equity instead of the midpoint that had been used earlier in the proceeding.ferc at median rate order.the parties then agreed to a growth rate.the commission denied rehearing on the median rate issue.ferc median rate order on rehearing.
two parties,northwest natural gas company northwest natural,a buyer of northwest gas,and the canadian association of petroleum producers capp,a representative of buyers,assert a variety of errors in the commission decisions.we review the commission determinations under the administrative procedure act arbitrary and capricious standard.see missouri public service comm ferc,a.we dismiss one claim for want of jurisdiction,we reverse and remand with respect to another claim,and we affirm on the remaining issues.all of the petitioners claims not addressed here have been considered and rejected.
the just and reasonable rates calculated by the commission under a are typically based on a pipeline costs.because several of the issues here revolve around one component,the cost of equity capital,we pause briefly to explain it.each year that a durable utility asset is in use imposes on the utility the annual cost of the capital used for its construction net of amounts already recovered in depreciation charges.in order to attract capital,a utility must offer a expected rate of return sufficient to attract investors.this return to investors is the cost to the utility of raising capital.for the portion of capital acquired through bonds,the cost is comparatively easy to interest the company must pay its bondholders.common equity is more complicated,for equity investors do not have a legally fixed return.to calculate the rate of return necessary to attract them,the commission measures the return enjoyed by the company equity investors by the discounted cash flow dcf model,which assumes that a stock price is equal to the present value of the infinite stream of expected dividends discounted at a market rate commensurate with the stock risk.with simplifying assumptions,this can be summarized by the formula 
where p is the price of the stock at the relevant time,d is the dividend to be paid at the end of the first year,r is the rate of return and g is the expected growth rate of the firm.see illinois bell telephone fcc,see also lawrence kolbe et,the cost of capital estimating the rate of return for public utilities.since r is what the commission is seeking,the equation is rearranged to the form 
illinois bell,at.
for a company that is not publicly traded,figures for p and d will be missing,and the commission has recourse to calculating the implicit rate of return on companies that are comparable or at least companies whose business is predominately the operation of natural gas pipelines and publicly traded.these companies are called the proxy group.the commission then makes adjustments for specific characteristics of the company whose rates are in question.here,one of the issues involves a contention that northwest business risk was comparatively low so that,petitioners argue,the commission should have chosen a rate at the low end of those of the proxy group.another issue involves calculation of the expected growth rates for the proxy group.and a third,assuming that northwest belongs in the middle of the proxy group,involves how to pick a number best representing the middle.
inclusion of costs in rate base 
in its expansion project northwest added considerable mainline pipeline and compressor facilities and services.its original filing included million in project costs but it ultimately persuaded the commission to include about million more.because of decisions adverse to northwest on other issues,the rates approved were lower than those for which it had originally filed.see ferc at opinion,reversed in part and remanded,ferc at opinion.
northwest natural claims that northwest should not be permitted to incorporate into its rate base costs that were not included in its original filing.its position is that even if consideration of those costs was proper,the commission should have reopened proceedings to consider its claim that about million in costs was not actually paid within the test period twelve consecutive months used,with adjustments,in estimating a pipeline costs and should have been excluded.
on the first claim,northwest natural argues that an earlier commission decision,natural gas pipeline of america,fpc,governs how the commission must deal with cost figures that differ from those of the initial filing.it places special reliance on a phrase of that decision saying that the regulations bind natural to its as submitted.id.at.the phrase is indeed there,but the commission went on to make clear that there was no flat rule against new data instead it performed a contextual analysis.there the evidence did not fit the very limited subject of the hearing because of that disjuncture there was a risk that other parties would reasonably assume that the evidence would not be considered and accordingly these parties would lack effective notice and the new cost evidence in fact did not meet the commission requirement that changes in costs after the test period be known and measurable.id.at internal quotation omitted.none of these characteristics was present here.the commission found that because northwest revised costs were disclosed prior to the filing of direct testimony in the hearing before the administrative law judge,that the parties had ample notice of the cost claims,and that such claims,though estimates,were known and measurable.see opinion,ferc at.
in its second claim northwest natural argues that the commission unlawfully refused to reopen proceedings to hear its claim that northwest had not actually paid all of the expansion costs within the test period.the claim has two strikes against it.first,although northwest natural was aware of the change
