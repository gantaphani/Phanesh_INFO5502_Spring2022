background 
the united states instituted price controls for crude oil pursuant to the economic stabilization act of esa,stat.codified at note,and the emergency petroleum allocation act of epaa.no,stat.codified at.see generally texas american oil united states dep t of energy,en banc federal circuit adoption of the precedent of the temporary emergency court of appeals.
section e a of the epaa contained a stripper well exemption that allowed crude oil to be sold at free market prices when it was produced at a property with an average maximum daily production of ten barrels per well during the preceding period.see generally energy reserves group,dep t of energy,detailed history of the stripper well exemption.some operators,in their calculation of average production per well for a specified property,counted the injection wells along with the producing wells.injection wells do not extract oil but are used to inject substances into the underground reservoirs serving the producing wells,in order to aid in the extraction of oil.
in december the federal energy administration fea,the predecessor to doe in administering these statutes,ruled that injection wells can not be included in calculating the average daily production per well,issuing ruling.a group of producing companies,forming the energy reserves group,challenged ruling in the united states district court for the district of kansas.the kansas district court held that ruling was void and unenforceable because it was issued in violation of the rulemaking requirements of the administrative procedure act.the court enjoined the fea from enforcing ruling against the companies that constituted the energy reserves group.energy reserves group,fed.energy.the kansas district court extended the injunction to the benefit of mobil on september,and gulf on june,pending decision of the appeal to the temporary emergency court of appeals,the district court required each of the oil companies to deposit into an escrow account the difference between the actual free market price and the regulated price,for oil whose stripper well character was based on inclusion of injection wells.
the temporary emergency court of appeals ultimately upheld the validity and enforceability of ruling,reversing the rulings of the kansas district court.in re dep t of energy stripper well exemption.in the oil companies and doe entered into a final settlement agreement to resolve the distribution of the escrowed funds.however,doe reserved the right to claim additional recovery if doe determined,upon further audit,that insufficient funds had been deposited into escrow.
meanwhile,in,while doe appeal on the basic question of how to calculate stripper well status was pending,mobil and doe entered into a consent order for the period from september through may.doe had conducted an audit of mobil compliance with crude oil price regulations for the period from september through december,and the findings of this audit were extrapolated forward through may.the consent order stated that it resolved all crude oil sales from its properties for the period covered by this consent order,on payment of million.notice of the consent order was published in the federal register on september,for comment and november,final order.
in doe sued chevron for additional recovery under the esa and the epaa.chevron states that a portion of the claim by doe included the liability of chevron predecessor gulf as operator for overcharges from september through october attributed to mobil working interest in a property operated by gulf at the east waddell ranch in texas.in re dep t of energy stripper well exemption,aff in part.the suit invoked the doctrine of operator liability,which permits the doe,as a matter of administrative convenience,to recover from the operator the full amount of all overcharges for oil from the operated property,even when only the working interest owners,not the operator,received the overpayment.see murfin drilling united states dep t of energy,explaining the operator liability doctrine.during the period september through october,stripper well oil from mobil working interest in the east waddell ranch was sold by mobil to gulf at free market prices,contrary to ruling.neither mobil nor gulf had made deposits into escrow to cover these charges through october gulf began making deposits that included mobil working interest in november.
in chevron settled all of doe claims by payment of a total of.chevron states that in actual overcharges plus interest of this payment was due to the improper characterization of stripper well sales from mobil working interest in the east waddell ranch from september through october.chevron seeks reimbursement from mobil on a theory of operator restitution,described by chevron as an equitable remedy responding to the operator liability doctrine.
the district court held that chevron was not entitled to this recovery because mobil,by its consent order with doe in,resolved all of its compliance matters related to crude oil sold between september,and may.the court ruled that this extinguished any stripper well violations attributable to mobil working interest in the east waddell ranch,and that chevron is not entitled to recovery from mobil for any payment that chevron may have made to doe based on mobil overcharges attributed to its working interest in misdesignated stripper wells.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the issues before the district court were decided on cross motions for summary judgment.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c anderson liberty lobby,d.in evaluating a motion for summary judgment,the evidence of the is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are drawn in favor of the.anderson,at.this standard is not changed when the parties bring for summary judgment,each nonmovant receiving the benefit of favorable inferences.murphy exploration production oryx energy.the grant of summary judgment is subject to plenary review.murfin,at.
depending on the circumstances,an operator who has accounted to doe under the operator liability doctrine may or may not be entitled to contribution from the working interest owners.t he right of contribution depends on the particular facts,and is imposed when justice requires.murphy,at.
the district court held that chevron would not be entitled to contribution for chevron payments to doe attributable to overcharges from mobil working interest if mobil had previously settled its liability for these overcharges in the consent order,and had provided chevron with notice of this settlement.chevron does not challenge this theory as applied to the audited and extrapolated overcharges settled by mobil in.however,chevron argues that the consent order did not and could not include settlement of mobil stripper well liability,for doe was enjoined from enforcing ruling,the consent order was not brought to the kansas district court,and in there was no stripper well liability.mobil responds that chevron should have raised mobil consent order with doe as a defense to the inclusion of mobil working interest overcha
