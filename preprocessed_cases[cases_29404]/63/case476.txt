the trans alaska pipeline system taps is a diameter pipeline carrying crude oil from alaska north slope approximately miles south to valdez,alaska.each shipper delivers its own crude oil to the pipeline,in which the oils are commingled at the terminus the shipper takes delivery of a proportional share of the common stream.the crude oils delivered initially differ from each other in various characteristics that affect market value.because of the commingling,a shipper will not in all likelihood receive the same quality of oil at valdez that it delivered to the pipeline.without some adjustment,the ones delivering relatively crudes would unfairly lose,and the ones delivering crudes would unfairly gain.the parties here battle over the formula governing the adjustment,which the federal energy regulatory commission controls in the exercise of its authority to regulate interstate oil pipeline rates 
exxon company,and tesoro alaska petroleum company filed complaints with the federal energy regulatory commission assailing aspects of the prevailing formula.exxon challenges the formula itself,a distillation methodology that the commission adopted in and later modified in tesoro contests the specific valuation of two cuts of petroleum,west coast naphtha and west coast vacuum gas oil vgo.a rate order must be modified where new evidence warrants the change.tagg moorhead united states.both exxon and tesoro appear to have offered evidence that is new in relation to what was before the commission in its earlier determinations and sufficiently compelling to require reconsideration of the earlier resolution.we therefore reverse and remand the case for the commission to reconsider the adoption of the distillation methodology and the pricing of west coast naphtha and west coast vgo,or to provide a suitable explanation for why it should not.
in the commission approved a settlement agreement establishing a quality bank to make the required adjustments between shippers.see trans alaska pipeline system,ferc the quality bank initially used a gravity method.as the term gravity is used here,it is a measure of density established by the american petroleum institute api.in contrast to specific gravity,a higher api gravity represents a less dense crude oil or petroleum product.see exxon,ferc.because crude oil was generally more valuable to the extent that it was higher gravity,lighter,the quality bank initially valued crude oils according to their gravity.
starting in,the amount of natural gas liquids ngls in the stream increased,changing the at least the perception.two factors contributed to this increase.first,natural gas operations expanded in prudhoe bay,resulting in sharply increased deliveries of ngls at the head of the pipeline.oxy usa,ferc,see also exxon,amerada hess pipeline,ferc at exxon decision.second,expansion of one refinery and construction of another along the route led to an increase in removal of valuable petroleum products from the stream,apparently leaving a higher proportion of the lighter ngls in the petroleum at the end of the pipeline.oxy,at see also ferc,at.ngls have a much higher api gravity relative to other petroleum components,but critics of the gravity method argue that ngls reduce rather than raise the value of the common stream.see oxy,at.
responding to the resulting complaints under of the interstate commerce act,the commission in started to investigate the gravity method.it found that the method was no longer just and reasonable and,in approving a contested settlement in,adopted the distillation method.see ferc distillation decision,order on reh g,ferc,further order on reh g,ferc.this latest method recognizes eight cuts of petroleum products propane,isobutane,normal butane,natural gasoline,naphtha,distillate,vgo and resid in each stream entering taps,ranked by their boiling points.the cuts are individually priced.each shipper delivery is categorized under this system and valued in accordance with the price of its component cuts.because alaskan north slope ans oil is sold in both the gulf coast and west coast markets,each cut is assigned gulf coast and west coast prices.distillation decision,ferc at.
for some cuts there were acceptable indicators of market value from the oil price information service opis or platt oilgram.no such markers were available,however,for distillate,vgo or resid,or for west coast naphtha.for these cuts the settlement proposed to use prices for kindred products,adjusted for differences between them and the actual cuts.the commission rejected this approach,saying that for a system to be it must use market prices,uncomplicated by subjective adjustments.id.at.as part of this no adjustment policy,the commission rejected the proposed use of adjusted west coast prices to value the west coast naphtha cut and instead set a gulf coast price for the cut.on rehearing,it also ordered the use of gulf coast prices for west coast deliveries of vgo.tesoro alaska petroleum amerada hess pipeline,ferc at tesoro decision.in oxy we affirmed the switch from the gravity to the distillation method but remanded to the commission its refusal to adjust the reference prices for the distillate and resid cuts.at.in due course the commission approved a settlement on these issues,providing for some redefinition of cuts and for use for several of the cuts of petroleum product prices adjusted to reflect processing costs.see ferc,at.on review,we rejected the revised valuation of the resid cut and again remanded.exxon,at.
in,while the oxy remand was under way,exxon filed a complaint against seven taps owners pursuant to,and of the interstate commerce act,leading to the present case.upholding an alj decision,the commission dismissed the complaint,holding that exxon had failed to produce evidence of changed circumstances to justify of the adoption of the distillation method.exxon decision,ferc at.
tesoro participated in the proceedings before the alj on exxon complaint,raising issues that the alj ultimately identified as different from exxon.the alj order of dismissal mooted tesoro arguments but noted that tesoro was free to file its own complaint.exxon,amerada hess pipeline,ferc,at.it did so in august,attacking the valuation of the naphtha and vgo cuts.the commission dismissed this,also on a finding of no changed circumstances.tesoro decision,ferc at.
petitioners argue that because their complaints were disposed of by motion for summary disposition,our review is de novo.that would be true if we were reviewing a district court equivalent action.but these dismissals implicate the commission expertise and authority,compelling deference.motor vehicle manufacturers ass of the united states state farm mutual auto.ins,d.the requisite deference does not,however,mean passive acceptance of irrational or unexplained decision making.see also louisiana public service comm ferc.here we find the commission answers to the evidence unconvincing.
in tagg moorhead united states,the supreme court held that a rate order is not res judicata.id.at.specifically,where a party presents new evidence that warrants the change,the regulatory agency has the power and duty to institute new proceedings.id.just as a plaintiff may allege a new cause of action for every time a conspiracy in restraint of trade operates against him,see stanton district of columbia court of appeals,so each new shipment by a carrier gives rise to a new cause of action,as to which a previous adverse determination is not res judicata,interoceanica sound pilots,cir hawaiian telephone public utilities comm of hawaii,cir.issue preclusion might nonetheless be applicable,but tagg suggests that any such application is quite weak.
the commission acknowledges the authority of tagg,but reframes justice brandeis for new evidence into one requiring evidence of changed circumstances.it is unclear if any such limit may be imposed.in oxy itself we observed,t he fact that a rate was once found reasonable does not preclude a finding of unreasonableness in a subsequent proceeding.at internal quotation omitted.see also texas eastern transmission ferc,cir.in oxy,as we noted,there were changed increased proportion of ngls in the common stream,and in texas eastern there was an issue that the prior determination had not confronted the consistency of minimum commodity bills with cost allocation based on the modified fixed variable approach,at.in rate cases that look toward the setting of a future rate as this does,having been brought under of the interstate commerce act,unacceptable competitive distortions could occur if one shipper were perpetually locked into a rate less advantageous than the one enjoyed by a competitor.the supreme court has emphasized this concern in the tax context 
a subsequent modification of the significant facts or a change or development in the controlling legal principles may make that judicial determination obsolete or erroneous,at least for future purposes.if such a determination is then perpetuated each succeeding year as to the taxpayer involved in the original litigation,he is accorded a tax treatment different from that given to other taxpayers of the same class.
commissioner of internal revenue sunnen.accordingly,we have upheld the denial of issue preclusion where the commission had initially rejected a requested rate on grounds of difficulties in tracing costs of service,but in a later proceeding the utility offered a solution.second taxing dist.of norwalk ferc.the new solution was perhaps a changed circumstance,but it was one under the control of the utility and thus seems somewhat akin to new evidence.in any event,because the outcome of our decision here does not turn on the distinction between evidence of changed circumstances and evidence that is merely new,we need not decide whether there is any reason to retreat from the language of justice brandeis.
exxon provided the testimony of pavlovic,an economic consultant,who tested the accuracy of the modified distillation methodology for crude oils in the california crude oil market from to.pavlovic used regression analysis to compare the relative values of the cuts produced by the distillation method with actual market prices.he claimed his tests showed that the distillation method substantially,heavier petroleum and substantially undervalues,lighter petroleum.joint appendix at.he also testified that this bias increase d dramatically in and remain ed large thereafter.id.at.a perfect pricing method would produce a coefficient of in a regression of the method relative values on those of the benchmark market.whereas the called a bias indeed just over for,it jumped in to and remained around for the next two years.id.at.pavlovic argued that he could reject,at a statistically significant level,the hypothesis that the bias measure was in id.at.
pavlovic testimony appears to constitute not only new evidence but changed circumstances as well.it shows that,for reasons not yet conclusively determined,the degree of bias resulting from the use of the distillation method rose from imperceptible to severe after.the commission it consistently has refused to base its decisions on how the taps quality bank should operate based on regression analyses of west coast or world crude values,exxon decision,ferc at us.the commission can not be saying that regression analysis,good enough to be a valuable tool for everyone else interested in quantitative analysis,is never good enough for the commission.
the intervenors offer an explanation that may be part of what the commission in fact had in mind pavlovic analysis was like testing a methodology designed to value alaskan apples by applying that methodology to a crate of california oranges.intervenors bp exploration alaska,et br.at intervenors br.this glib use of the old metaphor overlooks the problem confronting the commission there simply are no market prices for the alaskan crude oils delivered into taps.if there were,there would be little or no issue about inferring their relative values.to the extent that the california crudes are similar to the alaskan crudes,pavlovic technique seems to test the accuracy of the distillation method.compare at.
exxon also provided the testimony of moore,an engineer,and hausman,an applied economist.moore stressed that the gravity of ans crude oil consisting of the streams that enter at the start of the pipeline at pumping station and the return stream from refineries along its path had increased from about api in to about api in.id.at.in the face of the theory that gravity increases due to ngl blending had undermined the gravity formula,moore tracks the seemingly close positive relationship between the fraction of ngls and gravity of this crude oil,and,critically,between the gravity and price of ans crude measured against west texas intermediate,a marker crude used as a reference for valuing other crudes.id.at.
exxon invokes the testimony of moore not only to suggest that the premise of the abandonment of gravity was mistaken,but also to explain why one should expect occurrence of the sort of distortions that pavlovic seemingly showed in the distillation method.although there is an obvious link between crude oil values and petroleum product prices,they do not move in lockstep.the same event may drive the prices of the two in different directions.if a refinery shuts down because of equipment problems,for instance,it is likely to raise the market price of the refined petroleum product,but may reduce demand for crude oil and lower its price.see id.at.
hausman testified that regression results on price and gravity data from to showed that gravity was a significantly positive predictor of the price of ans crude.id.at.this evidence seems to show a positive correlation between ngl blending,gravity,and value.petitioners rely on the moore and hausman testimony to suggest that the distillation method seriously undervalues the ngl contribution to the taps stream.aspects of hausman testimony might pose questions about the line between evidence that is new and evidence of changed circumstances.after all,hausman claims that his regression results apply to the entire period of his to that the data also show the positive effect of gravity on ans value.overall,however,it certainly confirms the implication of the pavlovic and moore testimony that the distillation method is seriously flawed.
to dismiss the testimony of moore and hausman,the commission decision invoked our deference in oxy to the alj conclusion that the current straightline gravity basis for valuing crude oil does not assign an accurate value for ngls,and our statement,it follows from this conclusion that shippers delivering oil with a high ngl content were either being overcompensated or undercompensated under the gravity methodology at cited by the commission,exxon decision,ferc at.but these remarks were plainly not intended to suggest indifference to the impact of ngl contributions to the value of the common stream.quite the reverse we were endorsing the alj point that the issue was not whether the gravity methodology accurately valued ngls per se,but whether it placed a proper value on petroleum whose gravity had been increased as a result of the injection of substantial quantities of ngls.at.that issue is precisely what exxon testimony speaks to,seemingly calling into question the commission determinations.
tesoro challenges the current pricing of the naphtha and vgo cuts based on gulf coast market prices under the modified distillation method.tesoro wants the quality bank to value west coast naphtha using a formula based on west coast gasoline prices and west coast vgo using opis quoted price for west coast high sulfur vgo.
tesoro argues that the commission use of the published gulf coast price,rather than a formula based on west coast gasoline prices,significantly undervalues west coast naphtha its claim is based on three propositions.first,tesoro presents evidence,and the intervenors acknowledge,that gulf coast deliveries of ans crude have declined considerably from the somewhat less than level that existed in.intervenors br.at see also distillation decision,ferc at.the nearly complete disappearance of gulf coast ans sales suggests that the commission current reliance is more dubious now than in.
second,the commission has changed its outlook on the use of adjus
