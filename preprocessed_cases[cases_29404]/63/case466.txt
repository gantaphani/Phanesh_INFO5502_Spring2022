petitioner dominion resources,is the surviving parent corporation in a merger of two already quite diverse companies,one dominion primarily an electric power company,the other consolidated natural gas company cng a natural gas pipeline with upstream and downstream affiliates.the parties refer to this type of merger as a convergence merger.dominion here challenges the federal energy regulatory commission may compliance order requiring the pipeline subsidiary to observe ferc standards of conduct,in dealing with all of its energy affiliates in the entity.see dominion resources,consolidated natural gas,ferc,wl compliance order.dominion contends that the compliance order was far broader than the order on which it purportedly rested,see dominion resources,consolidated natural gas,ferc,wl merger order,destroyed integrations that existed before the merger,and was thus arbitrary and capricious.we agree with dominion and therefore vacate and remand.
in june dominion and cng sought commission authorization for their merger.see.dominion was a holding company with predominantly electric utility interests,specifically 
virginia electric and power company,an electric transmission and distribution subsidiary and 
dominion energy,a multifaceted firm active in 
power generation and power marketing,and 
oil and gas development and exploration.
cng,in contrast,was a holding company with predominantly gas utility interests 
cng transmission cngt,a gas pipeline 
cng retail services and cng power services,both power marketers 
various gas local distribution companies and 
cng producing,a gas exploration and production firm.
before the merger,cng also owned virginia natural gas,a local distribution company,but it divested that company pursuant to a consent order with the federal trade commission.merger order,ferc at see dominion resources,consolidated natural gas,wl.
the restrictions that the parties dispute come in the context of ferc generic standards of conduct.these limit interactions between gas pipelines and their gas marketing affiliates,with the aim of preventing pipelines from using their monopoly positions to obtain advantages in downstream gas markets,inquiry into alleged anticompetitive practices related to marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines,order,ferc stats.regs.cch order tenneco gas ferc.among other things,they prevent pipelines from disclosing nonpublic information preferentially to their affiliates and from otherwise discriminating against shippers.but the rules appear to apply only to a pipeline relations with its gas marketing affiliates.compare notice of proposed rulemaking,standards of conduct for transmission providers,proposing to apply the standards of conduct more broadly.
the commission saw a similar risk in the onset of convergence pipelines might use their market power in gas to manipulate downstream electric markets,san diego gas electric and enova energy,ferc,wl enova.ferc has thus required the gas segments in some convergence mergers,such as one involving san diego gas electric and enova energy,to adhere to specific codes of conduct that extend the generic standards of conduct to cover gas companies links with affiliates with an electric power merchant function.san diego gas electric and enova energy,ferc,at,wl enova.
in seeking commission approval,dominion and cng proposed a narrower set of applying such a code of conduct between the cng pipeline and affiliates with wholesale power authority as opposed to ones selling at prices at cost by regulation and with whom cng transmission conducts transportation transactions.merger order,ferc at.the commission rejected this version and instead insisted on a code applying to the corporate family as a whole,id.at,though offering the firms the alternative of submitting a new analysis of competitive effects.dominion and cng accepted the condition.but the composition of the corporate family as a whole quickly became a bone of contention.in their acceptance letter dominion and cng read the phrase as they believed the commission had read it in enova,covering communications between the pipeline and all affiliates within the corporate family who engage in the wholesale electric merchant function.letter of carmen gentile,counsel for dominion resources,to david boergers,secretary,federal energy regulatory commission,at,dominion acceptance letter see also code of conduct principles applicable to dominion resources,and consolidated natural gas company,at.the limitation set forth in the letter,of course,was broader than the firms original proposal,since it included electric affiliates regardless of whether they were free to sell at market rates or whether they transacted directly with cngt.
in its may compliance order,the commission rejected dominion interpretation of corporate family.distinguishing enova,the commission held that the merger order required that the standards of conduct be applied to all energy companies that would be affiliated under the proposed transaction.compliance order,ferc at.it directed dominion to modify its proposed code of conduct accordingly.the commission denied dominion motion for rehearing in november,describing dominion arguments as a collateral attack on the merger order.dominion resources,and consolidated natural gas company,ferc,at,wl.dominion filed a petition for review.
operating under the commission order in the meantime,dominion argued that the commission should apply a rule to information received by certain employees.see dominion resources,consolidated natural gas and dominion transmission,ferc,at,wl.this would have enabled staff shared by the pipeline and its affiliated energy companies to receive restricted information without making contemporaneous disclosure so long as the employees in fact did not act as conduits.id.the commission rejected this suggestion,holding that an automatic imputation rule was receipt of information by a shared employee would trigger the strictures under the standards of conduct as extended by the compliance order.see also dominion transmission,ferc,wl denying rehearing and granting clarification.again,dominion petitioned for review.
the commission challenges this court jurisdiction over the petitions for review.see steel company citizens for a better environment,d.the commission argues that the compliance order merely implemented the provisions of its earlier merger order,so that dominion was not aggrieved as required by the federal power act,b,or the natural gas act,b.the commission further notes that insofar as dominion claimed injuries were caused by the merger order,the relevant time limitations for seeking rehearing and review expired long before dominion filed any petitions.see a b establishing limitations period for applications for rehearing and period for obtaining judicial review thereafter a b same.the commission thus characterizes dominion petition as an impermissible collateral attack on the merger order.see,city of nephi ferc.these jurisdictional arguments are essentially one if the compliance order was merely a clarification,then dominion was not aggrieved by it and is indeed engaging in a collateral attack.in contrast,if the compliance order was a modification,then dominion clearly has standing to challenge it.
the answer depends on whether a reasonable firm in dominion position would have perceived a very substantial risk that the merger order meant what the commission now says it meant.anr pipeline ferc,see also b no objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.b same.mere ambiguity in the merger order is not enough to excuse dominion previous failure to challenge it.see icc brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d stating that the remedy for ambiguity is to petition for reconsideration,otherwise time limits would be held hostage to everpresent ambiguities.nor is the reasonableness of dominion interpretation enough.see anr pipeline,at.rather,we ask if the commission interpretation was so obscure that the merger order did not provide sufficient notice to dominion that it inflicted the burden.east texas cooperative ferc,raton gas transmission ferc,see also sam rayburn dam electric cooperative fpc.explaining that the rule prevents agencies from enter ing an ambiguous or obscure order,wilfully or otherwise,wait ing out the required time,then enter ing an explanatory order that would extinguish the review rights of parties prejudicially affected.a party need not approach every commission order with paranoia,petitioning for rehearing on account of any conceivable adverse meaning.anr pipeline,at.
here we find that the commission did not give the required notice.dominion had little reason to believe that the commission would interpret the merger order so sweepingly as to encompass all energy affiliates.in fact,the merger order language and context overwhelmingly suggested that dominion interpretation was correct.the order discussed the comments of only two intervenors,the new york public service commission and allegheny energy,and both sought to impose the standards of conduct only on links between the pipeline and all electric affiliates,not energy affiliates generally.merger order,ferc at the new york commission asserts that the commission should require the merged company to adhere to standards of conduct between natural gas pipeline companies and affiliate electric companies id.at allegheny specifically notes that applicants commitment to adopt the pipeline standards of conduct should apply to all affiliates engaged in wholesale sales of electricity.
a scouring of the agency allegheny motion to intervene and its motion for this interpretation.see,motion for clarification and permission to reply,and reply of allegheny energy,dominion resources,and consolidated natural gas company,docket no,at,allegheny motion for clarification expressing concern that cng interstate pipeline and local gas distribution company affiliates may share competitively sensitive information already in their possession with electric affiliates emphasis added id.at asking that electric employees be required to function independently of gas employees motion to intervene and request for conditions of allegheny energy,dominion resources,and consolidated natural gas company,docket no,at,the merger creates increased opportunities and incentives for cng to share this information with the merged company electric affiliates.
recall that dominion and cng had proposed a narrower set of limits to apply simply between the pipeline and a subset of electric affiliates affiliates with wholesale power authority and with whom cng transmission conducts transportation transactions.merger order,ferc at see also allegheny motion for clarification,at.the commission purported to resolve that dispute in favor of the intervenors.if it intended to go beyond a choice between the competing proposals,a sensible reader would expect it to say so and to say why.it did neither.
moreover,the merger order relied far as precedent was concerned,the commission enova decision.in the two pages in which the commission stated and explained its decision,ferc at,it thrice used the phrase,as we stated in enova or its equivalent as we discussed in enova.and the merger order used operative language exactly matching that of the enova decision 
therefore,the applicants would need to revise their commitment so that the standards of conduct requirements apply to the corporate family as a whole.
merger order,ferc at.
therefore,the applicants would need to revise their commitment so that the order restrictions and requirements would be applicable to the corporate family as a whole 
enova,ferc at.obviously the only difference is that in the merger order the phrase corporate family is put in quotes,in apparent homage to enova.yet,in enova,the commission ultimately required that the standards of conduct be applied only to any affiliate in the corporate family with an electric power merchant function.enova,ferc at.
before us the commission relies heavily on some language not including the qualifier electric,such as all the merged company affiliates,any combination of the energy companies that would be affiliated,and corporate family as a whole.id.at.but the context suggests that this language assumed electric as an implicit limitation.for example,the commission rejected applying the standards of conduct to only affiliates because the merged company affiliates with rates could unduly profit from higher electricity prices when market rates are less than rates.id.at emphasis added.indeed,the enova merger order also used vague terms to describe the commission concerns,expressing concern over the potential for abuse between any combination of the energy companies that would be affiliated.enova,ferc at.it is hardly surprising,then,that concurring ferc commissioner hébert unequivocally read the merger order to cover only links to electric affiliates 
this order requires the applicants for a merger to submit a new analysis or to accept standards of conduct applying to all electric affiliates.the applicants offered only those with rates.
merger order,ferc at hébert,comm r,concurring.
the reasonableness of the compliance order interpretation also sheds light on the likelihood that dominion would have anticipated it.here,of course,the jurisdictional question merges somewhat with the merits,for the predictability of a commission position is related to its defensibility.further,if the commission distinction of enova were very powerful,that would operate both to justify the compliance order much more stringent terms and to undermine dominion understanding that the words used in enova would have the same meaning when used in the merger order if the distinction were plain,the reader would have to infer that only a loose analogy was meant.
in fact the compliance order insistence that the standards of conduct be imposed on all energy affiliates,rather than only electric affiliates,represents a sharp and unexplained break with ferc precedent and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious.see anr pipeline ferc,w here an agency departs from established precedent without a reasoned explanation,its decision will be vacated as arbitrary and capricious.
the commission attempts to distinguish enova are rather thin.it principally stresses that the dominion merger involves several separate gas local distribution companies ldcs,whereas the ldcs in the enova merger were part of other entities explicitly covered by the standards of conduct or the code of conduct.compliance order,ferc at.these separate ldcs in the present merger would be subject to neither the generic standards of conduct at,because they are not pipelines,nor of dominion proposed code of conduct,because they are not electric affiliates.the ldcs thus could be used to engage in some of the improper sharing of information and other abuses,failing to offer the same discounts to affiliates and nonaffiliates,and not processing all similar requests for service in the same manner.compliance order,ferc at.
an ldc loophole may very well exist,but it is hardly as large as the commission suggests.the compliance order completely fails to acknowledge that sections and of dominion proposed code of conduct pcc impose restrictions on dominion ldcs that are almost completely analogous to those imposed on pipelines under
