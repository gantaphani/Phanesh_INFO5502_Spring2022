the city of fall river,massachusetts,the attorneys general of the states of massachusetts and rhode island,the conservation law foundation clf,and michael miozza together,appellants seek reversal of the july order of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc granting conditional approval to weaver cove energy wce to site,construct,and operate a proposed liquified natural gas lng terminal and associated pipeline in fall river,massachusetts,as well as the reversal of subsequent orders denying the reopening of the record and rehearing.the facility,which would include a marine berth requiring dredging of the harbor and waterways,including the taunton river,an lng storage tank,regasification facilities,and an lng truck distribution facility,would receive lng from ships for to trucks or for regasification and delivery by pipeline to new england network of natural gas pipelines.
the conditional permit is subject to a number of stipulations,including approval of the vessel transportation plan by the united states coast guard uscg and consistency with the wild and scenic rivers act,as determined by the department of the interior doi.because the uscg and the doi have not completed their respective evaluations of these aspects of the project,we find that it would be premature to address the merits of the appeal.appellants maintain the right to petition ferc,and subsequently seek appeal to this court,if and when these and other relevant agencies have made their final recommendations.
background 
in,ferc,uscg,and the united states department of transportation dot entered into an interagency agreement to coordinate review of proposed lng facilities.under the agreement,ferc is the lead agency in authorizing lng facilities and in preparing a proposed facility environmental impact statement eis which is required by the national environment policy act of nepa,et.generally,authorization is granted as it was in this case on the condition that certain stipulations,environmental and otherwise,are met.
here,the development of the eis began on may,with a preliminary meeting between wce,ferc staff,and key federal and state officials to discuss wce proposal and the accompanying environmental review process.at that time,ferc invited all federal,state,or local agencies with jurisdiction or special expertise to cooperate in preparing the eis,and also invited all interested parties to submit written comments and to attend a public scoping meeting to be conducted jointly by ferc and massachusetts state officials on july.on december,wce formally applied to ferc under the natural gas act of nga,et,requesting authority to site,construct,and operate the proposed lng facility.
during the review process,ferc received voluminous comments from the public,as well as objections from government agencies.as part of this process,ferc commissioner and chairman also hosted a meeting in january,at which fall river mayor,senators edward kennedy and john kerry,congressman james mcgovern,massachusetts representative david sullivan,and mitt romney representative presented their views on the proposal.
based on those comments and the research conducted during the review process,ferc prepared and issued a final eis on may,and conditionally authorized the project on july,the conditional authorization was based on an analysis of the need for the project project alternatives and safety and security considerations 
the conditions imposed on the project authorization include two significant hurdles approval of wce transportation plan by the uscg and the doi finding that the project is consistent with the wild and scenic rivers act neither the uscg nor the doi have completed their respective final evaluations.
since the conditional approval,there have also been two changes in project conditions that could very well affect wce final project approval.first,at the time of conditional approval,the brightman street bridge,which crosses the river leading from the ocean to the planned lng facility site,was scheduled for demolition.however,in late,congress passed legislation forbidding the demolition of the bridge,frustrating wce original plan to use wide vessels to bring lng to the facility.a new,larger brightman street bridge is still scheduled to be built next to the old protected bridge.in an amended proposal,wce informed the uscg that it would use smaller ships that could pass through the foot wide opening of the bridge,thereby increasing the frequency of shipments from the planned fifty to seventy deliveries up to deliveries per year.even with the smaller ships,however,transit through the new and old brightman street bridges would be an extraordinary navigational maneuver leaving no margin for error,according to the coast guard preliminary findings.
second,seven months after ferc approval,doi announced new restrictions that would limit the dredging of the necessary waterways to a few months of the year,likely delaying the completion of the project from to.
on april,clf petitioned ferc to reopen the record to consider the impact of those two developments on the project.ferc denied the motion,finding that there had not been a change in circumstances on which its conditional approval was based,and therefore review was not warranted.ferc explained that it is the uscg duty to review the changed shipment plan in its letter of recommendation,and that there is no change relative to ferc conditional approval unless the uscg review of this matter results in changes to the project that require a change to the plan authorized by ferc ferc did not address the potential impact of the changes in dredging regulations on the project start date.
following ferc order denying the motion to reopen the record,clf requested a rehearing based on the changes to wce navigation plan and potential delays caused by the new dredging constraints.ferc denied clf subsequent rehearing request on july.the explanation accompanying the denial of rehearing was largely the same as the denial to the motion to reopen.ferc added that,in regard to the dredging regulations,there was no new or significantly changed project warranting a rehearing and that the target date for the commencement of service was not a prerequisite for ferc authorization to the project.
the appellants now seek review of the merits of ferc conditional project approval and ferc denial of appellant motion to reopen the record.
ii.discussion 
ferc conditional approval 
at this time,we decline to review the merits of ferc conditional project approval because it is not yet ripe for review.ripeness is a justiciability doctrine that is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass dep t of the interior,d quoting reno catholic soc,d.even in cases raising only prudential concerns,the question of ripeness may be considered on a court own motion.id.at.we now consider the question.
the ripeness doctrine is designed to prevent courts from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies and from improperly interfering in the administrative process.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.in determining whether a case is ripe for review,we must examine both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.at.
