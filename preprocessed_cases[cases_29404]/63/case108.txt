two cases give rise to this appeal.both originated in state court and were removed to federal court under.they were later consolidated.to summarize,and possibly oversimplify,exro,ltda.exro asserted various claims against a variety of individuals and gta,gta.the basic claim was that gta and the individuals violated exro right to litigation proceeds that gta recovered in a suit.gta and the other parties adverse to exro prevailed below through dismissal and summary judgment motions.we conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction,vacate the district court judgments,and remand the case with instructions to remand the case to state court.
gta is a virginia corporation with its principal place of business in virginia exro is a foreign corporation organized under the laws of columbia,south america,where it conducts its business.gta and exro decided to pursue a business venture to produce and market a drag reduction additive dra.the dra is a product gta developed that,as the name suggests,reduces the drag caused by petroleum products moving in pipelines.gta held patents on the technology used to make this product.gta and exro created a virginia limited liability company called exg,exg,through which they would pursue the dra business.exg had two members at its inception,exro and gta,as well as four managers charged with operating the company.two of these managers were exro directors,and the other two were gta directors.
in the exg operating agreement,exro,gta,and exg promised to do certain things.exro promised to arrange funding through outside investors,while gta promised to license the intellectual property associated with the dra.exg promised to pay a licensing fee and royalties for the use of that technology.the operating agreement says that these initial capital contributions were to be contributed as of the effective time of the agreement.exro claims gta contributed a patent license to exg as of the effective time of the agreement,while gta argues its contribution was a promise to give a patent license that was never triggered because exg did not pay the licensing fee and exro did not arrange for funding.
exg never successfully produced or marketed the dra.as it turns out,a competitor in the field,conoco,conoco was infringing on the patented technology and had thereby produced a superior product.the litigation on appeal centers on that infringement.gta successfully sued conoco.the total amount awarded for the infringement was approximately million.exg was not a party to the infringement action.exro,once it learned of the award,demanded that gta pay it half of the proceeds of the conoco litigation.according to exro,exg had an exclusive license to the gta patents,making the infringement award exg.exro,as a member of exg,claimed entitlement to its membership share of the funds.gta refused,dispersed the funds to its shareholders,and this litigation ensued.
as indicated,two different suits have brought about this appeal.the first initially involved arbitration.after exro demanded arbitration of the dispute,gta filed a claim in a virginia state court against exro seeking a declaration that the dispute was not arbitrable.exro removed the case to federal court under and apparently waived arbitration.exro then asserted counterclaims against gta,the two exg managers,and several gta shareholders.as to gta,exro counterclaims centered on exg rights under the patent license that gta allegedly gave exg.the counterclaims made against the individuals were also premised on that license.gta amended its complaint to assert a claim against exro for breaching the exg operating agreement and sought a declaration that gta owed none of the conoco recovery to exro.the district court dismissed the counterclaims exro made against the individuals the two exg managers and the gta shareholders upon those parties motion to dismiss.and it dismissed one of the made against gta upon gta motion for summary judgment.
a second state court suit followed.exro styled this suit as a derivative action,filed on exg behalf,against exg and the individuals dismissed from the previous action.in the derivative action,exro asserted the same claims it had made against those individuals in the gta exro litigation.exro also named john and jane doe defendants who were gta shareholders,asserting various claims against them.the defendants removed the case to federal court.exro moved to remand the case,arguing there was no diversity jurisdiction.the district court did not rule on this motion and consolidated the case with the already pending gta exro litigation.
once consolidated,gta moved for summary judgment on exro counterclaims and for judgment on the pleadings on the claims it made against exro.the individual defendants also moved to dismiss the claims made against them.the district court granted these motions on the merits.
we must first address jurisdiction.standing is a jurisdictional issue we must consider independently,city of dallas,d.
standing does not refer simply to a party capacity to appear in court.rather,standing is gauged by the specific,statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.typically,the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.
int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund,d alterations in original quoting allen wright,d.our jurisdictional inquiry includes both and prudential aspects of standing.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.prudential concerns include the notion that a plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests.hodel irving,d.in a diversity case,we must consult state law to determine the nature of the litigant rights and whether he is entitled to assert the claims he makes.see gallagher cont l ins,cir newdow.at looking to state law.a litigant bringing a diversity action or seeking removal on that basis can have no greater ability to assert legal rights created under state law than it would have in the state forum.we are obligated to construe removal jurisdiction strictly because of the significant federalism concerns implicated.therefore,i f federal jurisdiction is doubtful,a remand to state court is necessary.dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc alterations in original quoting mulcahey columbia organic chems,cir.likewise,it is equally that the parties characterization of themselves or their claims is not determinative for federal jurisdiction purposes.roche lincoln prop,cir.
with regard to the initial suit,gta exro,exro counterclaims are made individually and not,exro seeks recovery on its own behalf.in those counterclaims,exro claimed that gta licensed its patent rights to exg that this license was exclusive and it therefore carried an obligation to turn the proceeds over to the licensee and,thus,gta must share the proceeds it recovered from conoco with exg and therefore exro as a member of exg.
all of exro counterclaims are based on the patent license it says exg license that,if it existed,gave certain rights to exg exro itself has no rights in the patent.a virginia limited liability company,in contrast to a partnership,is an entity separate from its members,and it may acquire property,sue,or be sued.hagan adams prop,ann.the property of such an entity,once acquired,vests in the limited liability company.ann.statutorily,the members of the limited liability company have no right to demand and receive any distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than cash,id,and,under exg operating agreement,n o member has the right to demand and receive property other than cash.because it is exg property that gives rise to exg alleged legal right to the conoco proceeds,the claim exro seeks to assert is exg.exro right to a cash distribution from exg is not directly at issue and is insufficient to give exro standing to assert exg legal rights.and even though exro could in certain circumstances assert exg claim against gta on exg,derivatively under ann.has not done that in its counterclaims.virginia strictly adheres to the rule.see simmons miller,refusing to create an e
