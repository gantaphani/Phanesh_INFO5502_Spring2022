shippers with firm contracts on the portland natural gas transmission system pngts petition for review of two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc certifying pngts capacity.the shippers group contends ferc determination was arbitrary and capricious because ferc failed to take into account the potential economic impact of a reduction in capacity.noting the pipeline historical capacity and an condition imposed by ferc on pngts,the shippers fear that their rates will increase as a result of the reduction.in the challenged orders,however,ferc concluded that any potential impact on rates would be better addressed in pngts subsequent rate case.portland natural gas transmission,june,declaratory order,reh g denied,rehearing order.because the shippers can not show an actual or imminent injury as a result of the challenged orders,they are not aggrieved pursuant to section b of the natural gas act,b.accordingly,the court lacks jurisdiction and the petition for review must be dismissed.
the natural gas act provides that pipelines must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity before they can construct,acquire,or operate interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.c.facilities subject to ferc jurisdiction or services rendered by such facilities may not be abandoned without ferc prior approval,based on a finding that the available supply of natural gas is depleted or that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit abandonment.b see part,subpart a.a pipeline,however,may file a petition for a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty.a.pngts filed such a petition in in view of several orders by ferc addressing the construction of two pipelines.
in the declaratory order now challenged by the shippers group,ferc summarized the background to its decision.in july ferc issued preliminary determinations in two proceedings in which pngts and maritimes northeastern pipeline,llc maritimes sought authorization to construct pipeline facilities in the northeastern united states.declaratory order.because the southern portion of each proposed pipeline would run along essentially the same route,ferc urged the pipelines to consider jointly owning pipeline where their proposed routes converged.id.they did and subsequently they filed an additional application to construct jointly a long,diameter pipeline extending from westbrook,maine,to dracut,massachusetts,as well as various laterals joint facilities.
in july ferc made a preliminary determination,pending favorable environmental review,authorizing pngts to construct and operate an individually owned long,diameter pipeline from the canadian border near pittsburg,new hampshire to westbrook,maine,as well as facilities jointly owned with maritimes from westbrook,maine to wells,maine.at the border,pngts facilities would interconnect with facilities of transquebec maritimes pipeline,tqm.ferc also made a preliminary determination to authorize pngts to provide service using its capacity on the joint facilities from wells,maine and dracut,massachusetts,and to construct and operate the remaining joint facilities from wells,maine to westbrook,maine.ferc found 
in the first year of service,pngts will have a capacity of mcf one thousand cubic feet per day on its mainline and mcf per day on the joint facilities.in subsequent years,the upstream mainline and pngts share of the joint facilities capacity will increase to mcf per day.therefore,pngts must revise its initial rates to reflect billing determinants based on these capacities.
id.quoting portland natural gas transmission,at.the preliminary determination also noted that pngts had not entered into contracts for the full capacity of its system and placed pngts at risk for the recovery of the costs for the unsubscribed capacity.declaratory order.the increased capacity after the first year of service would result from installation of additional compression by tqm on its canadian facilities to accommodate maritimes proposal to construct upstream facilities to be placed in service after a year.ferc conditioned pngts certificate authorization on tqm receiving the necessary approvals.
in september ferc issued final certificates to pngts authorizing construction and operation of the pipeline facilities between pittsburg,new hampshire and westbrook,maine,as well as construction and operation of the joint facilities between westbrook and wells,and the operation of the joint facilities between wells and dracut.the final certificate order also addressed pngts petition for rehearing on the issue of the increase in capacity and the condition after the first year.because it was uncertain exactly when the maritimes upstream facilities would go on line and when tqm would install its new planned compression,ferc concluded it was premature to require pngts to revise its rates or to be placed at risk for higher capacity after its first year of operation,declaratory order quoting portland natural gas transmission,at,and stated it would review this matter when pngts makes its section rate filing,id.in december pngts and maritimes filed a settlement resolving various issues involving the joint facilities,which ferc approved in part in march.
on january,pngts filed a petition for a declaratory order requesting a determination that physical capacity across its system would be mcf per day on a firm basis once maritimes phase iv expansion facilities were placed in service on november.it also requested a determination that it could lawfully deny future requests for firm service that together with its existing contracts would cause it to exceed mcf per day.according to ferc,the final certificate orders did not establish a certificated firm level of service and pngts most recent section rate case had resulted in a settlement without resolving that issue.pngts explained that its previously available capacity would diminish when maritimes phase iv expansion facilities were placed in service.because there was no contractual basis for obligating tqm to construct more compression upstream,the increased pressure downstream would reduce pngts capacity.pngts also requested that the rate consequences of its petition be addressed in its subsequent section filing.
in the declaratory order granting pngts petition,ferc made four determinations.first,ferc concluded that pngts was not required to file an abandonment application because a the final certificate order authorizing pngts facilities did not establish a certificated capacity level after the first year of service,due to the uncertainty involving the timing and impact of additional compression and use of joint facilities,and b pngts subsequent rate case was resolved by uncontested settlement,which also did not establish a certificated capacity for pngts.second,ferc concluded that it was appropriate to determine pngts certificated level of service going forward because that would remove uncertainty and provide transparency to the market,including pngts and its shippers.id.third,upon reviewing the engineering information submitted by pngts,ferc found that adopting mcf per day as pngts annual certificated systemwide capacity was in the public convenience and necessity.although pngts historically has been able to provide service in excess of this level,ferc stated its primary focus is whether natural gas service will be jeopardized.id.it found no basis to conclude that requiring pngts to operate its system at a capacity level greater than is needed to continue to serve current or anticipated customers.id no party,ferc noted,took issue with pngts assertions that it will have more than sufficient capacity to meet all of its contractual obligations for service after october,that are now in effect,and that it is not aware of any interest for additional firm service that would exceed the capacity level.id.fourth,ferc stated that the action here does not prejudge the impact of our decision on pngts rates and any rate issues associated with our decision here,including the appropriate determinants to use to design pngts rates,are more appropriately determined in pngts next rate proceeding.id.
