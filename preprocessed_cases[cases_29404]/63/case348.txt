in and,relator jack grynberg brought a number of qui tam suits against natural gas pipeline companies and their affiliates for alleged underpayment of royalties in violation of a of the false claims act fca seven of these suits alleged that the defendants had underpaid royalties on the carbon dioxide they produced from federal and indian lands by paying based on an artificially deflated value rather than the actual market value of.the district court found these suits jurisdictionally barred by the rule of b because a suit had alleged the same essential facts.that prior suit had named as defendants two of grynberg current defendants,mentioned three of the current defendants by name but without joining them as parties and had not mentioned two of the current defendants at all.the district court held that a prior action does not have to be against a party in order to bar a subsequent action under the bar,so long as the party is readily identifiable from the prior action.grynberg appeals the district court dismissal only with regard to the four defendants who were not parties to the prior action.we reverse.
background 
grynberg filed numerous qui tam suits against natural gas pipeline companies and their various parents,subsidiaries,and affiliates in and,alleging a variety of ways in which these companies had allegedly underpaid natural gas royalties owed to the federal government.grynberg primary claims alleged underreporting of the heating content and volume of natural gas through various mismeasurement techniques seven of his claims,however,concerned the production of,in which grynberg alleged that the companies underpaid royalties not by underreporting the volume of but by undervaluing its worth.these claims were brought against mobil exploration producing,mobil shell land and energy and shell western e p,collectively,shell exxon,usa exxon amerada hess amerada hess arco oil gas and arco permian,atlantic richfield collectively,arco and cross timbers operating cross timbers.the complaints against each defendant included an allegation virtually identical to this one,from the exxon complaint 
defendant exxon company,produces carbon dioxide from at least the royalty properties attached at exhibit under applicable law,defendant must pay royalties based upon the fair market value of the carbon dioxide so produced.defendant knowingly underpays royalties by paying based upon an assumed value of the carbon dioxide which is significantly below its true fair market value.purely by way of example,carbon dioxide is presently sold for per mcf on the open market yet defendant pays royalties based upon a value of less than that price.
exxon am.compl.
grynberg claims were similar to those in another qui tam action filed by a different relator the previous year.in claims coalition shell oil et,a coalition of royalty owners,small share working interest owners,and taxing authorities brought suit under the false claims act against shell and mobil,alleging that those companies had controlled and depressed the wellhead price of produced from the mcelmo dome field in southwest colorado the coalition complaint.as small share working interest owners of the produced at the mcelmo dome field,the coalition plaintiffs could not sell their independently,but instead entered into contracts with the large share working interest owners at the field,shell and mobil.shell and mobil would then pay the plaintiffs a royalty on all sales based on the wellhead price of.the royalties they owed the federal government were likewise based on these underlying agreements.
shell and mobil,however,were not only producers of,but also consumers of that very gas,using it in their production of crude oil.in their operations,shell and mobil would transport the from the mcelmo dome field to their oil fields in west texas,using a pipeline jointly owned by both companies.according to the coalition complaint,this enabled shell and mobil to depress the wellhead price of in a number of ways whereas a producer of would normally have an interest in demanding the highest price possible,because shell and mobil were also the consumers of that,they preferred a lower wellhead price so that they could shift the profits to the oil side of the operation and avoid paying higher royalties.the price they based the royalty payments on failed to include the in kind value that shell and mobil were receiving.furthermore,because they owned the pipeline,they could artificially inflate the transportation costs because the wellhead price is calculated as the delivered price minus the pipeline tariff,this would further reduce the royalties they had to pay.
although the coalition complaint brought actual claims against only shell and mobil,it identified four other major oil companies that owned working interests in the mcelmo dome field,including arco.in addition,it identified exxon,arco,amerada hess,and others as initiating similar projects in the sheep mountain and bravo dome fields.the coalition plaintiffs also brought an antitrust claim against shell and mobil,alleging that they had conspired with other oil companies to fix the price of.it specifically identified exxon,arco,and amerada hess as companies who had a level of control over production and transportation at the bravo dome field that would allow them to effect a similar pricing scheme there.the complaint did not,however,assert an actual antitrust claim against anyone but shell and mobil.
when grynberg filed his qui tam suits against shell,mobil,exxon,arco,amerada hess,and cross timbers,the defendants moved for dismissal under the rule of b.that provision states 
when a person brings an action under this subsection,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.
b.according to the defendants,grynberg current qui tam action was a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action,that pending action being the coalition claims.grynberg argued that to the extent his current action advanced claims against parties who were not named in the coalition complaint or involved different oil fields,such as sheep mountain and bravo dome,they are unrelated to the coalition complaint and not jurisdictionally barred under the rule.
the special master found that the undervaluation claims against shell and mobil were premised on the same underlying conduct that the coalition complaint was based on,and that gryberg complaints against shell and mobil had fail ed to allege a different type of wrongdoing,based on different material facts than those alleged in the coalition complaint.rec.this was so even though grynberg allegations of fraud extended beyond the mcelmo dome field.id.the special master found the claims against exxon,arco,and amerada hess more difficult,as the coalition complaint had not brought claims against those defendants.nonetheless,the special master found that those defendants were specifically identified in the coalition complaint,and were accused of being participants in a conspiracy to depress the price of by setting an assumed value that was significantly below its actual fair market value,id.at,which placed the government on notice of the essential facts of the fraudulent scheme,the participants therein,and the geographic locations where the scheme was utilized.id.at.the special master did not,however,recommend dismissal of the suits against and cross timbers,because the coalition complaint never mentioned those parties by name or description.id.
the district court accepted the special master recommendation in part and rejected it in part,finding that the bar applied not only to shell,m
