a company that sells aviation fuel at a puerto rico airport brought suit against a rival company,the puerto rico ports authority,and employees of those entities,claiming that the defendants wrongfully interfered with its business.the district court dismissed the claims against some defendants before trial,and granted judgment for the remaining defendants after a bench trial.finding no error,we affirm.
the is díaz aviation corporation díaz aviation,a company that also does business under the trade names borinquen air and amber service.díaz aviation has provided aviation services at the luis muñoz marín international airport lmmia in carolina,puerto rico,since.although the business began as an airline,in it began selling aviation fuel.by,díaz aviation was selling around million of fuel per year,and its main customer was the united states military.
sixto díaz saldaña díaz is the founder,sole shareholder,and general manager of díaz aviation.he is also a licensed attorney,and has chosen to represent his corporation throughout this litigation,in the district court and on appeal.
one group of defendants consists of airport aviation services,aas and some current and former employees of aas.aas is a puerto rico corporation that sells aviation fuel at lmmia it was formerly part of a consortium of puerto rican companies known as empresas santana.edwin santana de la rosa was formerly a stockholder,director,and officer of aas however,he sold his stock in aas and resigned from all positions at aas in march.josé algarín is the president and ceo of aas.rafael matos is the director of fuel sales and operations manager of aas.
the second group of defendants is the puerto rico ports authority prpa and various prpa employees.the prpa is a corporation owned by the puerto rico government that ran lmmia during the relevant time frame.fernando bonilla is a former executive director of the prpa.federico sosa román is a former manager of lmmia.alvaro pilar is the executive director of the prpa.arnaldo deleo is the director of aviation of prpa and manager of lmmia.edgar sierra is the director of operations at lmmia.eric gracia is the assistant director of operations at lmmia.
díaz aviation filed a complaint in the federal district court on june,and filed an amended complaint on february.broadly speaking,the amended complaint alleges that a corrupt relationship existed between aas and prpa,and that both organizations and their employees took improper actions in order to drive díaz aviation out of business.díaz aviation alleges that santana has paid bribes to the governing political party of puerto rico,and that as a result,the prpa has systematically favored aas and discriminated against díaz aviation.the complaint points to several specific actions and incidents,including 
in march,the prpa brought an eviction action against díaz aviation in puerto rico court.this action ultimately failed because díaz aviation had paid rent and the prpa had accepted it.
in,aas won a contract to supply the military with fuel at lmmia.díaz aviation alleges that aas has wrongfully claimed that this is an exclusive contract,and has interfered with díaz aviation fuel sales to the air force.
on october,algarín complained to a prpa employee about díaz aviation the next day,the prpa removed díaz aviation fueling permits and expelled díaz aviation trucks from the fueling ramps for approximately two weeks.
on january,prpa employees removed a military airplane that díaz aviation was fueling,claiming that the airplane was illegally parked aas then sold fuel to the airplane.
the complaint does not include headings for separate counts or causes of action,but it references numerous federal and puerto rico statutes in a scattered fashion.this lack of organization makes it difficult to determine what causes of action díaz aviation is pursuing.the causes of action referenced most prominently in the complaint are section of the sherman antitrust act,and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,based on bribery and fraud.the complaint also mentions civil rights the false claims act conspiracy against federal rights article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit,laws ann.tit,et.puerto rico ethics law and laws ann.tit,criminal statute barring public employees from using their position for the benefit of a third party.
all defendants filed motions to dismiss,and the district court granted the motions filed by the prpa and individual prpa defendants bonilla,pilar,sosa,deleo,sierra,and gracia.the district court dismissed these claims under the local government antitrust act lgaa,which immunizes local governments and local government employees from federal antitrust damages.see díaz aviation ports,wl,at july.the district court ruling did not mention or discuss any claims.
following discovery,díaz aviation and the remaining defendants aas,santana,algarín,and matos filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied the motions of díaz aviation,aas,algarín,and matos,finding that disputed factual issues remained.see díaz aviation airport aviation,wl,at.the district court granted santana motion for summary judgment because he had already left aas when the disputes about fueling occurred.id.at.
in february,a bench trial occurred between díaz aviation and aas,algarín,and matos.by that time,the claims had been narrowed to the sherman act and article of the puerto rico civil code article.in spite of the district court advice that díaz aviation should retain outside counsel,díaz chose to represent his corporation while also serving as a witness.
díaz aviation case consisted of testimony from employees of the puerto rico police,prpa,aas,and díaz aviation including díaz himself,along with several documentary exhibits.the testimony focused mostly on incidents between díaz aviation,prpa,and aas in and relating to fueling activities,and particularly fueling of military airplanes.where necessary,we will describe the evidence in greater detail below.
after díaz aviation concluded its case,the defendants filed for a judgment on partial findings in their favor,pursuant to.c.the district court granted the motion,finding that díaz aviation had failed to meet its burden of proof on all claims.see díaz aviation ports,wl.the district court factual findings and legal reasoning are described below.
díaz aviation moved for a new trial or for reconsideration of the district court previous decision.the district court denied the motion,saying that its earlier decision was supported by the evidence at trial.díaz aviation filed a timely appeal.
díaz aviation notice of appeal and original docketing statement have led to a dispute about the scope of the appeal.díaz aviation notice of appeal stated that it 
hereby appeal s to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit from the order,docket,dated june,denying a motion,filed on march,dockets and,seeking a new trial or the modification of the opinion and order entered on march,dockets and judgement.
in other words,the notice of appeal listed as the subject of appeal the denial of reconsideration of the final judgment,but not the judgment itself.further,the original docketing statement listed only three appellees aas,matos,and algarín.yet díaz aviation appellate brief urged reversal not just of the denial of reconsideration,but of the final judgment after trial,and the earlier judgments dismissing the claims against the prpa defendants and santana.
after díaz aviation filed its brief,sosa wrote to this court asking us to disregard any arguments against him because he was not listed as an appellee in the docketing statement,and the notice of appeal did not encompass the orders dismissing him from the case.we allowed díaz aviation to amend its docketing statement to include additional appellees if it wished,and invited the parties to address the scope of the notice of appeal in their briefs.díaz aviation then filed an amended docketing statement listing every defendant except pilar as an appellee.in their brief,sosa and bonilla renewed the argument that the orders dismissing the case as to them were not included in the notice of appeal.
under rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,a notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.although c ourts will liberally construe the requirements of rule,smith barry,accord blockel penney,cir,rule dictates are jurisdictional in nature,and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review,smith,at.these twin commands from the supreme court that rule is jurisdictional,but that it should be construed liberally inherently give courts some flexibility about when to apply rule jurisdictional bar and when to use liberal construction to rescue a facially deficient notice of appeal.
we are convinced that díaz aviation notice of appeal should be construed liberally to include the final judgment.it is well settled law that when a notice of appeal addresses only the order denying reconsideration and not the underlying judgment,courts have some latitude to consider other grounds originally urged against the underlying dismissal,especially where the issues on original dismissal and the reconsideration order overlap or are intertwined.mckenna wells fargo bank,cir see also rojas velázquez figueroa sancha,cir alstom caribe,geo.reintjes,cir.díaz aviation motion for reconsideration largely rehashed the arguments it made in opposition to the original judgment.as we have often done when the issues are intertwined,we will treat the appeal of the denial of reconsideration as also including an appeal of the final judgment.
yet construing díaz aviation appeal to encompass the earlier orders from nearly two years earlier dismissing the prpa defendants from the case would go a step too far.where a notice of appeal does not mention certain interlocutory orders or defendants,the touchstone is whether the appellant has indicated an intent to seek review of those orders through his notice of appeal and accompanying documents.see united states dowell,cir a n error in designating the judgment will not result in a loss of appeal if the intent to appeal from the contested judgment may be inferred from the notice and if the appellee has not been misled by the defect.
two peculiar facts of this case convince us that díaz aviation has not indicated a sufficiently clear intent to appeal the judgments dismissing the prpa defendants from the case.first,while díaz aviation appellate brief contains occasional glancing arguments related to those judgments,it also asserts that the prpa defendants are not denominated as appellees.thus,the brief is at best equivocal about the intent to appeal as to the prpa defendants.second,although the amended docketing statement adds most of the prpa defendants as appellees,it still lists only the denial of reconsideration as the subject of appeal,and does not mention any earlier interlocutory orders.on the specific facts of this case,we conclude that díaz aviation has not provided sufficient notice of intent to appeal the judgments in favor of the prpa defendants.we have some flexibility in our construction of rule,but we see no reason to exercise special flexibility in favor of a corporation in a business tort case that is represented by counsel.
for santana,although díaz aviation has asked this court to reverse the summary judgment in santana favor,díaz aviation has not provided any developed argument about why we should do so.we therefore conclude that díaz aviation has waived his perfunctory challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment to santana.see united states zannino,cir.
all that remains of the appeal are díaz aviation challenges to the judgments in favor of the trial defendants aas,algarín,and matos.
díaz aviation appeals the district court grant of a motion for under.c in favor of aas,algarín,and matos after díaz aviation presented its case at the bench trial.most of díaz aviation arguments challenge credibility determinations and factual inferences the district court drew from the evidence.for example,díaz aviation contends that the district court should not have credited the testimony of a prpa employee who said that he removed a military plane from díaz aviation ramp because it was illegally parked in an unsafe area.díaz aviation also argues that the court should have inferred that a conspiracy between prpa and aas existed from an email chain between prpa and aas employees,despite deleo testimony denying a conspiracy.
this type of argument is unavailing.when serving as factfinder,the trial judge is entitled to draw reasonable inferences and make credibility determinations.we defer to the trial judge factual findings and set them aside only if clearly erroneous.a.díaz aviation has made no showing to leave us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.jackson united states,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer city,internal quotation marks omitted.we now turn to each cause of action to show why the district court was correct or at the very least,not clearly erroneous in concluding that díaz aviation had not met its burden of proof.
sherman act section.section of the sherman act bars e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.a section violation requires an agreement,bell atl.twombly,and this agreement must be between separate economic entities rather than members of the same economic enterprise,see copperweld independence tube,gonzález maldonado mmm healthcare,cir.most agreements are judged by the rule of reason,under which they are declared illegal only if unreasonable or anticompetitive.see leegin creative leather,psks,
the district court ruling can be sustained on either of two grounds.first,díaz aviation did not prove the existence of concerted action.an agreement between aas and its employees algarín and matos would not qualify as concerted action under section.the only potential agreement of which díaz aviation presented any evidence was an agreement between aas and prpa.as evidence of such a conspiracy,díaz aviation pointed to an email exchange between aas and prpa employees that took place before prpa employees removed díaz aviation fueling permits and expelled its fueling trucks from the airport ramps.
on october,algarín received an email from another aas employee stating that díaz aviation had caused an imminent security risk through its conduct in fueling military planes it enclosed a police report of an incident involving díaz aviation and noted that díaz aviation employees are becoming very upset.algarín then forwarded the email to a prpa employee,saying the important thing is to prevent any personal incident actions,apart from any type of accident while fuel is being supplied.i would appreciate your intervening in the matter.that prpa employee forwarded the email to deleo,his supervisor.
the next day,deleo forwarded this email chain to díaz,noting that díaz aviation fueled an airplane which should have been serviced by aas.deleo said that aas had a contract to fuel military planes,but díaz aviation did not have a fuel permit with the prpa.deleo stated,based on said communication and at the request of aas,you are requested to immediately cease to interfere with this or other duly authorized companies with fuel permits in effect.that same day,prpa employees removed the fuel permits from díaz aviation trucks and escorted the trucks outside the fueling area.díaz aviation trucks were kept from the fueling area for about fifteen days until díaz aviation obtained an injunction in puerto rico court allowing it to return,on the basis that although its fueling permit was expired,it had become permanent.
díaz aviation argues that the email exchange confirms the existence of an unlawful conspiracy between aas and prpa,but the testimony at trial told a different story.algarín testified that he sent the email to prpa to deal with potential security issues and that while he hoped prpa would take appropriate action,he was not demanding or expecting that prpa take any specific action.deleo testified that he ordered díaz aviation trucks removed because díaz aviation interference with fueling operations was causing safet
