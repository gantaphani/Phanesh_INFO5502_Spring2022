in this contract dispute,appellant cq,cq appeals the district court resolution of the parties for summary judgment in favor of appellee txu mining company,txu.cq also appeals the exclusion of its expert testimony on damages.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this dispute arises out of a failed partnership to clean lignite,a type of coal.txu mines lignite and sells it for commercial use as fuel.in november of,txu began to explore cleaning lignite at several of its mines.txu sent out a request for bids rfb to several companies that specialized in such cleaning,including cq.the rfb contemplated the formation of a key alliance agreement,by which a chosen company would construct and operate facilities at txu twin oak and oak hill mines for a period of five years.the rfb cautioned that,even once a successful bidder was selected,txu reserved the right to further negotiate the proposed contract.prior to bidding,txu required cq and the other companies to sign a confidentiality agreement that prevented either party from using confidential information disclosed during negotiations for any purpose except the analysis,investigation,and evaluation of the proposed business relationship.cq submitted a timely bid in response to the rfb subsequently,txu proposed various addenda to the original rfb,and cq and the other bidders submitted modified bids in response.
in late february of,txu called cq and indicated that cq had been selected as the preferred alliance partner.the significance of this selection is hotly disputed.cq contends that txu orally agreed to the alliance agreement discussed in the bid documents.txu contends that it merely selected cq from among the available bidders and intended to further negotiate the final contract,as contemplated in the rfb.it is undisputed that the parties never entered a written contract finalizing the purported alliance agreement.
over the next few months,cq continued to work with and advise txu on the proposed operation.cq periodically asked when a contract would be formalized in writing.txu responded that it had not yet decided to build any cleaning facilities and would compensate cq if txu ultimately decided against the project.in of,the parties exchanged drafts of an interim services contract by which txu would pay cq a consulting fee for its services if the final alliance agreement failed to materialize.in of,txu requested documentation of the expenses undertaken by cq until that point.cq submitted an invoice for in services.in early july of,txu terminated the relationship with cq.txu ultimately built and operated its own facility at the oak hill mine,but chose not to clean lignite at the twin oak mine.
after txu terminated the relationship,cq filed suit in state court for,inter alia,breach of the purported alliance agreement,breach of the confidentiality agreement,quantum meruit,and misappropriation of trade secrets.txu removed the case to federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction.the parties agreed that texas law controlled the substantive claims.
the parties filed for summary judgment.cq moved for partial summary judgment in favor of its contract claims,but the district court found that disputes of material fact precluded judgment as to either claim.txu moved for summary judgment against all of cq claims.in response,the district court dismissed cq claim for breach of the purported alliance agreement,finding that the statute of frauds barred enforcement of the agreement.the court also dismissed the majority of cq claims,including the claim that txu misappropriated cq recommendation to focus on cleaning rom lignite rather than waste lignite.the court reasoned that cq had failed to provide any evidence that txu used the rom recommendation.as to cq remaining claims,the district court denied txu request for summary judgment.
as the trial approached,txu filed a motion to exclude the opinions and reports of ronald vollmar,cq expert on damages.the motion also sought to prohibit any evidence supporting a damages calculation other than,the amount stated in cq invoice.txu argued that cq failed to disclose any alternative computation of damages during discovery as required by.a a iii.after considering the parties briefing,the district court both excluded vollmar reports and limited further evidence of damages as requested by txu.subsequently,the parties entered a settlement by which txu paid cq in fees and cq dismissed its claims for promissory estoppel and injunctive relief.
given the settlement of the fee liability and the court order precluding further evidence on damages,txu moved for a judgment on cq remaining claims for breach of the confidentiality agreement,misappropriation of trade secrets,and quantum meruit.the district court granted the motion and entered a judgment.cq now appeals,arguing that the district court committed several errors in resolving the parties for summary judgment and excluding cq evidence of damages.
cq raises several challenges to the district court resolution of the parties for summary judgment.we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.robinson orient marine,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the movant has the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those parts of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.in currency,cir.once this initial burden has been met,the burden shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.id.all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmovant.robinson,at.
cq first contends that the district court erred in denying cq motion for summary judgment on its claim that txu breached the confidentiality agreement by using cq confidential information.the district court denied the motion because it found that issues of material fact remain ed as to whether cq indicated that its information was confidential as required by the confidentiality agreement.after reviewing the record,we agree that there is a genuine dispute as to whether cq marked the information as confidential or otherwise disclosed the information in a manner consistent with its confidential or proprietary nature.namely,the documents at issue were not expressly marked confidential on all relevant pages,and the parties provide conflicting accounts on whether a confidential intent was expressed.accordingly,the district court properly held that a genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment.see.c.
cq next contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against cq misappropriation claim as to its sixth alleged trade recommendation that txu focus on rom lignite rather than waste lignite the rom strategy.to prevail on a misappropriation claim under texas law,a plaintiff must show that a trade secret existed,the trade secret was acquired through a breach of a confidential relationship or discovered by improper means,and the defendant used the trade secret without authorization from the plaintiff.gaia techs.recycled prods,cir emphasis added.
cq alleged that the rom strategy was a trade secret that was misappropriated by txu.txu moved for summary judgment on this point,arguing that the rom strategy was not a trade secret under texas law and there was no evidence that txu actually used the rom strategy.the district court granted summary judgment on the latter ground,reasoning that cq response brief failed to provide more than a scintilla of evidence that txu was using this information.
cq contends that it provided sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue as to whether txu used the rom strategy.in order to avoid summary judgment,the nonmovant must identify specific facts within the record that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.smith ex rel.estate of smith united states,cir.the party must also articulate the precise manner in which the submitted or identified evidence supports his or her claim.id.w hen evidence exists in the summary judgment record but the nonmovant fails even to refer to it in the response to the motion for summary judgment,that evidence is not properly before the district court.id.quoting malacara garber,cir emphasis added.
here,cq response to txu motion for summary judgment included a short paragraph with the heading txu improperly used cq secret information.this paragraph lacked any argument that txu used the rom strategy in particular instead,it to a span of four pages in cq own motion for partial summary judgment.on one of the referenced pages,cq specifically argues that txu used the rom strategy and provides supporting citations to the record.substantively,the cited evidence creates at least a genuine issue as to whether txu used the rom strategy however,txu contends that the evidence may not be considered because the relevant citations were not included in the body of cq response brief.see smith,at.the district court apparently agreed,as it failed to acknowledge the or the dispositive evidence in the record.
this circuit has never addressed whether a nonmovant may satisfy its responsive burden by to its own motion for summary judgment.while we decline to endorse a rule,we hold that cq response was sufficient in this case cq response brief alleged that there was a material issue of fact and supported this allegation with a targeted to cq own motion.the pages contained argument and citations to the record that unambiguously created the alleged issue of fact.thus,we can not say that cq fail ed even to refer to the relevant argument and evidence in its response brief.see smith,at see also fair hous.council of riverside county,riverside two,cir holding that a district court must consider the evidence offered in a nonmovant own for summary judgment.accordingly,the district court erred by refusing to consider the cited evidence of txu use of the rom strategy 
nonetheless,we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground presented to the district court for consideration,even though it may not have formed the basis for the district court decision.gulf island,iv blue streak marine,cir.here,we agree with txu alternative argument that the rom strategy was not a trade secret under texas law.a trade secret is any formula,pattern,device or compilation of information which is used in one business and presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.computer assocs.int l,altai,quoting from the restatement of torts.it differs from other secret information in a business in that it is not simply information as to single or ephemeral events in the conduct of the business a trade secret is a process or device for continuous use in the operation of the business.restatement of torts,cmt.
the rom strategy does not qualify as a trade secret under texas law.as defined by cq,the rom strategy was cq recommendation that txu focus on cleaning rom lignite instead of waste lignite at the twin oak mine.cq does not allege that the rom strategy itself involved a previously unknown process or method for cleaning lignite.in fact,the record indicates that txu contemplated cleaning rom lignite when it sent its initial request for bids.the rom strategy was essentially a strategic recommendation between two generally known alternatives.while this recommendation may have been based on cq valuable experience and effort,it was not a process or device for continuous use that offered txu an advantage over its competitors.see id.moreover,the record indicates that the recommendation was tailored to txu initial cleaning project,not to the mining industry generally.see id.explaining that a trade secret is not simply information as to single or ephemeral events.accordingly,the rom strategy was not a trade secret under texas law,and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment against cq misappropriation claim.
cq next contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against its claim for breach of the purported alliance agreement.the district court found that the statute of frauds barred any enforcement of the alliance agreement.
under the texas statute of frauds,an agreement that can not be performed within one year is unenforceable unless it is documented in writing and signed by the person to be charged.bus.a,b vernon.cq complaint alleged that txu orally agreed to a contract for services known as the clean coal alliance agreement.cq raised several arguments in favor of the enforceability of the purported oral agreement,all of which were rejected by the district court on summary judgment.cq now reiterates two of these arguments.
first,cq contends that the oral agreement was sufficiently documented in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds.under texas law,an oral agreement must be evidenced by a written memorandum which is complete within itself in every material detail,and which contains all of the essential elements of the agreement,so that the contract can be ascertained from the writings without resorting to oral testimony.conner lavaca hosp,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this memorandum may consist of several different writings between the parties.cent.power light del mar conservation,antonio,writ ref.however,at least one writing must indicate the existence of a final contract evidence of mere negotiation is not sufficient.see southmark life investors,cir under texas law a writing that contemplates a contract to be made in the future does not satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds.indeed,it is common sense that futuristic language in a writing is not confirmatory of a contract already in existence.internal quotation marks omitted.
cq primarily relies on one document to establish that txu agreed to enter the alliance agreement in may of,txu david watkins sent an email to txu don clevenger seeking clevenger assistance in preparing the interim services contract between cq and txu.the watkins email provided as follows 
per the information below,we are requesting your guidance in completing a contract with cq,
i have been working with txu mining on a project regarding clean coal technology.we went through a formal bid process and through that process determined that the company cq is the best company for txu to go forward with on the clean coal technology project.the intent is to eventually form an alliance or partnership agreement with cq in regard to clean coal technology.the alliance would be contingent upon the results of testing and work we will be doing this year and upon txu overall fuel strategy.in discussions so far with cq,both parties have agreed that cq will be performing work this year that will provide a basis for the forthcoming alliance agreement if the clean coal technology methodology is a workable solution and if it fits into txu overall fuel strategy.in discussions so far with cq,it has been agreed that the costs for the work that cq performs this year will be rolled over into the final alliance compensation rates,if the alliance is determined to be a go project.if the alliance does not happen,then txu mining would compensate cq for the work that they have done this year.cq is to document the costs accrued this year and at the end of the year,txu will compensate cq for those costs.emphases added 
cq argues that the watkins email,in combination with the bid documents,creates a memorandum of the alliance agreement.however,the watkins email unambiguously disavows the present existence of the alliance agreement.according to the plain text of the document,the parties were seeking to enter an agreement precisely because they had not yet agreed on a arrangement.the intent was to eventually form an agreement if the alliance was determined to be a go project.this type of contingent language does not satisfy the statute of frauds because it is not confirmatory of a contract already in existence.see southmark,at internal quotation marks omitted.cq other written evidence is similarly inconclusive.cq has failed to offer a writing that demonstrates or even su
