plaintiffs,enterprises,et,appeal from the district court order entered on november,granting summary judgment in favor of defendant,sunoco,sunoco,on plaintiffs complaint for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violation of open price term obligations codified in ohio ann.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order.
background 
procedural history 
plaintiffs are twelve individual businesses and business persons who operate gasoline service station facilities which they either own or lease from sunoco.each plaintiff sells gasoline to the motoring public in central ohio.plaintiffs allege that,since,sunoco has violated ohio ann.by charging them excessively high prices for its gasoline.plaintiffs filed their complaint on march,in the franklin county court of common pleas in ohio.sunoco removed the case to the district court on april,based on diversity jurisdiction.on july,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to state sunoco proper name.
at the close of extensive discovery,which resulted in the production of thousands of documents and depositions,sunoco moved for summary judgment on all three counts of plaintiffs complaint.plaintiffs did not contest sunoco asserted grounds for summary judgment on the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.by order entered on november,the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint.plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal on december.they take issue only with the district court dismissal of their claim alleging a violation of sunoco open price term obligations codified in ohio ann.
plaintiffs business operations 
with two exceptions,each plaintiff operates a single gasoline service station facility in central ohio which is either owned or leased from sunoco two plaintiffs operate two sunoco service stations.each plaintiff is a party to a dealer franchise agreement dfa,which sets forth the terms of its relationship with sunoco.the dfas are substantially the same in that they contain similar or identical terms regarding the price sunoco will charge for its gasoline.
most plaintiffs own or control the real property on which their service stations are located and,therefore,are able to switch gasoline suppliers upon the expiration of their dfas.in the columbus,ohio area,major refiners like shell,british petroleum bp,marathon and citgo compete with each other to sign new accounts for the operation of their gasoline service stations with individuals who own or control their real property.
sunoco provides certain financial incentives to encourage such individuals to maintain the sunoco flag at their stations.first,sunoco provides a cash payment to be used for improvements or enhancements to the property.ten of twelve plaintiffs have received between and for signing their dfas.in total,sunoco has committed to pay these plaintiffs over in payments since.second,sunoco provides these plaintiffs with running consideration,which are credits earned by purchasing negotiated threshold amounts of gasoline from sunoco these credits apply to future purchases of gasoline from sunoco.third,sunoco operates a volume improvement program vip,a rebate program which rewards dealers who purchase a certain amount of gasoline with credits against subsequent purchases.the vip applies to all plaintiffs,regardless of whether they own or control their real property.
all but one of the plaintiffs who own or control their real property have renewed their dfas with sunoco since.during the pendency of this litigation four plaintiffs have had the opportunity to switch gasoline suppliers,but have signed new dfas with sunoco.
sunoco retail operations and pricing system in central ohio 
sunoco is a refiner and marketer of petroleum products headquartered in philadelphia,pennsylvania.like its principal competition bp,shell and marathon,sunoco markets and distributes its gasoline in central ohio in three ways directly at stations through use of a person or corporation who purchases gasoline directly from sunoco other refiners at what is called the rack price and transports the gasoline to one or more retail outlets,either with its own equipment or through a subcontractor or through independent retailers known as dealers.all of the plaintiffs fall into the third category.the independent retailers pay a different price for gasoline than the dealer tank wagon or dtw price.
sunoco is a pricing follower in central ohio,whereas bp and marathon are the pricing leaders.this means that sunoco pricing strategy is to follow the lead of bp and marathon.sunoco attempts to set its rack and dtw prices in such a way that it is neither the nor the least expensive supplier in the market.
sunoco sets both its rack and dtw prices on a daily basis.its rack price is based upon a market basket of pricing information all of which relates to other major refiners rack prices.sunoco subscribes to the oil pricing information service opis in order to determine the jobber rack prices of its competitors.sunoco sets its rack price somewhere in the middle of the rack prices being charged by its competitors.sunoco sets its dtw price based on a survey of what other major competitors are charging at their retail stations in each of sunoco pricing zones.sunoco then reduces that average retail price by a six to margin,which is subject to change depending upon changes in prices in the relevant area the rack price charged jobbers is typically lower than the dtw price because sunoco does not have to transport the gasoline purchased by a jobber.often,however,sunoco will lower its profit margin on the dtw price,and hence the dtw price charged to dealers,because a particular dealer may be faced with a competitor who sets its price below the average street price in the zone this lower price takes the form of a rebate that applies to the next load of gasoline purchased from sunoco.
company operated stations and jobbers are notified in advance of any proposed price change in the afternoon prior to the change taking effect.in accordance with section of the dfas,independent retailers such as plaintiffs are not advised in advance of any proposed price change,and they pay sunoco whatever dtw price is in effect on the day they receive a scheduled delivery.
sunoco change in business focus 
prior to,sunoco generally sought to maintain a separation between jobber retailers,retailers and retailers such as plaintiffs who are supplied directly by sunoco.in,sunoco created a midamerica division with a new structure that combined the markets previously segregated for plaintiffs and jobber retailers.sunoco strategic plan emphasized growing the number of stations without investing the significant capital required to purchase new stations.sunoco sought to grow its brand through jobbers by offering to sell jobbers real property or by assigning supply contracts sunoco had with direct dealers in exchange for the jobber agreement to increase the volume of gasoline purchased.

propriety of an open price term under ohio law 
ohio law permits parties if they so intend to conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled.ohio ann.a west.ohio law imposes two obligations in this context.first,the price must be a reasonable price at the time for delivery if nothing is said as to price.id.a.second,if the seller is to fix the price under the contract,the price must be fixed in good faith.id.b.these two requirements essentially track the definition of good faith applicable to transactions between honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.id.a see also id.cmt.referencing applicability of definition of good faith from.
comment to states that in the normal case a posted price or a future seller or buyer given price,price in effect,market price,or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.id.cmt.emphasis added.several courts,including the fifth circuit court of appeals,have interpreted comment to mean in a case that is not normal,objective reasonableness,pricing at market rates or at the price in effect is a necessary,but not a sufficient,condition for a finding of good faith and a case is not normal when the seller lacks subjective good faith.see,mathis exxon,cir applying texas law holding that there is both a subjective test honesty in fact and an objective test reasonable commercial standards for determining the propriety of a seller when price is an open term hrn,shell oil,same.according to this view,a seller with the responsibility to fix a reasonable price does not act in subjective good faith when it engages in price treating buyers when the seller is otherwise motivated by an intent to injure the buyer.see mathis.at any lack of subjective,good faith is abnormal price discrimination is only the most obvious way a acts in bad faith.
this court recognizes that the fifth circuit interpretation of good faith may be plausible under texas law.it is not within the province of this court,however,to similarly interpret ohio where the ohio courts already have passed on the issue.in transactions,good faith generally means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.ohio ann.s.the ohio supreme court has held that honesty in fact does not exist when the actions at issue are commercially unjustifiable.master chem.inkrott,ohio,accord needham provident bank,ohio app d,jim white agency nissan motor in,cir applying ohio law.the merchant definition of good faith applicable in this case incorporates the honesty in fact definition from s and adds an additional requirement the observance of reasonable standards of fair dealing in the trade.id.a.thus,under ohio law,to show that a lacks good faith in fixing a price pursuant to a contract with an open price term,it must be shown that the price was not fixed in a commercially reasonable manner and,moreover,that the pricing was commercially unjustifiable.these are two distinct issues,and both involve an objective analysis of the conduct 
the issue in this case is whether plaintiffs have produced enough evidence to create a genuine issue that sunoco exercised its obligation under the dfas in a commercially unreasonable fashion.if plaintiffs can not make this showing,it follows,a fortiori,that plaintiffs can not show that sunoco actions were commercially unjustifiable.as discussed below,plaintiffs have failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on either point,and,therefore,the district court properly granted summary judgment for sunoco.
observance of reasonable standards test 
for a price to be fixed in good faith,the price must be set pursuant to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.ohio ann.and a.a price fixed pursuant to need not be the lowest possible price.havird oil,marathon oil,cir finding that w hile it is true that some of havird competitors were selling gasoline at retail for less than havird could obtain gasoline at wholesale,this does not constitute a breach of contract on the part of marathon tcp,uniroyal,cir recognizing that n either the ucc nor the official comments to the ucc require that a price at fair market value under a contract with an open price term,but specify that prices must be reasonable and set pursuant to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade quoting ucc au rustproofing,gulf oil,cir stating that au contends that because its competitors sold gasoline for less than au could buy it from gulf,gulf prices were unreasonable in our view,this contention is insufficient to establish that prices set by gulf contravened reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the gasoline market or otherwise constitute bad faith or commercially unreasonable behavior ajir exxon,wl,at cir.may,unpublished stating that a ll that the ucc requires is that a price term be reasonable,not the lowest possible.
in order for plaintiffs to meet their burden under,plaintiffs must prove,with respect to pricing,that sunoco violated reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the gasoline marketing industry.schwartz sun,cir applying michigan law.this burden requires plaintiffs to produce background evidence of the manner in which other marketers of gasoline in central ohio set their prices.id.at,affirming summary judgment for sun on franchisee breach of contract claim for wrongful pricing of gas on the ground that franchisee failed to introduce any background evidence against which the commercial reasonableness of the prices sun had charged him could be assessed.plaintiffs,however,have proffered no relevant,admissible proof.
the only relevant background evidence appears to be a letter from an attorney at bp america,who prepared and produced the letter to plaintiffs in lieu of a formal production of documents.according to the letter,bp determines dtw prices based on retail street prices posted by its competitors at retail outlets with an eye on the extent to which target sales volumes and profit margins have been satisfied.bp determines rack prices based on information purchased from the oil price information service opis jobbers are notified of price changes in the late afternoon of the day before the new prices take effect.sunoco similarly determines dtw prices based on surveys of retail prices at competitors and determines jobber rack prices based upon a survey of its competitor jobber rack prices as reflected in data from the opis.like bp,sunoco also provides advance notice of price changes to jobbers.the court fails to see any material difference between bp and sunoco pricing practices to the extent plaintiffs argue that the bp letter is inadmissible the record is utterly devoid of any competent and relevant evidence of industry pricing standards,let alone,sunoco deviation from those standards accordingly,there is no evidence indicating the existence of a material factual dispute concerning whether sunoco pricing practices were commercially unreasonable.
commercially unjustifiable test 
plaintiffs cite to three events that purportedly demonstrate sunoco bad faith in setting the dtw price changes in a rebate program for independent dealers sunoco adoption of a business plan in which sunoco planned for an increase in jobber retailers relative to the number of independent dealers in the columbus area and sunoco decision to permit jobbers to compete directly with independent dealers in the columbus area.none of these events evidence a lack of honesty in fact,as that term is defined under ohio law,because plaintiffs have not created a genuine issue of material fact that sunoco actions were commercially unjustifiable.
vip program 
prior to sunoco change to the volume improvement program in,independent dealers had received a rebate of the dtw price for all gallons purchased over a monthly target figure,and the rebates increased as the volumes purchased increased.although sunoco reduced the rebates roughly by half,sunoco also reduced the dtw price for all of the gallons leading up to the monthly target figure.according to sunoco,the net effect to plaintiffs from the reduction in the rebates was negligible,and plaintiffs have not disputed this contention.moreover,plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence of the rebate practices of other refiners.see short,at affirming directed verdict for refiner on claim that refiner reduction in a rebate program put plaintiff at a competitive disadvantage finding no evidence to support a finding of bad faith where plaintiff did not produce evidence of the pricing or rebate practices of other oil companies.thus,on this factual record,no reasonable jury could find that sunoco change in the vip program was commercially unjustifiable.
