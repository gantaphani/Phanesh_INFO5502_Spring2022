willbros rpi,willbros appeals on various grounds from the district court grant of summary judgment in its declaratory judgment action against continental casualty company cna.cna.these appeals ask us to resolve three questions related to insurance obligations resulting from a botched pipeline drilling project whether cna professional services exclusion applied whether cna coverage was excess and whether willbros indemnity claim was.we agree with the district court resolution of all but the second issue.
shell pipeline company,shell hired willbros,as general contractor,to construct miles of pipeline the bengal project.willbros hired harding road boring,harding,as subcontractor,to perform directional drilling.harding,in turn,subcontracted various aspects of the job.during the drilling process,one or more pipelines owned by exxonmobil pipeline company empco were damaged.subsequently,empco and exxon mobile corporation collectively exxon commenced suit against shell,willbros,harding,and others the underlying suit,alleging that the defendants were negligent in their duties to analyze,review,supervise,construct,operate,and monitor the work so that empco pipelines would not be damaged.
shell tendered its defense and indemnity to willbros,who accepted the same.willbros,in turn,tendered its defense and indemnity,as well as that of shell,to harding and harding insurer,cna.cna previously issued harding a package policy the cna policy.the cna policy contains a blanket endorsement which extends additional insured coverage,generically,to any person or organization with whom harding had agreed to add as an additional insured.the district court determined that willbros qualifies as one such insured by virtue of a written agreement entered into by harding and willbros predecessor,rogers phillips,rpi 
cna,however,refused to assume willbros and shell defense and denied willbros indemnity demands,contending that it is unclear whether willbros,in fact,qualifies as an additional insured under the cna policy whether various provisions exclude coverage and whether coverage is excess,primary,or.nevertheless,it offered to pay fifty percent of willbros defense fees and costs under a reservation of rights,but offered nothing to shell.
meanwhile,willbros filed notice of the underlying suit with its own insurer,lexington,which previously issued willbros a commercial general liability policy the lexington policy.lexington accepted the tender and began paying defense costs.
willbros subsequently filed the declaratory judgment suit that forms the basis of this appeal against cna,seeking a declaration that willbros is entitled to percent defense and indemnity under the cna policy,and willbros is entitled to percent defense and indemnity for shell under the cna policy.in response,cna filed a,seeking a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify willbros or shell,and if an obligation to defend is owed,it has no duty to defend beyond fifty percent of defense costs that it has already voluntarily offered to pay under a reservation of rights.finally,cna filed a complaint against lexington seeking virtually the same declaratory relief.
on for summary judgment,the district court rejected cna contention that the professional services exclusion provided a basis to deny coverage,finding that the underlying suit alleged negligence as a basis for liability.the district court also found that cna had a duty to defend willbros,but that the duty did not begin until the exhaustion of the lexington policy.this result flowed from the district court determination that the lexington policy was primary and that the cna policy was excess.finally,the district court found that the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify are separate and distinct obligations and that the latter does not arise until the insured has been adjudicated,whether by judgment or settlement,to be legally responsible for damages covered by the policy.because the underlying suit was ongoing at the time of its decision,the district court determined that willbros indemnity claims were.this appeal followed.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.mongrue monsanto,cir.interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.gladney paul revere life ins,cir.
cna contends that the professional services exclusion in its policy bars coverage of willbros defense in the underlying lawsuit.according to cna,the exclusion applies because the property damage in question arose out of errors in the preparation approval of the surveyor plans.cna maintains that the preparation and approval of plans qualifies as a professional service and that the damage alleged in the complaint would not have occurred but for the performance of these activities.
to determine whether an exclusion provision applies,the allegations in the underlying suit must be considered in light of the provisions of the insurance policy.heyden newport chem.ins.because the only two relevant documents are the insurance policy and the pleadings of the underlying suit,the inquiry is often referred to as the eight corners rule.king dallas fire ins.in applying the eight corners rule,the allegations as set forth in the complaint are liberally construed without reference to their truth or falsity,to what the parties know or believe to be the true facts,or to a legal determination of the true facts.see duncanville diagnostic,atl.lloyd ins.of texas,writ denied citing heyden newport chem,at.in reviewing the underlying pleadings,we focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages rather than on the legal theories advanced.see adamo state farm lloyds,dist,writ denied citing cont l cas.hall,dist,writ denied,cert.denied,d.
following the dictates of the eight corners rule,we examine the relevant portions of the cna policy and the underlying suit.the professional services exclusion contained in cna policy reads as follows 
the insurance provided to the additional insured does not apply to property damage arising out of an architect,engineer,or surveyor rendering of or failure to render any profession services including 
a.the preparing,approving,or failing to prepare or approve maps,shop drawings,opinions,reports,surveys,field orders,change orders or drawings and specifications and 
supervisory,or inspection activities performed as part of any related architectural or engineering activities.
in the underlying suit,the amended complaint alleged 
after having an opportunity to review the drilling profile,defendants signed off and approved the plans on or about december.the process of drilling began and the drill bore damaged empco pipelines.
defendants owed a duty to use ordinary care to analyze,review,supervise,construct,operate,and monitor the work so that empco pipelines would not be damaged.
when the two documents are examined together,it is clear that exxon bases liability at least in part on conduct that does not qualify under the professional services exclusion.exxon alleges that defendants approved the plans,the drill bore damaged empco pipelines,and d efendants owed a duty to use ordinary care to analyze,review,supervise,construct,operate,and monitor the work.although the allegations include conduct that arguably qualifies as professional service under the terms of the exclusion,approval of the plans,they also contain conduct that clearly does not fit within the exclusion,drilling,constructing,operating.
a liability insurer is obligated to defend a suit if the facts alleged in the pleadings would give rise to any claim within the coverage of the policy.see union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa merchs.fast motor lines.in determining whether any of the allegations would give rise to a claim within coverage of the policy,we read the allegations liberally in favor of the insured,with any doubts resolved in favor of the insured.see guar.ins.azrock,cir.as we noted in primrose operating national american insurance,i f any allegation in the complaint is even potentially covered by the policy then the insurer has a duty to defend its insured,cir emphases in original internal citations omitted.an e
