in this unusual petition for review arising out of a state administrative proceeding,the petitioners themselves argue that we lack jurisdiction to hear their complaints about what has transpired to date before the state agency.because the agency itself has not yet finally acted on the matter that is before it as is required to invoke our jurisdiction under d,we agree and dismiss the petition.
background 
the natural gas act nga requires a natural gas company to obtain from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc a certificate of public convenience and necessity before it may construct new natural gas transportation facilities or expand existing ones.c a.ferc is responsible for coordinating all federal authorizations applicable to the process.id.b.the nga also expressly preserves the rights of states under the coastal zone management act of,the clean air act,and the clean water act cwa.see d.under the cwa,any applicant for a federal license to construct or operate facilities that may result in discharge into navigable waters must provide the licensing or permitting agency here,ferc a certification from the state in which the discharge originates or will originate.a.the state,in turn,must evaluate the proposed project compliance with certain provisions of the cwa and set forth limitations and monitoring requirements necessary to assure that any applicant for a federal license or permit will comply with the cwa and with any other appropriate requirement of state law set forth in such certification.id.d.a condition imposed under the state certification shall become a condition on any federal license or permit subject to the provisions of this section.id.
on july,tennessee gas pipeline company,llc tennessee gas applied to ferc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity,which ferc eventually issued in march subject to,among other things,filing of proof that tennessee gas has received all applicable authorizations required under federal law or evidence of waiver thereof.in pursuit of one such authorization or waiver thereof,tennessee gas submitted an application to the massachusetts department of environmental protection massdep for water quality certification on june.on june,after almost a full year during which interested citizens and environmental organizations including petitioners participated in a nontestimonial process,tennessee gas received conditional certification for its proposed project in a letter from the western regional office of massdep signed by wetlands program chief david cameron.
the letter contained over forty conditions to the project approval,including a condition condition forbidding tennessee gas from conducting any work subject to this certification,including the cutting of trees,until the expiration of the appeal period set forth below and any appeal proceedings that may result from an appeal.the conditional certification also described the appeal process,explaining that c ertain persons shall have a right to request an adjudicatory hearing concerning certifications by the department,including a ny person aggrieved by this certification who has submitted written comments during the public comment period.in accordance with massachusetts regulations on the subject,the conditional certification provided that any person who wished to appeal was required to submit a notice of claim for adjudicatory hearing within days of the certification issuance.
petitioners took advantage of this provision,filing a notice of claim for adjudicatory hearing on july.in response,tennessee gas opposed petitioners request for a hearing and sought a stay of further administrative proceedings,claiming that once the agency had issued a conditional water quality certification,the state involvement in the process was at an end,with any further review to be pursued through a petition to this court.petitioners disagreed,as did massdep,which denied tennessee gas request for a stay and moved forward,scheduling a final decision to be issued by april.in early august,tennessee gas filed suit in the district of massachusetts seeking to bar massdep from engaging in further review.petitioners,in turn,hedged their bets.they filed the petition now before us in order to preserve some review of the june conditional water quality certification in the event that tennessee gas was correct.at the same time,they asked us to reject their petition on the grounds that tennessee gas is not correct that is to say,they claim that our review is premature until massdep completes its adjudicatory process.
ii.discussion 
we begin with the language of the statute that grants us the jurisdiction putatively invoked by this petition.we have exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of an order or action of a state administrative agency acting pursuant to federal law in ruling on an application,as pertinent here,for a water quality certification under a.d.in a literal sense,state agencies repeatedly take action in connection with applications for water quality certifications.they docket applications,review them,and express opinions about them.we see no reason,though,to think that congress wanted us to exercise immediate review over such preliminary and numerous steps that state agencies may take in processing an application before they actually act in the more relevant and consequential sense of granting or denying it.
pushing back on this common sense conclusion,tennessee gas points to the fact that d employs the term action,bereft of the modifier final.this contrasts with,for example,the text employed in the administrative procedure act apa,agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review,and with the text of b,which permits judicial review of ferc orders only after ferc denial of an application for rehearing.therefore,reasons tennessee gas,we should infer that,by authorizing our review of state agency action,congress did not limit such review to final agency action.
such a negative inference might have interpretative force in dealing with some other subject matter.see generally,barnhart sigmon coal,articulating the rule of statutory construction that courts should typically infer that congress intends differences in statutory language to effect differences in statutory application.here,though,the subject matter is judicial review of agency action,which review congress creates in the context of a and strong presumption that judicial review will be available only when agency action becomes final.bell new jersey,citing fpc metro.edison.to say that silence on the subject implies no requirement of finality would be to recognize this strong presumption only when it is of little benefit.
it is also unclear that congress reference to ferc internal review process in b,coupled with the lack of a similar reference in d to the internal review processes of state agencies,even raises the inference that tennessee gas claims.rather,there is a more plausible explanation for congress decision to write the statute this way unlike the ferc procedures described in b,which are the same for any applicant proposing a project in any state or states,the state procedures giving rise to orders reviewable under d may and undoubtedly do vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.thus,whereas it is reasonable to interpret a reference to ferc rehearing process as a signal that final agency action is required under b,it does not make sense to draw the negative inference that the lack of a reference in d to the variegated internal review mechanisms deployed by state agencies sends the opposite signal.simply put,the text of d,on its own or read alongside b,does not rebut the strong presumption that judicial review is available only following final agency action.
further reinforcement for the strong presumption restricting review until an agency has taken final action resides in congress numerous efforts to prevent states from unreasonably delaying the performance of their reserved roles in connection with natural gas projects.in connection with any permit required by feder
