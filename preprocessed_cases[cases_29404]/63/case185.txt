cross lake is located just outside of shreveport,louisiana,and is the main source of water for the city.in act of,the louisiana legislature authorized the transfer of cross lake to the city of shreveport.see.acts.in,the secretary of state conveyed all that portion of land belonging to the state of louisiana in what is known as the bed of cross lake to shreveport to provide a water supply to the city.the deed explicitly reserved to the state all minerals or mineral rights to and under said land,with a full and unrestricted right to the state,through its officers,agents or agencies,to enter thereon,and bore for oil,gas or any other mineral.it further reserved the right to drill and operate any well and also such other privileges as are reasonably requisite for the conduct of said operations,and the removal of any mineral.
the act authorizing the transfer of the lake to shreveport granted the city full and plenary power over said lake for the purpose of the protection and conservation of the city water supply.the state made a similar grant of authority in and extended the geographic scope of that authority to the land immediately surrounding the lake up to feet,see.acts.the city of shreveport is hereby granted full power and authority to adopt and enforce all needful police and sanitary ordinances and regulations for the protection of the bed and waters of cross lake from pollution and contamination from any source and is likewise granted similar power and control over the area surrounding said lake for a distance of five thousand feet,and in reiterated its grant of this authority,see.acts.
in,pursuant to authority granted under the louisiana constitution,shreveport adopted an updated home rule charter section v of the charter provides that shreveport shall have the power t o make all necessary regulations to protect the water supply of the city from pollution and other damage,and to exercise full and unlimited police power over the bed and waters of cross lake and for a distance of five thousand feet from the meander contour line and to pass any and all rules,regulations and ordinances deemed to be necessary for these purposes this grant of authority in shreveport home rule charter mirrors the grant of authority by the state in act of.
in,citing its authority to adopt ordinances designed to protect its water supply under both its home rule charter and state law,shreveport adopted ordinance.ordinance claims to be an overall legislative scheme to regulate hazardous activities,including but not limited to oil and gas exploration and production,that do or may pose a threat to the safety of the city water supply.the ordinance forbids any new drilling within feet of cross lake.it further sets up a comprehensive regulatory scheme governing all new drilling between and feet of cross lake.
in,louisiana created the louisiana office of conservation loc.the loc has the exclusive authority to grant or deny permits to drill and mine in the state of louisiana.louisiana law specifically precludes local governments from interfering with decisions made by the loc regarding drilling and mining.see.f.the statute provides that t he issuance of the permit by the commissioner of conservation shall be sufficient authorization to the holder of the permit to enter upon the property covered by the permit and to drill in search of minerals thereon.no other agency or political subdivision of the state shall have the authority,and they are hereby expressly forbidden,to prohibit or in any way interfere with the drilling of a well or test well in search of minerals by the holder of such a permit.id.
in the years following the conveyance of cross lake to the city of shreveport,louisiana has granted both numerous leases of its mineral interests under cross lake and permits authorizing drilling pursuant to those leases.emc acquired several mineral leases granted by the state to drill and mine under and around cross lake.emc did not obtain a permit from the loc to drill on a location within feet of cross lake.rather,recognizing ordinance restrictions on its operations,emc attempted to negotiate an agreement with shreveport officials that would have removed the ordinance prohibition against drilling within the foot restriction zone.those efforts officially failed in december when the city made it clear that no such variance to the ordinance restrictions would be granted.
in,emc brought this diversity lawsuit in federal district court.emc complained that shreveport had no authority to regulate its drilling operations around cross lake.it argued that the city was precluded from doing so because under both the deed conveying the lake to the city,and under state law governing drilling permits,the state has exclusive authority to regulate drilling around cross lake.it further argued that even if shreveport has some limited authority to regulate drilling around the lake,ordinance is not a reasonable exercise of that authority.additionally it argued that even if the ordinance is a valid exercise of the city legislative power,it constitutes a taking under both the louisiana and united states constitutions.finally,it argued that the ordinance violates its equal protection and due process rights.
in response to the city motion for summary judgment,the district court dismissed emc takings claim as time barred.the district court held that the three year prescription period started to run on the date ordinance was enacted in,rather than on the date of the city refusal to grant a variance to the ordinance restrictions in,and the prescription period ran before emc initiated its lawsuit in.on for summary judgment,it further held that shreveport had the authority under louisiana state law to adopt ordinances designed to protect its water supply,including those that restrict drilling around cross lake.after a bench trial,it held that shreveport acted reasonably within that authority in restricting drilling within feet of cross lake.emc appeals.
although not raised by either of the parties or addressed by the district court,we must first consider this court jurisdiction to hear this case the specific question in this case is whether emc has standing to challenge the city of shreveport ordinance as preempted by comprehensive state regulatory authority vested in the loc in the absence of a permit to drill issued by the state for a location within the area affected by the ordinance.under article iii of the united states constitution,federal courts are confined to adjudicating actual cases and controversies.const.art.iii,cl.standing,one of the doctrines arising under the case and controversy requirement,requires a plaintiff to demonstrate they have suffered an injury in fact the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant actions and the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.public citizen,bomer,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.an injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical lujan,at.at.
the city of shreveport suggests that emc lacks standing to challenge the validity of ordinance because it does
