after issuing our opinion,we granted the parties motions for rehearing on november,and obtained further briefing from the parties.without further oral argument,we withdraw our opinion of march,and substitute the following opinion.
in this oil and gas dispute,royalty owners and an oil and gas lessee allege that the previous lessee failed to fully develop oil and gas tracts near refugio,texas and sabotaged the wells before abandoning the lease.the lessee claims at issue in this appeal are for negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and tortious interference with business opportunity.the royalty owners claims are for statutory and common law waste,breach of alleged regulatory duty to plug wells properly,negligence,negligence per se,negligent misrepresentation,tortious interference with economic opportunity,breach of lease,and fraud.the trial court granted summary judgment on lessee claims not subject to this appeal and directed a verdict against the lessee on its remaining claims and against the royalty owners on their claims for statutory waste,negligence,negligence per se,tortious interference,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.the remaining royalty owner claims for statutory and common law waste and breach of contract went to verdict.the jury found in favor of the royalty owners.the court of appeals reversed the directed verdict and affirmed the jury verdict.we reverse and remand to the court of appeals.today,we also issue our opinion on rehearing in the companion case of exxon emerald oil gas,reh g op.
factual and procedural background 
the royalty owners consist of three miesches,the,and the dunns collectively the miesches they owned mineral interests on several thousand acres of land the field or field in refugio,texas.in the,humble oil and refining company,a predecessor of exxon corporation and exxon texas,collectively exxon,began acquiring mineral leases from the royalty owners.exxon derived its interests from four separate but similar mineral leases with the miesches.the leases collectively the lease or the lease included an atypical fifty percent royalty obligation and a stringent disclosure clause.during the term of the lease,exxon drilled wells and produced at least million barrels of oil and more than billion cubic feet of gas,resulting in the payment of more than million in royalties to the miesches.in the early and later in the next decade,exxon attempted to renegotiate a lower royalty because profitability of the operations was declining.as early as,the royalty owners requested that exxon provide them information and documentation to support exxon position that the field was being depleted and was no longer profitable at the fifty percent royalty.by,exxon had begun plugging some of the wells remaining in operation.the miesches sent a letter,dated august,advising exxon that in the event you exxon plug and abandon any wells in the field which are producing or capable of producing minerals in paying quantities to the royalty owners,exxon will be sued under the terms of the lease and the common law,both for present breach of contract and anticipatory damages 
walker and mcbroom,a potential operator for the miesches whom they engaged to evaluate the amount of reserves remaining in the field,advised them by letter of september,that exxon has exhausted any value of the field to them,and created substantial environmental hazards and suggested that the royalty owners pursue exxon geologic information of the field to aid in its future development,particularly if oil and gas prices substantially rise in the future.
on september,the royalty owners demanded by letter that exxon deliver all data and documents pertaining to the subject wells,includ ing drilling,production,completion and re completion data,well bore production or completion schematics or diagrams and flow line maps and surface facility diagrams or schematics.in the same letter,the royalty owners warned that plugging and abandonment of the six referenced wells would commit waste and would be contrary to public policy and laws and that the letter shall also be considered as formal demand not to plug the above referenced six wells,as such would cause us irreparable harm and commit waste.the royalty owners further informed exxon that they had located a group of oil and gas companies that are willing to accept the plugging obligation and assignment of the lease.
initially,the royalty owners asserted that exxon refused to provide any information,claiming that the information was proprietary.later,exxon claimed the information was too difficult to locate and retrieve.then,exxon agreed to provide the royalty owners a data room containing the requested information subject to a confidentiality agreement.the data room included a large quantity of information,but apparently did not contain the well logs for the plugged wells and did not contain exxon opinions and analysis interpreting the data.
exxon ultimately concluded that it could no longer profitably afford the lease unless the royalty owners agreed to reduce the royalty obligation or assign the leases to third parties.when negotiations to lower the royalty obligation failed,exxon continued plugging and abandoning the wells.as required by law,after exxon plugged each of the wells,it filed a plugging report with the texas railroad commission,the department that regulates oil and gas production.admin.code b comm of,plugging by letter dated august,exxon notified the royalty owners that it had completed its plugging operations.
in,after the lease terminated,the royalty owners entered into a lease agreement with pace west production,pace or pace west,later known as emerald oil gas company,emerald,for approximately of the acreage in the lease.in deciding whether to lease the land,emerald reviewed exxon public filings for the field,including the oil well plugging reports forms that exxon filed with the texas railroad commission.the filings seemed to indicate that exxon properly plugged the wells.however,emerald encountered problems from the beginning of its attempts to the plugged wells,including wellbores plugged with improperly cut and other junk in the wells,and plugs in locations other than those listed on the reports.the term junk is a term of art used in the oil and gas industry to refer to material such as steel or iron in a wellbore.tarrant county control imp.dist.no.one fullwood,per curiam see.admin.code d comm of,plugging prohibiting,with exceptions,the placement of material or junk in the wellbore during plugging operations.rock thomas,principal in people,the company hired by emerald oil gas to some of the plugged wells on the lease,explained that junk is something in the wellbore that you do know what it is.testimony at trial indicated that nuts,bolts,fiberglass pipe,tubing,packers,environmental contaminants and other items were placed in plugged wells in the field.
emerald sent the royalty owners a written status report on june,explaining that it encountered junk in the hole in one well,that exxon had cut the casing in several wells,and that cut and shifted casing had halted in at least one well.royalty owners alleged the cut casing in wells in the field caused problems,including increasing costs to wells,making it impossible to some wells,and substantially damaging their interests.in january,emerald obtained exxon internal well records on the lease from quintana,exxon partner on the adjoining tract,also leased by exxon.exxon internal records allegedly differed substantially from the railroad commission filings regarding its plugging of the wells in the lease.on january,emerald met with the royalty owners and explained the extent of the alleged damage to the wells due to exxon plugging techniques.
concluding that exxon intentionally sabotaged the field,emerald sued exxon in july,and amended the pleading in,claiming breach of regulatory duty to plug wells properly,breach of duty to avoid committing waste of natural resources,negligence per se in violating several sections of the natural resources code and railroad commission regulations,tortious interference with economic opportunity,negligent misrepresentation,and fraud.the fraud claim was predicated on false representations in public filings with the railroad commission that the wells were properly plugged.
the royalty owners intervened in the lawsuit in two separate groups in august and september of,and alleged statutory and common law waste,tortious interference with economic opportunity,breach of regulatory duty to plug wells properly,fraud,and environmental claims,and sought various measures of actual damages,exemplary damages,and attorney fees.in october,the royalty owners amended their petitions,adding claims for breach of contract for exxon alleged failure to develop the leasehold,negligence,negligence per se,and negligent misrepresentation.
reasoning that exxon owed no duty to future lessees such as emerald,the trial court granted in part exxon motion for summary judgment on emerald claims for breach of regulatory duty to plug wells properly,breach of common law and regulatory duties to avoid committing waste,and negligence per se.the court severed the partial summary judgment,and emerald appealed.the court of appeals reversed and remanded the claims to the trial court.see emerald oil gas,exxon,pet.granted.exxon appealed that judgment to this court in cause number,and we issue the opinion on rehearing in the companion case today.exxon emerald oil gas,reh g op.
the case proceeded to jury trial on emerald three common law claims fraud,negligent misrepresentation and tortious interference with economic opportunity and on all of the miesches claims,but the royalty owners abandoned their environmental claims before verdict.the trial court granted a directed verdict in exxon favor on emerald three remaining claims and on all of the royalty owners claims except common law and statutory waste and breach of lease.the jury found in favor of the royalty owners on the claims against exxon for waste and breach of lease,awarding million in actual damages for waste,million in punitive damages for acting with malice in conduct causing injury to the royalty owners,and million in damages for breach of lease.the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict.all parties appealed.the court of appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of the royalty owners and did not address the miesches claims that were dismissed on directed verdict.at.it also reversed the directed verdict against emerald on its claims against exxon for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and tortious interference,ruled against exxon on its affirmative defense of limitations and remanded the claims for a new trial.id.at.we granted exxon petition for review and issued our opinion.the parties sought rehearing,which we granted.
ii.law and analysis 
statute of limitations the royalty owners claims for statutory and common law waste,and emerald claims for negligent misrepresentation and tortious interference 
the royalty owners claims against exxon decided in this appeal are statutory and common law waste,breach of lease,and fraud emerald claims against exxon in this appeal are for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and tortious interference.exxon asserts that the claims are barred by limitations the parties do not dispute that a statute of limitations applies to the waste,negligent misrepresentation,and tortious interference claims against exxon.civ.prac.a.emerald claim for fraud and the miesches claim for breach of lease are subject to limitations periods and are addressed later in the opinion.see id.
causes of action accrue and statutes of limitations begin to run when facts come into existence that authorize a claimant to seek a judicial remedy.provident life accident ins.knott,johnson higgins of kenneco energy.when a cause of action accrues is normally a question of law.knott,at moreno sterling drug.
in this case,more than two years elapsed between the time that exxon asserted tortious conduct damaged the field and the date that emerald and the miesches sued exxon.emerald and the royalty owners assert that exxon plugging operations caused them injury.exxon advised the royalty owners by letter in august that it had completed plugging all wells in the field.thus,the alleged tortious conduct occurred by august.emerald filed suit in june,and the miesches intervened in the lawsuit in august and september to assert claims against exxon.both emerald and the miesches filed suit more than two years after the injuries occurred for these claims.however,emerald and the royalty owners argue that the law recognizes exceptions to limitations that apply in this case.
emerald and the royalty owners contend that they filed suit timely because exxon fraudulently concealed its wrongful conduct,tolling the statute of limitations,and that the nature of their injuries was difficult to discover,thus delaying accrual of their claims.see wagner brown,horwood,distinguishing fraudulent concealment from the discovery rule computer assocs.int l,altai.at trial,the jury found that the royalty owners discovered,or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered,on january,the waste committed by exxon.on that date emerald representatives met with the royalty owners and informed them,in the words of the court of appeals,about the full extent of damage to the wells and the numerous discrepancies in exxon plugging reports.at.the court of appeals concluded that the statute of limitations was tolled until that date,that the lawsuit filed in the summer of was therefore timely,and affirmed the trial court judgment.id.at.the court of appeals reasoned that the discovery rule tolls limitations until the royalty owners knew of enough damage to know that the problems regarding the wells were not isolated.id.at.emerald and the royalty owners do not dispute that,unless accrual of the cause of action is deferred or the statute of limitations tolled,the statute of limitations bars all of their claims addressed by the court of appeals except fraud and breach of contract,which have statutes of limitations.see.civ.prac.
conclusive evidence of emerald and the miesches knowledge of problems in the field 
we do not reach the question of the impact of the discovery rule or fraudulent concealment on the limitations period for the pending claims because emerald and the royalty owners had actual knowledge more than two years before they filed suit of exxon alleged wrongful actions and that those actions caused problems or injuries to their interests.the evidence of their actual knowledge is in documents written by or on behalf of emerald and the miesches,and it is conclusive.we review the relevant,undisputed facts.
exxon completed wells in the field and produced both oil and gas over the nearly forty years the parties did business together.by the mid mineral prices dropped,and production in the lease declined.exxon believed the field was becoming unprofitable at the fifty percent royalty and attempted to negotiate a lower royalty with the miesches.the effort was unavailing,and in the late exxon plugged wells in anticipation of terminating the lease.the royalty owners were not obligated to accept a lower royalty,and they were not convinced that the field was uneconomic.the miesches advised exxon by letter dated september,that they had received notice that it intended to plug and abandon six wells referenced in the letter.the letter was a formal demand not to plug the above referenced six wells,as such would cause us irreparable harm and commit waste,and would be contrary to public policy and laws.two weeks earlier,counsel for the miesches had also warned exxon in writing that it would be sued under the terms of the lease and the common law,both for present breach of contract and anticipatory damages if it plugged and abandoned wells in the field capable of producing in paying quantities.in their fourth amended petition in intervention the live pleading at trial,the royalty owners alleged,separate from their claim for breach of an implied covenant under the lease to reasonably develop the field,that they lost royalties due to exxon holding the lease but plugging wells instead of producing them.therefore,by september,the royalty owners had actual knowledge of facts underlying their claim of waste by exxon for failure to produce available reserves of oil and gas from existing wells on the lease.
notwithstanding this evidence,even if we assume that the royalty owners were not aware of problems allegedly impacting their lease interests by exxon plugging the wells by the time of the september letter,they assuredly were aware by august.that is the date of exxon letter advising them that it had completed plugging and abandoning the remaining wells in the field.accordingly,limitations forecloses the royalty owners waste claim.
on rehearing,the royalty owners argue that their claim for waste actually focused on intentional damage or sabotage to wells in the lease the first claim,discussed above,was waste occasioned by abandoning wells that were alleged to still be capable of producing in paying quantities.the second claim was for waste allegedly caused by sabotaging the wells as they were plugged.the royalty owners alleged that exxon intentionally damaged the wells to hinder or preclude subsequent of the wells,causing increased costs,loss of some wells necessitating drilling new wells in some instances,and reduction in revenues they could recover from the field.the wrongful conduct alleged included improperly cutting production casing in the wells,placing junk in the wells,placing plugs in the wells below the surface at undisclosed locations,and pumping contaminants into the wells.they pled that exxon conduct damaged the leasehold and interfered with the business opportunity of the royalty owners to further develop the field with another operator.
assuming these allegations are true,which we must for limitations analysis,emerald and the royalty owners were aware of or suspected problems resulting from exxon conduct well before they filed suit.in a june,report,emerald advised the royalty owners that it discovered that exxon improperly cut casing in a number of wells and there was junk in at least one well exxon had plugged.the miesches also acknowledge that emerald had discovered junk in at least one other well.the royalty owners argue that emerald report to them in june discussing cut casing and junk in a wellbore did not raise suspicion and does not constitute knowledge of damage to the wells.they also claim that the june letter does not say that exxon put junk in the wells.the royalty owners arguments contradict conclusive evidence from the trial,which we set forth in some detail below.
the royalty owners hired emerald to redevelop a portion of the field after the lease was terminated.emerald prepared the june report for the royalty owners on the status of its efforts to reopen part of the field.it states,in relevant part 
casing had been cut by exxon at for the well,
c asing had been cut by exxon for the well,
c asing had been cut by exxon for the well,
c asing was cut by exxon when plugged for the well,
c asing was cut when plugged could not drill past cuts at for well,
c asing cut by exxon when plugged for well,
c asing cut by exxon when plugged casing shifted and collapsed for well,and 
emerald encountered junk in hole for the well.
in addition to junk in well,the report points out that emerald discovered cut casing in seven wells prior to june.emerald principal,glenn lynch,testified at length at trial that leaving cut casing in oil wells before sealing them with cement is an improper plugging technique that creates costly and problems to the well for further mineral production,rendered some plugged wells impossible to and,he believed,was prohibited by railroad commission rules lynch testified that if casing is cut in the wellbore,it should be pulled.emerald found cut casing in the first couple of wells it attempted to when it began of the field in may.
the alleged junking of the wells and cutting of production casing in the wellbores prior to capping the wells is the conduct that emerald and the royalty owners characterize as deliberate sabotage of the wells,as violations of texas laws and railroad commission regulations,and as constituting illegal steps to intentionally and systematically damage the wells to prevent.there is no dispute that exxon was responsible for plugging the wells in the field,and the june report identifies exxon throughout the report as the party that had cut well casing in plugging the wells in the field.that was no surprise to emerald or the royalty owners because exxon had been the operator in the field for nearly four decades.
the royalty owners argue that they did not appreciate the significance of the statements in the report emerald sent to them in june.neither the miesches nor emerald contest that the damages exxon allegedly caused to the leasehold occurred before or that emerald and the miesches knew of improper plugging,cut casing,and junk placed in capped wells in the field before august,at least to the extent documented in the june report.the miesches contend that the evidence of cut casing is not notice that the wells were damaged or the field was impaired.however,their live pleadings alleged that junk was left in the wellbores,casing was cut in multiple places in the well holes,and these acts of exxon were the proximate cause of damages to the royalty owners.by june,the royalty owners had actual knowledge of this alleged conduct.the september letter from the miesches to exxon threatening to sue for waste if wells were plugged and the june report the emerald report to the miesches alleging damage to the wells by their terms conclusively establish that the royalty owners knew or suspected there were problems or damages allegedly caused by exxon to their interests in the lease.the limitations period began to run no later than september on the first waste claim and no later than june on the second waste claim.having actual notice of such problems,the royalty owners had two years under the applicable statutes of limitations to investigate the problems and file suit,or not.
emerald contracted with the royalty owners in may to wells and further develop a portion of the field.it admits to encountering problems in its initial attempts in.the june report,which lists the date for some of the wells,expressly notes that was commenced in the prior year for several wells,and and that exxon had cut the casing in these wells.emerald also acknowledges that it performed due diligence in accord with industry practice by reviewing exxon sworn railroad commission filings before entering the lease with the miesches in may.and,glenn lynch,a principal in emerald,testified that eighty to ninety percent of the commission filings,on which emerald relied,were inaccurate and that cut casing caused significant problems to.thus,emerald report indicates its belief that exxon actions allegedly caused further development in the field to be more difficult,more costly,or impossible and that many problems in the wells were not listed in railroad commission reports,at least some of which emerald had admittedly reviewed prior to entering the lease in.
emerald filed suit in july,more than two years after the accrual of its causes of action for tortious interference with business opportunity and for negligent misrepresentation arising from allegedly false railroad commission filings.the miesches claimed damages for waste when they intervened in august,more than two years after the september letter and the june report.these claims were untimely.
the court of appeals concluded that the royalty owners were not on notice of the damage to the lease until january when the royalty owners knew of enough damage to know that the problems regarding the wells were not isolated.at citation omitted.the applicable legal standard is the statute of limitations begins to run when a party has actual knowledge of a wrongful injury.knott,at.once a claimant learns of a wrongful injury,the statute of limitations begins to run even if the claimant does not yet know the specific cause of the injury the party responsible for it the full extent of it or the chances of avoiding it.ppg,ctrs.partners,internal citations omitted velsicol chem.winograd,tex holding that the statute of limitations on claim for damage to real property ran as soon as property owner knew of presence of a hazardous chemical on the property,not when the residue exceeded regulatory contamination levels.emerald and the miesches had actual knowledge by june that there were problems a number of wells in the field due to cut casing or junk.after being put on notice of the alleged harm or actions,the claimant must exercise reasonable diligence to investigate the suspected harm and file suit,if at all,within the limitations period.heci exploration neel,holding that r oyalty owners can not be oblivious to potentially injurious activity taking place in the field kpmg peat marwick harrison cnty.housing fin,noting that a plaintiff known loss from a wrongful premature sale of assets should have caused the plaintiff to investigate the mismanagement of the assets as well as a different defendant involvement in the mismanagement mooney harlin,holding that the statute of limitations runs from the time fraud could have been discovered.knowing that there were problems with wells in and documenting them in the june report,put emerald and the miesches on notice of actual or potential conduct.therefore,for limitations purposes,they had a duty to diligently investigate the suspected similar harm by the same operator in the field and file suit on these claims within two years of such notice.
the logic of the court of appeals holding would create serious issues with application of legislated deadlines for filing actions where conduct is known but the full extent of the damages may not be known.in this case,the law accorded both emerald and the miesches the statutory period to investigate the problems raised by emerald and to file claims for damages arising from exxon alleged conduct in the field.the limitations period began when facts came into existence that authorized them to seek a judicial remedy.see knott,at.a different rule that delays accrual of the cause of action until the putative claimant knew of enough damage to know the problems regarding the wells were not isolated would cause inconsistent and illogical results.such a rule would extend the limitations period for a suit arising from the eight wells,known from the june report to be damaged,beyond the period because,even though those wells were known to be damaged,limitations would not run until many more wells were known to be damaged.alternatively,application of such a rule would mean that limitations may begin to run on the wells with known damage but not on other wells in the field,setting up multiple limitations periods to be applied to different wells in the same field for the same types of damage caused by the same operator during the same period of time,and undermining or eviscerating the legal duty of an injured party to be diligent in protecting his interests.this is not to mention the difficult and litigious problem of determining when there are enough problems that they are not considered to be isolated.here,unlike ppg industries,emerald alleged consistent problems with a high percentage of wells from the beginning of its efforts.see at.for these and other reasons,we have held that when a person is on notice of conduct,the claimant has a duty to use reasonable diligence to discover if he has a claim and,if so,to file it within the limitations period to preserve his right to recover.heci exploration,at.
royalty owners testimony concerning emerald june report of problems in the field 
the june report establishes that emerald and the royalty owners were made aware of problems caused by exxon.emerald prepared the report and sent it to the royalty owners.the trial testimony of the royalty owners concerning this document confirms their knowledge by june of problems in exxon capping of the wells.three royalty owners testified at.michael,morgan dunn,and laurie miesch.michael and morgan dunn discussed the june report.laurie miesch did not.
royalty owner michael was a key representative for the royalty owners.at trial he testified 
question so,would you agree with me now,that at least for chronology sake,that in june of,you were advised by taylor of emerald of problems they were having reentering the wells because of cut casing and junk in the hole 
right here from what i saw from this june report that i do remember it,of course,they reported that they had some problems with some wells.
question you do you not suggesting that you did receive this letter,are you 
no,i apparently did if it was in my deposition in my file.
emphasis added.explained that emerald advised in the june report that it encountered problems the wellbores due to cut casing and junk in the hole.emerald contends in its brief that michael quoted above did not understand the june letter to mean that exxon had done anything to deviate from industry standards or had damaged the wells.did not state that the report was insignificant or that it did not make him aware of any problems with plugging in the field.he testified,as cited above,that the report advised of problems with the wells.he also testified that he was aware of problems in exxon abandonment of the field,but i figured it was not necessarily showing some kind of trend of a problem until they came to us in january,referring to emerald meeting with the royalty owners to explain the extent of damage to wells in the field.knowledge of damage to interests need not rise to the level of a trend before claimants are charged under the law with notice of its occurrence.as ppg industries states,knowledge of actual causes and possible cures or the full extent of the injury is not necessary to preclude application of the discovery rule.at.knowledge of injury initiates the accrual of the cause of action and triggers the putative claimant duty to exercise reasonable diligence to investigate the problem,even if the claimant does not know the specific cause of the injury or the full extent of it.id.
not having oil and gas expertise,morgan dunn,a spokesperson and organizational person for the royalty owners,explained that she had no idea what the significance of shifting casing was,in reference to a november letter from emerald employee johnny yocham mentioning the term.lynch had testified that cutting production casing without pulling it from the well in capping operations may allow the casing to shift such that a well with offset casing in the well would be difficult if not impossible.notwithstanding the limits of her technical knowledge,morgan dunn affirmed that she knew from the june report that exxon had cut casing,which had shifted and collapsed in wells it capped in the field,and also knew of junk left in a well exxon had capped.
the miesches claim that these actions by exxon were intentional acts of sabotage,violated the law,and caused them substantial damages.although it is not within the scope of our review to determine whether these assertions are true or not,we can not escape the significance of the documents in the record or these statements by and to the miesches in light of the question we the royalty owners were on notice more than two years before filing suit of exxon alleged conduct that they claim caused the damages.the inescapable conclusion is that the royalty owners were aware no later than june from undisputed facts of conduct they suspected or knew allegedly injured their property interests.see city of keller wilson,explaining that courts conducting a review can not ignore evidence that has one logical conclusion.
we therefore conclude that the assertion of fraudulent concealment to toll limitations and of the discovery rule to postpone accrual of the limitations period are unavailing here.irrespective of the potential effect of fraudulent concealment or the discovery rule on limitations,actual knowledge of alleged conduct starts the clock on the limitations period.see kpmg,at.emerald claims for negligent misrepresentation and tortious interference with business opportunity are barred by limitations.the royalty owners claims for statutory and common law waste are barred by limitations.
breach of lease 
the royalty owners claim that exxon failed to fully develop two productive zones in the field,and,in violation of the lease development clause.exxon counters that the royalty owners misread the term fully develop in the development clause,article,and instead incorporate a provision from article that is a separate covenant that does not define exxon obligation to develop the field.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment,holding that the testimony of the royalty owners expert,george hite,was some evidence that the field was capable of further production in paying quantities until and that exxon did not drill and complete wells in two productive zones,and at.exxon contends no evidence supports the jury finding that exxon failed to fulfill its obligations under the development clause of the oil and gas lease 
there are four oil and gas lease agreements,and the development clauses in them have somewhat different terminology.at trial,the parties used the lease as the source of the terms and conditions of the parties obligations,and exxon acknowledged that the terms of the leases were similar the development clause is article of the lease.article also contains relevant provisions.
article a.l essee covenants and agrees to prosecute diligently a continuous drilling and development program until said tract is fully developed for oil or gas.
first tract shall be deemed fully developed within the preceding paragraph of this article if found to be productive of oil or gas or sulphur when there has been drilled to each horizon or stratum capable of producing oil or sulphur one well for the number of acres fixed by the railroad commission in determining the spacing pattern applicable to said first tract in the absence of such determination of a spacing pattern by said railroad commission said first tract shall be deemed fully developed when at least one well has been drilled and completed in each horizon or stratum capable of producing oil or sulphur in paying quantities for each twenty acres of said tract.first tract shall be deemed fully developed within the intent of the preceding paragraph if found to be productive of gas only when one well has been drilled and completed to each horizon or stratum capable of producing gas in paying quantities for the number of acres fixed by the railroad commission in determining the spacing pattern applicable to said tract for the production of gas,or,in the absence of such determination,one well for each one hundred sixty acres of said tract so capable of producing gas in paying quantities.
article.by the words with diligence,diligence,or diligently,as used in this instrument,is meant,in each instance,that degree of action,conduct and effort which is consistent with that which would characterize the action and conduct and effort of a prudent and skillful oil operator possessed of ample equipment,material and money,and unhampered by obligations to third parties,and actuated by an honest desire to carry out and fulfill in good faith each and every obligation imposed upon the lessee by this lease.lessee shall always develop and operate the leased premises for the production of oil and gas in accordance with the best practices of the industry at the applicable time,to the end that the full value of the leased premises for oil and gas shall be ascertained,conserved,and realized.
emphasis added.
before we address the legal sufficiency of the evidence,we must first determine the scope of exxon development obligations under the lease.an oil and gas lease is a contract,and its terms are interpreted as such.tittizer union gas,accord valence operating dorsett,interpreting an oil and gas lease using contract principles.in construing an unambiguous oil and gas lease,we seek to enforce the intention of the parties as it is expressed in the lease.tittizer,at.
general development 
the lease contains a development clause,article.the general development obligation in article a relied on by the miesches requires exxon to prosecute diligently a continuous drilling and development program until said tract is fully developed for oil and gas.emphasis added.the next paragraph of article a then provides definitions of fully developed for oil and gas.
the obligation to fully develop article 
the field shall be deemed fully developed within the intent of the preceding paragraph of this article when at least one well has been drilled and completed in each horizon capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities for each twenty acres of land for oil production and for each of land for gas production this is a common definition in an oil and gas lease development clause.howard williams charles meyers,oil and gas law,at ed.
to understand the obligation to fully develop,one must know the meaning of drill and complete in the development clause.the lease does not define drill or complete.it is a well recognized canon of construction that technical words are to be interpreted as usually understood by persons in the business to which they relate,unless there is evidence that the words were used in a different sense.barrett ferrell,writ ref.in oil and gas parlance,drilling refers to the a ct of boring a hole through which oil gas may be produced if encountered in commercial quantities.howard williams charles meyers,oil and gas law manual of oil and gas terms at ed.a completed well refers to a well capable of producing oil or gas.id.at emphasis added.the completion of a well can also refer to those processes necessary before production occurs such as perforating the casing and washing out the drilling mud.id.at.
certainly,the parties can define the operator duty to drill and complete a well differently under a contract.for example,
c ompensation for drilling an oil or gas well may be made contingent upon the discovery of oil or gas in paying quantities,but a contract will not be so construed in the absence of a clear expression or implication of such intent by the contract the courts in construing contracts for the drilling of wells are not disposed to imply warranties as to production.
barrett,at holding that a well was completed even though it was a dry hole citing summers,the law of oil and gas perm.ed.these definitions in the lease show that for a well to be considered drilled and completed as required by the development clause,a hole must be bored in the ground,and if oil or gas in paying quantities is encountered,the casing must be perforated or otherwise prepared for production.the article a development clause does not obligate the operator to produce all oil and gas that can be produced in paying quantities.the duty is to drill and complete at least one well capable of producing in paying quantities.the term in paying quantities specifies a characteristic of the well to be drilled,not the volume of production required.the royalty owners statement of the duty omits the in paying quantities term,but all four definitions in the lease of fully develop in article a for oil and for gas in each tract includes this language 
this definition of a completed well in the treatises,where the term is not defined in an oil and gas lease,is also the one recognized by texas courts.see id.at citing cannon wingard,writ ref.a well need not be a producing well to be completed it only needs to be capable of producing oil or gas.seale major oil.civ.app.eastland,no writ noting that completion of a well does not mean it is an oil or gas producer,but refers to completion of the required work on the well whether it becomes a producer or not.
article of the lease contains two sentences.the first sentence defines diligence,a term used in the general development clause in article a.it is defined as the conduct of a prudent and skillful oil operator actuated by an honest desire to fulfill in good faith each obligation in the lease.although not argued to the court of appeals or mentioned in the court of appeals opinion,the miesches argue in this court that the second sentence of article sets out the determinative language for defining exxon duty to develop the field 
lessee shall always develop and operate the leased premises for the production of oil and gas in accordance with the best practices of the industry at the applicable time,to the end that the full value of the leased premises for oil and gas shall be ascertained,conserved,and realized.
royalty owners argue,in effect,that this term is a warranty of a level of produce all oil and gas in each zone per the specified acreage for each well that can be produced in paying quantities.while not an unreasonable agreement to strike,the question is whether the lease contained that obligation given its somewhat less burdensome definition of the development obligation in article a,discussed above.
articles and are the determinative provisions in the dispute over the development obligation the miesches contend that under the lease,exxon was required to develop the tract fully by not only drilling and completing in each zone an oil well for every twenty acres and a gas well for every acres,but also developing the oil and gas to realize the full value from each well in each horizon.they acknowledge that under article,exxon had a right to abandon the lease,but contend it could do so only after producing the full value of oil and gas available in the field 
at trial,the miesches expert,hite,opined that exxon should have drilled or reworked an additional fifteen wells in the zone and additional wells in the zone to fully develop those zones.although he acknowledged that exxon would have had to commit an additional million to continue producing from the field,he opined that wells in those two zones would have produced oil and gas in paying quantities for an additional eight years after the field was abandoned in.however,in this court,the royalty owners acknowledge that exxon complied with the spacing requirements of article of the complete at least one well in every zone for each twenty acres for oil and one well completed in every zone for each acres for do not argue that exxon had a duty to drill additional wells in the field.likewise,the miesches do not argue that exxon had a duty to drill additional wells in the or zones.
they take the position in this court that exxon breached the lease by failing to produce all the oil and gas in horizons and that was available in paying quantities from existing wells.hite charts of the production from the wells in the lease were admitted at trial.the charts show that exxon drilled at least one well in each zone and produced cubic feet of gas and barrels of oil in zone and cubic feet of gas and barrels of oil in zone.hite agreed that exxon drilled at least one well in and at least one well in and both wells produced in paying quantities in each zone 
the miesches argue that exxon did not complete every well in the and zones.they also contend that the article duty to complete the wells required exxon to produce all oil and gas in zones and available in paying quantities.the miesches equate complete with the article a duty to fully develop and define fully develop as fully realizing all oil and gas available in paying quantities in each zone per the specified acreage.
the royalty owners analysis of articles and of the lease contradict its express terms and do not harmonize the terms in those articles.as we noted,article a of the lease expressly provides that the duty to fully develop is satisfied by only drilling one well in each zone per the designated acreage and preparing it for production,even in the unlikely event that no production occurs.that obligation is less onerous than producing all oil and gas available in paying quantities from the wells in the two zones.as a matter of law,exxon completed wells in zones and by not only drilling them and preparing them for production,but producing significant quantities of hydrocarbons from those zones,according to hite numbers.
there is a difference between article obligation to fully develop the tracts and article obligation to realize the full value of the tracts.fulfilling the duty in article to complete a well in each horizon would not satisfy article.the former duty arises from the development clauses in article.the royalty owners do not contend that exxon had a duty to drill more wells,and likewise do not contend in this court that the wells completed should have pierced additional zones in the field.they concede that zones and were pierced by wells exxon drilled but contend that the zones were not sufficiently worked to realize their full value.they contend that article requirement to realize the full value of operations is incorporated into the general development obligation of article,even though fully developed is the development duty specifically defined later in article.article does not include this sentence in the definition of diligence it defines diligence in the first sentence.the miesches position would mean that fully developed means one thing in the general development obligation of article a and something different in a latter paragraph of article a,which defines fully develop as drilling and completing at least one well in each zone on specified acreage for oil or gas production.there is no reference in article to an obligation to realize the full value of available hydrocarbons.to bridge that gap,the miesches argue that completing a well,a term in the specific development obligation in article a,means realizing its full value per article.but the lease does not define completion of a well,and nothing in articles or indicates that completion means to realize the full value,or all hydrocarbons available in paying quantities of each zone for the specified acreage.and the second sentence of article does not state that it is part of the definition of diligently or that it defines completed wells 
hence,under one interpretation of the lease,we are confronted with two different duties,both expressly set forth in the lease and one contradictory to the other where an ambiguity has not been raised by the parties,the interpretation of a contract is a question of law.seagull energy e p,eland energy.the duty to fully develop in article a is less onerous and is inconsistent with a duty to fully develop as defined by the miesches in article.we attempt to harmonize these provisions while giving effect to both.if the second sentence of article is the preeminent duty,it would vitiate the definition of fully develop in article a.see valence operating dorsett,holding that courts should harmonize the provisions of a contract such that none are rendered meaningless.article provides the definition of this duty.it expressly defines fully develop and states that the tracts of land shall be deemed fully developed within the intent of the preceding paragraph.emphasis added.the preceding paragraph is the general development obligation that introduced the term fully develop in the lease the second paragraph in article a defines fully develop.article a is more specific than article in addressing the development obligations in the lease.see forbau aetna life ins,noting that a specific contractual provision controls over the general provision concerning the same issue southland royalty pan am.petroleum,holding specific provision for payment of gas royalty controls over a less specific provision.
the second sentence of article includes aspirational terminology that exxon operate in accordance with the best practices of the industry to the end and that the full value of the lease be ascertained,conserved and realized.article a development language is mandatory.
clearly the extent of the duty to develop was defined by the parties in article.holding that article trumps this defined duty would render meaningless article a specifically defined obligation to fully develop and potentially eliminate the spacing requirements for wells drilled in the lease and require more wells subject to applicable railroad commission regulations to fully realize the mineral horizons.where the lease expressly defines the duty,we will not impose a more stringent obligation unless it is clear that the parties intended to warrant production beyond that defined obligation.see barrett,at.this reading of the lease harmonizes and gives effect to both articles.we conclude that the parties expressed intent was to define in article a the duty of the operator to develop the field.the aspirational language in article informs the duties in article such that they should be performed in accordance with the best practices of the industry with the goal of fully developing the tracts.
evidence of fulfillment of development duty 
having ascertained the scope of exxon development obligations,we now turn to exxon argument that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the breach of lease claim.because exxon is attacking the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting an adverse finding on an issue for which it did not have the burden of proof,exxon must show that no evidence supports the jury adverse finding.see croucher croucher.evidence is legally sufficient if it would enable reasonable and people to reach the verdict under review.city of keller,at.we credit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could,and disregard contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.id.
hite testified that fully developed means there are a sufficient number of wells in it to get the reserves.and when asked whether exxon completed in the and the,in every well,that exxon had good probability of producing oil and gas in those two zones,he answered n o,they did.however,when asked whether drilling the and completing it in two wells complete d that zone in the wells on this tract that would penetrate that zone in paying quantities,he answered i f your question is,did the two wells fully develop the lease,the answer is no.asked whether the wells emerald completed in were completed in a manner,he answered n o,it was not.hite opined that exxon violated the lease by not producing more extensively,or exhausting the production,from the wells in zones and.he testified that zones and had remaining reserve potential and that exxon had information indicating they could have been developed further.
hite stated assumption for his opinions is that fully develop meant to fully exploit the reserves in zones and.as we explained,the duty undertaken under the language of the development clause is to fully develop,not fully exploit the zones.under the contractual standard in the lease,the evidence does not support hite conclusions.hite charts of the production from the wells in the lease,admitted at trial,show that exxon drilled at least one well in each zone and produced cubic feet of gas and barrels of oil in zone and cubic feet of gas and barrels of oil in zone.the royalty owners submitted evidence establishing that exxon drilled at least one well in both zones and and both wells produced in paying quantities.they also conceded that the well spacing requirements were met.evidence that further development potential existed when exxon abandoned the leasehold in is no evidence that exxon failed to comply with the parties obligations embodied in the development clause.and evidence that exxon did not fully exploit the reserves in and is no evidence that exxon did not drill and complete the requisite number of wells for zones and.the evidence establishes that exxon completed at least one well capable of producing in paying quantities in each zone for every twenty acres for oil and every acres for gas.therefore,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment in favor of exxon on the royalty owners breach of lease claim 
unlike most of emerald and the royalty owners other claims,which have a statute of limitations,the statute of limitations for fraud is four years.civ.prac.a.the statute of limitations for fraud begins to run from the time the party knew of the misrepresentation.little smith,t he statute does not begin to run until the claimant knew or should have known of facts that in the exercise of reasonable diligence would have led to the discovery of the wrongful act.
emerald claims that exxon committed fraud by filing plugging reports with the railroad commission that deliberately misrepresented that it properly plugged the wells when it did not.that conduct allegedly caused emerald increased costs to wells and made of some wells impossible resulting in loss of revenues.at trial,the royalty owners asserted fraud both for filing false and misrepresenting the remaining reserves in the field.at the court of appeals,having recovered on other claims,the miesches conditionally appealed the trial court fraud judgment but only on the issue of the remaining reserves.
the trial court granted exxon motion for directed verdict on both emerald and the miesches fraud claims,therefore,there was no fact finding identifying the dates that emerald learned of alleged false plugging reports or that exxon allegedly misrepresented the reserves to the royalty owners.however,emerald notes that the first place subsequent operators turn is to those very filings at the railroad commission when deciding whether redevelopment can be economically undertaken.lynch testified that emerald reviewed the for the field.the june letter states that emerald encountered cut casing in the wells on the lease in and junk in the well prior to june.thus,emerald may have learned about the asserted misrepresentations on or around that date.based on either of these dates,the fraud claim filed by emerald would be timely,and therefore,we reach the merits of emerald fraud claim 
emerald fraud claim 
the court of appeals reversed the trial court directed verdict on emerald fraud claim,holding that the jury should have been allowed to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to establish fraud.it asserted that the evidence did not conclusively disprove the reliance element of the fraud claim.in reviewing a trial court directed verdict,we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the person suffering an adverse judgment and decide whether there is any evidence of probative value to raise an issue of material fact on the question presented.henderson travelers ins.we do not hold that public filings,such as railroad commission reports,alone satisfy the reliance element of fraud.we conclude there was some evidence presented at trial tending to show that exxon knew,at the time it filed the plugging reports,of an especial likelihood that the identified future operators would rely on the inaccurate plugging reports.we,therefore,agree with the court of appeals on this issue.
a plaintiff seeking to prevail on a fraud claim must prove that the defendant made a material misrepresentation the defendant knew the representation was false or made the representation recklessly without any knowledge of its truth the defendant made the representation with the intent that the other party would act on that representation or intended to induce the party reliance on the representation and the plaintiff suffered an injury by actively and justifiably relying on that representation.see desantis wackenhut,trenholm ratcliff.
emerald claims that exxon committed fraud by misrepresenting material information in its plugging reports to the railroad commission with the intent that known lessees and lessors of such mineral interests would rely on the information in the future.emerald claims,as a result of its reliance,that it is entitled to damages measured by the value of lost wells and minerals,the additional costs of reentering those wells that were improperly plugged,and the increased risk of loss of producing zones and wells due to improper plugging.the court of appeals held that evidence that exxon knew that unidentified,subsequent lessees and operators might rely on railroad commission filings to make business decisions was sufficient to satisfy the reliance element of fraud.at.exxon argues that the court of appeals decision is erroneous for two reasons.first,exxon argues there is no evidence that future operators would rely on the plugging reports because the reports only purpose is to allow the state to protect against pollution.second,exxon argues that emerald approach reduces the reliance element of fraud to mere foreseeability,counter to the court analysis in ernst young,pacific mutual life insurance,s.
we begin with the duty to plug wells.proper plugging is the responsibility of the operator of the well.reg.admin.code c,amended by.reg.current version at.admin.code c comm of,plugging.the railroad commission mandates 
material that would hamper or prevent of a well shall not be placed in any wellbore during plugging operations pipe and unretrievable junk shall not be cemented in the hole during plugging operations without prior approval by the district director or the director delegate.
admin.code d comm of,plugging.exxon argues that this section and similar plugging requirements are not intended to benefit future operators,but only to protect the environment.thus,exxon argues,no evidence supports emerald argument that there was an especial likelihood that exxon knew future operators would rely on the reports because that is not the reports purpose.
although the railroad commission explained that it revised section to protect fresh water in the state from pollution,the plugging reports are not limited to this purpose.reg.at.one of the objectives of the plugging regulations is to prevent plugging of wells that hinder or prevent wells,which could be desired by the same or subsequent owners or operators.id.to police this regulation,the commission requires that the plugging reports be verified under oath,be filed within thirty days after the plugging is completed,and disclose the methods used to plug a well.id.at.thus,the purpose of requiring operators to file plugging reports with the commission is to ensure that operators follow a plugging procedure that not only prevents pollution,but also allows into the wells for commercial purposes.
however,the mere fact that subsequent lessees might or should rely on statements in exxon plugging reports alone is not sufficient to establish an intent to induce reliance,as the court of appeals held and as emerald argues.ernst young,at.in ernst young,we considered the proof necessary to establish the reliance element of a fraud claim.although we declined to decide whether to adopt the standard outlined in section of the restatement second of torts,we concluded that this standard is consistent with texas fraud jurisprudence.id.section provides 
one who makes a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability to the persons or class of persons whom he intends or has reason to expect to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation,for pecuniary loss suffered by them through their justifiable reliance in the type of transaction in which he intends or has reason to expect their conduct to be influenced.
restatement second of torts.like the defendants in ernst young,exxon argues that this approach reduces the element to a foreseeability standard.we rejected that argument in ernst young,holding that section standard requires more than mere foreseeability the claimant reliance must be especially likely and justifiable,and the transaction sued upon must be the type the defendant contemplated.ernst young,at see also grant thornton llp prospect high income fund,quoting ernst young,at.evidence that reliance on false public information as part of a general industry practice is insufficient,as a matter of law,to prove an intent to induce reliance.see ernst young at.even an obvious risk that a misrepresentation might be repeated to a third party is not sufficient to satisfy the standard.a plaintiff must show that t he maker of the misrepresentation has information that would lead a reasonable man to conclude that there is an especial likelihood that it will reach those persons and will influence their conduct.restatement second of torts cmt.d,quoted in ernst young,at.the standard is not met if a defendant merely foresees that some party may rely on statements made in a public filing.
therefore,if the evidence shows only that exxon made material misrepresentations in its plugging reports to the railroad commission and knew that lessors and operators in the future may rely on the filings,such evidence would fail as a matter of law under the ernst young standard.see ernst young,at.such a holding would open the cause of action to any person who subsequently relied on any public stocks and bonds,security interests,real property deeds,and tax few limits in sight.the reliance element of fraud is a focused inquiry,more akin to a rifle shot than a shotgun blast.reliance is not satisfied by evidence that a misrepresentation may be read in the future by some unknown member of the public or of a specific industry.
here,however,there is some evidence that exxon knew of an especial likelihood that emerald specifically would rely on the plugging reports in a transaction being considered at the time it filed the plugging reports.in,exxon concluded that it could no longer profitably operate the leases unless exxon royalty obligation could be renegotiated.the negotiations failed,and exxon abandoned the field,plugging the last well in the lease in.in their letter of september,to exxon,the royalty owners stated,w e have located a group of oil and gas companies that are willing to accept the plugging obligations and an assignment of the above referenced six wells and certain acreage around each well.they also offered their consent to assign all of exxon right,title,and interest in the leases to several companies and indicated their interest in future oil and gas operations in the lease.
in,pace production company expressed that it was most anxious to proceed with production in the lease and offered to purchase exxon interest.it renewed its offer in january.by letter of july,exxon advised each of the royalty owners that pace had expressed an interest in the lease.on may,pace west production acquired the interests to develop the lease from the royalty owners.
exxon knew the royalty owners had a continuing interest in further developing the lease,received offers from the putative subsequent lessee to purchase exxon interest in the lease,and knew the transaction proposed by the miesches and emerald predecessors was the continued production of oil and gas in a portion of the lease.exxon argues that the company that made offers on the miesches oil and gas interests was pace production company,which is a different company than emerald alleged predecessor pace west production.we searched the record to determine if there was legally sufficient evidence of this proposition.a may,agreement for waivers between emerald and the royalty owners states that emerald was formerly known as pace west production,and also formerly known as pace west production,an undated memorandum of amended oil and gas lease and security agreement also states that emerald was formerly known as pace west.additionally,glenn lynch,a representative from emerald,testified that emerald was formerly pace west.royalty owner michael explained that emerald was operating under another name,pace west,when it made an initial offer to reopen some of the wells in the lease.this evidence raises a fact issue and precludes granting a directed verdict on the issue.
thus,legally sufficient evidence in the record supports the claim that exxon had information that would lead a reasonable person to conclude there was an especial likelihood emerald would rely on exxon allegedly inaccurate filings with the railroad commission.the question of whether the are inaccurate is not before us and we do not decide it.we hold that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on emerald fraud claim on the ground that there was no evidence of the element of the claim.accordingly,the trial court grant of directed verdict on the fraud claim on this basis was in error 
royalty owners remaining claims 
at the court of appeals,the royalty owners defended the trial court judgment in their favor on the waste and breach of lease claims and conditionally challenged the trial court directed verdict on their claims for negligence,negligence per se,negligent misrepresentation,tortious interference with economic opportunity,breach of regulatory duty to plug wells properly,and fraud in allegedly making misrepresentations of the remaining reserves in the field.they asserted that their fraud claims are not precluded by the lease and are supported by the evidence.the court of appeals upheld the trial court judgment in their favor and did not address the claims the royalty owners conditionally challenged.the royalty owners briefed the claims conditionally appeale
