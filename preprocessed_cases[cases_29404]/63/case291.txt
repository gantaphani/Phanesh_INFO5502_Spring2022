plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged that the design of defendants retail gasoline dispensers was fundamentally flawed due to a residual fuel occurence when plaintiffs purchased premium grade fuel,they received between two and of a gallon of residual fuel from the previous transaction,and therefore were overcharged when the previous purchaser had selected or regular grade fuel.plaintiffs sought to have defendants remedy this situation by developing a more accurate dispenser or pricing technology,or displaying disclosures at the point of purchase.these allegations fueled plaintiffs common law and statutory consumer protection claims 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs second amended complaint without leave to amend because the district court committed no legal error.
background 
plaintiffs 
defendants sell motor fuel to retail customers at gas stations throughout the united states.plaintiffs are six individual retail purchasers of motor fuel with an advertised octane rating of or higher,which was advertised,marketed,distributed,sold,by defendants 
plaintiffs alleged that defendants use gasoline dispensers at their gas stations that are less expensive to install and maintain than the previous variety.plaintiffs took issue with these dispensers because these nozzles create the residual fuel problem described above.
plaintiffs alleged that defendants could and should remedy the residual fuel problem,and proposed three remedies.first,plaintiffs asserted that defendants could implement technological devices that would enable a single nozzle pump to deliver of the grade of gasoline contracted for,yet such technology has not been implemented.plaintiffs conceded,however,that technology to completely eliminate the residual fuel problem may turn out not to be or feasible.in the alternative,plaintiffs alleged that defendants could install technology to charge customers at a lower price for any residual fuel pumped for a prior transaction.third,as a remedy of last resort,plaintiffs sought the addition of corrective disclosures to the gas pumps electronic display screens that would alert customers to the residual fuel situation.plaintiffs submitted no further factual allegations regarding these suggested remedies.
california regulation of gasoline dispensing devices 
inspection and certification of gasoline dispenser designs 
the california department of food and agriculture division of measurement standards dms regulates retail gasoline dispensing.see cal.bus,a b.any design of commercial weighing and measuring devices must be submitted to dms for certification that the submitted design meets the requirements of california regulatory regime.see cal.bus.if a device is inspected and deemed lawful,or correct,it is marked with a seal to be displayed to customers,identifying it as such.see cal.bus,c defining correct as meeting all requirements of california law.it is illegal to sell or use commercially any weighing or measuring device of a type or design which has not first been so approved cal.bus.
handbook standards restrictions on draining and price changing 
california technical requirements for commercial weighing and measuring adopt,by reference,the latest standards as recommended by the national conference on weights and measures ncwm and published in the national institute of standards and technology nist handbook specifications and tolerances,and other technical requirements for weighing and measuring devices handbook.cal.bus.see regs.tit,to earn the mandatory seal of approval from dms,weighing and measuring devices sold or used commercially in california must conform to handbook.see regs.tit.
handbook standards require two pertinent dispenser design features.first,discharging or draining of gasoline from the meter or hose is prohibited.second,if dispensers offer multiple grades of gasoline at different prices per grade,the selection of the unit price shall be made prior to delivery using controls on the device or other controls.a system shall not permit a change to the unit price during delivery of the product.nist handbook.
california air resources board requirements of single nozzle,single hose dispensers 
in addition to complying with the requirements of the dms,gasoline service stations must conform to the requirements of the california environmental protection agency air resources board arb.the arb certification procedure for vapor recovery systems at gasoline dispensing facilities arb cp,is incorporated by reference into the california administrative code.regs.tit.to earn this certification,all facilities installed since must use,gasoline dispensers.see arb cp,
procedural history 
plaintiffs second amended complaint in this diversity action presented six claims under california law breach of contract breach of the duties of good faith and fair dealing breach of express and implied warranties a claim predicated on california consumer legal remedies act clra,california civil code et a claim predicated on california unfair competition law ucl,california business and professions code et and a claim predicated on california false advertising law fal,california business and professions code et.defendants,in turn,filed a joint motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.
defendants presented four grounds for dismissal.defendants first argued that california regulatory scheme precluded any liability for the residual fuel problem because it mandates the dispenser and pricing features to which plaintiff objected.second,defendants contended that plaintiffs common law claims should be dismissed because they failed to comply with statutory notice requirements,and because plaintiffs claim alleging breach of the duties of good faith and fair dealing was duplicative of their breach of contract claim.third,defendants argued that any claim or relief that would mandate additional or different disclosures for octane labels was preempted by the federal petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,and the federal trade commission ftc posting rule,et.finally,defendants argued that the court should abstain from deciding the case under california equitable abstention doctrine,because the relief sought would embroil the court in economic and policy determinations and monitoring activities already governed by a comprehensive state regulatory scheme.
the district court granted defendants motion without argument,dismissing plaintiffs second amended complaint in its entirety without leave to amend.judgment was entered,and plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see telesaurus vpc,llc power,cir.
w e begin by identifying pleadings that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.we disregard threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements.after eliminating such unsupported legal conclusions,we identify factual allegations,which we assume to be true,and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face that is,plaintiff must plead factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.

iii.discussion 
failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b 
plaintiffs claims rest on one central allegation,as stated succinctly by the district court 
defendants fail to deliver percent of the fuel at the octane rating advertised when plaintiffs purchase fuel at a higher octane rating than the previous customer at a pump.plaintiffs argue that they are paying for approximately gallons of residual fuel,which is not drained or diverted,at the higher per gallon price,and hence,are allegedly overcharged.
defendants similarly rely on one central ground to support dismissal of the complaint the residual fuel situation stems from the mandated design of gasoline dispensers that are certified as lawful by california regulators.plaintiffs claims,argue defendants,seek relief that can not be granted because defendants may not alter their dispenser designs,price computation mechanisms,or octane disclosures without running afoul of various legal requirements in this heavily regulated arena.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs factual allegations,accepted as true,do not give rise to a reasonable inference that defendants have committed any misconduct for which we may grant relief.plaintiffs common law claims were properly dismissed for failure to provide reasonable notice.plaintiffs statutory claims under the clra and ucl fail because defendants conduct is clearly permitted by california law,and defendants therefore are entitled to safe harbor from liability under these broad consumer protection statutes.plaintiffs claim under the fal fails because it is expressly preempted by the pmpa and the ftc posting rule.accordingly,plaintiffs complaint fail ed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.fed.civ.proc.b.
plaintiffs failed to provide reasonable notice regarding the common law claims 
plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty allege,generally,that defendants have breached their sales contract obligations by failing to deliver the specific,number of gallons at the posted fuel grade the district court properly dismissed these common law claims because plaintiffs failed to provide defendants with reasonable notice.see cal.a the buyer must,within a reasonable time after he or she discovers or should have discovered any breach,notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy.
to avoid dismissal of a breach of contract or breach of warranty claim in california,a buyer must plead that notice of the alleged breach was provided to the seller within a reasonable time after discovery of the breach.stearns select comfort retail,d,citations omitted see also id.at construing reasonable notice in california as notice.the purpose of giving notice of breach is to allow the breaching party to cure the breach and thereby avoid the necessity of litigating the matter in court.see cardinal health,tyco elecs,cardinal health.this purpose would be completely undermined if it could be satisfied with the giving of notice.for that reason,we agree with the district court in stearns that the notice requirement means notice.in this case,plaintiffs alleged only that they gave notice to defendants to correct this breach upon learning of this breach by letter to defendants and by the filing of the instant action.this allegation fails to satisfy california notice requirement in light of the undisputed evidence that plaintiffs sent their notice letter simultaneously with the complaint.
in support of their argument that their letter provided reasonable notice,plaintiffs rely on hampton gebhardt chili powder,cir.in hampton,we concluded that notice need not precede the filing of the original complaint to be reasonable under california statutory requirement,so long as it otherwise is given within a reasonable time.see id.subsequent to that decision,however,california have disagreed with our construction of california commercial code section a.see cardinal health.at.the california court of appeal explained that a notice requirement best satisfies the statutory objectives of a by allowing sellers to repair or remedy the problem by providing the opportunity to negotiate a settlement,and by affording time to prepare for litigation by preserving relevant evidence.id.
our duty as a federal court in this case is to ascertain and apply the existing california law.munson del taco,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as our previous interpretation of california law,hampton is only binding in the absence of any subsequent indication from the california courts that our interpretation was incorrect.cardinal health indicates that our interpretation was incorrect.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore must conclude that plaintiffs failed to plead that they provided reasonable notice under a because their notice letter was sent to defendants simultaneously with service of the complaint.see cardinal health.at the first time cardinal provided any notice to t b was when cardinal served its lawsuit on t b.this did not comply with the statutory requirement.
safe harbor from liability pursuant to california unfair competition law and consumer legal remedies act 
plaintiffs statutory claims under the ucl and clra allege,generally,that defendants use of devices resulting in retention of residual fuel constitutes an unlawful deceptive business practice.see cal.bus.see also cal.a.defendants counter that these statutory claims fail because defendants are entitled to safe harbor from liability insofar as their challenged business practices are clearly permitted and indeed are certified to be lawful under california regulatory regime.
the ucl broadly prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising cal.bus.plaintiffs allege that the residual fuel situation amounts to an unlawful business practice and seek injunctive relief including requiring defendants to replace their gasoline dispensing systems to eliminate residual fuel,to change their billing and pricing systems so that customers are charged accurately for the grade and quantity of gasoline they pump,or to add additional disclosures on all gasoline dispensers notifying customers of the existing residual fuel in the hose.
plaintiffs ucl claim was properly dismissed by the district court pursuant to california doctrine because courts may not use the unfair competition law to condemn actions the legislature permits.cel tech,at.
although the unfair competition law scope is sweeping,it is not unlimited.courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.
id.at emphasis added.the allegedly unfair business practice in this case is the residual fuel resulting from a dispenser design.california law unequivocally permits defendants conduct,therefore affording safe harbor from ucl liability.
the clra similarly proscribes various unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer cal.a.plaintiffs asserted that defendants violated the clra by causing,and failing to disclose,the residual fuel situation.however,we agree with the district court that t he california regulatory framework creates specific requirements for retail gasoline dispensing that may not be trumped by the general prohibitions of the clra,and that defendants therefore were entitled to safe harbor from plaintiffs clra claims.see bourgi covina motors,applying safe harbor provisions of vehicle code to claims brought under the clra.
the claim predicated on california false advertising law is expressly
