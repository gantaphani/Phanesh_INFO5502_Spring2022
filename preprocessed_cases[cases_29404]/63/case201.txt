callon petroleum company callon brought this diversity action against frontier insurance company frontier to collect on a bond it had issued in callon favor,and moved for summary judgment.frontier subsequently became represented by gregory serio,the new york state superintendent of insurance as rehabilitator superintendent,who failed to respond to the motion,and the district court granted summary judgment.over a year later,the superintendent,after three notices of the judgment,moved to have the adverse summary judgment vacated under.b.we hold that the judgment was not void,and that the district court did not err in denying relief from the judgment under rule b.the crux of our reasoning in affirming the denial of relief under rule b is simply that the superintendent offers no plausible excuse for ignoring the judgment for some fourteen months.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion and affirm its denial of the superintendent motion.
in december,callon entered into an agreement with wood energy company wood,in which callon assigned its interest in certain mineral leases to wood.under the agreement,wood agreed to plug and abandon the incident oil and gas wells,and to guarantee its performance with a bond in callon favor.subsequently,frontier,as surety,issued a bond for million in callon favor.
in august,the louisiana commissioner of conservation demanded that wood plug and abandon the wells.when wood failed to respond,the commissioner demanded that callon,as the wells owner,perform the work.in turn,callon demanded that frontier comply with the commissioner demand,or pay callon the million payable under the bond so callon could perform the work itself.frontier neither tendered the penal sum nor performed the work required.
on may,callon filed suit,alleging that frontier was liable under the bond for the cost of plugging and abandoning the wells,and otherwise complying with the commissioner terms.on july,frontier answered the suit but raised no affirmative defenses.on august,callon filed a motion for summary judgment,which was set for hearing on september.
on august,the superintendent initiated delinquency proceedings against frontier in the supreme court of new york.on august,that court entered an order to show cause the order to show cause,which restrained frontier,its officers,directors,shareholders,members,trustees,agents,servants,employees,policyholders,attorneys,managers,and all other persons from the transaction of frontier business or the waste or disposition of its property,except as authorized by the superintendent.the order also appointed the superintendent as frontier temporary rehabilitator and authorized and directed him to take possession of frontier property and conduct its business.on september,frontier counsel provided the order to show cause to callon counsel and filed it with the district court.
on september,in the absence of any opposing papers from frontier,the district court granted callon motion for summary judgment.it acknowledged the new york order to show cause but did not consider itself restrained by the order because disposition of the pending motion was not a transaction of frontier business by the restrained persons,as contemplated by that order.the district court subsequently entered a final judgment against frontier for million.
on october,the new york supreme trial level court entered an order of rehabilitation rehabilitation order,making the superintendent appointment as rehabilitator of frontier permanent.in the rehabilitation order,the new york court expressly enjoined all persons from prosecuting any actions against frontier or the superintendent and from obtaining judgments or making any levy against frontier assets.the superintendent did not file the rehabilitation order with the district court until a year later,when he filed it with his rule b motion for relief.
as early as october,however,callon had provided the new york state department of insurance with a copy of the district court final judgment.the accompanying letter stated that callon considered the judgment final and binding.then again three months later,in january,callon wrote another letter insisting on the finality of the district court order,and demanding the sum owed under the judgment.there was no response from the superintendent.
on september,a year after the district court granted summary judgment,callon moved in the new york rehabilitation proceedings to have its claim against frontier liquidated as a matter of law and fixed at million with interest.this action finally prompted the superintendent,on november,to file a rule b motion for relief from judgment in the district court.the superintendent simultaneously filed a motion for stay or dismissal without prejudice pending the outcome of the rehabilitation proceedings.on december,after hearing argument,the district court entered an order denying both of the superintendent motions.the superintendent appeals 
the superintendent argues that the district court erred in denying rule b relief for two reasons.first,the superintendent contends that the judgment is void under rule b because the district court entered summary judgment after frontier delinquency proceedings had begun.second,the superintendent argues that the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the delinquency proceedings and the equities of the case weigh in favor of vacating the judgment under rule b so that frontier may have its day in court.each of these issues involves a different standard of review and raises distinct legal questions 
we first look at whether the judgment is void under rule b.this court reviews a district court denial of a rule b motion to set aside a judgment de novo.carter fenner,cir.we have recognized two circumstances in which a judgment may be set aside under rule b if the initial court lacked subject matter or personal jurisdiction and if the district court acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.id.at see also jackson fie,cir we take up both considerations in order.
the superintendent contends that at the time of the district court grant of summary judgment,jurisdiction over callon claim had vested exclusively in the new york supreme court.that is,by virtue of commencement of rehabilitation proceedings in the new york state courts,the federal district court in louisiana no longer maintained jurisdiction over the action.
callon correctly points out that because federal courts regulate the scope of their own jurisdiction,a rule b challenge to jurisdiction should be sustained only where there is a clear usurpation of power or total want of jurisdiction.nemaizer baker,cir see also united states tittjung,cir only when the jurisdictional error is egregious will courts treat the judgment as void.here,the district court clearly had diversity jurisdiction over the litigation between callon and frontier moreover,the jurisdictional error,if any,in entering judgment after the order to show cause does not appear to be egregious.
the superintendent argues,however,that insurance regulation should be an exception to the general rule that state courts are powerless to restrain federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction congress has evinced a strong federal policy in favor of deferring to state regulation of insolvent insurance companies as reflected in the act and the express exclusion of insurance companies from the federal bankruptcy code.munich american reinsurance crawford,cir emphasis added he further points out that because insurance regulation has long been recognized as an area of traditional state concern,gross weingarten,cir,federal courts routinely confront the conflict between their exercise of federal jurisdiction and state laws establishing exclusive claims proceedings for insurance insolvencies federal courts normally manage this conflict by exercising burford abstention to avoid interfering with state rehabilitation proceedings.burford sun oil.although burford abstention is generally considered the exception rather than the rule,the insurance insolvency context presents the classic example of the doctrine goal of preventing needless conflic
