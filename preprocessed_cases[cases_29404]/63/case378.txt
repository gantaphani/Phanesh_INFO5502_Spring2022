more than four years after entry of a quiet title judgment in favor of the united states,defendant ripley berryhill berryhill,joined by others the movants,sought relief under federal rule of civil procedure b.they contended that the judgment should be set aside under rule b because it was obtained by fraud upon the court and under rule b because it is void.the district court denied the motion.berryhill and fellow defendant daniel buck appeal.we have jurisdiction under.
we affirm,holding appellants claim of fraud upon the court was brought improperly under rule b but can be treated as a claim in an independent action or as a motion addressed to the inherent power of the court to set aside a judgment procured by fraud upon the court appellants failed to establish fraud upon the court the judgment is not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,appellants claim to the contrary being founded merely on contentions that the district court had committed legal error in deciding the merits and failure to give notice of the quiet title action to the movants did not deprive them of due process or otherwise render the quiet title judgment void.the united states also challenges the standing of the movants under rule b,but our decision in favor of the united states on the merits makes it unnecessary for us to address that issue.see steel citizens for a better env t,d statutory standing,unlike article iii standing,need not be decided before addressing the merits mcnamara city of chicago,cir court need not resolve standing of all plaintiffs when some plaintiffs clearly have standing to raise the issue.
background 
the property at issue the property consists of two lots totaling acres in hughes county,oklahoma.berryhill and the movants claim descent from nettie tiger,a fullblood creek who acquired the property in from the muscogee creek nation.after her death a court in determined that she had six heirs.in one of these heirs conveyed her undivided interest in the property to ralph oliphant,a.oliphant promptly filed suit to partition the property,thereby forcing its sale.he purchased the property at a sheriff sale on january.but on january the secretary of the interior exercised his preference right under the oklahoma indian welfare act of june,to acquire the property in trust for the thlopthlocco tribal town.bidding on the property was therefore reopened.the united states was the high bidder,its title being confirmed by court order on march.dispute over the title then arose after ralph oliphant conveyed whatever interest he had in the property to buck and berryhill in.
litigation concerning the property commenced in the united states district court for the eastern district of oklahoma in when the united states brought an action on its own behalf and in its capacity as trustee of lands of the thlopthlocco tribal town.the complaint sought,among other relief,to quiet title to the property and to enjoin buck and berryhill from trespassing on the property or asserting any claim to it.named as defendants were buck and berryhill nannette oliphant moore john,francis,ralph,and emma jo oliphant the known and unknown successors,heirs,and assigns of the individual defendants sentinel petroleum and the state of oklahoma ex rel.oklahoma tax commission.the court entered judgment on february,quieting title to the property in the united states and granting the requested injunctive relief.
on october,the united states filed a motion for an order requiring buck and berryhill to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for violating the injunction in the quiet title judgment.on march,a day before a scheduled hearing on the motion,berryhill and the movants filed a motion for relief from the judgment p ursuant to rule b and.the district court ruled that the motion was untimely,the legal arguments challenging the propriety of the quiet title judgment were unfounded,there was no fraud upon the court,and the movants lacked standing to seek relief under rule.
ii.the merits 
there was no appeal of the quiet title judgment.the motion for relief from the judgment comes long after the time for appeal had expired.if there is ever to be closure to litigation,such motions should be granted only for compelling reasons.the federal rules of civil procedure so provide.rule a governs the correction of clerical mistakes.substantive grounds for relief are set forth in rule b appellants invoke clause b of the rule,which permits relief on the ground that the judgment is void,and clause b,which permits relief for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.we begin with their argument that relief should have been granted under clause b.
fraud upon the court.
procedural issues 
appellants claim for relief under rule b is based on the contention that the attorneys for the united states committed fraud upon the court in obtaining the quiet title judgment.before considering the merits of the contention,we address a procedural matter.we hold that a claim of fraud,including fraud upon the court,can not be brought under clause b.as we shall explain,however,the error in labeling the pleading is not fatal because rule b permits other means of pursuing the relief they seek.
appellants reliance on clause b immediately raises questions because fraud is specifically mentioned in clause b as a ground for relief from a judgment.why would appellants choose clause b rather than b the answer is timing.rule b provides that a motion under the rule shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order or proceeding was entered or taken.appellants were well outside the time limit for a motion under clause b,the motion having been filed more than four years after the quiet title judgment.
to avoid the time bar,appellants instead rely on clause b,which permits relief for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.rule b emphasis added.their reliance is misplaced.the clear import of the language of clause b is that the clause is restricted to reasons other than those enumerated in the previous five clauses.see liljeberg health servs.acquisition,d plotner v.at t,cir james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed.moore charles alan wright,et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.wright miller.because fraud is one of the reasons for relief appearing in clause,it is not available as any other reason under clause.appellants can not so easily escape the time restrictions on rule b motions.
nevertheless,rule b authorizes two other avenues for relief from fraud upon the court.the rule states that it does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment,order,or proceeding or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.rule b see moore b distinguishing between an independent action and the inherent power to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court wright miller,at same.
the first additional avenue mentioned is an independent action.it is a narrow avenue.the supreme court has recently held that under the rule,an independent action should be available only to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice.united states beggerly,d.but the roadway is wide enough to allow at least some claims of fraud.see wright miller,at id,at moore a.there is no set time limit for filing an independent action,although relief may be barred by laches.see wright miller,at moore,at.
the second procedure for obtaining relief is to invoke the inherent power of a court to set aside its judgment if procured by fraud upon the court.relief is not dependent on the filing of a motion by a party to the original judgment the court may assert this power sua sponte.see wright miller,at id,at moore e,at party seeking relief need not have been a formal party to original proceeding id.f id,at.there is no time limit for such proceedings,nor does the doctrine of laches apply.see bulloch united states,cir en banc wright miller,at moore g.
in this case no purpose would be served by denying appellants relief on the ground that the motion misstyled the plea for relief.the substance of the plea should contr
