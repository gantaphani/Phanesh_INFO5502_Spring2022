aes sparrows point lng,llc and express,llc together,aes brought this suit against baltimore county,maryland,its executive,and its zoning commissioner together,the county seeking a declaration that county bill,which prohibits the siting of any liquefied natural gas lng terminal in the county chesapeake bay critical area,is preempted by the natural gas act nga.the district court granted summary judgment to the county,concluding that bill is saved from preemption because it is within the delegated authority of the state of maryland and the county under the coastal zone management act czma and is enforceable as part of the state of maryland coastal management program.aes now appeals.we hold that bill is not part of maryland federally approved coastal zone management plan cmp,and therefore is not saved from preemption as an exercise of maryland rights under the czma.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
before turning to the facts of this case,we describe briefly the relevant statutory framework.the natural gas act,et,requires a party seeking to construct an lng terminal to first obtain authorization from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.a.in order to do so,applicants must comply with the nga requirements as well as complete ferc extensive process.see.ferc must then consult with the appropriate state agency on numerous state and local issues.see b.the nga also contains two provisions,added in,that are pertinent to this appeal.the first provides that ferc shall have the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting,construction,expansion,or operation of an lng terminal.e the second the savings clause provides that nothing in the nga affects the rights of states under the czma and two other federal statutes d.
the czma,et,was designed to encourage states to develop planning programs that will preserve,protect,and restore the environment of their coastal zones.shanty town assocs.epa,cir.to that end,the czma authorizes states to create cmps setting forth the state objectives,policies,and standards to guide public and private uses of lands and waters in the coastal zone.the czma sets forth detailed requirements that a cmp must meet in order to obtain federal approval.see.once a state cmp is approved by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the state is eligible to receive federal grants for the purpose of administering its coastal zone management programs.in addition,the czma requires that any federal agency activity affecting the state coastal zone be carried out in a manner which is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of approved cmps.c.the czma therefore gives states with approved cmps the right to engage in consistency review,permitting them to conditionally veto federally permitted projects that are not consistent with the enforceable policies of the state approved cmp,subject to a final override by the secretary of commerce.c a see generally cal.coastal comm granite rock,d explaining consistency review.finally,the czma specifies the procedures a state must follow in order to amend its cmp,which include presentation of any such amendment to noaa for approval.see e.
the facts of this case are not disputed.to meet the demand for natural gas in the region,aes proposes to build an lng import terminal with the necessary transmission pipeline at sparrows point,a heavily industrialized coastal area on the chesapeake bay in the county.lng,which is natural gas that has been cooled to fahrenheit to form a liquid,occupies one of the volume of natural gas in its gaseous state.aes proposed terminal would receive lng,store it,and regasify it for transportation and delivery to residential,commercial,and industrial end users.because lng can be economically transported by sea from areas worldwide to many domestic and foreign markets,lng import terminals are typically sited in coastal areas with shipping access to foreign countries.
in,responding to public opposition to the siting of an lng terminal at sparrows point,the county council approved bill,which amended the county zoning regulations to provide that an lng terminal can only be constructed with a special exception and must be located at least five miles from residential zones and feet from businesses.this zoning amendment would have prevented aes from constructing an lng facility at sparrows point.
following passage of bill,aes brought suit in federal court,arguing that bill was preempted under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution by the nga grant of exclusive authority to ferc to site lng terminals.the district court agreed and enjoined the county from enforcing the zoning ordinance.see aes sparrows point lng,llc smith,d,aes i.
the county responded in by passing bill,which takes a different approach to banning lng facilities at sparrows point.instead of restricting lng terminal siting based on proximity to residential and commercial areas,bill makes the restriction on lng facilities a matter of coastal concern by amending the county zoning regulations to include lng terminals among the prohibited uses in the chesapeake bay critical area because the proposed sparrows point site is located within the county chesapeake bay critical area bill prevents aes from constructing an lng facility there.
aes then filed the present suit,seeking essentially the same injunctive and declaratory relief as in aes i.the county responded by requesting that maryland critical area commission for the chesapeake and atlantic coastal bays the critical area commission amend the county chesapeake and atlantic coastal bays critical area protection program capp to include bill restriction on lng terminal siting in coastal areas.the capp was enacted pursuant to,nat.res.et,and is one of over state laws identified in maryland cmp as effectuating maryland coastal management policies before the district court rendered its decision,the critical area commission approved the adoption of bill into the capp.maryland,however,never presented bill to noaa for approval by that agency,pursuant to the czma procedures for amending state cmps.
the district court concluded that bill was not preempted by the nga.reasoning that by adopting bill into the county capp,maryland also had incorporated it into its cmp,the district court concluded that bill represented an exercise of maryland delegated authority under the czma and was thus saved from preemption by the nga savings clause.the district court also held that bill does not facially discriminate against or unduly burden interstate and foreign commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution.accordingly,the district court denied aes request for declaratory and injunctive relief and granted summary judgment in favor of the county.this appeal followed.
aes primary contention on appeal,as below,is that bill is preempted by the nga.we review this legal question de novo.cox shalala,cir
