cleere drilling company cleere appeals the district court bench trial judgment,which rejected cleere claims against dominion exploration production dominion and held cleere liable to dominion for almost million in damages.these damages resulted from the blowout of kenaf industries unit well the well,which cleere had contracted to drill for dominion.cleere contends that the district court misconstrued various provisions of the standard form international association of drilling contractors iadc footage drilling contract,july revision,the contract,as revised by the parties and entered into by cleere as contractor and dominion as operator.cleere also contends that the district court erred in various findings of fact.we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
this action arises from the blowout and resulting total loss of the well.central to the action are issues of responsibility for several categories of resulting losses and damages.
while drilling ahead at a depth of approximately feet en route to a contract footage depth of feet,the project got into trouble after cleere toolpusher ordered a short trip,in which stands of drill pipe were pulled out of the hole and run back in to ensure the integrity of the pipe.in the course of this operation,cleere driller swabbed the well at least twice he completed the removal of the pipe despite observing an increase in the flow of drilling mud from the hole.when the driller realized that a potential situation was developing,he had cleere crew attempt to activate the blowout preventer.they failed to do so,however,because they did not first close a hydraulic bypass valve,a critical prerequisite to the preventer effective operation.
cleere toolpusher,who had not been present,came to the drill site promptly after being called and was eventually able to activate the blowout preventer and shut down the well.cleere efforts to maintain control were ultimately unsuccessful,however,and the well cratered around its casing seven days after the initial loss of control.the well eventually blew out through several surface fissures approximately to linear feet from the hole,spewing salt water,gas,sand,and chemically treated drilling mud on and around the drill site.as cleere had neither the equipment nor the experience and expertise to control and kill the well,dominion retained the firm of boots coots to do so,at substantial cost to dominion.
cleere sued dominion in state court,and dominion removed the case to the district court based on diversity of citizenship.cleere sought to recover for its services under the contract for work performed both before and after the blowout.specifically,cleere sought,which included x for the value of the hole that cleere had drilled before it lost control of the well for days and hours daywork after it lost control and approximately for other items,including joints of drill pipe and drill collars lost in the hole.
dominion counterclaimed to recover costs and expenses totaling comprising for controlling the blowout for cleanup of the surface location,for restoration of the surface location for settlement of damage claims with the landowner,kenaf industries of south texas kenaf and for the differential between dominion cost of drilling a replacement well and the well price under the contract.
the district court conducted a bench trial,after which it ruled in favor of dominion,awarding the entire amount sought and rejecting all of cleere claims.cleere timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of the diversity of citizenship provisions of a following dominion removal of the case from the state court in which cleere had originally filed it.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
standard of review 
we review the district court interpretation of the contract de novo,as such an interpretation requires the determination of legal questions as the district court award of compensatory damages presents an issue of fact absent an error of law,our review of this aspect of the judgment,like all other factual findings of the district court,is for clear error 
cleere claims 
on appeal,cleere does not contest the district court finding that cleere negligence caused the blowout,so the particular facts surrounding the blowout itself are not at issue.rather,cleere views the case as one of contractual allocation of risk that turns primarily on the release and indemnity provisions of the contract.cleere maintains that the contract allocates to dominion responsibility for much of the damage,irrespective of whether cleere was negligent or otherwise at fault.cleere also insists that the district court misconstrued the contract as a result of misapplying texas law.
recovery based on conversion of the contract to daywork status 
one important aspect of cleere theory of recovery against dominion is the contention that,by its own terms,the contract automatically converted from a footage basis to a daywork basis.conversion to daywork basis would mandate different contractual allocations of liability,possibly entitling cleere to the damages it seeks related to the work it performed both before and after the blowout occurred,as well as the value of its lost equipment and materials.cleere argues that the district court erred in holding that,as a matter of law,such a conversion never occurred.
cleere contention that the contract converted to daywork status is premised on the factual assertion that cleere encountered several problematic conditions while drilling the well,including abnormal pressure,loss of circulation,and failure of equipment.the presence of any of these conditions would have converted the contract to a daywork status and entitled cleere to collect on its claims for breach of contract.the district court found that none of these conditions occurred,and cleere arguments that they did are not persuasive.cleere definition of abnormal pressure contradicts the express language of the contract and depends entirely on testimony that is not related to the contractual provisions at issue,but to normal pressure in a strict engineering sense similarly,cleere argument regarding loss of is entirely different from increased flow of drilling to the condition of the well following cleere actions that resulted in the blowout.as the district court noted in its order of june,even if abnormal pressure or lost circulation were encountered,they were only encountered after the driller swabbed the well,which action caused the increased flow and left it uncontrolled,leading to the blowout.we can not say that the district court clearly erred in this determination,and the contract is unambiguous that cleere is liable in such a situation finally,cleere contention that the formation surrounding the surface casing formation is part of the somehow operator supplied equipment is untenable.we agree with the district court that the contract never converted to a daywork basis.
recovery under footage contract basis 
we also agree with the district court conclusion that cleere can not recover the damages that it claims under the contract footage basis.first,cleere is not entitled to be paid for its drilling services that preceded the blowout because contract footage depth was never reached,a condition precedent to payment under subparagraph of the contract.second,cleere can not recover for its services because this claim depends on conversion of the contract to daywork status which,as noted,never happened.and,third,under subparagraph of the contract,cleere alone is responsible for any loss of its own equipment while the contract is in footage status.therefore,cleere can not recover from dominion for the loss of drill pipe,collars,and the like.we affirm the part of the district court judgment that rejects each of cleere damage claims against dominion.
dominion claims 
the district court held cleere liable to dominion after finding that cleere negligence caused the well to blowout.in its discussion of this point,the district court correctly stated that,because this is a diversity case,texas law governs all substantive contractual questions in its application of texas contract law,the district court gave two reasons why dominion recovers under these circumstances.first,held the district court,the overarching indemnity and release provisions contained in subparagraph do not,as a matter of law,meet the texas public policy requirement of fair notice for release and indemnity agreements to be binding.the fair notice doctrine requires contract language of express negligence that is conspicuous.the district court held that the contract failed both prongs of this test for fair notice of indemnity clauses of a contract,and was therefore inadequate to release cleere from damages resulting from its own negligence.second,held the district court,the materials deposited on the drill site by the blowout did not constitute pollution or contamination as those terms are used in the contract,absent which subparagraph is not available to shift responsibility for those items from cleere to dominion,whether or not the contract indemnity and release provisions are enforceable under texas law.we disagree with both determinations and shall discuss them in turn.
recovery based on cleere negligence 
the district court based its holding that the release and indemnity provisions of do not meet the fair notice requirement on the decision of the supreme court of texas in ethyl corporation daniel construction company the test for fair notice established in that case has two conjunctive prongs express negligence,which requires that a party seeking indemnity from the consequences of its own negligence must express that intent in specific terms within the four corners of the contract and conspicuousness,which requires that the release and indemnity provisions at issue be sufficiently conspicuous to ensure the parties conscious awareness of such provisions on appeal,dominion concedes that the contractual language at issue meets the express negligence prong.dominion nevertheless continues to contend on appeal that the release and indemnity language of paragraph fails the conspicuousness prong.as the fair notice doctrine can be trumped by the jurisprudentially recognized exception of actual knowledge,we now address that exception to determine whether it is applicable in this case.
even if we assume without conceding that the pertinent language of the contract is not sufficiently conspicuous to meet the second prong of the subject test,we are convinced that the requirement of fair elements,express negligence and irrelevant in the face of dominion actual knowledge of the subject provisions of the contract.the supreme court of texas explained in dresser industries,page petroleum,that t he fair notice requirements are not applicable when the indemnitee establishes that the indemnitor possessed actual notice or knowledge of the indemnity agreement.
the record contains a surfeit of evidence to support cleere contention that dominion had actual knowledge of the release and indemnity provisions of the contract.testimony at trial revealed that contract negotiations between cleere and dominion included consideration of and changes to several provisions of the iadc printed form,including a number in paragraph.as noted,contains the contract provision for release and indemnity and covers responsibility for pollution and contamination,the latter of which we address below.furthermore,the acts of agents of the parties in making and initialing numerous changes to the printed form is facially evident on several pages of the contract.among the many changes were additions to or deletions from subparagraphs,and,each of which was initialed by dominion representatives,david linger and richard miller,as well as by a representative of cleere.in addition,the several changes made in paragraph are bracketed by changes made in preceding paragraphs,and,and in following paragraph.
dominion nevertheless attempts to avoid a holding that it had actual knowledge by implying that its linger,who was directly involved in the negotiation and confection of the contract as well as the changes to it,was not a lawyer and thus had no ability or responsibility for the legal aspects of the contract.this feeble effort to maintain that linger was somehow disqualified from understanding and therefore from having actual knowledge of the import of the indemnity provisions and the changes that he negotiated and made to those,because he is not a lawyer,he could not and need not realize what he was specious.as noted in footnote above,paragraph is labeled responsibility for loss or damage,indemnity,release of liability and allocation of risk.linger and miller made changes for dominion that directly addressed indemnity and release,including the revision of,to which the phrase but excluding wilful sic misconduct was inserted in the margin to preclude indemnity or release under such circumstances.and,these revisions were initialed not only by linger but also by miller,the representative who signed the contract for dominion.
we find inescapable the conclusion that dominion had actual knowledge of the contents and purposes of the entirety of paragraph allocation of risk and responsibility,including specifically and,through the acts of linger and miller in negotiating on behalf of dominion and personally initialing changes that deal directly with the indemnity provisions contained therein.except disingenuously,dominion can not argue that,through its designated agents,it did not acquire actual knowledge of those provisions.if dominion was uncomfortable with the qualifications of the two individuals who negotiated and signed off on the changes to the indemnity provisions on its behalf,it never made such qualms known to cleere and can not now be heard to disavow the acts of its agents.
in sum,we can not affirm the district court ruling that the release and indemnity provisions of the relevant subparagraphs of paragraph do not apply for failure of the contract to meet the fair notice requirements of texas law.dominion had actual knowledge of each of paragraph subparagraphs that are relevant to this case,including provisions governing indemnity and release and overriding the fault of the indemnified and released party.dominion actual knowledge of all pertinent provisions of paragraph satisfies that exception to the fair notice requirement and makes that doctrine inoperable here.we hold that applies in this case stated differently,that as to,requirement of fair notice is rendered inapposite by virtue of the actual knowledge exception to that doctrine,and the parties are therefore bound by the provisions of paragraph and each of its subparagraphs.
recovery based on absence of pollution or contamination 
dominion insists that it is entitled to recover its costs of cleanup and restoration of the drill site,including damages paid in settlement with the landowner,held by the district mess on the surface was neither pollution nor contamination.noting that,under,responsibility for any damages arising from pollution or contamination that originated below the surface of the land is allocated to dominion alone,cleere counters that the costs of the extensive cleanup and restoration of the surface location are the direct result of pollution or contamination or both that originated below the surface of the earth.in addition to holding that,as a matter of law,the contract indemnity and release provisions on which cleere relies are ineffectual under the texas doctrine a holding we have reversed above the district court also held that the spoliation of the surface location constituted neither pollution nor contamination as those terms are used in the contract.cleere responsibility for costs and expenses incurred by dominion in cleaning up and restoring the surface of the land at and in the vicinity of the drill site thus turns on whether the salt water,sand,and drilling mud deposited on the surface of the land as a result of the blowout constitutes pollution or contamination for purposes of 
the pertinent text of,pollution and contamination,specifies 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,it is understood and agreed by and between cleere and dominion that the responsibility for pollution and contamination shall be as follows 
a cleere shall assume all responsibility for causes of action of every kind arising from pollution or contamination,which originates above the surface of the land or water 
b dominion shall assume all responsibility for,including control and removal of,and shall protect,defend and indemnify cleere from and against all claims,demands,and causes of action of every kind and character arising directly or indirectly from all other pollution or contamination which may occur during the conduct of operations hereunder,including,but not limited to,that which may result from fire,blowout,cratering,seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil,gas,water or other substance,as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids,including,but not limited to,oil emulsion,oil base or chemically treated drilling fluids,dominion shall release cleere of any liability for the foregoing emphasis added.
there can be no dispute that the putative contaminants in question salt water,sand,gas,and mud,chemically treated drilling fluids originated hundreds of feet below the surface of the land,or subsection b of makes dominion,as operator,responsible for all pollution and contamination that does not originate at or above the surface of the land.dominion is therefore responsible for all damages resulting from the deposit of the subject materials on the surface of the land unless,as held by the district court,the presence of those materials does not constitute pollution or contamination within the intendment of the contract.furthermore,by virtue of,dominion responsibility for such damage to the surface is not negated by cleere having caused the blowout that resulted in the deposit of such materials on the surface.thus,the only way for cleere to be held responsible under subsection b of for damages resulting from the spread of salt water,sand,and chemically treated drilling fluids on the land,would be for dominion to it did in the district its contention that the presence of those materials did not amount to either pollution or contamination.
the contract does not define pollution or contamination.the district court acknowledged the presence of salt water,sand,and chemically treated drilling fluid on the land,but nevertheless held that,under the contract,the presence of this foreign matter did not rise to the level of pollution or contamination of the surface of the land at or near the drill site,absent which cleere could not rely on for relief from liability.cleere contests that holding,insisting that the blowout deposit of those subsurface materials onto the surface of the land constituted pollution or contamination,or both,within the meaning of.consequently,insists cleere,the costs that dominion incurred in cleaning up and restoring the drill site and surrounding areas,and in settling with the landowner for its surface damages,must be borne by dominion alone.
not surprisingly,dominion supports the district court holding of no pollution or contamination as those terms are used in,asserting that the mess left by the blowout did not rise to the level of pollution or contamination.dominion emphasizes that the substances in question are relatively benign and not environmental threats.
we have not previously considered the meaning of pollution or contamination in the context of oil and gas drilling contracts.in doing so today,we heed the canon of contractual interpretation that requires words and phrases in a contract to be given their plain meanings unless the document demonstrates that the parties intended for the terms to be employed in some special or technical sense which is not the case here.black law dictionary defines pollution as c ontamination of the environment by a variety of sources including but not limited to hazardous substances,organic wastes and toxic chemicals.pollution is legally controlled and enforced through various federal and state laws and agencies.noting that independent soil testing determined that there did not appear to be a significant impact to the surface area from the blowout,dominion reasons that this fact and the absence of an environmental remediation order from the texas railroad commission is further proof that there was no pollution or contamination at the site.
any persuasiveness of dominion logic regarding the typical focus of that word on harm to the environment,and no such harm appearing to have occurred significantly less when applied to contamination.subsection b of refers disjunctively to pollution or contamination as words of different meanings,not as synonyms.cognizant of another canon of interpretation that requires courts to give effect to each contractual term so that none is rendered meaningless we must determine whether either pollution or contamination occurred here.
contamination 
when we examine the contract use of the term contamination,we are not convinced that any sort of environmental harm is required.in contrast to its definition of pollution,black law dictionary defines contamination as a c ondition of impurity resulting from mixture or contact with foreign substance.and,black definition of pollution as an enhanced subcategory of contamination supports cleere contention that environmental harm is not an essential element of all contamination rather,it is an exacerbating element that makes pollution a more noxious subcategory of contamination.similar to black,webster third new international dictionary defines the verb,to contaminate as to soil,stain,corrupt,or infect by contact or association to render unfit for use by the introduction of unwholesome or undesirable elements.in sum,all pollution is contamination,but not all contamination is pollution.
even if we assume arguendo that the materials disgorged onto the drill site and its surroundings are not so noxious as to be deemed pollutants because their presence either did not or could not cause environmental damage,their presence certainly meets the definition of contamination.relative to the surface of the drill site,the salt water,sand,and drilling mud with its associated chemical additives indisputably were foreign substances.it is equally indisputable that these substances were undesirable elements that rendered the surface area soiled,stained,impure,and almost certainly unfit for its intended use.if this were not true,we ask rhetorically,why would dominion have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the expedited removal of those substances,and,in addition,have paid the landowner a cash settlement for surface damages 
dominion argues that such a definition of contamination gives the term too wide a scope that even though the blowout created a substantial and obvious condition which had to be cleaned up,that condition was only a mess and did not amount to contamination.scope is clearly critical to this issue.there could be many situations that come within the common definitions of contamination yet fall outside the range of circumstances intended by the parties to be covered by that term.
although,as observed earlier,we have not addressed contamination in the context of drilling contracts,we and other courts have considered the scope of contaminant in the context of pollution exclusions in insurance contracts.in pipefitters welfare educational fund westchester fire insurance company the seventh circuit addressed the issue in the following way 
the terms irritant and contaminant,when viewed in isolation,are virtually boundless,for there is virtually no substance or chemical in existence that would not irritate or damage some person or property.without some limiting principle,the pollution exclusion clause would extend far beyond its intended scope 
in certain underwriters at lloyd london turner construction company,we agreed with the seventh circuit approach to this problem 
the issue in certain underwriters was whether the temporary release of a quickly dissipated but not before causing pollution and therefore exempted from coverage by a policy exclusion we concluded that the release of gas was pollution and therefore excluded from the policy coverage,explaining that such a conclusion did not conflict with the seventh circuit approach in view of the substantial nature of the discharge that occurred.
we perceive the instant situation to be analogous.obviously,neither pollution nor contamination is the cause of bodily injuries suffered by one who slips and falls on the spilled contents of a bottle of drano,or bodily injury caused by an allergic reaction to chlorine in a public pool,despite the fact that both drano and chlorine could probably be classified as contaminants in those situations similarly,fresh water that would evaporate in a matter of days,or a fine layer of sand that would cause no impairment to the use of the surface of rural land,should not be considered contamination.the instant situation is far different,however.
testimony at trial revealed that temporary dams had to be constructed and that vacuum trucks removed fluid waste hours a day to keep it from going all over the country.in all,dominion hauled away and disposed of more than barrels of waste fluids resulting from the blowout.these actions obviously were taken to minimize both the surface damage from the blowout and the need to eliminate foreign substances and undesirable elements that might render the surface of the land unfit or undesirable for use,indefinitely if not permanently.
our legal conclusion that contamination occurred comports with the overall structure of the contract.the only subparagraph that could be applicable to the surface restoration and cleanup costs at issue is.for example,subparagraphs through address surface and equipment,and subparagraphs and address damages to the hole itself similarly,subparagraphs and address underground damage and inspection of damage,respectively.the remaining subparagraphs of paragraph are likewise inapplicable.as the foreign matter at issue here can be considered contaminants under these circumstances,the structure of the contract further supports the conclusion that,for today purposes,they are contaminants either the contract fails to account for this category of damage entirely,despite its otherwise comprehensive attention to contingencies and potential losses,or this kind of damage is meant to come within the purview of.we conclude that this type of damage is covered by.
finally,dominion argues that because subsection b of contains release provisions,and release is an affirmative defense,cleere had to plead release expressly but failed to do so as cleere correctly points out,however,three of the pretrial order contested issues of law ineluctably implicate release when they address the allocation of risk and shifting of liability.more to the point,the record confirms that the issues of indemnity and release were tried in the district court by implicit consent of the parties.dominion never objected to testimony concerning the negotiations surrounding,and the changes made to,the contract indemnity and release provisions and the district court opinion discusses those provisions extensively the validity of the indemnity and release provisions is an issue that was tried without objection to the district court,and we must take the issues as they come to us we do not adjudicate by labels.we adjudicate cases on the facts and law as they fit and support each other in the trial as the case progresses.in short,dominion argument on this hypertechnical point is wholly unpersuasive.
at oral argument,dominion suggested in the alternative that,if we should conclude that the surface eruptions of salt water,sand,gas,and drilling mud constituted pollution or contamination,we should remand for a determination by the district court of exactly what damages were caused by those items and thus,under,are the responsibility of dominion.we agree.it is counterintuitive that any substantial part of the cleanup and restoration costs did not aris e directly or indirectly from the surface presence of these subsurface contaminants.still,dominion should have the opportunity to demonstrate that at least some of its restoration and cleanup,for example,repairing and restoring the physical character of the land at the locations of the fissures where the well blew out through the thus the costs of such work,are more properly attributable to something other than contamination,and are therefore cleere responsibility.
whether based on the existing record or on the record as supplemented on remand,the district court should make these determinations in the first place.we therefore remand the case to the district court for it to conduct a closer examination and allocation of the nature and costs of cleanup and restoration of the surface,and their relationship or lack thereof to contamination.the district court shall do so,of course,in the context of our holding that the salt water,gas,sand,and drilling mud that erupted onto the drill site and vicinity are contaminants,as that term is used in,even if not pollutants as well.and we defer to the district court to decide,in its discretion,whether additional evidence is necessary or desirable.if the district court finds that any aspects of dominion cleanup or restoration involved damage that did not result from contamination,the court shall assign responsibility therefor to cleere or dominion,as the case may be,depending on which provisions of the contract are applicable.in any case,however,the court shall assign to dominion responsibility for all cleanup and restoration necessitated directly or indirectly by contamination.
settlement with the landowner 
a few weeks after the blowout,dominion entered into a settlement agreement with kenaf,the owner of the surface and the mineral rights of the land on which the well was drilled.this agreement reflects dominion payment of to kenaf in full settlement of all claims for damages to the land on which the well was drilled,resulting from an incident obviously referring to the blowout.although there can be no question that the need to clean up and restore the surface was a direct consequence of the blowout,neither the surface damages settlement agreement between dominion and kenaf industries nor other record evidence that we have located or has been referred to us identifies the specific nature of the particular damages sustained by kenaf as landowner,over and above or in addition to the contamination and the physical damage to the surface,all of which dominion cleaned up and restored in kind.we harbor no doubt that any damages to kenaf ownership interests resulted from the blowout,either directly or indirectly.yet we can not determine from the refuse simply to the damage to kenaf property interests for which it was paid was caused entirely,or partially,or not at all,by contamination.
we do hold,however,as a matter of law based on our interpretation of the contract,that cleere is responsible to dominion for necessary and reasonable costs incurred in settling with kenaf for its surface damages to the extent,if any,that any of such damage to the landowner interest did not result from contamination.like cleanup and restoration costs,any landowner damages would remain the responsibility of dominion under and thus would not be recoverable by dominion from cleere.
we therefore remand the issue of landowner damages to the district court for it to determine whether all,some,or none of kenaf damages resulted from contamination.if the court should conclude that any portion of such damages did not result from contamination,it then must determine how much of the that dominion paid to kenaf was for any such landowner damages and how much of that was necessary and reasonable,and thus reimbursable to dominion by cleere.
killing the well 
our plenary review satisfies us that the district court correctly held that cleere loss of the well prior to reaching contract footage depth makes cleere responsible for the necessary and reasonable costs and expenses occasioned by that lost control.this responsibility is not otherwise allocated by the contract.cleere loss of control of the well,coupled with cleere inability to bring the well under control,left dominion no choice but to hire a contractor capable of controlling and killing the well.the district c
