members of a purported class alleging claims against exxon mobil corporation arising out of a fire in an exxon mobil facility,appeal the district court order denying certification of a rule b plaintiff class in this mass tort action.a panel of this court granted appellants petition for permission to appeal and we have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal under e and rule f.finding no abuse of discretion by the district court,we affirm the denial of class certification.
on august,a recently installed control valve in exxon mobil baton rouge chemical plant failed,resulting in sponge oil leaks.the oil ignited,and although the fire was controlled quickly,it burned until its fuel source was exhausted,sometime on the morning of august.during the time the fire was burning,the wind carried the smoke plume to the southwest and across the mississippi river.exxon mobil conducted air monitoring both inside and outside the facility,and in the surrounding community during the time of the fire.
hundreds of suits were soon filed against exxon mobil,alleging various causes of action including personal injury,personal discomfort and annoyance,emotional distress resulting from knowledge of exposure to hazardous substances,fear of future unauthorized exposures,and economic harm including damage to business and property,among others.
after the suits were consolidated,appellants proposed class certification under rule b for all issues and with the following class definition 
all persons or entities residing or located,or owning property or operating businesses in east baton rouge parish or west baton rouge parish at the time of the incident at the exxon chemical plan,exxon refinery,in baton rouge,louisiana,on august,and who sustained legally cognizable damages,including but not limited to all claims for exemplary or punitive damages as provided for in,property damage,business loss,and all personal injury claims,and who have not settled their claims in full,and who have complied with and comply with all further orders of the court in this class action 
appellants also proposed two class representatives.
following a hearing but before the court ruled on class certification,the court granted summary judgment to exxon mobil on certain categories of claims.first,the court granted summary judgment to exxon mobil on all claims for physical injuries and emotional distress brought by individual plaintiffs who were located outside the geographic area that the air modeling experts agreed was affected by the plume.second,the court granted summary judgment to exxon mobil on all claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
following the entry of its summary judgment,the court denied appellants motion for class certification,concluding that appellants failed to satisfy the typicality and adequacy requirements of rule a,as well as the predominance and superiority requirements of rule b.the appellants were granted permission to appeal the denial of class certification pursuant to rule f,and this appeal followed.
we review the denial of class certification for abuse of discretion.see countrywide home loans,cir.because,however,a court by definition abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect legal standard,we review such errors de novo.id.moreover,although the district court has substantial discretion,the district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the rule prerequisites before certifying a class.castano american tobacco,cir.additionally,a party seeking certification bears the burden of proof.id.
rule a provides four prerequisites to a class action a class so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable questions of law or fact common to the class named parties claims or defenses typical of the class and representatives that will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a amchem products,windsor,nn,d.in addition to these prerequisites,a party seeking class certification under rule b must also demonstrate both that questions common to the class members predominate over questions affecting only individual members,and that class resolution is superior to alternative methods for adjudication of the controversy.bell atlantic,cir.whether common issues predominate and whether the class action is a superior method to resolve the controversy requires an understanding of the relevant claims,defenses,facts,and substantive law presented in the case.castano,at.
the district court in this case assumed for purposes of its order that the plaintiffs could satisfy the numerosity and commonality questions,but concluded that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the typicality,adequacy,predominance,or superiority requirements.we agree that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate either predominance or superiority,and because failure on those two requirements dooms class certification under rule b,we decline to address the remaining requirements.
the predominance inquiry requires that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.unger amedisys,cir quoting berger compaq computer,cir.the cause of action as a whole must satisfy rule b predominance requirement.castano,at.this requirement,although similar to the commonality requirement of rule a,is far more demanding because it tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.unger,at quoting amchem,at.
appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that the proposed class definition failed to satisfy the predominance requirement.appellants argue that because the alleged injuries all arise from the single incident at the exxon mobil plant,the issues relating to exxon mobil liability predominate over individual issues of causation and damages.appellee argues that the district court correctly concluded that the individualized medical causation,injury,and damages issues were the predominant issues in the case,and therefore that a class action was an inappropriate vehicle for resolution.
the district court heard from experts who opined that the primary issues left to be resolved would turn on location,exposure,dose,susceptibility to illness,nature of symptoms,type and cost of medical treatment,and subsequent impact of illnesses on individuals.moreover,in addition to the personal injury claims,separate types of proof would be necessary for the property damage,devaluation,and business loss claims.the district court observed that each plaintiff claims will be highly individualized with respect to proximate causation,including individual issues of exposure,susceptibility to illness,and types of physical injuries.as a result,the district court found that individual issues surrounding exposure,dose,health effects,and damages will dominate at the trial.the district court concluded that one set of operative facts would not establish liability and that the end result would be a series of individual which the predominance requirement is intended to prevent.
as appellants argue,the necessity of calculating damages on an individual basis will not necessarily preclude class certification.see bell,at.however,where individual damages can not be determined by reference to a mathematical or formulaic calculation,the damages issue may predominate over any common issues shared by the class.id.at holding that class certification is not appropriate because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the calculation of individualized actual economic damages,if any,suffered by the class members can be performed in accordance with the predominance requirement,at holding that district court abused its discretion in certifying class i n light of the individual calculation of damages that is required allison citgo petroleum,cir holding that certification under rule b was not appropriate because plaintiffs claims for compensatory and punitive damages must therefore focus almost entirely on facts and issues specific to individuals rather than the class as a whole.
it is clear from the record that the damages claims in this case are not subject to any sort of formulaic calculation.instead,each individual p
