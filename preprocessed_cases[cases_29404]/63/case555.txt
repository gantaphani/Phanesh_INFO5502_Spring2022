a railroad and a pipeline company had a dispute over whether a pipeline existing in the railroad should be moved before the railroad built a second track in the.the pipeline company refused to move the pipeline and filed a lawsuit to condemn a easement around the existing location of the pipeline.the parties agreed to employ a retired judge to decide the case as a referee pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and,subdivision a the referee filed a written statement of decision holding that the proposed easement was not located in the manner most compatible with the greatest public good as required by section,subdivision b and,accordingly,ruled in favor of the railroad.
the pipeline company appeals,claiming that the referee committed legal errors in applying the condemnation statute and that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence.we conclude that the doctrine of implied findings derived from section is applicable to the statement of decision,that the referee correctly applied section,and that the express and implied findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.thus,the judgment entered below is affirmed.
respondent burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf or its predecessor in interest has maintained and operated a railroad main line though central california for over years.
appellants sfpp,a delaware limited partnership sfpp,and its affiliate,a nationwide petroleum pipeline operator,have a petroleum terminal with storage tanks located in southern fresno,immediately to the east of bnsf.the terminal is serviced by a pipeline distribution system operated by sfpp.the distribution system includes pipeline located in bnsf.
the facts that led to the dispute between sfpp and bnsf were set forth in the statement of decision as follows 
p ursuant to various licensing agreements between the parties predecessors in interest,a portion of the pipeline distribution system running between concord and bakersfield that sfpp operates and maintains is located within bnsf.this pipeline carries gasoline,jet fuel,and diesel to a distribution center in fresno this center is the major distribution center in the greater fresno area.the pipeline also transports jet fuel to the lemoore naval air station,and is the only such pipeline servicing the naval air station.bnsf,or its predecessor in interest,has maintained and operated a railroad main line through central california,extending from bakersfield in the south to port chicago in the san francisco bay area in the north,for over one hundred years.originally the railroad was exclusively single track but,as rail traffic increased,several areas expanded to double track.by federal law,railroads are required to make their available for use by amtrak,which provides long distance and commuter rail passenger service in california,the state department of transportation caltrans has entered into various agreements with amtrak to provide additional equipment and costs,enabling amtrak to increase passenger rail services and thereby reducing highway congestion and the need to build additional highways.
in an effort to increase performance,reduce travel times,and increase ridership,caltrans had bnsf conduct a study to determine what areas of train traffic were most impacted by congestion.that study concluded that converting an approximate mile portion of bnsf calwa to bowles to double track would greatly reduce congestion and passenger travel time.thereafter in or about september caltrans and bnsf entered into an agreement to expand the railroad tracks in this location.
once bnsf determined that it would be constructing a second track in this location,it notified all utilities utilizing the of the impending construction and requested that the utilities,pursuant to their various licenses,move their pipes,wires,so as not to interfere with the proposed second track.all utilities except sfpp agreed to do so and have now relocated their equipment.after some correspondence and discussion between the parties,sfpp refused to pay to relocate any portion of its pipeline,alleging that there was no legal or safety issue basis for doing so.
the licensing agreements under which sfpp operated its pipeline in bnsf provided that 
sfpp shall,at its own cost and subject to the supervision and control of bnsf,locate,construct and maintain the pipeline in such a manner and of such material that it will not at any time be a source of danger to or interference with the present or future tracks,roadbed and property of bnsf,or the safe operation of its railroad.
if at any time sfpp shall fail or refuse to comply with or carry out any of the covenants herein contained bnsf may at its election forthwith revoke this license.
this license is given by bnsf and accepted by sfpp upon the express condition that the same may be terminated at any time by either party upon ten days notice in writing to be served upon the other party,stating therein the date that such termination shall take place,and that upon the termination of this license in this or any other manner herein provided,sfpp,upon demand of bnsf,shall abandon the use of the pipeline and remove the same and restore the right of way and tracks of bnsf to the same condition in which they were prior to the placing of the pipeline thereunder.in case sfpp shall fail to restore bnsf premises as aforesaid within ten days after the effective date of termination,bnsf may proceed with such work at the expense of sfpp.no termination hereof shall release sfpp from any liability or obligation hereunder,whether of indemnity or otherwise,resulting from any acts,omissions or events happening prior to the date the pipeline is removed and the right of way and track of bnsf restored as provided above.
exhibits,and.
upon sfpp refusal to relocate the pipeline,bnsf sent a letter,dated october,terminating the license agreements,citing both paragraphs and of the licensing agreements,and demanding that sfpp remove the pipeline and restore the and tracks to their previous condition.exhibit.on november,sfpp filed a complaint in eminent domain in the instant action,seeking to condemn a five foot wide easement for purposes of operating and maintaining the pipeline.in response,bnsf filed a for declaratory relief,seeking a declaration that sfpp had no rights to maintain its pipeline within the and that bnsf was entitled to move the pipeline and charge sfpp for the cost of that move.
one of the pipelines servicing sfpp fresno terminal is inches in diameter and approaches bnsf from the northwest as it runs parallel to south golden state boulevard line section.the line section enters bnsf in the area where the intersects with south golden state boulevard and runs approximately feet south where it leaves the and enters sfpp fresno terminal.cover over the line section varies from three to nine feet deep.
the pipeline used in delivering jet fuel to the lemoore naval air station is a multidimensional line line section which leaves the fresno terminal and runs south on the east side of the before turning west,crossing under the track,and exiting the.the length of line section occupying the is approximately feet.cover over the line section varies from seven to feet deep.
bnsf intends to install the second track to the east of its existing track.to make room for the second track,bnsf requested that sfpp move its pipelines to the other side west of the existing track.bnsf intends the centerline of the proposed second track to be a minimum of feet from the centerline of the existing track because that distance would allow it to perform maintenance on either line without closing both tracks.also,bnsf asserts that the second track must be placed to the east of the existing track because the existing track is located near the western edge of two underpasses,and placing the second track to the west of the existing track would require reconstruction of the underpasses at the cost of several million dollars.
sfpp does not dispute this assertion regarding the inadequacy of space for another track on the west side of the existing track,but contends that the proposed track can be added in its intended location without moving the pipelines from their current locations.
a report prepared for caltrans by the parsons transportation group states that the line section currently is located from eight to feet from the centerline of the proposed second track.the report concludes that locating the pipeline feet from the track would lessen the risk of pipeline rupture and avoid the need to close the proposed track for pipeline maintenance.the report bases its conclusion on a consideration of the risk of damage to the pipeline from a the construction and maintenance of the second track,b a train derailment,and c cleanup and repair equipment used after a derailment the risk that a small leak in the pipeline will weaken the subgrade soil and pose a fire hazard by saturating the soil over an extended period of time,and the delays and interruptions to rail service caused by a significant pipeline repairs,b less intrusive repairs and maintenance of the pipeline,and c integrity verifications.
proceedings 
when negotiations between the parties broke down,sfpp filed a complaint seeking to condemn a easement around the current location of the pipelines.bnsf filed a for declaratory relief in december against sfpp as well as and filed an answer to the complaint the next month.in april,sfpp and answered the and shortly thereafter sfpp filed its final offer to bnsf of for the easement it sought to condemn.
by agreement of the parties,this case was tried before a retired superior court judge acting through judicial arbitration and mediation services initially,the appellate record did not contain the written agreement of the parties regarding the general reference of the matter to the referee.this court brought the omission to the attention of the parties in a letter raising issues for supplemental briefing.see.subsequently,the parties jointly requested to augment the record on appeal by including a document titled stipulation re reference of suit pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and,which contained a related order and was filed in the superior court on january,stipulation of reference.the stipulation of reference provides in part 
the matter is transferred and referred to the referee pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and for all remaining matters including trial.
all proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the code of civil procedure and the evidence code as well as all other applicable statutory and case law as if the proceedings were conducted by the superior court of the state of california.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section,all decisions,rulings judgment rendered by the referee shall not be advisory but shall be the decision of this superior court and shall be subject to all the same rights of appeal review as if made directly by a judge of this court.
the case was tried before the referee without a jury from march through.on may,a document titled statement of decision prepared by the referee was served on the parties and the superior court.the last paragraph of the statement of decision provides 
the court awards judgment to defendant bnsf on the complaint and to bnsf on the.bnsf is to prepare the appropriate judgment and submit it directly to the fresno superior court for entry.italics in original.

pursuant to the stipulation and order filed january,and the statement of decision issued by the referee dated may,judgment is entered in favor of defendant bnsf on the complaint and judgment is entered in favor of bnsf on the.
the appellate record does not contain a motion for new trial,a motion to vacate the judgment,or any document filed prior to the entry of judgment that challenged the statement of decision or asserted it contained an omission or ambiguity.in july,sfpp and filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
standard of reviewa.substantial evidence rule and implied findings of fact 
generally,appellate courts independently review questions of law and apply the substantial evidence standard to a superior court findings of fact.see ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,questions of law are subject to independent review crawford southern pacific cal d,substantial evidence rule.the substantial evidence standard for review has been described by our supreme court as follows 
where findings of fact are challenged on a civil appeal,we are bound by the elementary,but often overlooked principle of law,that the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.crawford southern pacific,supra,cal d.we must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the standard of review so long adhered to by this court.jessup farms baldwin cal d.
the substantial evidence standard applies to both express and implied findings of fact made by the superior court in its statement of decision rendered after a nonjury trial.see michael jamie cal d,implied findings.the doctrine of implied findings is based on our supreme court statutory construction of section and provides that a party must state any objection to the statement in order to avoid an implied finding on appeal in favor of the prevailing party i f a party does not bring such deficiencies to the trial court attention,that party waives the right to claim on appeal that the statement was deficient and hence the appellate court will imply findings to support the judgment.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,fn.omitted.stated otherwise,the doctrine directs the appellate court to presume that the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment so long as substantial evidence supports those findings and applies unless the omissions and ambiguities in the statement of decision are brought to the attention of the superior court in a timely manner.see eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,see generally,rule.
statement of decision of referee after general reference 
consensual general references are governed by sections and.both of these sections were mentioned in paragraph of the stipulation of reference.section provides in relevant part 
a referee may be appointed upon the agreement of the parties filed with the clerk,or judge,or entered in the minutes,or upon the motion of a party to a written contract or lease that provides that any controversy arising therefrom shall be heard by a referee if the court finds a reference agreement exists between the parties a to hear and determine any or all of the issues in an action or proceeding,whether of fact or of law,and to report a statement of decision.
the portion of section applicable to the general reference in this case states 
a in the case of a consensual general reference pursuant to section,the decision of the referee or commissioner upon the whole issue must stand as the decision of the court,and upon filing of the statement of decision with the clerk of the court,or with the judge where there is no clerk,judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the court.
the procedures for challenging a statement of decision rendered by a referee after a consensual general reference are not set forth in detail by the statutes.instead,section broadly states that t he decision of the referee appointed pursuant to section or commissioner may be excepted to and reviewed in like manner as if made by the court.although this language appears straightforward and clear,uncertainty exists over its application.see knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group to,to discussing uncertainty regarding application of to a consensual general reference.
the uncertainty arises because the statutory scheme creates differences between the procedures followed by a referee in making a decision and by the court in reducing that decision to a judgment,on one hand,and the procedures followed by a superior court judge in doing the same thing,on the other hand.thus,where differences exist,the referee decision is not made in a like manner as if made by the court.when the manner in which the referee decision is made is procedurally different,the question becomes whether that difference has any impact on the manner for except ing to and review ing the decision of the referee.
the answer to this question is not derived solely by statutory construction because the proper way to challenge and review a referee statement of decision may be complicated,clarified or unaffected by the agreement of the parties to the general reference.specifically,subdivision b of section provides that a referee appointed pursuant to section shall report as agreed by the parties and approved by the court.italics added.thus,the parties have some flexibility in specifying the procedures a referee will follow in reporting a decision.
in this case,we must consider both the statutory provisions and the agreement of the parties in determining the proper way to challenge and the proper way to review the statement of decision.in the course of our review of this appeal,questions arose regarding the applicability of the doctrine of implied findings to the referee statement of decision.we therefore directed the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs.
in response,the parties jointly agreed to augment the appellate record to include the stipulation of reference and presented their arguments concerning the interpretation of that document.although both bnsf and appellants believe the broad language in the stipulation of reference means they impliedly addressed the question of whether the doctrine of implied findings applied to the referee decision,they have opposing views on the answer to that question.bnsf contends they agreed the doctrine of implied findings would apply and appellants contend they agreed the doctrine would not apply.
bnsf view is as follows.a stipulation to a general reference under subdivision a of section,which also specifically invokes the provisions of section,calls into play all of the legal rules and doctrines generally applicable to a statement of decision rendered by a superior court judge.among the provisions invoked by the general language used are the requirements of rule d,which provides for the filing of objections to a proposed statement of decision or judgment,and the statutory limitation in section,which establishes the scope of the doctrine of implied findings.because the stipulation of reference did not exclude the application of section and rule,it follows from the parties general language that they intended those provisions would apply to the referee statement of decision.
appellants argue that t he stipulation was expressly entered into pursuant to sections and citation.therefore,it implicitly rendered the doctrine of implied findings inapplicable to this appeal.to support this conclusion,appellants point out that the referee did not comply with the steps set forth in rule in that the referee did not provide the parties with a tentative statement of decision,any proposals as to the content of the statement of decision,a proposed statement of decision,or a proposed judgment.instead,the referee filed the statement of decision with the superior court and simultaneously provided it to the parties.appellants assert that,once the statement of decision is filed,the judgment must be entered immediately and,consequently,they had no opportunity to challenge ambiguities or omissions in the statement of decision and their right to object was limited to moving for a new trial or filing an appeal.
by the terms of their stipulation of reference,the parties agreed that a ll proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the code of civil procedure and the evidence code as well as all other applicable statutory and case law as if the proceedings were conducted by the superior court of the state of california.this general language is not ambiguous.section is contained in the code of civil procedure and,therefore,is applicable to the proceeding.it follows that the doctrine of implied findings,which is derived from section,also is applicable.furthermore,the statutory provisions that govern consensual general references do not alter the effect of the general language contained in the stipulation of reference.the statutory provisions state that the referee shall report as agreed by the parties,subd.b and exceptions to the decision of the referee may be made in like manner as if the decision had been made by the superior court.these provisions allow the parties to agree the proceedings will be conducted in accordance with the code of civil procedure,including section.
consequently,we agree with bnsf view that the broad language of the stipulation of reference means that section and the doctrine of implied findings derived from that section apply to the referee decision.in addition,we disagree with appellants position that the procedures actually followed by the referee deprived them of the opportunity to object to deficiencies in the statement of decision prior to appeal.section provides 
when a statement of decision does not resolve a controverted issue,or if the statement is ambiguous and the record shows that the omission or ambiguity was brought to the attention of the trial court either prior to entry of judgment or in conjunction with a motion under section or,it shall not be inferred on appeal or upon a motion under section or that the trial court decided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue.
in accordance with the terms of section,appellants could have filed objections to the statement of decision prior to the entry of judgment on may,or filed a motion under section asserting the judgment should have been set aside because it was not supported by the facts and had an erroneous legal basis.
first,under the terms of section,appellants could have brought any claimed deficiencies,such as the claim that the referee did not find the pipeline interference with the proposed second track unreasonable,to the attention of the superior court after the statement of decision was served may,and before the judgment was entered may.
second,section provides in part 
a judgment,when based upon a decision by the court may,upon motion of the party aggrieved,be set aside and vacated by the same court,and another and different judgment entered,for either of the following causes,materially affecting the substantial rights of the party and entitling the party to a different judgment.incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision,not consistent with or not supported by the facts and in such case when the judgment is set aside,the statement of decision shall be amended and corrected.
because a motion to vacate the judgment was available to appellants,they had a postjudgment mechanism for challenging any claimed omissions or ambiguities contained in the referee statement of decision.see national union fire ins.nationwide ins.th,d a general reference preserve s the court power regarding new trial motions and other postjudgment remedies.
thus,appellants claim that they had no opportunity to object to deficiencies in the statement of decision is false.accordingly,we reject appellants contention that the doctrine of implied findings can not be applied to resolve deficiencies in the factual findings in the statement of decision.
ii.background on the eminent domain law and public uses on same parcel 
california eminent domain law was enacted by section of chapter of the statutes of and codified as title of part of the code of civil procedure,commencing with section.the enactment resulted from a recommendation by the california law revision commission proposing a new comprehensive statute governing condemnation law and eminent domain law.recommendation proposing the eminent domain law cal.law revision com.the proposal contained some important changes but was basically a reorganization and restatement of prior law with numerous minor technical and corrective changes.ibid.
condemnation of property already appropriated to public use 
the law revision commission addressed many topics,including the condemnation of property already appropriated to public use 
existing law permits to a limited extent the acquisition by eminent domain of property already appropriated to public use.the commission believes,however,that joint use of property appropriated to public use should be encouraged in the interest of the fullest utilization of public land and the least imposition on private ownership.to this end,it recommends that any authorized condemnor be permitted to acquire,for use in common,property already devoted to public use if the joint uses are compatible or can be made compatible without substantial alteration of the preexisting public use.
only where the two uses are not compatible and can not be made compatible should a condemnor be permitted to take for its exclusive use property already appropriated to public use.in such a case,taking of the property should be permitted only for a more necessary public use than the use to which the property is already appropriated.recommendation proposing the eminent domain law cal.law revision com,supra,at,fns.omitted.
the situation of compatible public uses and the condemnation procedures that will lead to the joint use of the property is addressed in article of the eminent domain law,which commences with section 
any person authorized to acquire property for a particular use by eminent domain may exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire for that use property appropriated to public use if the proposed use will not unreasonably interfere with or impair the continuance of the public use as it then exists or may reasonably be expected to exist in the future.where property is sought to be acquired pursuant to this section,the complaint,and the resolution of necessity if one is required,shall refer specifically to this section.
the situation where a condemner proposed use will displace the condemnee existing or planned public use is addressed in article of the eminent domain law,section et.under those statutory provisions,preference is given to the more necessary public use.see naiman,judicial balancing of uses for public property the paramount public use doctrine envtl.aff,arguing that judicial balancing of competing uses is required by the statutory phrase more necessary public use.section states 
any person authorized to acquire property for a particular use by eminent domain may exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire for that use property appropriated to public use if the use for which the property is sought to be taken is a more necessary public use than the use to which the property is appropriated.where property is sought to be acquired pursuant to this section,the complaint,and the resolution of necessity if one is required,shall refer specifically to this section.
general prerequisites applicable to all condemnations 
regardless of whether the property sought to be condemned already is appropriated to a public use or is held for a private use,section specifies some of the prerequisites to condemnation 
the power of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire property for a proposed project only if all of the following are established a the public interest and necessity require the project.b the project is planned or located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.c the property sought to be acquired is necessary for the project.
these three prerequisites to condemnation have been described as the public necessity elements.legis.com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.
iii.section was applied correctly in this case 
the referee explicitly found that the public interest and necessity require this project and thus concluded the pipeline met the requirements of subdivision a of section.bnsf does not challenge this finding on appeal.see shell cal.pipeline city of compton th,d after franchise agreement with city lapsed,public utility pipeline company filed eminent domain proceeding to obtain a subsurface easement for the existing pipeline finding of public interest and necessity upheld because pipeline reduced price of gasoline provided to public and reduced use of tanker trucks to transport oil products.
with respect to the requirements in subdivisions b and c of section,the referee explicitly found that the pipelines were not located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good and least private injury and sfpp has failed to establish a legal necessity for taking this particular piece of property.appellants challenge these findings by asserting that they are based on an improper and legally irrelevant analysis regarding alternative locations for sfpp pipeline,and insufficient and speculative evidence regarding the alleged incompatibility of sfpp existing pipelines and bnsf proposed second track.
evidence regarding other locations was relevant 
appellants contend the referee analysis of an alternate location was error because it improperly balanced the equities between the parties,did not give effect to the presumption of public necessity applicable to the existing location of the pipeline,and failed to consider the wide discretion given to a condemner in selecting a location.see kachadoorian calwa county water dist.d.kachadoorian city of pasadena stimson cal.
the question whether the referee properly analyzed possible alternate locations for the pipeline involves an analysis of the language used in subdivision b of section,and the consideration of the case law and related arguments presented by appellants.
application of the unambiguous language of subdivision b of section 
our analysis of whether the referee was authorized by subdivision b of section to consider the availability of alternative locations for sfpp pipeline begins with the statute itself.we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of section,subdivision b.see day city of fontana cal th,d.
first,in construing the meaning of that statutory provision,we must look to the words used by the legislature,giving them their usual,ordinary meaning garcia mccutchen cal th,d.the words most,greatest and least are comparative terms that relate to both the plans and the location of the project.such comparative terms can not be applied in the abstract instead,they unambiguously show the legislature intent that the condemner proposed location be compared with other potential locations to see how those other locations compare in effect on the public good and private injury resulting from the project.
generally,the analysis of statutory language ends once a court has determined that the words used are clear and unambiguous.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,judicial construction is generally unnecessary where statutory language is clear and unambiguous,has only one reasonable construction.nevertheless,it is not uncommon for a court to review legislative history,which is another source for the expression of legislative intent,to confirm its statutory analysis,in re vicki d.fifth app.dist.observed that its statutory analysis was supported by legislative comment see north hollywood project area com.city of los angeles th,d.
in this case,the clarity with which the legislature expressed itself is supported by readily available legislative history regarding subdivision b of section.the senate legislative committee comment appended to section provides in part 
subdivision b.subdivision b prevents the taking of property by eminent domain unless the proposed project is planned or located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.this limitation,which involves essentially a comparison between two or more sites,has also been described as the necessity for adopting a particular plan for a given public improvement.people chevalier,cal d.see also city of pasadena stimson,supra eel field,cal.
proper location is based on two factors public good and private injury.accordingly,the condemnor choice is correct or proper unless another site would involve an equal or greater public good and a lesser private injury.a lesser public good can never be by a lesser private injury to equal a more proper location.see montebello.school dist.keay,d.nor can equal public good and equal private injury combine to make the condemnor choice an improper location.california cent.ry.hooper,cal.legis.com,west civ,supra,foll.
accordingly,we hold that subdivision b of section permitted the referee to consider other locations when determining whether the project was located in the proper manner.thus,the analysis used by the referee to apply subdivision b of section to the facts of this case does not contain legal error.
the case law relied upon by appellants does not apply to subdivision b of section 
appellants arguments were based on case law rather than an analysis of the language used in subdivision b of section.therefore,we consider whether the case law compels a result different than the one reached through statutory analysis.
in kachadoorian,a municipal utility operated a water line on land that had been a public alley.after the county abandoned the alley,the owner of the land brought a quiet title action seeking to enjoin the utility from asserting any interest in the land.on the question of whether the water line of the utility was trespassing on the landowner property,the court held that full title had reverted to the landowner as a result of the county abandonment and therefore a trespass was occurring.kachadoorian,supra,d at.next,the court considered what remedy was available to the landowner and held the trial court erred in quieting title and enjoining the utility use of the land.id.at.the court ruled the proper form of relief was damages based on inverse condemnation,provided that the utility could establish a public use and the necessity of maintaining that use.id.at.
in holding that the utility had made a sufficient showing regarding public use and necessity,the court held the trial court committed legal error by balancing the equities and determining that the owner property right outweighed the utility public service right.kachadoorian,supra,d at.in addition,the court stated that the requirement concerning the necessity of the property for the project merely required the land be reasonably suitable and useful for the improvement.id.at.the citations used to support this statement,which included a reference to a legislative committee comment clearly establish that this determination relates to the requirement in subdivision c of section that the property sought to be acquired is necessary for the project.furthermore,the court stated that the absence of a substantial public use is not established merely by showing the existence of other physical alternatives to the use of a landowner property kachadoorian,supra,at.the court then adopted a presumption of public necessity for continued use of the land based on the years the pipeline had been in existence and concluded the evidence presented did not overcome that presumption.id.at.accordingly,the court ruled the pipeline could remain where it was and the landowner was relegated to obtaining damages for the taking of his property.id.at.
kachadoorian is distinguishable from the present case because,among other things,the trial court in kachadoorian did not make any findings of fact regarding the requirements of subdivision b of section the issues regarding the greatest public good and the least private injury were not addressed on appeal and the decision did not mention any facts that suggested any public good resulting from the landowner use of the property would be adversely affected by continuing to operate the pipeline at that location.furthermore,the present case involved more than a mere showing of an alternative to the easement requested by sfpp because bnsf made a showing of a better alternative.
the presumption adopted in kachadoorian regarding the necessity of continuing the use of the pipeline might support the referee finding under subdivision a of section that the public interest and necessity require this project.nevertheless,kachadoorian is not authority for the proposition that such a presumption is required when considering the issues of the greatest public good and least private injury that arise under subdivision b of section.insofar as we are aware,no appellate court has extended the use of such a presumption to the analysis of whether the project is planned or located in the manner most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury ibid.we will not be the first to do so.there is nothing in the statutory language or legislative history to suggest that such a presumption was intended by the legislature or furthers the purpose of the statute,the efficient utilization of land.we,therefore,hold that a finder of fact inquiring into greatest public good and least private injury should consider all the facts and circumstances,and the preexisting location of an improvement is only one of the factors relevant to that inquiry.
appellants also argue that consideration of alternate locations is inappropriate because of the ease with which condemnation proceedings could be thwarted by showing other locations are just as good.city of pasadena stimson,supra,cal.at.this argument misses the mark in this case because the standard applied by the referee was not whether an alternate location west of the existing track was just as good,but whether that alternate location was better,was compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury,subd.b.
in summary,we hold the principles of law contained in the cases relied upon by appellants did not prohibit the referee from evaluating alternate locations when applying subdivision b of section to the facts of this case.
analysis of offer of alternate location was not prejudicial error 
because of the clarity of the statutory language in subdivision b of section and its legislative history,the referee decision can be upheld without considering the requirements in subdivision c of section.thus,we need not discuss appellants attacks on the referee analysis of the necessity requirement contained in that provision.
nevertheless,to avoid a misunderstanding as to the future legal significance of the judgment and the statement of decision,we specifically address appellants argument relating to the following paragraph from the statement of decision 
the referee cautions,however,that the decision as to sfpp right to an easement,as requested in the complaint,rested in large part upon bnsf ongoing offer of an alternate location for the pipeline.should bnsf renege on this offer,the court would be justified in revisiting the issue of necessity.
based on this paragraph,appellants contend that the referee committed legal error by considering bnsf purported offer of an alternate location.our analysis begins by placing the quoted paragraph from the statement of decision in context.first,the paragraph is contained in the referee discussion of bnsf for declaratory relief of its rights under the license agreement.second,the referee earlier discussion of whether the property was necessary for the project stated 
here the evidence is that bnsf has continually offered,to and through the time of trial,an easement on the other side of the right of way which would be compatible with the proposed second railroad track at this location.the fact that no agreement was reached as to the specific location of such an alternate easement is due to sfpp refusal to consider such an option in shell oil compton,supra,the court found necessity in part because the city failed to suggest an alternate location for the pipeline here several alternatives have been suggested.the referee finds that sfpp has failed to establish a legal necessity for taking this particular piece of property.
third,as support for the finding that the proposed easement was not located in the m
