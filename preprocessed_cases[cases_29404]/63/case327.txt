since the administration of president warren harding,the united states has looked to the petroleum and natural gas resources underlying the wilderness of northern alaska,but development has come slowly.the frigid region is far reaching and so is the range of wildlife that inhabits it.
the government now proposes to lease vast reaches of the northernmost part of the state,known as the northwest planning area nwpa.in this litigation,a group of environmental plaintiffs have challenged the adequacy of the final environmental impact statement feis prepared by the bureau of land management blm for its plan to offer long term oil and gas leases in the nwpa.the leases would enable the oil companies to undertake exploration to determine what sites,if any,can be developed for productive drilling.the national environmental policy act nepa requires an assessment of the effects of major federal action on the surrounding environment.
according to plaintiffs,the feis issued by the secretary and blm to open the nwpa to oil and gas leasing does not comply with the requirements of nepa.plaintiffs allege that the department of interior and blm violated nepa because the feis failed to evaluate sufficiently site specific environmental consequences,failed to consider reasonable alternatives,did not discuss mitigation measures,and did not assess the cumulative impacts of leasing and other activities plaintiffs claim to be reasonably foreseeable.plaintiffs also argue that the biological opinion biop issued by the fish and wildlife service fws violates the endangered species act esa.
the plaintiffs main contention is that the analysis undertaken for the eis was inadequate,because it lacked site specific analysis for particular locations where drilling might occur.the government responds,we conclude cogently,that no such drilling site analysis is possible until it is known where the drilling is likely to take place,and that can be known only after leasing and exploration.the government points out that the environmental consequences at specific sites can be assessed in connection with later applications for permits for drilling at those sites,and that no permits should issue without extensive site specific analysis of adverse environmental effects and of the mitigation measures appropriate to minimize them.on that basis,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government.
background 
president harding established the naval petroleum reserve on alaska north slope in.it was fifty years later,in,that the national petroleum reserve protection act nprpa transferred authority over the reserve to the secretary of interior.the reserve was subsequently renamed the national petroleum.it remains the largest single unit of public land in the united states and covers million acres.it is also an important habitat for vegetation,fish,and wildlife.
the prohibited petroleum exploration until when congress,driven by the fuel crisis of the previous decade,directed the secretary to carry out an expeditious program of competitive leasing of oil and gas on the reserve.the congressional act also recognized the subsistence interests of native american tribes in the area and the need to protect the environment.in,the blm opened up million acres,or percent of the northeast planning area of the reserve to oil and gas leasing,while carving out various special areas as off limits to leasing.the northeast planning area is also the subject of litigation in the district court.
the portion of the at issue here is the northwest planning area,consisting of million acres to the west of the northeast planning area.the historical background of the region is well summarized in the district court opinion in this case that is published at d.
development of the feis 
the blm published a draft eis for the nwpa in january and received considerable critical comment.the blm published the final eis in december to open parts of the nwpa to leasing.the feis adopted the preferred alternative of the draft eis,opening the blm administered lands in the nwpa to leasing subject to certain significant limitations.the blm would defer for years any leasing on the western most portion of the nwpa,consisting of approximately percent of the proposed area the feis identified the kasegaluk lagoon as a special area because of important migratory bird and marine mammal habitat.it imposed no surface occupancy restrictions along the coastal areas and deep water lakes,comprising about percent of the area,and imposed stipulations on development that included set back restrictions and seasonal prohibitions on exploration and development in several of the areas richest in wildlife resources.
under the plan,the leases are to be offered as individual parcels that vary in size and are identified by number.at the time this record was developed,only a relatively small proportion of the parcels had received bids and only a few leases had been issued.of the parcels available for leasing,approximately received bids.no exploration had begun.
in assessing the environmental impact of the leasing program for purposes of preparing the feis,the blm had no way of knowing what,if any,areas subsequent exploration would find most suitable for drilling.thus,it did not do an analysis of any specific parcels.
the blm did do an analysis of the possible effects of drilling in the climatic environment of the region.that analysis projected two hypotheticals,representing each end of the available spectrum of possibilities.on the basis of experiences in drilling elsewhere in alaska,the blm projected types of drilling and patterns of development that might ensue,if,under the first scenario,half of the available parcels were leased for exploration,but no actual development occurred,and,in the second scenario if the total resources available in the area were to be discovered and developed.
the feis conducted an analysis under each scenario for each of the natural resources affected in the area,as,for example,water,wildlife,and specific bird species.because the analysis was based upon hypothetical future projections of what might be undertaken in the exploration and development phases,and was conducted on a resource by resource basis,the eis did not attempt to examine the impact on specific parcels.that is what gives rise to this litigation.
plaintiffs filed this action in the united states district court for the district of alaska on february.their principal claim was that by not undertaking a parcel by parcel analysis of the environmental consequences of projected exploration and drilling,the blm had failed to satisfy the nepa requirement of site specific analysis.the district court held that the resource by resource analysis of the effects of development in the overall area to be offered for leasing satisfied the site specific analysis requirement of nepa.it also rejected the plaintiffs secondary nepa challenges and their claim that there was a violation of the esa.this appeal followed.
discussion 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment upholding an agency decision.natural resources defense council of interior,cir.the appropriate inquiry under the administrative procedure act apa is whether the agency decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.nepa requires an eis to address 
i the environmental impact of the proposed action,
ii any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,
iii alternatives to the proposed action,
iv the relationship between local uses of man environment and the maintenance and enhancement of productivity,and 
v any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.

ultimately,nepa requires federal agencies to issue an eis before undertaking major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.a court inquiry,when reviewing whether an agency complied with nepa,is whether the agency adequately considered a project potential impacts and whether the consideration given amounted to a hard look at the environmental effects.idaho sporting congress,rittenhouse,cir.a hard look includes considering all foreseeable direct and indirect impacts.id.at.furthermore,a hard look should involve a discussion of adverse impacts that does not improperly minimize negative side effects.native ecosystems council forest service,cir.

site specific analysis 
with respect to the need for site specific analysis in the eis,our law under nepa makes it clear that there must be such analysis whenever there is an irretrievable commitment of resources by a federal agency to a project.see conner burford,cir.there is no question here that approval of the leasing program represents an irretrievable commitment of resources.the issue is whether it was sufficiently site specific.
plaintiffs major contention is that site specific in this context requires an analysis of the environmental effect with respect to each parcel involved in a possible lease for exploration and development.the problem is that until the lessees do exploratory work,the government can not know what sites will be deemed most suitable for exploratory drilling,much less for development.we are left with a chicken or egg conundrum in that if plaintiffs interpretation of its requirements were adopted,nepa could never be satisfied in the circumstances of this case.
our task,however,is to give effect to congressional intent as expressed not only in nepa,but also in the and enactments relating to the alaska reserve.the government resolution of the problem of how to give appropriate effect to all the relevant statutes in this case was to consider hypothetical situations that represented the spectrum of foreseeable results,once all phases of the program were completed.we can not say that this resolution,as set forth in the feis,is arbitrary or capricious under our circuit law.
conner burford is one of our seminal cases considering the procedures for evaluating the environmental effects of leasing programs to develop oil and gas resources.in that case the government instituted programs to sell oil and gas leases without preparing any eis at all.two types of leases were involved.one,the so called no surface occupancy or nso leases,forbid any use,or even occupancy of the surface of the national forest land being leased,without blm approval of the specific,activity the lessees planned to undertake.we held that such leases themselves involved no irretrievable commitment of resources and no eis was required at the leasing stage.
the second and more numerous type of leases in conner were non nso leases.they authorized the lessees to undertake development subject to government regulation of surface disturbing activities such as roads and drilling.the government could not totally preclude such activities,however,and for that reason we held an eis was required for non nso leases.
plaintiffs place principal reliance on conner,but we do not believe it advances their position in this case.here the leases are more like the non nso leases in conner.the government can condition permits for drilling on implementation of environmentally protective measures,and we assume it can deny a specific application altogether if a particularly sensitive area is sought to be developed and mitigation measures are not available.the government can not,however,consistent with current statutory imperatives,forbid all oil and gas development in alaska nwpa.the leasing program thus does constitute an irretrievable commitment of resources.an eis is undeniably required,and,indeed one has been prepared.
the issue here is plaintiffs contention that the eis is insufficient because it does not undertake a parcel by parcel analysis of surfaces that will eventually be explored and developed.as to this contention,conner is of no assistance to plaintiffs,for we did not discuss the degree of site specificity required in the eis.the only question was whether one had to be completed at all.
we recognize that in arguing that this eis analysis should have been parcel specific,the plaintiffs raise legitimate concerns about the uncertainty at this stage of gauging the adverse effects that future development may have on this environment.similar concerns,however,are inherent in any program for the development of natural resources.this is because such projects generally entail separate stages of leasing,exploration and development.at the earliest stage,the leasing stage we have before us,there is no way of knowing what plans for development,if any,may eventually materialize.
such concerns underlay our decision in conner and inform our decision today.they become critically important when dealing in the environmental context of northern alaska.indeed,the circuit addressed them in north slope borough andrus,when it upheld an eis prepared for off shore exploration of resources under the beaufort sea,off the northeast planning area.the circuit explained that uncertainty is an inherent problem with projects such as oil and gas programs,which include separate leasing,exploration,and development stages.id.the court went on to say that t he secretary of interior plainly can not be expected or required to wait until the totality of environmental effects is known.id.the circuit concluded that when an agency complies in good faith with the requirements of nepa and issues an eis indicating that the agency has taken a hard look at the pertinent environmental questions,its decision should be afforded great deference.id.at.the same holds true for the instant case.there is no basis for holding that the analysis in the eis was arbitrary,capricious,or done in bad faith.
nepa applies at all stages of the process,however.any later plan for actual exploration by lessees will be subject to a period of review before being accepted,rejected or modified by the secretary.see c.plaintiffs will have an opportunity to comment on any later eis.in addition,before any activity for exploration or development occurs,permits from several agencies may be required and additional permit conditions imposed for the protection of land,water and wildlife resources.id.
for these reasons we conclude that the government was not required at this stage to do a parcel by parcel examination of potential environmental effects.such effects are currently unidentifiable,because the parcels likely to be affected are not yet known.such analysis must be made at later permitting stages when the sites,and hence more site specific effects,are identifiable.
we do not agree,however,with the government further suggestion that any challenge to the sufficiency of the eis at this stage is premature.the government overreaches when it suggests that the tenth circuit decision in park county resource council united states department of agriculture,precludes any challenge to an feis at the leasing stage.the tenth circuit held that plaintiffs in that case could,at the permit stage,challenge the earlier approval of the leasing program that was instituted without preparation of any eis.the court held the plaintiffs were not required to make the objection at the earlier stage.the tenth circuit therefore recognized that the failure to prepare an eis could be raised at either stage.
park county is consistent with our decision in conner.it is also consistent with our decision
