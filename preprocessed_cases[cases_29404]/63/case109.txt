rzs holdings avv rzs seeks appellate relief from a judgment entered against it in the eastern district of virginia,confirming an arbitration award in favor of the appellees,pdvsa petroleo and several of its officers collectively,pdvsa.the district court order of may,from which this appeal flows,followed its oral ruling on pdvsa motion to confirm the arbitration award,announced at a hearing conducted on april.during that hearing,the court permitted rzs counsel to withdraw,denied rzs owner permission to proceed pro se,and struck rzs pro se pleadings.although rzs had also sought a continuance to obtain replacement counsel,the court proceeded instead to address and rule in favor of pdvsa on its motion to confirm the arbitration denying rzs continuance request and conducting an ex parte proceeding in which it ruled on the merits of the controversy.as explained below,we are obliged to vacate and remand.
pdvsa,a venezuelan corporation,is the state owned and operated oil company of venezuela.rzs is involved in the international petroleum market,with its principal place of business in oakton,virginia,and with mailing offices in london and venezuela.rzs is owned,at least in part,by an individual named shukri gabriel deeb.
the underlying dispute arose from a february,agreement,by which rzs agreed to sell,and pdvsa agreed to buy,metric tons of unleaded gasoline.although the basis for termination of the gasoline contract is disputed,the parties agree that it was terminated by pdvsa on approximately april.as a result,rzs filed breach of contract claims against pdvsa in a state court in fairfax county,virginia,and in the eastern district of virginia.
in november,rzs and pdvsa entered into settlement discussions and,according to rzs,agreed to settle rzs claims against pdvsa.pursuant to the settlement agreement,rzs filed motions to dismiss its pending lawsuits against pdvsa in the state and federal courts.these motions were granted and,after the dismissals,rzs claimed that pdvsa had improperly repudiated the settlement and refused to pay rzs the agreed settlement funds.on june,rzs again filed suit against pdvsa in fairfax county,asserting violations of the gasoline contract and the settlement agreement,as well as various other claims.on july,pdvsa removed this civil action to the eastern district of virginia.shortly thereafter,pdvsa sought a stay of the litigation pending arbitration proceedings provided for in the gasoline contract.on august,the district court granted pdvsa motion and stayed the litigation pending arbitration.
the arbitration proceedings began in the fall of and continued until february.at the conclusion thereof,the arbitration court ruled substantially in favor of pdvsa,concluding that a contract for metric tons of gasoline had been entered into by rzs and pdvsa rzs breach of contract claim nevertheless failed,and pdvsa owed no damages to rzs the arbitration court lacked jurisdiction to arbitrate the other claims and no binding settlement agreement had been entered into because the settlement had not been appropriately agreed to by pdvsa.see rzs holdings avv pdvsa petroleo,int l comm,case,
near the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings,a fee dispute developed between rzs and its attorney,george doumar.on december,doumar wrote to the arbitration court,indicating that he and his firm were withdrawing as counsel for rzs.by this correspondence,doumar alleged that rzs owed his firm over in fees and expenses,and that,pursuant to virginia rule of professional conduct b and he was entitled to withdraw because to continue the representation would constitute a financial hardship on his firm.on march,doumar also filed a motion to withdraw from the representation of rzs in the district court proceedings underlying this appeal.in the supporting memorandum that accompanied the motion to withdraw,doumar contended that it was a financial burden to continue to represent rzs and that he had advised rzs to consult with and retain another attorney.doumar thus requested that the court grant him and his firm permission to withdraw,and that the court grant rzs a thirtyday continuance to retain replacement counsel,if it so desired.
anticipating the withdrawal of doumar from the representation of rzs in the district court proceedings,deeb began filing pro se pleadings on behalf of rzs.for example,on march,before doumar filed his motion to withdraw,deeb filed a pro se motion seeking to lift the stay,to vacate the arbitration award,and to award rzs damages.pdvsa responded on march,seeking to strike the pro se pleadings deeb had filed on behalf of rzs.in an accompanying memorandum,pdvsa contended that the pro se pleadings were deficient and should be stricken because they violated the principle that business entities are entitled to appear in federal court only through licensed attorneys 
on april,deeb filed a pro se response in the district court opposing pdvsa motion to strike rzs pro se pleadings.in that submission,deeb claimed that it was appropriate for him to represent rzs pro se,in that rzs was a sole proprietorship rather than a partnership.in support of this proposition,deeb relied on a certificate he had filed with the clerk of the circuit court of fairfax county on september,registering rzs as a sole proprietorship and himself as its sole owner deeb requested,in the alternative,that if the court ruled that rzs had to be represented by an attorney,it be given a reasonable time to secure replacement counsel if doumar and his firm were allowed to withdraw.
on april,pdvsa filed a motion in the district court seeking to lift the stay of the litigation and to confirm the arbitration award in its favor.on april,deeb filed a pro se motion requesting that doumar compensate rzs for certain of its costs,asserting that doumar and his firm had breached their representation agreement with rzs.deeb filed another pro se pleading on april,requesting that the court deny pdvsa motion to confirm the arbitration award and seeking an award of damages for rzs.
on april,doumar submitted a motion on behalf of rzs seeking to file,out of time,rzs opposition papers to confirmation of the arbitration award,as well as a memorandum opposing confirmation of the award.thus,two pleadings opposing confirmation of the arbitration award were submitted to the district court one by deeb appearing pro se for rzs,and the separate motion and memorandum by doumar as counsel for rzs.
the critical motions hearing in this case,which had been noticed by both pdvsa,on its motion to confirm the arbitration award served on doumar,and by doumar,in connection with his motion to withdraw served on counsel for pdvsa,was conducted in the district court on april.at the outset of the hearing,the court,without any argument or discussion,orally granted doumar motion to withdraw.after his withdrawal motion had been granted,doumar requested that the court nevertheless allow him to argue the substantive motions on behalf of rzs,in that rzs had not had an opportunity to secure replacement counsel.in response,the court advised doumar i t you in or you out.which do you wish to be when doumar answered that he was out,the court simply responded goodbye.id.having permitted doumar to withdraw,the court then refused to consider the pleadings previously filed by him on rzs behalf,including the april,memorandum opposing confirmation of the arbitration award and the accompanying motion to file it out of time 
the court then turned its consideration to the disposition of the other pending motions.it orally ruled,again without hearing from the parties,that deeb does not have the right to file any motions in this court.he not a member of the bar of the court.all of his pleadings will have to be stricken.the court also informed deeb and those present that it was prepared to confirm the arbitration award.directing its remarks to deeb,it explained that 
a s a business person who owns a business,you can not appear in federal court.you have to appear by an attorney.you do not have an attorney,so all the things that you filed are invalid and will not be considered by the court.i prepared now to enter the arbitration award to co
