the oil companies timely appealed the court of federal claims judgment to us,and we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under a.
this appeal turns on the proper interpretation of a final judgment as the term is used in c,and on the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by that statute.this court reviews without deference both issues of statutory construction,ainslie united states,and issues of sovereign immunity,ins.of the west united states.

well established rules of statutory construction frame a court analysis of whether congress has waived sovereign immunity in a statute or statutory scheme,and they tilt the interpretive playing field in favor of the government immunity.in analyzing whether congress has waived the immunity of the united states,we must construe waivers strictly in favor of the sovereign,and not enlarge the waiver beyond what the language requires.shaw,at.quoting ruckelshaus sierra club,d quoting transp.united states.citation omitted.a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed,or a court must infer that congress did not intend to create a waiver.united states mitchell,d quoting united states king,d see also united states williams,d united states nordic,d irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d kalan,united states.if a statute is susceptible to a plausible reading under which sovereign immunity is not waived,the statute fails to establish an unambiguous waiver and sovereign immunity therefore remains intact.see nordic,at.

the oil companies contend on appeal that c demonstrates that congress has waived sovereign immunity for interest on their contract judgment.the court of federal claims provided two grounds to support its conclusion that the oil companies contention is incorrect.we examine each in turn.
the court of federal claims erred in holding that the december,judgment was not a final judgment in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit as envisioned by c.although it is true,as the court of federal claims noted,that the language of the federal circuit opinion and judgment clearly state s that the court was affirming the prior judgments of the court of federal claims,interest opinion.at,the legal accuracy of a trial court judgment is not determinative of the status of the judgment of a court of appeals as a final judgment of that court.a final judgment is a court last action that settles the rights of the parties and disposes of all issues in controversy,except for the award of costs and,sometimes,attorney fees and enforcement of the judgment.black law dictionary ed catlin united states.holding that in the context of appellate jurisdiction a final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.our december,judgment was,temporally,our last action in the oil companies suit for breach of contract,and it did not remand any substantive disputes on liability or on damages for resolution in the court of federal claims.williams principi,noting that a remand is generally not a final judgment.it was,therefore,a final judgment of this court for the purposes of section c.
given that the december,judgment was a final judgment of the federal circuit under section c,we must consider whether section c unambiguously waives sovereign immunity for interest on all judgments of the federal circuit as the oil companies posit it does.
section c can not be read in isolation.its express language triggers a chain of that links four distinct statutory provisions.
section,in its entirety,provides as follows 
a interest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court.execution therefor may be levied by the marshal,in any case where,by the law of the state in which such court is held,execution may be levied for interest on judgments recovered in the courts of the state.such interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment,at a rate equal to the weekly average constant maturity treasury yield,as published by the board of governors of the federal reserve system,for the calendar week preceding the date of the judgment.the director of the administrative office of the united states courts shall distribute notice of that rate and any changes in it to all federal judges.
b interest shall be computed daily to the date of payment except as provided in section b of this title and section b of title,and shall be compounded annually.
c this section shall not apply in any judgment of any court with respect to any internal revenue tax case.interest shall be allowed in such cases at the underpayment rate or overpayment rate whichever is appropriate established under section of the internal revenue code of.
except as otherwise provided in paragraph of this subsection,interest shall be allowed on all final judgments against the united states in the united states court of appeals for the federal c ircuit,at the rate provided in subsection a and as provided in subsection b.
interest shall be allowed,computed,and paid on judgments of the united states court of federal claims only as provided in paragraph of this subsection or in any other provision of law.
this section shall not be construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any court not specified in this section.
as relevant to this appeal,section c provides that interest shall be allowed on all final judgments against the united states in the united states court of appeals for the federal c ircuit as provided in subsection b,id.c,and section b states that i nterest shall be computed daily to the date of payment except as provided in section b of this title and section b of title,and shall be compounded annually,id.b.section b,in turn,provides that i nterest on a judgment against the united states affirmed by the supreme court after review on petition of the united states is paid at the same rate specified in a.id.b.
finally,chapter of title,entitled appropriations,contains,commonly known as the judgment fund statute,which,according to its title,creates an appropriation for judgments,awards,and compromise settlements.section b,the only subsection of section referenced in b,provides as follows 
interest may be paid from the appropriation made by this section 
a on a judgment of a district court,only when the judgment becomes final after review on appeal or petition by the united states government,and then only from the date of filing of the transcript of the judgment with the secretary of the treasury through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance or 
b on a judgment of the court of appeals for the federal circuit or the united states court of federal claims under section b of title,only from the date of filing of the transcript of the judgment with the secretary of the treasury through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.
interest payable under this subsection in a proceeding reviewed by the supreme court is not allowed after the end of the term in which the judgment is affirmed.
b emphases added.
the oil companies argument is straightforward.the oil companies argue that,under the plain language of section c,congress has unambiguously waived sovereign immunity for all final judgments against the united states in the united states court of appeals for the federal c ircuit.all means all,they say,and all includes their contract judgment.
the oil companies recognize that section c provides for interest on judgments only as provided in subsection b,but they contend that subsection b supports,rather than detracts from,their argument.subsection b formulates a general rule for calculating interest and identifying the time period during which interest accrues i nterest shall be computed daily to the date of payment b.this general rule applies except as provided in section b of this title and section b of title.id.according to the oil companies,these two sections merely place different constraints on the computation of interest.they permit interest only on a particular subset of judgments against the united judgments against the united states affirmed by the supreme court after review on petition of the united states.b see also b b addressing only interest on a judgment of the court of appeals for the federal circuit under section b of title.with respect to these particular judgments against the united states,the two statutes define a window during which interest is available that is different from the one specified in section b,stating that interest is to be computed only from the date of filing of the transcript of the judgment with the secretary of the treasury through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.b b.
according to the oil companies theory,neither section b nor the two statutes it references negate the government liability for interest on all federal circuit judgments established in section c because these statutes address only the secondary,technical issue of how to compute the required interest.furthermore,the oil companies contend that the interest owed on their contract judgment is unaffected by b or b.these sections are only relevant to the limited set of judgments expressly delineated is,to judgments affirmed by the supreme court after review on petition of the united states.for all judgments against the united states that the united states does not unsuccessfully appeal to the supreme court,the oil companies insist that the provisions in b and b b do not impact the existence or the scope of the government waiver of sovereign immunity as established in section.
in summary,the oil companies contend that section c provides a rule that is applicable to all meaning all judgments of the federal circuit,and that b and b merely list particular circumstances not relevant to this appeal under which interest on judgments of the federal circuit against the united states is computed according to a rule other than the one specified in section b.because the united states did not petition the supreme court for review of the oil companies contract judgment,the oil companies argue that the exceptions do not affect their right to interest,and they seek interest running from the date the judgment was entered to the date the judgment was paid as provided in section b.
viewing this argument from a historical perspective,the oil companies propose that the federal courts improvement act of fcia,stat,which created this court and enacted subsections b and c of,left the waiver of sovereign immunity for interest intact for all of the judgments that it had historically encompassed,but created a for interest on all other judgments for which sovereign immunity had never before been waived.
prior to the enactment of fcia,contained language similar to the language now found in b.section,entitled appropriations for payment of judgments against the united states,stated that whenever a judgment rendered by the court of claims now the court of appeals for the federal circuit is payable from this appropriation,interest payable thereon in accordance with section b of title shall be computed from the date of the filing of the transcript thereof in the general accounting office.prior to,b provided,as it does today,for interest on judgments against the united states affirmed by the supreme court after review on petition of the united states.b.before the fcia,these two statutes were the only statutes addressing interest on judgments of the court of claims,and they were held to waive sovereign immunity for interest only during the period that the government appealed its adverse judgment to the supreme court.thompson kennickell.we find no cases suggesting that prior to the government paid interest on court of claims judgments against the united states that the united states did not seek to have reviewed in the supreme court.
thus,for judgments of the federal circuit against the united states reviewed by the supreme court on the government request and affirmed,the oil companies suggest that the pre and waiver of sovereign immunity is identical and that the waiver is for interest only during the period that the government appealed its adverse judgment to the supreme court.id.the oil companies contend,however,that while this figure has remained constant,the fcia shifted the ground from black to white.the oil companies argue that subsections c and b of section now not only waive sovereign immunity for interest on all judgments against the united states that the government chooses not to appeal to the supreme that were previously entirely beyond the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity for also that they waive sovereign immunity for interest on such judgments from the date of the judgment until the date of time period potentially longer than is permitted for appealed judgments.
needless to say,the government views the effect of the statutory scheme on sovereign immunity from liability for interest differently.it argues that the regime remains in force today unaltered by the enactment of subsections c and b of section.it argues that the relevant statutes are clear on their face,waiving immunity only narrowly as in the past,and that,at best,the oil companies have demonstrated an ambiguity in the statutory scheme that by law precludes a waiver of sovereign immunity 
we conclude that the oil companies have not demonstrated an unequivocal or unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity for interest on their contract judgment.the interaction of sections c and b,on the one hand,and sections b and b,on the other hand,is subject to plausible readings under which congress has not waived sovereign immunity for interest on judgments of the federal circuit against the united states that the united states does not seek to have reviewed in the supreme court.
in the end,the legal choice is simple and.either the relevant statute could mean that all final judgments of the federal circuit carry interest,or it could mean that all final judgments as provided in the relevant statutes,less than the global universe of all final judgments,carry such interest.given the legal test to be administered to the statutes at hand,and the statutes themselves as discussed below,there can be no doubt that congress has not unequivocally excluded the narrower reading of the relevant statutes.given the fact that congress never before had even contemplated waiving sovereign immunity for interest on all final judgments of a court of appeals,the notion that it has done so for the federal circuit with nary a word of legislative history to support such a sweeping change strikes us as nearly beyond comprehension.
section b establishes a general rule for interest calculation except as provided in section b of this title and section b of title.b.on its face,it is susceptible to both a reading favoring the oil companies and a reading favoring the government.
as discussed above,the oil companies suggest one reading the exception in section b should be read to mean except as provided for the specific set of judgments listed in section b and section b,namely except when the judgment against the united states is affirmed by the supreme court after review on petition of the united states,b.
however,a second plausible reading exists as well.the reference to sections b of title and b of title is a citation to all of the relevant provisions in the united states code that deal directly with interest on judgments against the government so the reference to these statutes in section b can be read to refer to all judgments against the government.according to this reading,the exception in section b should be read to mean except as provided for the general class of judgments addressed in section b and section b,namely except when the judgment is against the government.
under this second reading,there is no waiver of sovereign immunity for interest on a judgment like the oil companies contract judgment that the government does not seek,unsuccessfully,to have reviewed in the supreme court.interest on such a judgment is withdrawn from the scope of the general rule in section b because the judgment is against the government,but does not fall within the scope of the interest provisions of b b because the judgment does not satisfy the criteria therein stated.in sum,under this reading,congress has not created a rule for computing interest on such a judgment,so congress has not waived immunity for interest on such a judgment.
the oil companies argue that the second reading is not a plausible reading because it renders section c superfluous by making sections b and b determinative of the outcome in all cases seeking interest on judgments of the federal circuit.in the context of section as a whole,we conclude that some redundancy in statutory provisions is insufficient to transform a plausible reading into an implausible one.several provisions of section c are replete with redundancy,and section c is thus more easily read as providing an overview intended to emphasize and to rather than as codifying law not provided for elsewhere.for example,subsection c states that interest shall be allowed,computed,and paid on judgments of the united states court of federal claims only as provided in paragraph of this subsection or in any other provision of law.c.court of federal claims judgments are mentioned nowhere else in section subsection,which provides the rule for internal revenue tax cases,would presumably apply to internal revenue tax cases in the court of federal claims without the aid of subsection c other provision s of law would also presumably apply to court of federal claim judgments without the benefit of subsection c.likewise,subsection states that this section shall not be construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any court not specified in this section.id.c.presumably,this provision is redundant in light of ordinary principles of statutory interpretation,and principles of sovereign immunity,and was added by congress for emphasis.
in summary,the reading of the except as provided in language of section b under which congress did not waive sovereign immunity for interest on the oil companies contract judgment is a plausible reading,and the existence of a plausible reading under which congress has not waived sovereign immunity means that we are obliged to conclude from the plain language of the statute that congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity.see nordic,at.noting that sovereign immunity was not waived because the readings of a statute that did not waive sovereign immunity were,although assuredly not the only readings,plausible readings.
another argument suggests to us as well that,despite the presence of the word all in section c,congress has not unequivocally waived sovereign immunity for interest on judgments of the federal circuit against the united states unless the criteria listed in b are satisfied.there can be no unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity for interest on a broad array of judgments of this court if congress has not clearly appropriated funds with which the government can pay the interest.
under the appropriations clause of the constitution,funds from the treasury can not be used for purposes other than those permitted by the appropriating statute.see office of pers.mgmt.richmond,d money may be paid out of the federal treasury only through an appropriation made by law in other words,the payment of money from the treasury must be authorized by a statute.id.at.the general appropriation for payment of judgments does not create an fund for judicial disbursement rather,funds may be paid out only on the basis of a judgment based on a substantive right to compensation based on the express terms of a specific statute.the congressional appropriation that creates the judgment fund,from which the government pays interest on all judgments not otherwise provided for,a,thus can only be dispensed in accordance with the terms of section.in light of these strict rules governing the expenditure of the treasury funds,it is plausible to construe the role of section b in the concatenation of statutes at issue in this appeal as more important than merely explaining the method of computing interest for the narrow subset of judgments against the united states that the oil companies argue are excepted from section b.it is plausible to conclude that the scope of the appropriation in section b is jurisdictional in nature,and that the government has waived sovereign thus is for the interest specified therein.under this reading,congress intended to waive sovereign immunity only for interest payments that satisfy the conditions of section b because congress has appropriated funds to pay interest only under those conditions.inversely,congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity for interest payments for which congress has provided no funds.
as discussed above,the oil companies claim for interest on their contract judgment does not satisfy the conditions of section b,so to the extent that the statutory restrictions on dispersal of funds from the judgment fund to pay interest on judgments are jurisdictional,the oil companies claim must fail.the oil companies failed to counter the proposition that section is the only potential existing source of funding for the interest that they seek and that congress has not provided for payment of the interest allegedly authorized by section c elsewhere section b b permits payment of interest from the judgment fund appropriation created by section only on final judgments of the federal circuit against the united states that the united states unsuccessfully appeals to the supreme court.see b b concerning only judgments of the court of appeals for the federal circuit under section b of title b pertaining only to judgments against the united states affirmed by the supreme court after review on petition of the united states.the government did not petition for review of the oil companies contract judgment,so congress has not expressly appropriated funds in section b b to pay interest on judgments such as the oil companies contract judgment.no other subsection of b permits payment of the interest either.see b a addressing interest on a judgment of a district court id.b placing an additional limitation on interest otherwise payable under subsection b.
returning to the language of section c,whether the word all claims a universe that includes a subset of final judgments for which certiorari is successfully taken,or whether congress meant all to mean all of those cases for which it clearly has provided a source of funding in section but not another category of final judgments for which congress has provided no funding,is ambiguous.however,construing the provisions of the judgment fund in section b as limitations on the government waiver of sovereign immunity,we would be required to find ambiguity in the overall statutory scheme even if the language of subsections c and b of section were,hypothetically,crystal clear when read in isolation from the judgment fund statute.
the reasonableness of concluding that the contours of section b determine the liability of the united states for interest is supported by the pronouncements of other courts on the jurisdictional nature of section b.in transco leasing united states,cir,the fifth circuit interpreted section b a,the statute controlling access to the judgment fund for the government to pay interest on judgments of the district courts,as determinative of the scope of congress waiver of sovereign immunity 
section b restricts the liability of the united states for postjudgment interest to amounts funded in section.section b,then,acts as more than an appropriation statute,it limits the liability of the united states for postjudgment interest,by limiting the waiver of sovereign immunity to the time periods it specifies.accordingly,we reject appellees contention that section is not controlling because it is an appropriation statute which determines which judgments and amounts the united states will pay,but does not determine whether or not the united states is liable for a particular judgment or award of interest.

we are aware of two cases from sister circuits that have held that a different aspect of the judgment fund incorporation of in section a a is not a superseding limitation on the government waiver of sovereign immunity.rosenfeld united states,cir see also trout garrett.in relevant part,section a provides that 
a necessary amounts are appropriated to pay final judgments,awards,compromise settlements,and interest and costs specified in the judgments or otherwise authorized by law when 
payment is not otherwise provided for 
payment is certified by the secretary of the treasury and 
the judgment,award,or settlement is payable 
a under section of title 
a.section provides for payment of final judgments rendered by a district court against the united states.
in trout,the district court granted the title vii plaintiffs claim for interim attorney fees the government conceded that congress had waived sovereign immunity for such a claim,see at relying on the title vii provision codified in k that provides the united states shall be liable for costs the same as a private person and the court characterized the government concession as an acknowledgement of a legal proposition,id.the government insisted,however,that sovereign immunity for immediate payment of this interim attorney fees award had not been waived because limitations on the dispersal of funds from the judgment fund prevented the government from paying the award until the end of the litigation produced a final,not an interim,judgment.the government argument relied on the language in section a a permitting payment from the judgment fund for judgments under section,and section provision solely for the payment of final judgments.the court ruled against the government,however,concluding that the language in section incorporated by reference into the judgment fund statute was not designed to retract or limit duly enacted waivers of sovereign immunity.id.at see also rosenfeld,at since congress waived sovereign immunity from attorney fees in the foia actions no additional waiver is required in the judgment fund statute for interim fees.
we express no opinion on whether the waiver of sovereign immunity from interim attorney fees in these cases was truly unequivocally expressed,mitchell,at,but we conclude that the discussion of in rosenfeld and trout does not render implausible our interpretation of the role that b plays in maintaining and waiving sovereign immunity for interest on federal circuit judgments against the united states.the courts in both trout and rosenfeld relied on the fact that waivers of sovereign immunity existed in title vii and the foia,statutes completely unconnected to the judgment fund statute.in contrast,the alleged waiver of sovereign immunity in section c on which the oil companies rely in the instant case includes a reference,via section b,to the very limitations in section b b at issue.whereas the court in trout began its analysis of the judgment fund statute by reaffirming the proposition that sovereign immunity does not bar a claim by a title vii plaintiff for interim fees against the government,at,we must consider the reference to the judgment fund statute in section b in the first instance to determine whether a claim for interest by a party granted a final judgment by the federal circuit is barred by sovereign immunity.
additionally,the sovereign immunity inquiry is different for the judgment fund provision in section a,addressed in trout and rosenfeld,and the judgment fund provision in section b at issue here.the provisions in subsection b are subject to the rule and thus to an added gloss of strictness on the traditional sovereign immunity analysis.shaw,at.
finally,we note that rosenfeld relied on the fact that when a court has rejected the judgment fund argument casting section as a waiver of sovereign immunity,the government has managed to pay the interim fee award.at.for evidence of this fact,rosenfeld cited jurgens eeoc,which states 
in both this case and shafer commander,army air force exchange service,no.ca,wl,the defendants argued that they could not pay the interim awards due to the restrictions of and.when faced with a citation for contempt of court,however,the defendants in shafer made immediate payment.the court believes that the eeoc can also arrange for immediate payment of this court interim award.
jurgens.at.however,the supreme court has stated that 
i t would be most anomalous for a judicial order to require a government official to make an extrastatutory payment of federal funds.it is a federal crime,punishable by fine and imprisonment,for any government officer or employee to knowingly spend money in excess of that appropriated by congress.
richmond,at.here,where the oil companies can not suggest an appropriate statutory appropriation of funds with which interest on their million contract judgments could be paid,we decline to infer that congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for interest when payment could only occur extrastatutorily.
as with the core ambiguity in section c,we thus conclude that it is plausible to read section b b to likewise determine whether or not the united states is liable for a particular judgment or award of interest.transco leasing,at.
requested at oral argument to identify a statute authorizing the appropriation of funds from which interest on their contract judgment could be paid,as interest can not be paid under the terms of section b,the oil companies were quick to suggest section a.the oil companies argue that the interest on all final judgments against the united states in the united states court of appeals for the federal c ircuit described in section c is interest otherwise authorized by law as provided for in section a,and that section a by its own force therefore appropriates the n ecessary amounts to pay their interest.even assuming that the interest mentioned in section c is interest otherwise authorized by law,however,this argument fails.
section a authorizes payment from the judgment fund only when the judgment is payable under one of the statutes listed in subsection a,as the numbered subsections of the statute are written in the conjunctive.in full,section a authorizes the appropriation of funds when the judgment,award,or settlement is payable 
a under section,or of title 
b under section of this title 
c under a decision of a board of contract appeals or 
d in excess of an amount payable from the appropriations of an agency for a meritorious claim under section or of title,section of title,or section of the national aeronautics and space act of.
a.none of the listed statutes authorize the payment of a judgment of the federal circuit.thus,to the extent that the oil companies seek payment of interest based on their contract judgment obtained in this court,section a does not aid their cause.
the oil companies could argue,however,that the judgment for which they seek payment from the judgment fund is the court of federal claims judgment that they would receive if they were to prevail on this appeal.subsection a a provides for payment from the judgment fund of judgments payable under,which in turn authorizes the payment of every final judgment rendered by the united states court of federal claims against the united states,a.a construction of section a permitting payment from the judgment fund under this theory is tenuous,as it would require two different portions of section a to refer to two different judgments the interest otherwise authorized by law in subsection a would refer to interest on the oil companies federal circuit contract judgment,and the judgment payable under section in subsection a a would refer to the court of federal claims judgment sought in this appeal.nonetheless,even accepting this construction of section a,the oil companies argument fails to demonstrate an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.subsection a of section is clearly not independent of subsection b,and subsection b is plausibly read to limit the interest payable under subsection a.
this line of analysis requires us to confront the language in section b which states that i nterest may be paid from the appropriation made by this section,namely section or the judgment fund as a whole.b emphasis added.if the may language in subsection b is simply permissive,allowing not only the conditions in a and b but other conditions as well to warrant payment from the judgment fund,the oil companies could navigate the interstices of section with success.but the matter is not so simple,as the word may in some contexts is not permissive but indeed is interpreted as restrictive in nature see,cortez byrd chips,bill harbert constr,d resolving the ambiguity between permissive and restrictive interpretations of the word may in the venue provisions of the federal arbitration act faa citizens bank bougas,d noting that it is settled that the word may in means may only in the restrictive sense of the word.whereas a permissive reading of may would make subsection b an enumeration of conditions sufficient for the payment of interest,a restrictive reading of may would transform subsection b into a list of conditions necessary for the payment of interest.without doubt,if the may in subsection b were to be restrictive,then the provisions of subsection b b would clearly prohibit the payment of interest on the oil companies final contract judgment of this court in this particular case.thus,for the oil companies to succeed,the permissive reading must be unequivocally the proper reading.we decline to reach this conclusion.
in cortez byrd chips,the supreme court interpreted the meaning of the word may in three related venue provisions of the faa,including section that provides that,to confirm an arbitration award,application may be made to the united states court in and for the district within which such award was made.at.quoting.one party argued that the statute was permissive in that it liberalized venue by adding another district in which confirmation could occur the other party countered that the statute was restrictive in that it required confirmation to occur in the specified district.the court expressly declined to resolve this issue based on the plain meaning of the statute 
enlightenment will not come merely from parsing the language,which is less clear then either party contends.although may could be read as permissive in each section the mere use of may is not necessarily conclusive of congressional intent to provide for permissive or discretionary authority each party has a point,but neither point is conclusive.
id.at.instead,the court examined the statutory history and animating policy of the venue provisions of the faa and determined that may was used in the permissive sense.id.at.
we find the court reasoning in cortez byrd chips both persuasive and decisive.even if read in the light most favorable to the oil companies,the plain language of the may p
