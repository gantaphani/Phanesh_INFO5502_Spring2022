ascent energy,and ascent energy louisiana,collectively,ascent appeal from a bench trial in which rathborne land company,rathborne was awarded damages for ascent breach of its obligations to reasonably develop and explore a leased,parcel of oil,gas,and mineral land.ascent argues that rathborne failed to put ascent into default before filing suit and that rathborne is not the proper plaintiff.ascent also challenges various aspects of the district court award of damages,interest,and fees.
in,the joseph rathborne land lumber company,granted an oil,gas,and mineral lease to the california company for a parcel of land in charles parish,louisiana.the original lease covered acres,but,through a variety of partial releases,the lease now covers acres.this parcel is at the center of the present case.
the california company interest in the acre lease passed through various entities,eventually coming into ascent possession.the succession of lessors is similarly complicated.indeed,as discussed below,the identity of the lessor remains unresolved,notwithstanding a stipulation in the order that rathborne land company,the plaintiff in this case,is the successor owner of the acre lease 
on november,rathborne counsel sent ascent the following letter the november letter 
re demand for development 
this firm represents the interest of the current lessors you and your predecessors in title have failed and refused to comply with your lease obligations to reasonably develop and further explore all portions of the lands currently burdened by said lease.accordingly,this letter constitutes formal demand of your lessors for the immediate release of all undeveloped and portions of this lease.
should you fail or refuse to provided sic undersigned counsel with a recordable instrument of the requested release within thirty days of your receipt of this letter,we have been instructed by your lessors to take whatever legal action is necessary to secure the cancellation and release of all undeveloped and unexplored portions of this lease.
following the november letter,the parties attempted to settle their dispute,but were unable to reach agreement.in may,rathborne,along with another plaintiff who also leased mineral property to ascent,filed suit against ascent in louisiana state court they alleged that ascent had failed to perform its obligations of reasonable development and further exploration as required by louisiana prudent operator standard under.ann.ascent removed the case to federal court.
in february,rathborne filed an amended complaint,asking for cancellation of the lease and damages.at the center of rathborne complaint was ascent failure during the preceding years to participate in a number of opportunities to conduct a seismological survey,which,according to rathborne,could have aided the development of the mineral leases.because the parcel sat in the middle of a larger parcel,ascent refusal to participate in a seismic survey effectively made it impossible to conduct a useful survey of the rest of the adjoining land.the complaint alleged that ascent was in violation of its lease and statutory obligations to reasonably develop and explore,and that the lease had failed to produce oil and gas in paying quantities,as required by both the lease and louisiana law.
ascent filed a motion to dismiss or,alternatively,a motion for summary judgment in august,alleging that the november letter failed to comply with notice and requirements under the lease and under louisiana law.the district court denied the motion.
the district court held a bench trial over several days in early march.in may,ascent filed a motion to introduce two new pieces of evidence that rathborne was not,in fact,the lessor of the parcel,and thus not the proper plaintiff and that ascent had released the lease in response to a new demand letter from rathborne.the district court denied ascent motion to dismiss on the grounds of mistaken parties the release of the lease,on the other hand,mooted part of rathborne complaint,narrowing the issue to damages only.
the district court issued its judgment and opinion in late.the court found ascent to have breached its obligation to reasonably develop and explore.it awarded rathborne damages for three years simple interest,or the time value of money,on the seismic fee paid to rathborne in for the entire acres surveyed.that award totaled.the court also awarded one year lost leasing revenues bonus payment plus rental payment on the entire acres,totaling.the court held that ascent had ceased to be a good faith possessor of the lease in february,and thus owed rathborne an accounting and payment of all production from the property since that date.that award totaled.the court also awarded rathborne a stipulated amount of attorney fees,totaling.
the district court invited the parties to brief the issue of whether it should award rathborne interest on its damages award.following briefing,the court issued another opinion,awarding rathborne interest on all amounts except the simple interest award for seismic fees.
ascent timely appealed.on appeal,ascent does not challenge the district court rulings that it breached its lease obligations to reasonably develop and explore,and that it ceased to be a good faith possessor of the lease in february.instead,ascent renews its arguments that the november letter did not satisfy louisiana demand requirement and that rathborne is not the proper plaintiff.ascent also raises several objections about the propriety of the damages,interest,and attorney fees awarded.
ascent argues that rathborne claims should have been dismissed because rathborne did not satisfy louisiana requirements for providing lessees notice of an alleged breach of obligations and time to cure that breach,rathborne failed to put ascent in default prior to bringing suit.the district court rejected this argument when it ruled on ascent motions and again in its final judgment opinion,holding that the november demand letter satisfied the requirements to place ascent in default of its lease.
ann.provides 
if a mineral lessor seeks relief from his lessee arising from any claim that the lessee has failed to develop and operate the property leased as a prudent operator,he must give his lessee written notice of the asserted breach to perform and allow a reasonable time for performance by the lessee as a prerequisite to a judicial demand for damages or dissolution of the lease.
thus,before rathborne could bring suit for ascent breach of the obligation to reasonably develop and explore,it needed to give adequate written notice of the breach to ascent and allow ascent a reasonable amount of time for performance.see mcdowell pg e res.cir.so d,to cancel a lease for breach of an implied covenant,the plaintiff is required to place the defendant formally in default prior to seeking judicial intervention.the lease contract also had a parallel requirement,which set the reasonable time to cure at days.
the parties disagree as to the proper standard of review.ascent argues that the standard is de novo because the appeal is from the denial of ascent motion to dismiss,or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.rathborne contends that the standard is clear error because the sufficiency of the demand was an issue of fact decided by the court as part of the bench trial.whether the challenge is to the denial of ascent motion or the district court opinion,the proper standard of review is de novo.since the issue turns on whether the november letter satisfies.ann,it has nothing to do with the district court factual findings.rather,the question is a matter of law,and thus subject to de novo review.see rutgers martin woodlands gas,cir.
ascent does not seriously contend that the november letter failed to put ascent on notice that rathborne considered ascent to be in violation of the obligation to develop and explore the leased premises,the first requirement of.ann.instead,ascent focuses its complaint on the second requirement,that the lessee be afforded a reasonable opportunity to perform its development obligations.ascent cites hunt stacy.cir.so d,in which the court criticized demand letters that contained content similar to the november letter in approving the trial court finding that the demand requirement had not been met,the appeals court noted that the central focus of the letters was to demand a release of the leases as opposed to requesting further development.id.at.
although the language of the november letter arguably focuses as much on the demand for release as the demand for development,we nonetheless find the instant case distinguishable from hunt.in hunt,the lessors initial demand letters were followed two months later by a letter in which the lessors wrote to the lessees advising that the lessors had no plans to further pursue the matter.id.at.five years later,the lessors sent a letter stating that the leases were deemed terminated and,just three days later,filed suit to judicially terminate the leases on the basis of a failure to explore and develop.id.here,by contrast,the initial demand letter was followed by two and a half years of negotiation in which rathborne made clear exactly what it would consider to be reasonable steps to explore and develop.the letters the parties exchanged during this period clearly show that ascent was on notice of the development rathborne sought and that rathborne provided ascent a reasonable opportunity to perform its obligations.unlike the lessees in hunt,ascent should not have been surprised when rathborne eventually filed suit in.
to rule in favor of ascent on this issue would require us to put too much emphasis on form over substance.ann.does not specify that any magic words must appear in the demand letter.under louisiana law,t he purpose of the requirement of putting in default for is to provide the lessee notice that the lessor considers the lessee actions or inaction as violative of the implied obligation to develop the leased premises,and to afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to perform its development obligations.hunt,so d at.since the november letter and the intervening two and a half years accomplished that purpose,we hold that the november letter met the.ann.demand requirement 
the district court awarded rathborne damages for lost leasing opportunities on its property because it found it was more probable than not that rathborne would have been able to lease the property in or and earn a bonus of per acre plus at least one year rental at per acre.ascent argues that the court should have required evidence of a firm offer to lease the property in question before awarding damages for lost leasing opportunities.because this issue involves a legal determination of the proper burden of proof,our review is de novo.halliburton comm r of internal revenue,cir.
the district court cited two recent louisiana cases for the proposition that,in order to recover lost leasing opportunity damages,a plaintiff must show it is more probable than not that he would have been able to lease the property in question,absent the lessee bad behavior.in the first,chesapeake operating,richardson.cir.so d,a lessee failed to make rental payments and,as a result,its lease automatically terminated.for a time,however,the lessee refused to release the land back to the lessor.the trial court dismissed the lessor suit because he failed to prove an actual,identifiable opportunity to lease.id.at.the appellate court reversed,holding that,to recover lost leasing opportunity damages,the lessor need not prove an actual,identifiable opportunity to lease.the standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.the lessor need only prove it more probable than not he would have been able to lease his property had the lessee complied with its statutory duty.id.relying on edmundson.montex drilling.cir.so d.in the second,wood axis energy.cir.so d,the court granted lost leasing opportunity damages when a lessee continued to hold a property after the lease had automatically terminated for failure to produce in paying quantities.the court cited chesapeake and held that the plaintiffs established more probably than not that they would have had the opportunity to lease the property for per year,had the lessee released the lease after it terminated.wood,so d at.
ascent argues that wood and chesapeake are distinguishable because,in both cases,the underlying lease was held to have automatically terminated in the past,whereas here ascent breached obligations under a lease.ascent reasons that in automatic termination cases the lessees were held liable for damages under the laxer more probable than not standard because they wrongfully retained possession of the lessor property after the lease terminated.
in the several pages of briefing that ascent spends on this supposed factual distinction,it never cogently explains why it makes any difference in the standard for recovery of lost leasing opportunity damages.ascent cites a long string of cases,which,it claims,trace a clear line between automatic termination cases like wood and chesapeake,and breach of obligation cases like this one.in the latter,ascent claims,louisiana courts have applied a more rigorous firm offer standard before awarding lost leasing opportunity damages.the cases,however,do not come close to proving ascent point.most of them involve not the standard for awarding damages,but the standard for proving a violation of the obligation to reasonably develop.in determining whether there was a breach of the obligation to reasonably develop,courts have held that a vague,imprecise offer by a third party to lease a parcel is not sufficient evidence that the current lessee is not developing in the manner of a prudent operator.but those cases say nothing about the standard for awarding damages once that obligation is determined to have been breached,as it has been here.
in fact,only one of the cases cited by ascent addresses damages.in every other case,the remedy at issue is cancellation of the lease.that one case,goodrich exxon,made the unremarkable holding that damages would not be awarded in that instance because they were not supported by the record.the court opined,in dictum,that d amages alleged to be due by reason of lost opportunity to lease are highly speculative in nature.id.at.this comment is hardly grounds for applying a firm offer standard,absent any precedent supporting such a rule.
in addition to its faulty caselaw argument,ascent also argues that a lessee statutory obligation to present evidence of a release of a lease if the lease automatically terminates somehow suggests that the more probable than not standard should be limited to automatic termination cases.that argument is unconvincing.nowhere does ascent show any connection between this statutory obligation and the standard of proof for recovery of lost leasing opportunity damages.
the only standard in louisiana caselaw for determining whether to award lost leasing opportunities is the more probable than not standard applied by the district court.ascent suggested alternative standard,evidence of a firm offer to lease,seems to have been invented without any reliable legal precedent or even a sensible policy argument to support it.accordingly,we find no error in the district court use of the more probable than not standard.
ascent argues that the district court awarded rathborne double damages with its lost leasing revenue award.ascent reasons that because rathborne was able to its parcel after ascent relinquished it in,it follows that rathborne did not miss out on lost leasing revenue bonus and rental payments in the end.in other words,all rathborne is missing is the time value of money for that leasing revenue,that is,the simple interest it could have earned on the leasing revenue if it had received it in instead of in.ascent maintains that the lost leasing damages should be treated the same as the lost seismic fee award,for which the court awarded rathborne only the simple interest it could have earned if the fee had been received in instead of in.
having determined that the district court properly applied the more probable than not standard to the lost leasing issue,we review its factual finding that rathborne would have been able to lease the parcel a second time under the clearly erroneous standard of review.see rhodes guiberson oil tools,cir.if the district court factual findings are plausible in light of the evidence presented,we will not reverse its decision even if we might have reached a different conclusion.tyler union oil of,cir.
rathborne acknowledges that the district court award must have been based on the theory that rathborne would have been able to lease out the parcel at least twice,had it been available in,the year following rathborne demand to ascent.here,this favorable assumption was supported by the evidence presented at the bench trial.the testimony of several witnesses,including greg lier,mark miller,and john berrnhardt,and documentary evidence evincing leasing opportunities in nearby fields following the completion of seismic surveys indicate a viable market for oil and gas leases in southeastern louisiana.for example,rathborne showed that a seismic survey was conducted on a similar parcel of land,held by rathborne parent company,about ten to fifteen miles away from the parcel.following this survey,rathborne parent company granted several successive mineral leases on the property.additionally,there was testimony from which the district court could infer that the parcel at issue in this case was similar to nearby parcels leasing at approximately per acre.given this evidence,the district court did not clearly err in concluding that rathborne would have been able to lease the disputed acreage more than once if it had been able to seismically survey the parcel prior to.
ascent nevertheless contends that there was insufficient evidence to support full lost leasing damages because under louisiana law,speculation alone can not support a claim for damages for breach of contract.ascent cites spencer luckenbach gulf,so d,a case in which the louisiana supreme court denied damages for lost membership dues to an unincorporated labor organization because the court found the connection between the hypothetical lost dues and an employer breach of an employment contract too tenuous.i n considering a claim for damages for the breach of a contract we can only rest our judgment on the basis of certainty and not on the basis of mere conjecture and speculation.id.at.
ascent also cites coon placid oil,so d,writ denied,so d,in which a state appellate court reviewed a damages award for lost future oil revenues for clear error after a lessee caused a blowout that damaged the surface of the lessor property.the appeals court found that the trial court disregarded evidence that the blowout did not impair the lessor from drilling for oil in the future.because of this contradictory evidence,the court found that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claim for loss of future income to a legal certainty,and therefore,that the trial court clearly erred in awarding damages based on purely speculative evidence.id.at.
neither spencer nor coon controls here.the link between ascent contractual breach and the damages awarded is closer than in spencer and is supported by specific evidence in the record.and,in contrast to the defendant in coon,ascent has not pointed to any countervailing evidence that would render the district court award clearly erroneous.moreover,this circuit has held that while louisiana law forbids an award of damages based on speculation,compensation for lost profits need not be determined with mathematical precision.reasonable certainty suffices to permit a court to determine the extent of damages.breaux schlumberger offshore,cir citations omitted.testimony and documentary evidence showed that similar parcels were leased multiple times during the disputed period.given this evidence,ascent is simply incorrect that the damages are supported by speculation alone.
ascent argument that lost leasing damages should have been handled in the same way as lost seismic fee damages is also unavailing.there is nothing incongruous about the two awards.the court did not award the full seismic fee amount presumably because it was not persuaded that rathborne would have collected more than one seismic fee between and.conversely,the district court was persuaded that rathborne would have been able to lease the parcel more than once during the time ascent held it in violation of its obligation to reasonably develop.
in sum,given the evidence in the record,the district court award of a full year lost leasing revenue in addition to the revenue that rathborne collected following the seismic survey was not clearly erroneous.
having concluded that the district court was correct to award damages for lost leasing revenues,we now turn to ascent primary complaint on appeal.ascent argues that the district court grossly miscalculated the damages because it held ascent liable for lost revenues on a area of land even though ascent had a mineral lease interest in only of those acres.by ascent calculations,if the seismic fee and lost leasing revenue damages were properly limited to its parcel,ascent would owe rathborne,far less than the awarded by the district court.
whether the district court applied an erroneous theory of recovery in awarding damages based on the larger parcel is a question of law subject to de novo review.tyler,at.
the district court held ascent liable for lost leasing revenues and seismic fees on rathborne entire parcel because it found that ascent refusal to include its leased parcel in seismic surveys of the area made it impossible to conduct useful surveys of the rest of the acres.the court further found that,had ascent agreed to the seismic surveys,it was more probable than not that rathborne not only would have received seismic fees for the entire parcel,but also would have been able to lease out the entire parcel.
in louisiana,a mineral lessee is bound to perform the contract in good faith and to develop and operate the property leased as a reasonably prudent operator.ann.a prudent operator implies four obligations on the part of the lessee,two of which are at issue here the obligation to develop known mineral producing formations in the manner of a reasonable,prudent operator and the obligation to explore and test all portions of the leased premises after discovery of minerals in paying quantities in the manner of a reasonable,prudent operator.ann,cmt.ascent correctly notes that these obligations apply only to the property leased.ascent also cites case law holding that liability arising under mineral lease obligations ends when the underlying lease is released.see shanks exxon.cir.so d,writ denied,so d willis int l oil gas,so d,cameron meadows land bullard,so d.
although ascent arguments regarding the extent of its obligations are correct,they are somewhat beside the point.the district court did not hold that ascent had any obligations to develop or explore the entire acres.rather,the court held ascent liable for damages pertaining to that larger parcel because the larger injury flowed out of ascent violation of its lease obligations for the smaller parcel.as rathborne states in its brief,ascent confuses its lease obligation with its liability for the damages caused by a breach of those obligations.although the district court did not use the term,it essentially awarded consequential damages for ascent breach of its lease obligationsdamages outside the scope of the lease contract,but which the court found ascent should have nevertheless foreseen.the district court damage award is improper not because it rested on a holding that ascent had some obligation to develop land not covered by its lease,but because this consequential damages theory is novel and inconsistent with louisiana law.
neither party provided,nor did our research uncover,any case in which a louisiana court has awarded damages for breach of the obligation to reasonably develop.the comment to.ann.explains that this is because 
f rom a practical standpoint it seems that little in the way of damages can be shown in most cases unless the premises are being drained by wells on adjoining land.in that case,the dispute will be dealt with as a failure to exercise reasonable diligence to protect the property against drainage,another of the four obligations of a reasonable operator,not at issue
