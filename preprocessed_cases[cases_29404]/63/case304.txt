this appeal requires that we undertake the task of interpreting a provision of the internal revenue code.in essence,this statute allows a taxpayer,who is required to pay to a third party income on which it has already paid income tax,credit for the tax it paid on that income.subsection b,however,provides that this credit is not available with respect to an item which is included in gross income by reason of the sale of inventory.b.
texaco sought a tax refund of under a because it was required to pay out pursuant to a settlement agreement with the department of energy sums that it had previously included in its gross income.the government denied the refund claims on the ground that the inventory exception in b barred texaco from using a.texaco brought suit challenging the denial.the district court agreed with texaco and ordered the government to pay the refund.the government appeals and we reverse.we hold that the language in b plainly precludes texaco from using the computation of tax set forth in a.
background 
texaco was engaged in an integrated petroleum business.between and,texaco made certain sales of crude petroleum and refined petroleum products at prices that exceeded the price ceilings set by federal petroleum price regulations.texaco included these overcharges as gross income on its corporate tax returns for the years through.
the department of energy doe took various administrative actions against texaco which eventually resulted in a consent degree requiring texaco to pay plus interest.texaco made the payments and deducted the settlement amount on its federal income tax returns for those years as ordinary and necessary business expenses.
in february,texaco filed refund claims for the years,and,claiming that the tax benefit of the ordinary and necessary business expense deductions should have been calculated in accordance with a.the government denied the refund claims on the ground that b rendered a inapplicable.
in january,texaco filed a complaint against the united states in the district court for the northern district of california.on for summary judgment,the district court determined that subsection b did not preclude texaco from seeking tax treatment under a,reasoning that the statute was ambiguous and sources outside the text of the statute supported texaco argument that b only prohibited the use of a computation for sales returns,allowances and similar items.
following the entry of a final judgment,the government filed a timely appeal.
ii.the statutory scheme 
the supreme court observed in,that a ll the revenue acts which have been enacted since the adoption of the sixteenth amendment have uniformly assessed the tax on the basis of annual returns showing the net result of all the taxpayer transactions during a fixed accounting period,either the calendar year,or,at the option of the taxpayer,the particular fiscal year which he may adopt.burnet sanford brooks.under the claim of right doctrine,which follows from the annual accounting principle,a taxpayer who has received an item of income over which he has full control must include that item in his income in the year of receipt,even if his right to retain that item is imperfect and he is later required to return part or all of that item.see generally mertens,law of federal income taxation supp.july.
absent some statutory exception,such as a,a taxpayer who was required in a later year to restore to a third party income previously received is entitled to a deduction if the repayment is deductible under some provision of the internal revenue code.see united states lewis.in other words,a taxpayer may be able to reduce his taxes for the year of repayment by deducting the repayment amount from his taxable income,but he has no recourse against the increased taxes that he had paid in the year that he received the money.the taxpayer might benefit if the tax savings from the deduction in the year of repayment is greater than the increase in tax due to the inclusion of the amount in the year that the amount was received.however,if the deduction in the year of repayment results in a savings of less than the amount of increased tax paid as a result of the inclusion of the amount repaid in income for the year in which the amount was received,the taxpayer,absent some statutory provision,can not recover the taxes he paid in the initial year on income that he subsequently restored to a third party 
section a provides some taxpayers with an option if the taxpayer satisfies the criteria set forth in subsections a,as texaco does,a taxpayer has a choice.it can still take a deduction for the repayment in the year of repayment.a a.however,it can alternatively calculate what its tax would have been in the initial year without the income that was restored to a third party.if the difference between the tax it actually paid and the tax it would have paid if the restored amount had not been included in its gross income is greater than the deduction it would receive by claiming the deduction in the repayment year,it may use the difference instead of the deduction.a b,see alcoa,united states,cir by allowing the taxpayer the choice between a simple deduction and a recalculation of the prior year tax liability,section ensures that any change in tax rates or in the taxpayer tax bracket is a tax neutral event with respect to the disputed item of income.here,the parties agree that if a is applicable,then for the four years in issue,texaco,using the alternative provided by a b,is entitled to a refund of.
the government,however,contends that texaco is barred from using a by b the government position is that a is not applicable to texaco because the first sentence of b provides that subsection a does not apply to any deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer.texaco concedes that d uring the years through,all of texaco sales of crude oil and petroleum products were sales of inventory or property held by texaco primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of texaco trade or business.because the income in issue arose out of the sale of inventory,the government asserts that texaco is barred from using a to compute its taxes.texaco disagrees,contending that b does not bar it from using a.thus,this litigation turns on the meaning and scope of b 
iii.interpreting section b 
the supreme court has directed that the first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.the inquiry ceases if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.barnhart sigmon coal,d internal citation omitted.the supreme court has further noted that i f a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the language of b is clear.the statute provides that a deduction otherwise allowable under subsection a is prohibited if the deduction was based on an item included in gross income by reason of the sale of inventory.thus,the statute directs us to the basis of the deduction allowable under subsection a.the deduction arises if a taxpayer included in its tax return income that it subsequently had to pay to a third party.subsection b asks what was the basis for the item included in gross income that year.if the item was included in gross income because of the sale of stock in trade inventory,then the taxpayer is prohibited by subsection b from using the deduction otherwise allowed by subsection a.
the federal circuit agrees that this is the plain meaning of subsection b.in analyzing the statute,the federal circuit parsed into three phrases a any deduction allowable b with respect to an item which was included in gross income c because of the sale or other disposition of property such as inventory.state united states.it then wrote 
the wording of the inventory exception is clear as a grammatical matter.a modifying phrase attaches to its closest referent so phrase c because of the sale of inventory would ordinarily modify phrase b which was included in gross income.accordingly,if the item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year because of the sale of inventory,then the inventory exception precludes section relief.a.
id.at alteration in original.
texaco,however,urges that there is a syntactical ambiguity in subsection b,and that the phrase by reason of the sale or other disposition of inventory modifies the phrase deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income in such a way that the question that must be answered is whether the deduction in the current year is allowable by reason of the sale or other disposition of inventory.it then defines by reason of the sale or other disposition of inventory to be limited to sales returns,allowances,and similar items.
even if such a construction were grammatically possible,it would not be reasonable.first,subsection a clearly states that its general rule applies when an item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year or years because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item.a emphasis added.accordingly,there is no reason to interpret included in gross income in subsection b as referring to anything other than the prior taxable year or years.moreover,the proposed interpretation would eviscerate subsection b because a subsection a deduction is always based on calculations arising from a prior tax year and not on whether an item was included in gross income in the current year.
second,there is nothing in the statute that limits the definition of sale or other disposition of stock in trade to sales returns,allowances,and similar items.texaco urges that such a limitation arises from treasury regulation f we,however,agree with the federal circuit that this regulation does not limit subsection b.the federal circuit explained 
the treasury regulation,which recites the inventory exception and infers therefore that provides no relief for transactions in inventory,is not to the contrary.the word therefore means as a consequence or it must follow.bryan garner,the elements of legal style.the treasury regulation can be made to say no more than that sales returns and allowances and similar items are examples of situations where the inventory exception applies they do not delimit the exception.mertens,a leading tax treatise,explains that the inventory exception is not limited to sales returns,but rather the regulations use this merely to provide an example of the inventory exception.for example,amounts for which the taxpayer is liable due to a patent infringement fall within this exception if the infringement is related to the inventory goods.mertens law of federal income taxation.
third,texaco proposed interpretation of subsection b would reduce the final sentence of the section to surplusage.the supreme court counsels against adopting such a statutory interpretation,stating 
it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.duncan walker,d,internal quotation marks omitted see united states menasche,it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.quoting montclair tp.ramsdell.w ere we to adopt andrews construction of the statute,the express exception would be rendered insignificant,if not wholly superfluous.duncan,at,we are reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage in any setting,ibid.internal alteration and quotation marks omitted,and we decline to do so here.
trw andrews,d.
the final sentence of subsection b provides that the bar to using a subsection a computation in the first sentence does not apply if the deduction arises out of refunds or repayments made by a regulated public utility,if required by a government agency,a court,or made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation.although it may not be impossible for a public utility refund or repayment to be based on sales returns,allowances,and similar items,it defies logic to believe that congress in enacting the final sentence of subsection b was concerned with only such a refund or repayment.again,we agree with the federal circuit when it reasons 
a sales return is defined as merchandise given back to the seller because of defects,while a sales allowance is defined as a reduction in the selling price of goods because of a particular problem,breakage,quality deficiency,incorrect quantity.dictionary of accounting terms,ed.a public utility government or rate refund is neither of those things.quaker narrow interpretation of the inventory exception would therefore render the public utility exception to the inventory exception impermissible reading.
for the forgoing reasons we conclude that subsection b clearly provides that the deduction allowed by subsection a is not available with respect to an item which was included in the gross income in a prior taxable year by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade or inventory.
in light of our conclusion that subsection b is plain and unambiguous,several of texaco other arguments need not detain us.texaco argues that congress intent in enacting may be extracted from the legislative histories of and former internal revenue code.internal revenue code of,a,stat.repealed by act of june,ch,stat.despite the facts that the statutes covered different taxpayers,that makes no mention of,and that was retroactively repealed in,texaco argues that the committee reports confirm congress unmistakable intention that the exception in section b apply only to those deductions that qualified for section treatment.whatever the merits of texaco argument,it is insufficient to overcome the plain meaning of the statute language.see bedroc,llc united states,d stating that the preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there and that our inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
similarly,we are not free to act on texaco assertion that subsection b creates an inequity.once congress has spoken,the court can not revise a statute to promote a more equitable consequence.see badaracco comm r of internal revenue,d the relevant question is not whether,as an abstract matter,the rule advocated by petitioners accords with good policy.the question we must consider is whether the policy petitioners favor is that which congress effectuated by its enactment of the statute.courts are not authorized to rewrite a statute because they might deem its effects susceptible of improvement.in re kelly,cir stating that policy arguments are,of course,beside the point once congress has spoken.
iv.deference to the agency position 
even if there were some ambiguity in b,we would be hard pressed not to defer to the agency interpretation of the statute.in morales sociedad espanola de auxilio mutuo y beneficencia,cir,the first circuit recently reiterated the controlling standard as follows 
if,however,the language admits of a possible ambiguity and congress has not spoken directly to the issue,the court must look for guidance to any relevant regulations promulgated by an agency charged with administering the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d muñiz sabol,cir.
in those circumstances,a court is bound to apply the agency interpretation of the statute,as embodied in a regulation,as long as it constitutes a permissible construction of the statutory text.chevron,at.determining a regulation meaning requires application of the same principles that imbue exercises in statutory construction.see,cumberland coal,lp fed.mine safety health comm n,cir sidell comm r,cir.
when the regulatory language remains ambiguous even after the application of those principles,an inquiring court must look beyond the letter of the regulation and defer to an
