rate ceiling issues 
waiver of the rate ceilings for capacity releases by shippers 
the heart of order was the commission decision to a rate ceilings that it previously imposed on releases of pipeline capacity by shippers with rights to that capacity.order at.at the same time the order retained the ceilings for similar sales by the pipelines themselves.id.both aspects are attacked the experimental certain shippers collectively,exxon,the exclusion of certain pipelines.
the natural gas act nga,et,mandates that all the rates and charges of a natural gas company for the transportation or sale of natural gas shall be just and reasonable.a.it is undisputed for the purposes of this appeal that a shipper reselling its capacity is a natural gas company to that extent and thus subject to ferc jurisdiction over such resales,texas eastern transmission,ferc at,wl see also order,order on rehearing,pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation under part of the commission regulations,ferc stats.regs.regs.preambles cch at order united distrib.ferc,udc.in its prior rulemaking aimed at enhancing competition by unbundling various pipeline services,the commission recognized that a significant percentage of pipeline capacity reserved for firm service often went unused.order,pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation under part of the commission regulations,ferc stats.regs.regs.preambles cch at order udc,at.it granted authority for the holders to release such capacity,but,concerned that capacity holders might be able to exercise market power,imposed a ceiling on what the releasing party could charge.order at order at.the ceiling was derived from the commission estimate of the maximum rates necessary for each pipeline to recover its annual revenue requirement,order at,which the commission simply prorated over the period of each release,id.at.
as the commission observed activity in the market under this arrangement,however,it came to believe that the ceilings probably worked against the shippers they were designed to protect.with the rate ceilings in place,a shipper looking for capacity on a peak day,and willing to offer a higher price in order to obtain it,could not legally do so this reduced its options for procuring transportation at the times that it needed it most.order at.so the commission decided to grant a experimental waiver of the ceilings on releases of firm capacity.for this limited period,capacity releases defined for these purposes as less than one year may proceed at market rates.order at.capacity sales by the pipelines themselves,both short and,continue subject to the rate ceilings.order at.we here address the claims of the shippers who object to the experiment itself and the pipelines who object to their exclusion from its opportunities.
framing our consideration of the challenges are the special deference due agency experiments,the basic premise of the congressional mandate to ferc to regulate the rates of the interstate gas pipelines,and a set of criteria,discussed exhaustively in farmers union cent.exch.ferc,farmers union,for review of decisions,undertaken by an agency having such a mandate,to choose a regime more lighthanded than traditional regulation.
here of course the waiver is explicitly experimental.as the commission said,no matter how good the data suggesting that a regulatory change should be made,there is no substitute for reviewing the actual results of a regulatory action.order at.for at least years this court has given special deference to agency development of such experiments,precisely because of the advantages of data developed in the real world.see,public serv.comm fpc,paul mohler,experiments at the search of a hypothesis,energy.the petitioners do not contest this extra layer of deference.
second,the basic premise of the nga is the understanding that natural gas pipeline transportation is generally a natural monopoly,see,udc,at,so that without regulation the rates of pipeline companies would exceed competitive rates,ones approximating cost,elizabethtown gas ferc.in dispensing with rate ceilings presumptively intended by congress as a remedy,and supplanting those ceilings temporarily with rates in a segment of the pipeline market,the commission may be seen as facing a kind of uphill fight.though the slope faced by ferc is perhaps uphill,however,it is not the almost vertical escarpment that exxon seems to suppose.this is not point du hoc.
third,our decision in farmers union,though addressing oil pipeline regulation under the hepburn act,sets out general guidance for our review of ferc decision to elect more relaxed lighthanded,as we said regulation than traditional ceilings,in the context of a mandate to set just and reasonable rates in an industry generally thought to have the features of a natural monopoly.at.the overarching criterion that we identified was inevitably that any such decision could be justified by a showing that the goals and purposes of the statute will be accomplished through the proposed changes.id.to satisfy that standard,we demanded that the resulting rates be expected to fall within a zone of reasonableness,where they are neither less than compensatory nor excessive.id.at internal quotations omitted.while the expected rates proximity to cost was a starting point for this inquiry into reasonableness,we were quite explicit that factors may legitimate a departure from a rigid approach,id.finally,we said that ferc must retain some general oversight over the system,to see if competition in fact drives rates into the zone of reasonableness or to check rates if it does not.id.at.we now apply this basic model.
expected range of market rates.as competition normally provides a reasonable assurance that rates will approximate cost,at least over the long pull,elizabethtown gas,at,exxon argues that the commission experiment can not be sustained in the absence of data establishing the existence of competition.presumably,for example,a calculation of indices for the capacity release market in all origin and destination pairs would do the job.the commission has not undertaken such an enterprise.see,order at.
but the commission has other evidence.first,since capacity resales were authorized in,the rates for such releases have on average been somewhat below the maximum tariff rates,both during and peak periods.order at.second,the commission has data from the bundled market,inferences as to transportation values drawn from comparison of the prices for gas sold at the field with the prices for gas sold in destination markets.as the commission points out,if the difference between field prices and citygate prices in a particular pathway is only,people will not pay more than for the unbundled transportation.order at.only during the coldest times of some years has this inferred price exceeded the capped rate.order at.order figure,found at,which we reproduce below,illustrates the pattern the commission found.
thus the commission had a substantial basis for concluding that the uncapped market price for ferc concedes is likely to exceed the current maximum at certain times of the be roughly in line at least annually with the price.order at.
of course,one could argue that this demonstrates only that in the periods where the ceilings are not binding,there is no problem for them to solve thus it supplies no justification for removal of the ceilings for the peak periods where they are binding.but the data represented in the graph above do support the commission view that the capacity release market enjoys considerable competition.the brief spikes in moments of extreme exigency are completely consistent with competition,reflecting scarcity rather than monopoly.see order at.a surge in the price of candles during a power outage is no evidence of monopoly in the candle market.
moreover,outside the spikes the rates were well below the regulated price,which in turn is based on the commission estimates of cost.as prices would be above cost in the absence of competition and yet are not putting aside the brief spikes,the commission inference of competition appears well founded.
the commission also considered two ways in which capacity resellers might exploit or extend such market power as they may discrimination and deliberate withholding of capacity to drive up found that neither presented much peril.order at.ferc dismissed price discrimination on the grounds that,given the ease with which capacity can be transferred between shippers,resellers would have no way to prevent arbitrage.see order at.
as to deliberate withholding of capacity,the commission reasoned that this too was not within the power of capacity holders.if holders of firm capacity do not use or sell all of their entitlement,the pipelines are required to sell the idle capacity as interruptible service to any taker at no more than the maximum is still applicable to the pipelines.see order at.even though interruptible service may not be as desirable as firm service,the commission concluded that it would provide an adequate substitute,whose availability would place a meaningful check on whatever tendencies the resellers might have.see order at.and because the pipelines continue to be bound by regulations,the agency suggested that they would have no incentive to collude with firm shippers to limit available capacity.id.
moreover,the availability of the bundled sales mentioned above where a holder of capacity buys gas in the field and sells it in a destination market,with no explicit sale of the necessary capacity itself further reduces the possibility that the waiver policy would significantly change the firm shippers ability to increase their rates for capacity releases.order at.and,if pipelines should observe high prices in the secondary market,they their capped have adequate incentives to add capacity,which they can do even in the relatively by adding compression.id.at.
thus we think the commission made a substantial record for the proposition that market rates would not materially considering degree,volume and duration exceed the zone of reasonableness required by farmers union.any flaws in its showing must be evaluated,of course,in light both of the experimental nature of the removal of ceilings and of the factors discussed below.
factors.the commission pointed to a number of advantages of lifting the ceilings on capacity releases,tending to offset whatever harm the occasional high rate might entail.we discuss them,concentrating on the highlights.
first,because the rule applies only to the secondary transportation market,the primary intended beneficiaries of the captive shippers,typically operating under firm to receive whatever benefits the rate ceilings generally provide.see order at alluding to the continued protection of the commission primary firm capacity holders.indeed,these holders actually reap the benefits of ferc new rule,in the form of higher payments for their releases of surplus capacity.see id.at see also order at.
second,the rate ceilings on capacity releases were fundamentally ineffective.we already described the market for bundled gas and transportation,by means of which a holder of surplus capacity can take advantage of the real market value of transportation by going into the gas market itself,buying in an origin market and selling at the destination.although all hands recognize that during peaks the market value of the transportation can far exceed the maximum tariff rate,see order at,neither the commission,nor any of the parties,has proposed extending price regulations to cover the bundled sales market,id.at.
third,removal of ceilings facilitates the movement of capacity into the hands of those who value it most highly.see order at.with the rate ceilings in place,the options of a shipper looking for capacity on a peak day are only to enter a bundled transaction with a holder of firm capacity at a price that includes the market value of transportation,or to take the gas out of the pipeline and pay the pipeline scheduling or overrun penalties,which,the commission observed,may compromise the operational integrity of the pipeline system.order at see also id.at.thus the rate relaxation reduces transactions costs and increases transparency,helping economic actors make rational decisions for other aspects of their operations,decisions on how much firm capacity they really need,and,for example,for a industrial user,whether to use or sell some of its capacity.id.at.
it might be argued that these efficiency values are ubiquitous and might justify any deregulation of any rates mandated by congress to be held at just and reasonable levels.not so.rate regulation of a natural monopoly if accurately big if is consistent with efficiency.the special phenomenon here is congestion in the peaks it is only the inefficiency produced by rates based solely on the cost of in complete disregard of the opportunity cost of the the commission has set out to remedy.compare order at expressing view that peak prices simply reflect scarcity rents.
the presence of these factors here distinguishes the present case from prior decisions cited by exxon,see farmers union elizabethtown gas,tejas power ferc,where we set aside ferc departures from rate ceilings.
oversight.as to monitoring and assurance of remedies in the event of insufficient competition,on which farmers union set great store,see at,the commission identifies three safeguards.
first,release prices and availability must be publicly reported in compliance with ferc current posting and bidding requirements.this will increase the information available to buyers and,the commission believed,reduce any ill effects of market power,while at the same time making it easier for ferc to identify situations in which shippers were abusing their market power.order at order at.ferc also noted that it retained jurisdiction under of the nga,to entertain complaints and to respond to specific allegations of market power on a basis if necessary.see order at stating that specific abuses of market power can be addressed on an individual basis see also ferc br.at citing transmission access policy study group ferc,taps,aff sub,new york ferc,d,i f a party has evidence that the tariff results in undue discrimination in its individual circumstances,that party remains free to file a petition under fpa the equivalent of nga for redress,and ferc will consider its claim.finally,the commission pointed out that this mitigation mechanism,however reactive and limited to remedies,is complemented by its continued regulation of pipeline penalty levels,which establish de facto rate ceilings for release transactions,as purchasers of capacity would not pay a price greater than the penalty for overuse of their regular pipeline capacity.see order at.
given the substantial showing that in this context competition has every reasonable prospect of preventing seriously monopolistic pricing,together with the advantages cited by the commission and the experimental nature of this particular lighthanded regulation,we find the commission decision neither a violation of the nga,nor arbitrary or capricious.
retention of the rate ceilings for pipeline releases 
having been attacked for going too far with its waivers,ferc is also challenged for not going far enough.a group of four pipelines argues that the commission decision to retain the price ceilings on pipelines,while removing them from resellers of capacity,is discriminatory and arbitrary and capricious.we do not find the commission gradualism fatally flawed.
we start,of course,from the premise that the commission is free to undertake reform one step at a time.maryland people counsel ferc.we can overturn its gradualism only if it truly yields unreasonable discrimination or some other kind of arbitrariness.
in fact the commission distinction is not unreasonable.despite the absence of indices for capacity holders,there seems every reason to suppose that their ownership of such capacity in any given market is not so concentrated as that of the pipelines concentration that prompted congress to impose rate regulation in the first place.see fpc texaco,d.the petitioning pipelines assert that pipelines hold only about of pipeline transportation capacity,while shippers hold the remaining.this is classic apples and oranges.the commission points out that whereas the uncontracted capacity of a pipeline is presumptively available for the market,no such presumption makes sense for the capacity holders they presumably contracted for the capacity in anticipation of actually using it.
second,the commission made clear that pipelines do have options for a switch to market rates.a pipeline may sell at such rates either by demonstrating that there is enough competition in the market to preclude market power,or by securing ferc permission for sale of capacity by auction.the commission recognized that such auctions were to a degree hampered by its own regulations,and expressed a readiness to waive some of the burdens.see order at order at.
the pipelines make the interesting point that continued subjection of their rates to ferc ceilings will skew the prices in the decontrolled market.the commission brief writers profess to be baffl ed by this argument,but its opinion writers understood the principle perfectly well,in fact invoking it in another context.see order at.the basic proposition asserted by the pipelines and,as we say,recognized by the commission is that where a portion of the supply of a good or service is subject to price controls,and demand exceeds the supply at the fixed price,the price in the uncontrolled segment will be normally higher than if no price controls were imposed on any of the supply.
this is so there is a system of rationing the supply that in some way exactly matches the buyers willingness to pay an improbable scenario buyers whose demand would have been completely foreclosed if the entire market had been uncontrolled will in fact use up some of the supply and thus obviously some of the aggregate supply.in the segment demanders will to a degree be supplanted by demanders.the presence of the extra unsatisfied demand alters the ratio in the uncontrolled market,which will therefore clear at a higher price than if the entirety were uncontrolled.for example,consider a good that sells for in an open market.the market is then split and a ceiling of is set in the controlled sector.as some users of the controlled supply would only have been willing to pay,say,and thus would have consumed none before,their usage will displace demanders willing to pay or more the displaced demanders will drive up the uncontrolled price.compare national regulatory research institute,state regulatory options for dealing with natural gas wellhead price deregulation.
this is surely a potential price of gradualism.but distortions of this sort seem likely in any such compromise,and one step at a within the commission purview so long as it rests on reasonable distinctions.here,the distinction between pipelines and other holders of unused capacity,based on probable likelihood of wielding market power,seems to us to pass muster.
ii.segmentation 
as part of order,ferc established two related and flexible point it thought were important to enhancing the value of firm capacity and to promoting competition in the secondary market between firm shippers releasing capacity and pipelines,as well as between releasing shippers themselves.order at,see also order at.segmentation refers to the ability of firm capacity holders to subdivide their capacity into separate parts,either for their own use or for release to replacement shippers.order at see also order at.flexible point rights,on the other hand,enable firm capacity holders to change the primary receipt or delivery points with respect to which shippers are guaranteed to have firm service for their that they can receive and deliver gas to or from any point within their firm capacity rights.order at.
not having included its segmentation policy in any regulations issued as a result of order,see order at,the commission later found that in the process of approving individual pipeline restructurings it had not implemented the policy uniformly.see order at.compare,texas eastern transmission,ferc at,wl segmentation allowed,with koch gateway pipeline,ferc at,wl no segmentation see also order at order at.
concerned with this lack of consistency,it responded in order by codifying a requirement that pipelines permit a shipper to make use of the firm capacity for which it has contracted by segmenting that capacity into separate parts for its own use or for the purpose of releasing that capacity to replacement shippers to the extent such segmentation is operationally feasible.order at e.it directed each pipeline to make a pro forma tariff filing showing how it intended to comply with the new regulation,or explaining why its system configuration justified curtailing segmentation rights to ensure operational integrity.order at.moreover,at least in the context of segmented transactions,limitations on flexibility in changing primary points would now also have to be based solely on the operational characteristics of pipeline systems.order at.
interstate natural gas association of america and several pipelines collectively,ingaa now challenge the new segmentation rule both on its face and,in the alternative,as it applies to a number of factual scenarios.we deal first with the general attack,then with specifics.
general validity 
section of the natural gas act requires that when the commission seeks to replace an existing rate or practice with a new one,it must demonstrate by substantial evidence that the existing rate or practice has become unjust or unreasonable,and that the proposed one is both just and reasonable.western,ferc.ingaa raises both a procedural and a substantive attack on the adequacy of ferc findings in the present orders.
ingaa claims that the commission must make a detailed showing that every pipeline existing tariff was unjust and unreasonable,or that the new policy is just and reasonable for any pipeline.ingaa segmentation br.at.but imposes no such requirement.our cases have long held that the commission may rely on generic or general findings of a systemic problem to support imposition of an solution.see taps,at wisconsin gas ferc.here,the commission has made a generic determination that a pipeline refusal to permit segmentation where it could operationally do so would be unjust and unreasonable.order at.and the commission explained that it was not making a determination that any particular pipeline tariff was unjust or unreasonable,but that it would defer such an inquiry to individual compliance proceedings,where the applicable standard would be operational feasibility.id.at.
as ingaa correctly points out,the commission can not enact an solution for a problem that exists only in isolated pockets.in such a case,the disproportion of remedy to ailment would,at least at some point,become arbitrary and capricious.ingaa segmentation br.at quoting associated gas distributors ferc,agd.according to ingaa,the commission vague observation that some pipelines do not permit segmentation where it is operationally feasible,order at,does not sufficiently illustrate the existence of an practice that the commission purports to seek to eliminate with its broad rule.ingaa segmentation br.at.
ingaa somewhat misinterprets the law when it insists that a problem must necessarily be widespread to permit a generic solution.the very quotation from agd on which ingaa relies shows that proportionality between the identified problem and the remedy is the key.see also agd,at holding that the commission could not rely on generic analysis where it expressly found that only a limited segment of the industry was affected by the problem it sought to address,while the remedy adopted would necessarily impact other segments.
here the commission could reasonably consider the remedy proportional to the identified problem it requires segmentation only where it is operationally feasible,since in that situation,the commission found,the failure to permit segmentation is unjust and unreasonable because it restricts efficient use of capacity without adequate justification.see order at order at.
insofar as ingaa makes a general attack on the substance of the generic finding,it is unconvincing.it says that a pipeline may resist even operationally feasible segmentation for a host of contractual,and financial reasons.ingaa segmentation br.at.this is surely true.but pipeline contracts are subject to modification by the commission on findings that their terms are unjust or unreasonable,and we have long taken the view that the commission may use this power to apply whatever policies are consistent with the agency enabling act.agd,at.as a general matter,ingaa simply fails to make the case that the flexibility on which the commission insists subject to operational feasibility concerns is not necessary for reasonable pursuit of the commission policy of enhancing competition by increasing the flexibility of capacity releases.
ingaa makes a related claim that by forcing pipelines to submit pro forma filings,the commission has impermissibly shifted onto them the burden of proof that segmentation is indeed infeasible for a particular pipeline,evading its duty to carry the burden of supporting any change implemented via.according to ingaa,the commission has in essence required pipelines to make filings to defend their current rates proceedings presuppose that it is the company that seeks a rate change and they therefore allocate to the company the burden of justifying new tariffs.see public serv.comm ferc.
indeed,certain language in the orders and even in the commission brief supports ingaa claim.for example,the commission at one point says that it will require the pipelines to show why their existing tariffs should not be considered unjust and unreasonable,order at,and that individual pipelines will have an opportunity to demonstrate that their own circumstances justify deviation from the general conclusion that segmentation is appropriate,ferc br.at.ingaa suspicion is also fueled by the fact that on several previous occasions the commission had impermissibly blurred the distinction between and,see western,at we now make it an even six times that the commission failed to respect this distinction,or tried to use another section of the nga to trump its obligations,see pub.serv.comm n,at holding that of the nga,which grants the commission the right to require filings needed to exercise its powers under the nga,did not permit ferc to require a company to make periodic.
nonetheless,the orders contain some express language supporting the position of the commission counsel at oral argument that ferc will indeed shoulder the burden under of the nga to show the requisite operational feasibility.see order at suggesting that pro forma compliance filings are not filings,and that ferc will be acting under section to implement changes order at.given that the character of is well established,we feel reasonably confident that the commission will hew to its constraints if not,obviously a judicial remedy would follow any individualized abuse.
as to the commission determination to extract information from pipelines relevant to the practical issues,we see no violation of the nga.the commission has authority under to order hearings to determine whether a given pipeline is in compliance with ferc rules,a,and under and to require pipelines to submit needed information for making its decisions,c.see also order at.
specific defects 
ingaa contends that,although ferc expressly limited its new segmentation rule to capacity for which the shipper has contracted,d,the orders actually increase shippers transportation rights beyond their contractual scope,thus amounting to an unlawful abrogation of contract,and that the orders are otherwise arbitrary and capricious.
primary point rights in segmented releases.in the commission view,segmentation must be coupled with flexible point rights in order to create effective competition between pipeline services and released capacity.order at.take the commission own example of a shipper holding firm capacity between the gulf of mexico and new york.that shipper could release the portion or segment of its firm capacity between the gulf and atlanta to a replacement shipper,permitting the replacement shipper to use the segment to deliver gas to atlanta meanwhile the releasing shipper would retain its firm capacity between atlanta and new york,allowing it to ship gas from atlanta to new york.order at.in this situation,both the releasing and the replacement shippers need to have the ability to change their primary receipt and delivery points from the ones designated in their contracts so as to be able to effectively make use of the segmented capacity for instance,the replacement shipper needs to designate atlanta as its primary delivery point,now that it has acquired rights to capacity in the mainline segment terminating there.if the replacement shipper were limited to rights at atlanta,then the releasing shipper could not compete effectively with the pipeline as a seller of capacity,because the pipeline would have the right to sell capacity to the atlanta point on a primary basis.see order at.
ingaa objects to the commission requirement that pipelines automatically grant shippers primary treatment at multiple points,subject only to operational constraints,saying that such a rule effectively abrogates contractual limit primary rights to specific endowing shippers with rights they have never bargained or paid for.assuming the shippers rights are so limited,ingaa claims that the commission has not met the standard under for abrogation of the pipeline rights.see permian basin area rate cases,d abrogation permitted only in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.
it is not clear,however,that there are any contract rights to be abrogated.ferc policy tying flexible primary points with segmentation rights dates back to order,which started the restructuring process thus,it presumably governs the currently applicable contracts.in the order restructuring proceedings,the commission generally permitted more than one approach by pipelines to granting shippers flexible point rights,but observed repeatedly that in the segmentation context,flexibility in point rights was required in order for segmentation to be a meaningful option or a meaningful mechanism.see,transwestern pipeline,ferc at,wl northwest pipeline,ferc at,wl.in some instances,the commission did permit pipelines to limit shippers flexibility in choosing primary points,based on tariff provisions.for example,in transwestern pipeline,the commission approved a pipeline tariff that continued a provision limiting a shipper primary point rights to the same level as its total mainline contract demand,based on a concern over hoarding of primary point rights.ferc at order on rehearing,ferc at,wl.but even then the commission noted transwestern remark that it had a lot more primary point capacity than mainline capacity,and so acknowledged that perhaps the restriction would prove unneeded,ferc at ferc at.thus,its practice appears to have been in effect an application of the operational feasibility principle,and this typically led to tariff rules broadly protecting releasing and replacement shippers interest in points along their respective segments.see,northwest pipeline,ferc at.in the restructuring in texas eastern transmission,ferc,wl,for example,ferc stated its policy to be 
the releasing and replacement shippers must be treated as separate shippers with separate contract demands.thus,the releasing shipper may reserve primary points on the unreleased segment up to its capacity entitlement on that segment,while the replacement shipper simultaneously reserves primary points on the released segment up to its capacity on that segment.
id.at quoted verbatim in order at.see also el paso natural gas,ferc,wl.thus the new segmentation rule represents a continuation of past policy rather than a break with it,and no further special showing was required for the continuation of that policy.
forwardhauls and backhauls to the same delivery point.ingaa also challenges what the commission viewed as a clarification of prior policy for the situation where releasing and replacement shippers,in a combination of forwardhaul and backhaul,make deliveries to a single point in an amount greater than the shipper capacity at the delivery point.
first,we need to develop a clear picture of a backhaul transaction.suppose a pipeline runs from a to b to c,and has dekatherms of daily capacity,all of which is contracted for from a to c and of which x holds.x market at c declines,and x would like to ship only to b and to release the in capacity.x learns of another possible shipper,y,who has a right to dekatherms at c and would like to sell it at can x release its capacity to y,even though the nominal flow of y intended shipment is against the a to c stream 
so far as mainline capacity is concerned,we understand the parties to agree that this is permissible.given that the gas actually will not and can not be moved upstream,the deal appears to force the pipeline to carry an extra from a to b the basic,plus the to be delivered at b on behalf of y.but because of gas fungibility the appearance is false.the pipeline will now deliver at c,and it will rely on y supply for of that.as a result,it still need carry only from a to b,where it will dispense for x account and for on the leg it need carry only.thus the transaction does not violate ferc rule that segmentation may not result in shipments exceeding the shippers capacity rights on any segment.order at.
but the parties are in dispute over the delivery point.suppose that point b,instead of being the same physical delivery facility,were really two nearby points,and,the latter a bit downstream of the former.both sides agree that the above transaction would be all right,subject to the operational feasibility constraint,even though deliveries are now being made at those two sites that were not specifically contracted for.but ingaa balks at the original hypothetical where both new deliveries are at b,because of the alleged excess beyond x contract rights.
some decisions prior to the present orders suggest that the commission too disapproved of such a transaction.in at least one case the commission said that such a transaction produced a fatal overlap at the single point of delivery.a shipper may segment its capacity rights,but it can not exceed its contractual service levels at any point.iroquois gas trans,ferc at,wl.but a few years later the commission allowed what appears to be substantially similar,a combined forwardhaul and backwardhaul to a series of meter stations considered as a single point for nomination purposes,order at,citing transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,wl.
finding that its prior policy was based on a metaphysical distinction between a single point and two points adjacent to each other,ferc decided in the present orders that,to advance its new segmentation policy,it would no longer apply prior restrictions on using forwardhauls and backhauls to the same point.order at.
the commission characterization of the distinction as metaphysical may in the end be correct,but it is not the number of angels that can stand on the head of one pin seems physically rather than metaphysically different from the question how many can stand on two.although the commission observed that the pipelines seeking rehearing had not shown that they faced any operational problems in permitting such flexibility,order at,that issue is distinct from the problem of an inadequately supported contract modification.accordingly,we remand this issue to the commission so that it can more clearly confront the question of whether this aspect of the orders can stand without additional findings.
virtual pooling points.ingaa attacks the commission decision that segmentation be permitted at any transaction points on the pipeline system,including virtual transaction points,such as paper pooling points,as well as at physical interconnect points.order at.it argues that this provision grants rights to certain shippers that are detrimental to other shippers,and interferes with how such virtual points actually operate.
a virtual point is a paper or accounting point that does not physically exist on a pipeline.one kind of a virtual point is a paper pooling point,which is used for administrative purposes,to aggregate the receipt of gas from multiple physical points in a specific geographic area to simplify accounting.
ingaa reasons that because a paper pooling point does not physically exist,a shipper can not purchase the right to transport gas to or from that point along an identifiable capacity path a shipper that segments its capacity in relation to a paper pooling point could end up flowing gas on overlapping physical segments of the pipeline and thus in excess of its capacity.for instance,if a pipeline runs from a to b to c to d,and b and c are physical points included in a single paper pool,then a shipper releasing the capacity and retaining the capacity would be making an overlapping use of the segment.
in order the commission acknowledged such a possibility,but nevertheless thought that t o the extent such difficulties,overlapping exist,they are more appropriately examined in the compliance filings.order at.we understand this to mean that the commission is serious in its commitment that it will not apply segmentation in a way that subjects pipelines to overlapping uses of mainline capacity.oddly,the commission brief writers seem to have adopted a rather approach,declaring flatly that t his type of segmentation does not result in the overlap of capacity and petitioners have not explained otherwise.ferc br.at.
despite the brief,we take the commission at its,that in the compliance process it will not apply the orders in such a way as to violate the precept against forcing overlaps on a pipeline.
reticulated pipelines.in contrast to linear pipelines,a reticulated pipeline has a structure.such pipelines are typically located in a single geographic area and have receipt and delivery points interspersed throughout the system.gas flows are not unidirectional but instead reverse direction depending on supply and demand.they typically rely on displacement to make deliveries,that is,the substitution of gas at one point for gas received at another point.
in the orders,the commission recognized that permitting segmentation on a reticulated pipeline can result in operational difficulties because unplanned changes in flow patterns might threaten their operational integrity.order at see also northwest pipeline,ferc at,wl certain offsetting volumes must flow in one direction in order for customers shipping in the opposite direction to receive service.but it nonetheless said that these pipelines must permit segmentation to the maximum extent possible given the configuration of the system,order at,and must optimize their system s to provide maximum segmentation rights while devising appropriate mechanisms to ensure operational stability,order at,a duty that may include allowing segmentation on portions of the pipeline,order at.
ingaa first contends that it is arbitrary and capricious for ferc to apply the segmentation rule to reticulated pipelines,because these pipelines have no identifiable capacity paths to segment,and therefore segmentation is not possible on reticulated systems.ingaa segmentation br.at.but the commission only clear language requiring segmentation in this context explicitly focused on portions of the pipeline.order at.insofar as its other,vaguer language invites extreme interpretation,we understand it to be qualified as always by the operational feasibility criterion.as we can not possibly divine the vague phrases operational meaning,the claim is now unripe.see abbott labs.gardner,d stating that to evaluate ripeness,a court must consider both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration,overruled on other grounds,califano sanders,d rio grande pipeline ferc,a case is ripe when it presents a concrete legal dispute and no further factual development is essential to clarify the issues and there is no doubt whatever that the challenged agency practice has crystallized sufficiently for purposes of judicial review.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the same unripeness applies to ingaa claims regarding a special class of reticulated pipelines,those employing postage stamp rate structures.in such pipelines,as for first class mail in the postal system,the same transportation rate applies to all transactions.this contrasts with the usual rate structure for pipelines,and for some reticulated ones,under which the rate depends on the zones through which the gas passes.ingaa argues that in this context segmentation grants shippers rights and is an unexplained and,therefore,arbitrary and capricious departure from prior policy.
order provides that,o n reticulated pipelines with postage stamp rate structures,where shippers have no specifically defined paths,the pipeline should permit firm shippers to use all points on the system and to use or release segments of capacity between any two points,while continuing to use other segments of capacity.order at.the commission justifies this policy on the ground that shippers on such pipelines pay for the use of the entire pipeline in their rates.id.finally,the order notes that,if these pipelines find that providing segmentation would be more feasible with a redesign of its rates,the pipeline can make a section filing to establish rates that it considers more consonant with segmentation.id.
ingaa suggests that under this language the commission may intend to allow shippers to multiply their capacity rights.ingaa segmentation br.at.the language is indeed susceptible of such a reading taken at the extreme,it is as if the post office,having agreed to carry letters anywhere for cents,including from new york to san francisco,could be obliged to carry one letter from new york to chicago,and another from chicago to san francisco,all for one stamp.the commission allusion to new filings under only heightens the impression of overweening agency ambition.can the commission contemplate that it will use in compliance proceedings to compel costly changes in pipeline operation,leaving the pipeline to recover the resulting costs by filing under but to conjure up such activities is not to say that the commission language compels them.until the words are implemented,claims based on this language are unripe.
discounts.under typical discount agreements,pipelines agree to provide shippers with services at discounted rates,but with those rates limited to receipt and delivery points.before these orders,the commission policy was that discounts granted with respect to specific points do not apply when shippers change points.order at.this meant that when a shipper released part of its capacity,the releasing or replacement shipper was subject to the rate if it exercised its right to designate different receipt or delivery points.id.
some of the commission language here appears to contradict the prior view.for example,the commission said that within the path of a shipper contract,it should be permitted to segment capacity along that discounted capacity path without incurring additional charges,without having to pay the rate.order at.and it said that the reason a discount should apply to segmented transactions is that,once a pipeline has discounted transportation to a downstream delivery point,it has foreclosed the possibility of selling that capacity at a higher rate to an upstream delivery point.t he discount,therefore,should apply to all transactions within the capacity path.order at.
several aspects of discounting are affected here.first,the commission refers to discounts granted because of pipeline underutiliz ation,order at.when a pipeline discounts some capacity from a to c solely for that reason,presumably the discount is consistent,in the pipeline view,with the levels of demand in even the most heavily used segment.thus the observation quoted above from order.
but the commission also recognized that discounts may be given because of differing competitive conditions.it said that pipelines will still be able to discount transportation to a particular customer who has competitive options to stimulate throughput without necessarily offering the same discount to other customers who are not similarly situated.order at.the difference in conditions might be,a industrial user or,a pipeline might be subject to severe competition between points a and c,but to little between points a and b the latter being an intermediate point between a and c.
finally,of course,the whole capacity release program as a general matter creates possibilities for arbitrage.if a customer is completely free to transfer capacity to a one,offering price variations not based on cost becomes a far less tempting pipeline strategy.
but again the issue is unripe,as the orders leave us quite unclear just what will emerge from all this.besides the already quoted commitment to preserve at least some discounts,the commission said that it did not intend to change the rules regarding selective discounting.order at.we are in no position to assess the legality of the commission intentions,which will only be revealed in future proceedings.
iii.secondary point capacity allocation 
in order ferc changed the rule for allocating mainline capacity leading to secondary delivery additional points to which a firm shipper may wish to deliver gas besides its primary delivery location.order at.because shipments to such secondary points are normally accorded lower priority than deliveries to primary points,this service is subordinate to firm service during periods of congestion.order at.in the past,the commission rule governing secondary point capacity allocation during constrained periods was the pro rata method.shippers whose primary delivery points were located in the same rate geographical area treated as a single point for rate equal entitlements to the capacity needed to reach secondary points in that zone if they requested more secondary point capacity than was available,it was allocated pro rata.id.
the commission illustrates the issue with the following diagram 
order at.on the facts given,the old rule gave shippers and equal rights to the mainline capacity needed to ship to b,with their entitlements being inferior to shipper.
in order,however,the commission concluded that a different approach would better assure allocation of the capacity to the shipper valuing it most highly.under its new rule,all shippers for whom the point is within their capacity is,the shippers whose primary delivery points are downstream of the point at which secondary rights are preference over shippers for whom the point is not in their capacity path.in the example above,then,shipper would have a straightforward priority over shipper,though even shipper would be subordinate to shipper.order at.the commission theory was that the priority for shipper would reduce transaction costs and,by establishing shipper as a more vital competitor with shipper as a source of capacity,would enhance competition.
two interstate pipelines owned by enron collectively,enron now challenge the new rule for allocating capacity at secondary points on a number of grounds.we do not reach those issues because enron has not made an adequate showing that it is aggrieved by ferc ruling.as it lacks both statutory and constitutional standing to bring this petition,we dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction.
the nga requires,as a precondition to judicial review,that a party be aggrieved by the order in question,b el paso natural gas ferc,and all parties trying to invoke the jurisdiction of federal courts must satisfy article iii requirements of constitutional standing.common to both of these thresholds is the requirement that petitioners establish,at a minimum,injury in fact to a protected interest.shell oil ferc.to show injury in fact,a litigant must allege harm that is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
enron is a pipeline,not a shipper,so no injury leaps to the eye.but it proposes two theories of injury,one based on the effect of the rule on competition,the other on administrative burdens generated by the rule.neither is persuasive.
first enron suggests the new method will diminish competition in the supply of capacity by decreasing the number of possible suppliers.the reduced competition would cause higher gas prices in markets,reducing overall gas consumption,and thereby reducing pipeline throughput.
where a claimed injury stems from changes in levels of competition,this court ordinarily requires claimants to show that a challenged agency action will almost surely cause them to lose business.el paso,at emphasis supplied see also energy ferc.enron relies on a simple account under which eliminating competitors reduces competition.enron repl.br.at enron br.at.everything else being equal,that is likely a sound assumption.but the commission here enron has not shown the matters were more complex.
the commission stated rationale for adopting its new method was that the pro rata method does not provide for the most efficient use of mainline capacity or promote capacity release because it creates uncertainty as to how much mainline capacity any shipper seeking to use secondary points will receive.order at.as a result the secondary rights were not tradable,and there was no effective competitor to the primary rights holder as a seller of secondary rights.id.by comparison,under the method,the fewer shippers to whom secondary rights would be awarded would thus be able to offer in the useful entitlement to service.id.in ferc opinion,this increase in certainty of entitlement would actually improve competition.id.
we need not pass on the ultimate merits of the commission reasoning to say that enron contrary theory fails to show the requisite probability of harm.basically,the showing is far too conjectural to establish a substantial if unquantifiable probability of injury,energy,at,as demanded by el paso almost surely test.
alternatively,enron claims that that the company will incur significant expense in implementing the new method because it must modify its computer systems in order to accommodate multiple levels of secondary point priorities.enron repl.br.at.while compliance costs often constitute an,enron argument here rests solely on a conclusory,vague and unsupported assertion of cost increases.see enron repl.br.at.compare virginia american booksellers ass n,d standing where plaintiff will have to take significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecution see also id.at.at,detailing steps needed for compliance.thus we dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction.
iv.penalties 
order changed the rules governing what pipelines may do when shippers overrun their transportation entitlements by shipping more gas than they have contracted for or create physical imbalances in the pipeline system for example,by withdrawing from the system than they have tendered.previously,in the interests of deterrence,see order at,pipelines were allowed to enforce their contractual rights by imposing appropriate penalties,that is,charges that reflect ed more than simply the costs incurred as a result of the shipper conduct,order at id.at order at.the penalties were enforceable whether or not the offending shipper behavior caused any actual harm to the pipeline system or threatened its reliability.see,natural gas pipeline,ferc at,wl.
order sharply restricted pipelines ability to assess penalties.ferc amended its regulations to provide 
penalties.a pipeline may include in its tariff transportation penalties only to the extent necessary to prevent the impairment of reliable service.pipelines may not retain net penalty revenues,but must credit them to shippers in a manner to be prescribed in the pipeline tariff.
c v order at.as ferc said,this requirement may result in either no penalties for days days when the pipeline is not expected to operate at or near full capacity or higher tolerances and lower penalties for as opposed to critical days.order at.in addition,the rule denies pipelines the right to retain revenues from penalties,instead requiring them to credit them to shippers.id.at.
in addition,order required pipelines to provide imbalance management services,such as parking,temporary storage and lending of gas,and greater information about the imbalance status of a shipper and the system as a whole,in order to give shippers positive lieu of manage or prevent imbalances.order at c iii.the order also allowed pipelines to retain revenues generated from these imbalance management services until the pipeline next rate case,as would be true for other new pipeline services initiated between rate filings.order at.thus it used carrots with the pipelines to encourage them to use carrots with their customers.
we deal here with a basic attack on ferc policy change,as well as specific claims relating to the treatment of revenues from such penalties as remain and to the new imbalance services.
ingaa attack on penalty limits 
ingaa and several pipelines again collectively,ingaa claim that in adopting its new penalty rule the commission did not make the required findings or exercise reasoned decisionmaking,and that the new rule unlawfully infringes on pipelines ability to enforce their contractual rights.
when ferc seeks affirmatively to displace a pipeline existing rates or tariff provisions,the previously stated requirements of of the nga apply.but there is no requirement that ferc use the magic words of itself,rhode island consumers council fed.power comm n,and indeed one would search the relevant portions of order in vain for words such as just or unjust.
but the commission did find that the existing penalty system was not the most efficient system of maintaining pipeline reliability,and that it skewed the market choices that shippers and pipelines would otherwise make.order at.as we understand the core of the commission analysis,it was that excessive pipeline penalties,and skimpy pipeline tolerances,allowances for contract excesses that would not generate penalties,made shippers unduly.excessive disincentives led them to oversubscribe to firm pipeline capacity,or underuse their entitlements,in order to assure a decent safety margin.order at order at nn.such consequences would seem to follow excessive penalties virtually as a matter of definition,but in addition there was testimony as to the behavior of prudent shippers.see,id.at.and in fact ingaa does not even try to dispute that the penalties produced these results.
aside from being concerned with the adverse effects of the penalties,the commission also concluded that the prior regime was ineffective in fulfilling what was supposed to be its intended purpose,order at shipper conduct that actually threatened the integrity of the pipeline system at critical times.order at order at.because the penalty levels were disconnected from threats to reliability,they did not offer incentives in any way calibrated to those threats.indeed,penalties were evidently often higher on systems where and at times when extra gas posed no threat to reliability at all,than on systems with such threats.
it was thus the commission conclusion that it should henceforth tie the imposition of penalties to behavior actually causing a threat to system integrity.order at.and,to eliminate market distortions caused by the use of penalties as a substitute for obtaining services,id.at,the commission believed that it was necessary for pipelines or third parties to directly provide shippers with the service flexibility they had been obtaining indirectly via their responses to the penalty regime thus the requirement of separate imbalance management services at pricing.id.at.finally,the commission new rules on disposition of the pipeline retention of penalties but allowing retention of the proceeds of new balancing reinforced its basic policy judgment.
we are not altogether clear why the commission response to excess penalties was to bar all penalties not directed to threats to reliability,and otherwise to switch to carrots.one might suppose that the most obvious response to excessive penalties would be to place ceilings on to the damage inflicted by the penalized behavior,whether it took the form of a threat to reliability or not.this option is not discussed,and petitioners neither suggest it nor fault the commission for its failure to consider it.perhaps the answer is that in fact there are no injuries other than the ones to system reliability.that in turn would seem to depend on the actual treatment incentives who overrun their contract entitlements under circumstances posing no threat to reliability.
in fact,the commission limits on penalties as they are understood in this regulatory regime appear to leave potential contract breaches covered by appropriate sanctions.when a shipper incurs a contract overrun,it must still pay for the interruptible service it has used for the surplus.order at.moreover,as was conceded by ingaa counsel at oral confirmed by commission current open access rules require a pipeline to make its spare capacity available to any shipper who desires it,at the interruptible rate.tr.oral arg.at.thus,a shipper that overruns its contract and suddenly seeks additional service is apparently treated apart from penalties just the same as any unscheduled interruptible shipper.the capacity that a shipper would obtain by means of an unauthorized overrun is not firm service,but is interruptible service that is subject to bumping and is limited by the capacity available at the time.order at.indeed,the firm shipper that overruns its entitlement in a time may be worse off than a interruptible shipper,as the latter may enjoy discounts evidently unavailable to the overrunning customer.tr.oral arg.at.
likewise,a shipper who runs an imbalance must either or pay for the gas he took.order at.although the record seems not to explain what price will govern such a transaction,we were told at oral argument that the offending shipper might be obliged to pay a higher price than a user with similar needs who chooses instead to take advantage of the imbalance management services or avoids creating an imbalance altogether by purchasing excess gas from another shipper.tr.oral arg.at.
thus,even with penalties now largely gone,pipelines are no more forced to provide services under the new rule than they were under the old one.what has changed is merely the remedy for breach.nor are pipelines turned into common carriers required to provide service to anyone regardless of whether they have a contract their duties in this respect are set out in the previously adopted open access rules.
the rules governing shippers who exceed their contract entitlement also answer another concern of ingaa that because of the limited availability of penalties,shippers will not contract and pay for an adequate level of firm service but instead will simply overrun their contract capacity as needed.in fact,in times such shippers will do no better than interruptible shippers and perhaps worse,because of the discount issue.and since overruns during peak times can still trigger penalties,shippers who need guaranteed service should not be tempted to contract for less capacity than what they expect to need.order at.
ingaa also accuses ferc of failing to engage in reasoned decisionmaking because of what ingaa perceives as a logical disconnect between ferc stated of the inefficiencies of the penalty ferc adoption of carrots as the cure.ingaa suggests that the pipelines mandated proffer of imbalance services is hardly equivalent to penalties,for on days,when penalties are not an option,shippers will have no incentive to use or pay for imbalance services.as they will continue to engage in creating overruns and imbalances,the commission rule is internally inconsistent and will not further ferc stated goals.
in large part this is answered by our earlier discussion of the incentives faced by shippers under the new regime the commission appears to have successfully rebutted ingaa prediction that the curtailment of penalties would harm any pipeline interest that deserved protection.that the commission hope and expectation of a flourishing market in services may prove unwarranted does not undermine that essential conclusion.
thus the commission made generic findings in support of its action under,see taps,at,which were backed by substantial evidence,and its conclusions met the standard for reasoned decisionmaking.
attacks on provisions 
on one hand a group of pipelines not joined by ingaa attack the commission requirement that they flow penalty revenues to shippers,and on the other several shippers and state consumer advocates argue that the pipelines should not be allowed to retain the revenues from the new imbalance services.neither attack is well conceived.
the pipelines claim that the commission did not find that previously approved tariffs and settlements,which imposed no such refunding mechanism,were unjust and unreasonable and the commission justified the refund requirement as an incentive for pipelines not to impose penalties,whereas pipelines should actually be given incentives to impose the penalties allowed by the new rule,as they necessarily apply only when shipper conduct threatens system reliability.
the first argument appears erroneously to assume that magic words are required under as we said,they are not.and as we already explained,the commission discussion of penalties in order reflects compliance with.in substance the commission finding of unsound incentives,see order at,amounts to a finding that the prior method was unjust and unreasonable.
the pipelines critique of the commission rationale misconceives its purpose.ferc goal here was not to discourage pipelines from imposing penalties at all but rather to motivate them to impose only necessary and appropriate penalties,and to develop mechanisms to deal with imbalance problems.order at.requiring refunds of penalty proceeds simply removes an incentive to impose unnecessary penalties.see order at stating that ferc was requiring penalty revenue crediting not so much for the purpose of preventing penalties from becoming a profit center,but more for the purpose of eliminating any financial incentives on the part of pipelines to impose penalties that would naturally hinder the pipelines movement toward reliance on the provision of imbalance services.
on the other side,the shippers first object to pipeline retention of revenues from imbalance services on the theory that because order requires pipelines to develop such services in any event,no financial incentive is necessary.but the directive to develop such services is not inherently.unless the commission were ready to take on a large new program for micromanagement of pipelines,it makes complete sense for it to rely on positive incentives instead of punitive measures to promote compliance.besides,as the commission explained,its decision on this point is entirely consistent with its current general policy of allowing pipelines to retain revenues from a new service initiated between rate cases.id.at.
finally the shippers assert that the commission policy here is inconsistent with two recent commission decisions requiring pipelines to share revenues with shippers,citing trunkline gas,ferc at,wl,and columbia gas transmission,ferc at,wl.but these cases involved sharing interruptible service revenues under conditions where the commission believed there was a substantial risk of overrecovery by the pipelines in question.the petitioners have not shown that any such conditions obtain here.
v.the right of first refusal 
as part of its effort to devise balanced rules to protect capacity holders from abandonment of service when their transportation contracts with pipelines expire,ferc also made changes to its right of first refusal rules.in some respects,it narrowed those rights,limiting their benefit to shippers paying the maximum tariff rate.in other ways,it expanded them,allowing incumbent shippers to exercise the right of first refusal by bidding for a mere term.this contrasted with the term that it had set in order,which gave the pipelines considerably more stability and which,in udc,at,we found inadequately justified.again,the agency actions have been challenged from both sides,as going too far and not far enough.
matching cap and regulatory right of first refusal 
section b of the natural gas act generally prohibits compan ies from ceasing to provide service to their existing customers unless,after due hearing,ferc finds that the present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment.b.seeking to streamline the regulatory process,the commission in order attempted to dispense with these individualized hearings by giving pipelines broad prospective authority to refuse shippers continued service on the expiration of their contracts in the absence of a contractual right of renewal.see american gas ass ferc,aga.under this mechanism,the commission makes ex ante generic findings of public convenience and necessity,and issues a blanket certificate that allows a pipeline to terminate service at the end of the shipper contract term.see d mobil oil exploration producing southeast,united distrib,d allowing the commission to issue general,prospective,and conditional abandonment approvals under b.
when this court addressed the merits of the issue in aga,we remanded the rule for lack of an adequate explanation of how it could be squared with the commission basic duty to protect gas customers from pipeline exercise of monopoly power.aga,at.but we noted that all parties recognized that such a procedure made sense for at least some transactions,most notably interruptible services and contracts.see id.
in order,the commission responded to aga and modified its earlier approach by supplementing abandonment authority with a right of first refusal for those shippers the commission considered to be captive and thus in need of operating under a firm contract longer than one year.order at.the right entitled a protected shipper with an expiring contract to retain its service from the pipeline under a new contract by matching the rate and duration offered by the highest competing to the maximum just and reasonable rate approved by ferc.on reconsideration,the commission also adopted a cap on the length of the term that existing shippers may be required to match.order at.
on review,though we generally upheld abandonment as supplemented with the right of first refusal,see udc,at,we thought that the cap was not justified by the record and remanded it for further explanation.id.at.we expressed concern that contract duration could become a surrogate for price which,of course,is capped,thereby allowing new customers to outbid existing ones by offering longer terms than they would in a truly competitive market.id.at.in addition,while ferc had picked years in reliance on actual contracts,we questioned whether the subset of contracts relied the construction of new properly representative.id.at.but because the selection of any duration for the matching cap would be necessarily somewhat arbitrary,we said we would defer to the commission expertise if it provides substantial evidence to support its choice and responds to substantial criticisms of that figure.id.at.
on remand,ferc decided to reduce the cap to one of five years,pointing to what it perceived as the current industry trend in favor of shorter term shipping contracts.order,order on remand,pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation under part of the commission regulations,ferc at order.despite objections from the pipelines,ferc summarily affirmed its decision in order,order on rehearing,pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation under part of the commission regulations,ferc at,wl.
in order the commission again confirmed the period.see id.at.and it made clear that right of first refusal includes the right of the existing shipper to elect to retain a volumetric portion of its capacity subject to the right of first refusal,and permit the pipeline pregranted abandonment to apply to the remainder of the service.id.at.moreover,it said that the regulatory right of first refusal,the right supplied by this commission mandate was a minimum right,usable by an eligible shipper regardless of whether its contract provides a comparable right by means,for example,of an evergreen clause,and that the shipper might exercise the regulatory right for part of the contract volume and any contract right for the rest.order at.it also specified,most clearly in order,that the right trumped any inconsistent provision in a pipeline tariff.
a group of interstate gas pipelines,led by ingaa collectively ingaa,attack both retention of the period and the commission explicit statement that the right of first refusal applies regardless of tariff provisions.
cap.in selecting a cap on remand from udc,the commission gave little indication of why it thought that this new figure would appropriately balance the protection of captive customers with the furtherance of market values putting capacity in the hands of those who value it most.it relied entirely on the fact that five years was about the median length of all contracts of one year or longer between january,and october.see order at.this contrasted with average durations of about years in the period from april,to october.
before confirming the figure,the commission itself raised doubt about its wisdom.in order,it acknowledged that the pipelines have raised legitimate concerns about the practical effects of the five year term matching cap on the restructured market as it continues to evolve.order at.at that point the commission decided to defer a final decision about the length of the cap until a new gas policy initiative which proved to be order,because at the time it had no information concerning current conditions in the natural gas industry.order at.in its nopr for order,ferc raised what it perceived were further problems with the term,suggesting that it provides a disincentive for an existing shipper to enter into a contract of more than five years,and results in a bias toward contracts.notice of proposed rulemaking,regulation of natural gas transportation services,ferc stats.regs.proposed regulations cch at.the commission apparently was concerned that the cap would foster an imbalance of risks between pipelines and existing shippers,allowing shippers indefinite control over pipelines capacity,but giving the pipelines no corresponding protection.id.at.thus,it suggested,elimination of the cap would foster efficient competition.id.at.moreover,as the pipeline petitioners point out,an artificial,shift toward shorter contracts increases risk for the pipelines this tends to raise their costs of capital and thus the overall cost of pipeline transportation.and,they note,it is at least requires ferc should choose a median to function as a ceiling.
but when ferc ultimately elected to retain the period,it addressed none of the difficulties that it or the pipelines had previously invoked.instead,it simply referred back to order evidence about median contract lengths and remarked that n one of the commenters presented evidence to support the conclusion that a five year contract is atypical in the current market.order at see also order at concluding simply that there is no evidentiary basis at this time for changing the matching cap.thus the only evidence supporting ferc final decision to choose a cap was the original on the commission own view was incomplete.there is neither an affirmative explanation for the selection of five years,nor a response to its own or the pipelines objections.
we therefore vacate the cap and remand the issue back to the agency.the commission may appear to be,the court,like mankind to the gods as flies to wanton boys,they kill us for their sport.pick years,and get reversed for failing to explain the length pick five,and get reversed for failing to explain the brevity.but our acknowledgment of the difficulty of the policy choice,see udc,at,is fully intended.the record simply lacks indicators of the commission seriously tackling that choice.
right of first refusal trumping tariff provisions.pipeline counsel accuse the commission of wrongfully creating a regulatory right of first refusal in order.we think their claim can better be comprehended as saying that the commission in that order transformed its requirement of a right of first refusal,ensconced in the commission regulations since april of,see order at see also d ii,into a requirement.that is,their argument is comprehensible only as a claim that before order the right of first refusal had legal effect only to the extent that it was expressly embodied in a pipeline tariff.in fact,order and order appear to be the commission first express articulations of the idea that the regulatory right of first refusal trumps tariff provisions.the first declares that eligible shippers have the right of first refusal as provided in the commission regulations,order at,and the second expressly says that the regulatory right of first refusal is effective regardless of the terms of any tariff,order at.
the commission says this was old hat,pointing to its statement back in august,in the order series,when it said that shippers were assured the right to continued service even if the parties do not include an evergreen or rollover clause in their contract.order at.but the language makes no mention of tariffs,and thus appears not inconsistent with a view that tariff language,mandated by the commission regulations,is necessary to effect the right,or at least that inconsistent tariff language trumps.more confusing is the commission decision in algonquin gas transmission,ferc,wl.there it first pointed to the language quoted above from order,see ferc at then,when its attention was called to contradictions between the regulatory right of first refusal as it conceived it,and the pipelines tariff provisions which had been approved as just and reasonable,it said that the solution was proceedings under of the nga to consider modification of the tariffs,see id.at.were the regulatory right,we do not understand why proceedings would be needed.the commission brief on the issue sheds no light.
accordingly,though not vacating this aspect of order or order,we remand to the commission for it to explain its current position,and,to the extent that language in the orders under review is legally unsustainable,to modify it.
narrowing of the right of first refusal 
at the same time that the commission expanded the degree of protection offered by right of first refusal by decreasing the maximum term that a protected shipper might be required to match,it also narrowed the right scope in certain respects.specifically,order denied the right to all shippers operating under discounted rate contracts,contracts with rates below the maximum approved by ferc.it also excluded negotiated rate contracts,ones whose terms differ in some respect from simple application of tariffs,and whose rates may fall below,at,or above the maximum rate.both parties assume the existence of contracts with rates above the ferc ceiling,but neither explains how such a contract would even be lawful.order at order at.the order grandfathered e xisting discounted contracts,so as to protect expectations based on the prior rule.order at.
in support of this modification the commission offered two general grounds.first,it portrayed the amendment as driven by the right of first refusal original purpose to protect captive customers from the pipeline monopoly power.order at.if the customer is truly captive,the commission reasoned,it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate.id.and shippers who have alternatives in the marketplace,as typically evidenced by their ability to negotiate discounts below the just and reasonable rate,do not need this type of regulatory protection.
second,because the right of first refusal necessarily creates a disincentive for a shipper to enter into contracts with the pipeline,and thus tends to saddle the pipeline with an unshared and uncompensated investment risk,see id.at,the commission also thought that limiting the right of first refusal to those shippers paying the maximum rates was needed to better balance the risks between the shipper and the pipeline,id.at.
petitioners objecting to the change assert that it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,because the agency relied virtually entirely on its own supposition that truly captive shippers are likely to be paying maximum rates.furthermore,they say,the commission rejected their examples to the contrary,which indicated that pipelines do sometimes offer discounted or negotiated rates to captive shippers.
the ferc order indeed cited no studies or data.but its conclusions seem largely true by definition.rate ceilings are set at the commission estimate of cost,thus roughly paralleling what would occur in a competitive market.the rates protect shippers whose choices are,by hypothesis,so limited that otherwise they would be ready to pay rates.if they are paying even less than the rates,it appears a fair inference that they have better choices than are supposed by the system of rates.
or so one would think in the absence of specific,compelling rebuttal evidence.what petitioners offer can hardly be called compelling,given the commission need to devise rules of general application.to be sure,their comments listed several situations in which,they claimed,pipelines might offer shippers discounted rate contracts even where they had market power.for instance,a discount may be given in consideration of entering into a settlement of a rate case or complaint proceeding,or for an agreement of the shipper to shift to a less desirable or underutilized receipt point,or to sign a longer contract,or to take an additional volume,or when a shipper is captive only for a part of his total load,or to assist an industrial customer during times of financial troubles in order to keep the facility viable,or in response to a perceived competitive threat from the proposed construction of a new pipeline.order at.most of these appear to be cases that any shipper aware of ferc rule can readily avoid this should be all affected shippers,as the rule applies only to contracts entered after its adoption.
petitioners in fact offer us no reasons to believe that their are anything more than sporadic exceptions to the general rule on which ferc relied.generalizations are not automatically rendered invalid by examples to the commission is plainly entitled to respond with a general solution to general findings of a systematic condition or problem,rather than proceed with a approach.agd,at stating that when ferc acts under its rulemaking authority to promulgate generic rate criteria,it is not required to adduce empirical data for every proposition on which the selection depends taps,at approving ferc open access rules on the basis of general findings of systemic monopoly conditions and the resulting potential for behavior,rather than evidence of monopoly and undue discrimination on the part of individual utilities.as petitioners have presented no data on how widespread the occurrence of discounting unrelated to market power is,they fail to undermine ferc conclusion that generally discounts are given to obtain or retain load that the pipeline could not transport at the maximum rate because of competition.order at emphasis added.further,nothing they say suggests that shippers on notice of the rule will be unable to avoid its consequences and enjoy the right of first long as they are willing to pay the price.
as to ferc second argument,relating to the balancing of risk,petitioners say only that they can see no problem in a pipeline being required to provide continuing service at maximum rates.br.of petitioners opposing limitations on the right of first refusal at.but the commission apparently was persuaded by pipeline commenters,who asserted that the prior regime place d disproportionate risks on the pipelines because the pipeline must bear the risk of standing ready to serve the existing shipper indefinitely,while the shipper has no such obligation.order at.this seems clear to us we see how the commission could find imbalance where one party,even though ready to commit itself to only a relatively short term one year,thereby secures a perpetual right to service.ferc clearly believed that limiting the right of first refusal to maximum rate contracts was a fair means of apportioning the risk,so that those customers who place a premium on the assured continuity of service must now pay for that protection by foregoing discounts,to which,of course,they have no regulatory entitlement.order at.
petitioners finally object that a discounted or negotiated rate is determined at the outset of the contract and thus has no relationship to the market the shipper faces at its end.this seems to be beside the point.the risk that market conditions would change always only issue is how it should be divided.under the new rules,any shipper who wants the benefits of a right of first refusal can secure them by simply choosing to take service under the standard just and reasonable rates set by ferc.the same goes for negotiated shippers are entitled to service under the generally applicable maximum tariffs,and pipelines can not require captive customers to enter into negotiated rate agreements.order at.no captive shipper is thus deprived of regulatory of them have the entitlement to place themselves within the protected class by simply paying,rates.as these are designed around existing levels of pipeline risk,they presumably include something approximating the necessary premium for the rights these customers prefer.
vi.discount adjustments 
standard ferc ratemaking,in its most simple form,involves projecting a revenue requirement for service on the pipeline facilities and dividing the sum by projected throughput.the quotient is a maximum unit rate.although both the revenue requirement and throughput are largely based on past experience,both figures are projections.where it is expected that some service will be sold at a discount from the maximum rate,there is obviously a problem with assuming that enhanced by,when multiplied by the maximum rate,yield the revenue requirement.ferc solution to the problem has been to make an offsetting downward adjustment in projected throughput.interstate natural gas pipeline rate design,et,ferc,wl policy statement,order on rehearing,ferc,wl policy statement rehearing.in the rulemaking,and citing expert testimony in other proceedings,various shipper interests headed by illinois municipal gas agency imga attacked this policy.in the end ferc elected to do nothing on the subject though not rejecting the petitioners claims on the merits,it concluded that the issue was better left to another day.imga and associated petitioners attack this decision not to act.
apart from the simple arithmetic described above,the theory underlying ferc discount adjustment is as follows by selectively discounting its services at least so long as charging prices above marginal cost,a pipeline could increase actual throughput by attracting additional,customers as the fixed costs of service will be spread over more units,captive customers themselves will benefit in the end.see policy statement rehearing at.
imga and kindred opponents of the policy see it in an entirely different light.they argue that the demand for pipeline service is largely inelastic in the aggregate as a result the rate discounts do not produce an overall increase in throughput but merely shift it around among pipelines.this is most plausible in the case of competition,which does not involve luring any away from competing fuels such as oil.the upshot is that the competitive customers enjoy a decrease in rates and,the captives,instead of enjoying the supposed benefit,actually experience higher rates as the aggregate contribution of the competitive customers is reduced.
over the last eight years,and despite the efforts of captive customers such as those represented by imga,ferc has declined to rule on the issue in any kind of a comprehensive manner.some of its conduct is suggestive of a shell game.thus,in resisting an imga petition for mandamus,see in re illinois municipal gas agency,wl,ferc pointed to the fact that in its rulemaking proceedings,which were to eventually culminate in the order before us,the commission was specifically considering whether it should change the policy.see notice of inquiry,regulation of interstate natural gas transportation services,iv ferc stats regs.notices cch at july.but when the order finally emerged,it contained no ruling on the matter,except for yet another promise to consider the arguments sometime in the indefinite future.order at.
imga and others here petition on the ground that ferc continuation of the discount adjustment policy is unsupported by substantial evidence.but this frames the issue imprecisely.the policy originates in past decisions ferc did not here decide to continue it,in the sense of confronting the substance and making an affirmative decision it decided only that it would defer substantive treatment to a necessarily.in essence,then,the claim is of a violation of the apa mandate that an agency decide matters within a reasonable time,b,and calls on us to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,id.at.our review is highly deferential.see,in re barr laboratories.
the case is anomalous among wrongful delay cases in that every ratemaking where the policy is applied presents an opportunity for challenge and lawsuit by a party aggrieved by its whose name is legion if petitioners are correct.in fact,since,the discounting practice has been challenged on at least four separate occasions.see,southern natural gas,ferc at,wl order on reh g,ferc at,wl regulation of negotiated transp.svs.of natural gas pipelines,ferc,wl,clarified,ferc,wl tennessee gas pipeline,ferc,wl,modified,ferc,wl,reh g denied,ferc,wl panhandle eastern pipe line,ferc,wl,reh g denied,ferc at,wl.in none of these cases,however,did aggrieved parties seek judicial review of the policy continued application.
an agency undoubtedly enjoys broad discretion to determine its own procedures,mobil oil exploration producing southeast,united distrib,d,including whether to act by a generic rulemaking or by adjudication,nlrb bell aerospace,d.but here ferc arguments in justification of deferring the issue make reliance on individual pipeline ratemaking perhaps as a palliative.indeed,the commission itself stressed some points strongly suggesting the advantage of treating the issue in a generic rulemaking format.
first,the commission pointed out,order itself comprised a policy statement inviting pipelines to institute differentiated rates.order at.not only would such differentiated rates tend to optimize the allocation of pipeline capacity,id.at,but they would reduc e the need to make discount adjustments,id.by its own terms,however,this point is only a partial answer.on this issue order is only a policy statement,see part vii,infra,and does not immediately introduce any seasonally differentiated rates.and even the commission sees seasonal differentiation only as reducing,not extinguishing,the practice of discounted rates.
second,the commission explicitly treated the discount adjustment problem as linked to a host of other issues,to be examined together,
