this appeal involves a challenge by orion reserves limited partnership orion to a decision of the department of the interior interior invalidating oil shale mining claims on federal land.the district court concluded that interior decision was arbitrary and capricious.we reach the opposite conclusion,which is compelled by the supreme court holding in hickel oil shale,d,that when a party substantially fails to perform the assessment work required by federal law it loses its claim to mine oil shale.
to encourage mining in the western united states,congress enacted the general mining law of mining law,declaring valuable mineral deposits in federal lands open to exploration and purchase,id.the mining law provides that citizens may stake,or locate,claims to extract minerals without prior government permission and without paying royalties to the united states.id.claimants may also apply for purchase of a deed,or patent,conveying full legal title to the land on which their claims are located.id.
even without a patent,claimants can maintain their mining rights indefinitely so long as they comply with federal,state,and local requirements.id.among these obligations is a duty to perform annual assessment work.the mining law requires that until a patent has been issued therefor,not less than worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year.id.when a claimant fails to perform this annual assessment work,his claim is open ed to relocation as if no location of the mineral deposit had ever been made.id.in other words,if a claimant does not complete the required annual labor or improvements,he will lose his rights in the land to a competing claimant who does.if,however,a claimant who has failed to perform assessment work later resumes work before anyone else has staked a competing claim,his original claim remains intact under a statutory exception known as the resumption provision.id.after passage of the mining law,interior promulgated regulations stating that failure to perform required annual assessment work would subject a claim to relocation unless the claimant resumed work after such failure and before relocation.nature and extent of mining claims,pub.lands.
the mineral leasing act of leasing act,authorized interior to take a more active role in regulating mining on federal lands.replacing the system of location and patent for oil shale and several other minerals,the leasing act requires new claimants to lease mined land from the secretary of the interior and to pay the federal government annual rental fees and royalties to obtain the privilege of mining,extracting and disposing of valuable minerals.id.of relevance here,claims made under the mining law system of location and patent were preserved under a savings clause,provided those claims were thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.id.interior subsequently promulgated revised regulations with a preface noting that regulations associated with the mining law no longer apply to minerals,like oil shale,listed in the leasing act,except as to valid claims existing at the enactment of the leasing act and thereafter duly maintained pursuant to the law under which located.nature and extent of mining claims,pub.lands,note.
this case involves orion attempt to patent oil shale mining claims in uintah county,utah that its original located between and under the mining law.it was not until,however,that another of orion predecessors filed patent applications for the claims.in the course of reviewing these applications,the bureau of land management blm,a division of interior,challenged two of orion claims,alleging they were invalid because,among other things,orion predecessors had failed to perform annual assessment work for significant periods of time.the parties agreed to put the matter on hold until interior finished processing orion other patent applications.the blm continued its investigation of orion claims and discovered a substantial number of years between and in which no affidavits,required annually by state law as a record that assessment work was completed,were filed.although work records differ for each of the claims,with lapses apparently ranging from to years,it was not until that orion predecessors consistently performed at least worth of assessment work each year and made the requisite filings.on this basis,the blm declared orion oil shale claims void.crippled horse,bureau land mgmt,crippled horse i.
orion appealed the blm decision to the interior board of land appeals ibla orion did not dispute the missing assessment work records,but argued that it had nevertheless preserved its claims under longstanding judicial and departmental interpretations of federal law,requiring only that orion resume annual work at some time,which it had done.the ibla rejected orion argument and concluded that supreme court precedent requires that claimants substantially satisfy the mining law annual assessment work obligation in order to maintain claims under the leasing act savings clause.crippled horse,crippled horse ii.orion ultimate resumption of work in could not revive claims forfeited by its failure to perform the required annual assessment labor or improvements.id.at.orion failure to file work affidavits for numerous years made out a prima facie case that the work was not performed in those years.id.at.because orion did not proffer evidence that assessment work was in fact done in years for which no affidavits were filed,the ibla held that its claims were invalid.id.at.
orion brought suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia challenging the ibla decision under the administrative procedure act.the district court bifurcated the case,addressing first the merits of the ibla decision and postponing until later orion separate and contingent claim that interior failed to process its patent applications in a timely fashion.on march,the court granted orion motion for summary judgment,reasoning that orion and its were entitled to rely on the resumption exception to maintain their claims because interior regulations allowed for such a resumption privilege when orion resumed annual assessment work in.orion reserves.norton,slip op.at,wl norton 
on june,the district court took up the question whether interior unreasonably delayed action on orion patent applications.orion reserves.kempthorne,d kempthorne.the court concluded that the delay in processing orion patent applications ha d not been unreasonable,especially given several administrative and congressional moratoria on claim processing,the unusually large size of the land at issue,limited blm resources,and the complex legal issues involved.id.at.the court remanded the proceedings to interior for further action,but ordered the blm to file quarterly reports detailing progress made in processing orion patent applications.id.at.
interior filed a timely notice of appeal and challenges the district court conclusion that orion repeated and extended failure to perform annual assessment work did not forfeit its oil shale claims.orion,arguing that interior unreasonably delayed processing its patent applications.orion has also lodged a conditional asking this court to consider several alternative grounds for affirmance in the event we conclude that the district court decision on the merits was in error.see,dep t of,recognizing this circuit willingness to entertain an otherwise prevailing party conditional seeking affirmance on alternative grounds.
we have jurisdiction under and review the summary judgment decision de novo.see transp.group united states.upon concluding that the district court decision on the merits was in error,we take up and find wanting each of orion alternative arguments.we need not reach orion unreasonable delay claim because we conclude that orion mining claims are no longer valid and therefore no longer need patent processing.
the ibla determination that orion had forfeited its oil shale mining claims,and the district court conclusion that it had not,turn on undisputed but different facts.the district court focused on the ultimate resumption of annual assessment work for each of the claims the ibla based its decision on the lengthy cessation of required assessment work over the course of several decades.the district court found the ibla decision arbitrary and capricious because orion predecessors resumed annual assessment work in,at a time when interior regulations allowed for noncompliant claimants to remedy assessment work performance failures by resuming work.norton,slip op.at.it was not until that interior removed from its regulations any reference to the resumption exception and announced that a lapse in assessment work causes the interest of the claimant s in the minerals subject to the mining laws to revert back to the public domain.b.the district court concluded that,by effectively disavowing the longstanding resumption exception,interior regulatory revision was a change to the law that could only work prospectively and could not reach back to undermine mining claims for which orion predecessors had resumed work in.norton,slip op.at.interior application of this revised regulation to invalidate orion claims was therefore impermissibly retroactive.id.consistent with interior original regulations,the court suggested that orion should get the benefit of the leasing act savings clause,which preserved the legal status quo for claims first made under the mining law.see id.at.according to this analysis,resumption of assessment work prior to any competing claim was sufficient to maintain orion oil shale claims.
the ibla,by contrast,focused on the long cessation of annual assessment work.in doing so,it applied mining law and leasing act provisions,as interpreted by the supreme court in hickel oil shale,d,to orion oil shale claims.see crippled horse ii,at.the hickel court emphasized that the leasing act completely changed the legal terrain regarding oil shale lands.at.the act put an end to private location of oil shale mining claims.as a result,claimants no longer feared other parties seeking to displace their idle claims meaningful enforcement of the assessment work requirement could no longer depend on the private initiative of relocators.id.at.although the leasing act savings clause provides that individuals may preserve mining law claims thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated,the court did not read the clause merely to preserve the status quo for mining law claims as against competing claims.recognizing that unless interior could directly challenge lapsed mining law claims,the maintenance provision of the leasing act savings clause becomes largely illusory,the court held that the power of enforcement had shifted to the federal government.hickel,at.
in the context of this new government leasing regime,the hickel court concluded that to preserve a mining law claim,a claimant must substantially comply with the assessment work requirement.see id.at.the court held that token assessment work or assessment work that does not substantially satisfy the mining law annual work requirement is not adequate to maintain the claims under the leasing act savings clause.id.at.to allow claimants to keep their claims despite long lapses in assessment work would defeat the policy that made the united states,as the prospective recipient of royalties,a beneficiary of these oil shale claims.id.
hickel substantial compliance standard governs orion sustained failure to complete the required annual assessment work.applying this standard,the ibla properly concluded that orion lapse in performing assessment work did not substantially satisfy the statutory work requirement,regardless of its ultimate resumption of annual work.see crippled horse ii,at see also exxon mobil norton,cir upholding a finding that gaps in assessment work throughout much of the period between and indicated a lack of substantial compliance with annual work requirements cliffs synfuel norton,cir concluding that there was a clear lack of substantial compliance when assessment work was not performed between and.
the district court contrary conclusion is wrong because it missed the effect of hickel.the court erroneously applied interior original regulations to orion claims even though those regulations are inconsistent with the statutory requirements as explained in hickel the authority to issue regulations is not the power to make law,and a regulation contrary to a statute is void.manhattan equip.comm r of internal revenue.a regulation which operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute is a mere nullity.because the supreme court determined that the mining law and the leasing act together require substantial compliance with assessment work obligations to maintain oil shale claims,any contrary directive in interior past regulations offers no protection to a noncompliant claimholder like orion.
the district court also mistakenly held that interior violated principles of retroactivity when it attempted to invalidate orion claims for lapses in assessment work that occurred before either the amended regulation or the hickel decision came into existence.norton,slip op.at.it is true that,as a general rule,regulations may only be applied prospectively,but the ibla relied on hickel and not on any of interior regulations.see crippled horse ii,at.supreme court decisions are given retroactive effect absent a clear statement from the court to the contrary.see harper.dep t of taxation,d when this court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect as to all events,regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.there is no suggestion in hickel that the decision would have anything other than retroactive effect the ibla properly applied hickel substantial compliance standard to invalidate orion oil shale mining claims.
as part of its conditional,orion offers several alternative reasons why we should affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.these include three separate arguments that the ibla decision was arbitrary and capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence.see.the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.mount royal joint venture kempthorne,quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.we uphold the ibla determinations so long as the board engaged in reasoned decisionmaking and its decision is adequately explained and supported by the record.cross harbor surface transp,internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,because substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,palace sports entm t,nlrb,internal quotation marks omitted,we reverse an agency decision only when the record is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find to the contrary,highlands hosp.nlrb,internal quotation marks omitted.
rather than contest interior evidence that it failed for many years to perform annual assessment work,orion argues that its resumption of work in was sufficient to maintain its oil shale claims,notwithstanding hickel.but orion misreads hickel,which made clear that the mining law resumption linchpin of orion not survive the leasing act.
citing to language from two early supreme court cases that applied the maintenance provision of the leasing act savings clause,orion argues that the resumption exception remains in force.in wilbur krushnic,the supreme court suggested that a lapse in assessment work does not automatically forfeit a mining law claim,but only renders it subject to loss by relocation.id.at.noting that the claimant had only failed to perform assessment work for a single year and had fully resumed work before anyone contested its claim,the court concluded that no relocation can be made if work be resumed after default and before such relocation.id.similarly,in ickes development,the court rejected interior attempt to invalidate mining claims during a lapse in assessment work.noting that the claimant had not only stated its intention to resume work but also made arrangements to do so,the c
