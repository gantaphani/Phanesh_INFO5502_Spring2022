pursuant to d of the natural gas act,d,we are petitioned by aes sparrows point lng,llc and express holdings,llc collectively aes to review the state of maryland department of the environment denial of a request for water quality certification pursuant to a of the clean water act,a,with respect to a proposed liquefied natural gas marine import terminal and pipeline project.for the reasons that follow,we deny the petition for review.
a.the project.
this case involves a proposal by aes to construct and operate a liquefied natural gas lng marine import terminal at sparrows point a heavily industrialized area adjacent to baltimore harbor and an pipeline connecting the terminal to three interstate natural gas pipelines in eagle,pennsylvania the project.lng,which is natural gas that has been cooled to fahrenheit to form a liquid,occupies one of the volume of natural gas in its gaseous state.aes sparrows point lng,llc smith,cir.the project 
would receive lng,store it,and regasify it for transportation and delivery to residential,commercial,and industrial end users.because lng can be economically transported by sea from areas worldwide to many domestic and foreign markets,lng import terminals are typically sited in coastal areas with shipping access to foreign countries.
the project involves three different aspects,each of which raises different environmental concerns.many of these concerns derive from the fact that the water and sediments around sparrows point are already contaminated by past industrial use and fail to meet maryland water quality standards.first,in order to accommodate the lng tankers,the project requires dredging an approximately turning basin and approach channel within baltimore harbor to feet of depth.one environmental concern of such dredging is that dissolved oxygen levels in the additional deep channel areas would drop below maryland water quality standards,rendering aquatic life virtually impossible.
the second aspect of the project is the terminal itself,which includes facilities to process the approximately million cubic yards of contaminated material to be dredged from the harbor.the processing of the dredged material as called for under the project involves both the of the dredged spoil and the mixing of the spoil with portland cement and other additives in an effort to bind the contaminants within the processed dredged material the pdm.depending on the success of that process in preventing the leaching of historical contaminants,aes hopes to make the pdm available as fill material for mine reclamation projects,construction fill,and other development projects,with placement in land fills as a secondary option.
the final aspect of the project is the installation of a natural gas pipeline,thirty inches in diameter and approximately miles long,from baltimore harbor to eagle,pennsylvania,where the pipeline would connect with three existing interstate pipelines.among other things,the pipeline would cross streams and wetlands in maryland,raising concerns regarding the destruction of aquatic habitat and water quality through sedimentation.
relevant statutes and agencies involved in authorizing the project.
the natural gas act,to,requires a party seeking to construct a lng terminal to obtain authorization from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.id.a.in order to do so,applicants must comply with the natural gas act requirements as well as complete ferc extensive process.ferc must then consult with the appropriate state agencies on numerous state and local issues.b.
ferc carries out reviews under the natural gas act and the national environmental policy act,and,as the statutorily designated lead agency,coordinates other agencies reviews related to a lng project under other applicable statutes.b.the ferc docket serves as a central conduit and repository for information requests and responses and is the foundation for the consolidated record for petitions for review,such as this one,concerning water quality certifications under the clean water act.d.
the army corps of engineers the corps issues authorizations pursuant to of the clean water act,and of the rivers and harbors act of,to conduct dredging in navigable waters of the united states and to discharge dredged and fill materials into jurisdictional wetlands and waters.other federal agencies participated in ferc review of the project,with comments being submitted by the united states environmental protection agency,the national oceanic and atmospheric administration,and the united states fish wildlife service.the maryland department of the environment maryland is charged with reviewing the project under the coastal facilities review act,envir.to,and a of the clean water act.
c.the review process.
maryland initial review.
of relevance to the present petition for review,on january,aes submitted its request to maryland for water quality certification under a of the clean water act aes request for a water quality certification or aes a certification request.both on may and august,maryland notified aes that its a certification request was incomplete and identified additional information needed for processing the request.aes submitted information in response to each notification.continuing to deem aes a certification request incomplete,maryland requested further additional information from aes on january.aes responded with a series of submissions,the last of which it submitted on april.
the corps initial review.
during the same time frame,the corps undertook its review of aes application for a dredging and discharge permit under of the clean water act and of the rivers and harbors act of.like maryland,the corps made a series of requests to aes for additional information in order to make aes application complete.having received aes final response to its data requests in april,on april,the corps issued a public notice of aes application for a dredging and discharge permit under of the clean water act and of the rivers and harbors act of for review and comment.in relevant part,the public notice stated 
for corps permitting purposes,the applicant is required to obtain a water quality certification in accordance with section of the clean water act from maryland and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pdep.the corps hereby requests that maryland and pdep review the proposed discharges for compliance with the applicable water quality standards.the section certifying agencies have a statutory limit of one year in which to make their decisions.
may,emphasis added.
ferc initial review.
the april,public notice was jointly issued with ferc and also announced the availability of the draft environmental impact statement the draft eis for review and comment.
maryland,the corps,and ferc continued review.
on june,maryland submitted comments to ferc regarding the draft eis,concerning a number of different aspects of the project,including the creation of areas caused by the of the turning basin the corps submitted comments on the draft eis as well.on december,ferc published for review and comment the final environmental impact statement for the project the final eis.in official comments on the final eis directed to ferc,maryland and the corps repeated many of their earlier concerns regarding deficiencies in certain areas of information.
on january,ferc adopted the final eis and issued its order approving the project under the natural gas act the ferc order.issuance of the ferc order,however,did not end the regulatory review process.by letter dated february,the corps informed aes that,due to outstanding information about the ultimate disposal of the pdm,the final pipeline alignment and crossing methodologies,and the project impact on endangered species,the corps was not in a position to finalize its review.the corps also stated that based on information currently in the administrative record,it would be difficult for the project to receive a favorable determination from the corps if the decision needs to be made within the designated federal agency decision timeframe of days from release of the feis,by march.
further events with respect to the corps review.
faced with the prospect of a permit denial,aes requested that the corps,pursuant to d v,suspend its processing of its permit application so that aes could provide the outstanding information.the corps declined to suspend its review,but determined that,in accordance with d,aes permit application is hereby withdrawn from active status and will be held in abeyance pending resolution of these outstanding issues and your written request to have the corps resume evaluation of this permit application.
further events with respect to maryland review.
on april,maryland denied,in writing,aes request for a water quality certification on the overall basis that it was unable to conclude that,on this record,the project will be carried out in compliance with maryland water quality standards.maryland expressly identified four independent and alternative grounds for the denial aes had not demonstrated that the pdm will ultimately be managed to ensure compliance with water quality standards,the project would create additional deep water areas where dissolved oxygen levels would fail to meet maryland water quality standards aes had not provided final surveyed plans for all wetland and stream crossings and until interagency consultations under of the endangered species act of,have been completed,maryland could not conclude that the project is consistent with maryland water quality standards.maryland noted,however,that it would continue its review of the project under the coastal facilities review act and would reconsider its denial of aes request for a water quality certification upon aes fulfillment of the above requirements.
petition for review.
in the present action,aes petitions us for review of maryland denial of its a certification request.d the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which a facility subject to section of this title or section of this title is proposed to be constructed,expanded,or operated shall have original and exclusive juris diction over any civil action for the review of an order or action of a state administrative agency acting pursuant to federal law to issue,condition,or deny any permit,license,concurrence,or approval required under federal law.
as a threshold matter,we first address maryland claim that,as a sovereign,it is immune from defending its denial of aes a certification request in this court.not surprisingly,aes responds that maryland waived any potential claim of sovereign immunity in connection with the present petition for review by expressly consenting to defending,in federal court,its decision to deny aes a certification request.virginia reinhard,cir a state may waive its sovereign immunity if it consents to suit in federal court,petition for cert.filed.in this regard,aes points to the following language in maryland written decision denying aes a certification request pursuant to d of the natural gas act,d,aes has the right to seek review of this decision through a civil action filed with the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit.
we agree with aes.a state may waive its immunity to suit in federal court in the context of a particular federal program.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.while the test for determining whether a state has waived its immunity from suit in federal court is a stringent one,we conclude that the test has been met here.a state will only be held to have waived its sovereign immunity from suit in federal court when the waiver is stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.reinhard,at quoting edelman jordan,d.at a minimum,the language upon which aes relies leaves no room for any other reasonable construction than that maryland consented to defending its denial of aes request for a water quality certification before this court,pursuant to d.frankly,we find maryland assertion to the contrary disingenuous.moreover,common sense compels the conclusion that if maryland did not intend the above quoted language to represent its consent to defend its decision before this court,it would not have proceeded to specify in such decision that t he record for any such review would be the consolidated record maintained by ferc.in conclusion,we reject maryland claim to sovereign immunity and proceed to address the merits of maryland denial of aes a certification request.
the parties agree that our review of the merits of maryland denial of aes a certification request is limited to the grounds set forth in the administrative procedure act the apa,to.ohio valley envtl.coalition aracoma coal,cir claims challenging federal agency action under the clean water act are subject to judicial review under the apa.under the apa,we are to hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.our review will follow this standard.
aes first challenges maryland denial of its a certification request as untimely,and therefore,not in accordance with law.in this regard,aes argues that maryland waived the water quality certification requirements of a of the clean water act with respect to the project by failing to grant or deny its a certification request within the waiver period set forth in the same statutory section.aes argument is without merit.
in relevant part,a of the clean water act provides 
if the state fails or refuses to act on a request for water quality certification,within a reasonable period of time which shall not exceed one year after receipt of such request,the certification requirements of this subsection shall be waived with respect to such federal application.no license or permit shall be granted until the certification required by this section has been obtained or has been waived as provided in the preceding sentence.no license or permit shall be granted if certification has been denied by the state 
a emphasis added.
with respect to the date the waiver period commenced regarding aes a certification request,aes first contends that it commenced on january,the date maryland first received such request.alternatively,aes contends that,at the latest,the waiver period commenced on april,the date of its last submission in response to maryland last request for additional information,prior to maryland decision denying aes a certification request on april.maryland denial of aes a certification request did not occur within one year of january,or april.in support of its contentions,aes cites the language of a providing that the waiver period begins after receipt of a request for water quality certification under a.aes also points out that,in,ferc changed its interpretation of a waiver language from an interpretation considering the waiver period to commence on the date the certifying agency deem s an application acceptable for processing,washington county hydro dev,ferc cch,september,to an interpretation considering the waiver period to commence on the date the certifying agency received a written request for certification,b iii formerly e according to ferc,its prior practice of deeming the waiver period to commence from the date the certifying agency deems the request acceptable for processing,fails to enforce the clear text of the waiver provision of the clean water act and subjects a license applicant to the possibility that a section certification proceeding may be protracted beyond one year,in contravention of the statutory objective of preventing such delay.
in response,maryland argues that the waiver period did not begin until april.this is the date that ferc and the corps issued a joint public notice to advertise,inter alia the availability of the draft eis the fact that aes had applied for a permit with respect to the project and 
for corps permitting purposes,the applicant is required to obtain a water quality certification in accordance with section of the clean water act from maryland and pennsylvania.the corps hereby requests that maryland and pennsylvania review the proposed discharges for compliance with the applicable water quality standards.the section certifying agencies have a statutory limit of one year in which to make their decisions.
all of this brings us to the question of whether the waiver period began to run on april,such that mary land april,denial of aes certification request was timely.in answering this question,we first consider the regulation promulgated by the corps governing its processing of permit applications 
no permit will be granted until required certification has been obtained or has been waived.a waiver may be explicit,or will be deemed to occur if the certifying agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification within sixty days after receipt of such a request unless the district engineer determines a shorter or longer period is reasonable for the state to act.in determining whether or not a waiver period has commenced or waiver has occurred,the district engineer will verify that the certifying agency has received a valid request for certification.
b ii emphasis added.in the joint public notice,the corps declared that maryland had one year from april,to consider aes a certification request.by necessary implication,the corps determined that,as of april,aes certification request constituted a valid request for certification,such that the waiver period commenced on that day.choosing an earlier date for the commencement of the waiver period would require us to interpret a as providing that the waiver period commenced at the filing of an invalid a certification request in this case on the ground of incompleteness,an interpretation directly at odds with b ii.
because the corps is charged with determining whether to issue aes a permit for the project,if the clean water act is ambiguous regarding whether an invalid as opposed to only a valid request for water quality certification will trigger a waiver period in connection with a permit application,the corps interpretation as set forth in b ii is entitled to chevron deference.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.indeed,the statute is ambiguous on the issue.thus,under chevron,we must defer to the corps interpretation,so long as that interpretation is permissible in light of the statutory text and reasonable.ohio valley envtl.coalition bulen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the corps interpretation that only a valid request for a water quality certification,as determined by the corps,will trigger the waiver period in connection with a permit is permissible in light of the statutory text and is reasonable.accordingly,we adhere to it.moreover,to the extent the joint public notice in the federal register regarding aes permit application is understood to be interpreting the corps own regulation,interpreting b ii,such interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d quoting auer robbins,d internal quotation marks omitted.such interpretation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation finally,we note that aes reliance on ferc regulation interpreting a waiver period is misplaced given that ferc is not charged in any manner with administering the clean water act.alabama rivers alliance ferc.
in sum,aes has failed to establish any basis for us to disturb the corps determination that maryland had not waived its right to grant or deny aes a certification request.
having rejected aes waiver argument,we now turn to consider maryland denial of aes a certification request under the arbitrary and capricious standard.maryland relied upon four independent and alternative grounds for its denial,and aes takes issue with each one.for reasons that follow,we uphold maryland denial of aes a certification request on the independent ground that the dredging required to accommodate the lng tankers would create additional deep water areas where dissolved oxygen levels would fail to meet maryland water quality standards.accordingly,we do not reach and express no opinion on the remaining three independent and alternative grounds for maryland denial.see syracuse peace council,i f an agency relies on two grounds for a decision,a court may sustain it if one is valid and if the agency would clearly have acted on that ground even if the other were unavailable.communication workers of am.nlrb,cir if an agency states two grounds of decision,each sufficient,a court should sustain the decision if either reason is correct.
with respect to maryland denial on the ground that the dredging required to accommodate the lng tankers would create additional deep water areas where dissolved oxygen levels would fail to meet maryland water quality standards,aes contends maryland exceeded its statutory authority under a of the clean water act and the conclusion is arbitrary,capricious,and unsupported by record evidence.we address each in turn.
first,aes argues that the depth of a channel is not a discharge under a,and therefore,maryland acted in excess of its statutory authority when it denied aes a certification request based upon the channel depth required for the project.aes argument is without merit.
in pud of jefferson county washington of ecology,d,the court made clear that a authority to grant or deny water quality certification vel non depends on the threshold condition of a discharge.id.at.although we agree with aes that the depth of a channel itself is not a discharge under a,our agreement does nothing to aid aes cause here.aes authority argument ignores the fact that the dredging required to increase the channel depth would undeniably cause the flowing of water into the places of navigable waters where the dredged material is removed,displacing the dredged material.although the clean water act does not define the term discharge,the supreme court has interpreted it to mean a flowing or issuing out into navigable waters.warren maine bd.of envtl,d internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,in the same case,the court squarely held that the term discharge,as found in a of the clean water act,includes within its ambit the flowing or issuing out of water.warren,at.
in warren,the petitioner company warren asked ferc to renew federal licenses for five of the hydroelectric dams it operated on a maine river to generate power for its paper mill.id.at.each dam impounded water,which then ran through turbines and returned to the riverbed,passing around a section of the river.id.at.under protest,warren applied for a water quality certifications from maine environmental regulatory agency.id.at.ferc licensed the dams subject to compliance with those certifications,which required warren to maintain a minimum stream flow and to allow passage for certain fish and eels.id.after losing state administrative appeals,warren filed suit in state court,which rejected its claim that the water discharged from its hydroelectric dams did not result in a discharge under a of the clean water act.id.
ultimately the case came before the supreme court,which also rejected warren claim that water discharged from its hydroelectric dams did not constitute discharge under a of the clean water act.id.at.of particular relevance in the case presently before us,the supreme court reasoned as follows in support of its holding 
congress passed the clean water act to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters,a see also pud,at,d,the national goal being to achieve water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish,shellfish,and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water,a.to do this,the act does not stop at controlling the addition of pollutants,but deals with pollution generally,see b,which congress defined to mean the or alteration of the chemical,physical,biological,and radiological integrity of water.
the alteration of water quality as thus defined is a risk inherent in limiting river flow and releasing water through turbines.warren itself admits that its dams can cause changes in the movement,flow,and circulation of a river caus ing a river to absorb less oxygen and to be less passable by boaters and fish.brief for petitioner.and several amici alert us to the chemical modification caus
