ii.statement of the case 
this case involves the construction and application of the hereinbelow identified texas oil and gas working interest unit agreement and joint operating agreement.
a.the leases,lessors,lessees 
in,moose oil gas company moose o g acquired oil,gas and mineral leases in lavaca county,texas.moose o g assigned some of its lease interests to a group of investors the moose assignees,including appellant herein lee tawes,iii tawes.collectively,these lands will be referred to as the baker lease.
also in,american exploration company acquired from leon barnes and doris barnes appellee herein individually and as executrix of the estate of leon barnes,deceased an oil,gas and mineral lease the barnes lease.the barnes lease covered acres of property adjacent to the baker lease.ultimately,american exploration company interest in this lease was passed to louis dreyfus natural gas corporation,which interest in turn later passed to dominion oklahoma texas exploration and production,collectively dominion.
in july,moose o g,the moose assignees,dominion and seisgen exploration seisgen pooled their interests in the oil,gas and mineral leases discussed above of the total acres in the pooled unit,the barnes lease constituted of the land.each of these parties agreed to be bound by the terms of a working interest unit agreement wiua and an attached joint operating agreement joa.dominion later acquired seisgen interest.
the wiua designated dominion as the operator of any wells that would be drilled on the pooled unit.dominion drilled and operated wells on the pooled unit.moose o g proposed to drill two additional wells that would have their surface location on the baker lease,but would directionally extend to bottom out under the barnes lease.the contracts allowed dominion to not participate in the drilling of these wells if it chose to go.for a certain period under the contract,dominion would not receive any revenues from production,nor would it incur liabilities in drilling and maintaining the wells.
dominion elected to go on the proposed wells.moose o g decided to and did drill and operate these two wells designated anyway.moose o g and the moose assignees,including tawes,were consenting parties under the wiua and joa.at all herein relevant times,moose o g was the operator of the wells.
b.the working interest unit agreement 
at issue in this case is tawes liability,as a consenting party,for royalty respecting production from the wells under the wiua and joa.the wiua,in a section titled lease burdens,provided 
each party hereto shall bear and be responsible for their own lease burdens including,but not limited to their lessor royalty,overriding royalty along with any and all other royalty burdens which may have been created by the party contributing the lease or leases to this working interest unit.
further,in a section titled provision v,it also provided that 
moose oil gas company shall be the liable party to the operator for the entire percent working interest within the working interest unit for the parties hereinabove referred to as moose including tawes.moose oil gas company shall be the responsible party,for each of said parties,to the operator for obtaining and delivering any and all elections,notices,invoices payments and billings.
should one or more moose parties decide not to participate in a proposed operation,the participating moose party or parties shall have the option of disbursing the moose parties interest proportionately among the participating moose parties.
finally,in an section titled lease rentals,the wiua stated 
rentals,payments,or minimum royalties which may become due on leases committed hereto shall be paid by the contributor of the lease to the working interest unit.it is the obligation of the contributing lessee to maintain its own lease or leases subject to this agreement.
the parties agreed in the wiua that it would be governed by the joa that was attached as an exhibit to the wiua.
c.the joint operating agreement 
the joa,in its article,set out a general scheme of liability apportionment 
unless changed by other provisions,all costs and liabilities incurred in operations under this agreement shall be borne and paid,and all equipment and materials acquired in operations on the contract area shall be owned,by the parties as their interests are set forth in the wiua.in the same manner,the parties shall also own all production of oil and gas from the contract area subject to the payment of royalties to the extent of their interests which shall be borne as hereinafter set forth.
regardless of which party has contributed the lease s oil and gas interest s hereto on which royalty is due and payable,each party entitled to receive a share of production of oil and gas from the contract area shall bear and shall pay or deliver,or cause to be paid or delivered,to the extent of its interest in such production,the royalty amount stipulated hereinabove and shall hold the other parties free from any liability therefor.no party shall ever be responsible,however,on a price basis higher than the price received by such party,to any other party lessor or royalty owner,and if any such other party lessor or royalty owner should demand and receive settlement on a higher price basis,the party contributing the affected lease shall bear the additional royalty burden attributable to such higher price.
after thus setting out the relationship between the parties generally,the joa then specifically addressed the situation where a signatory did not want to take part in a proposed well drilling operation.if a party did not consent to the drilling of a proposed well,the joa gives consenting parties the right to drill anyway and lays out the rights and obligations of the consenting parties.article i of the joa also defined the terms consenting party and party 
the terms drilling party and consenting party shall mean a party who agrees to join in and pay its share of the cost of any operation conducted under the provisions of this agreement 
the terms party and party shall mean a party who elects not to participate in a proposed operation.
the joa states in its article,t he entire cost and risk of conducting such operations shall be borne by the consenting parties in the proportions they have elected to bear finally,in a subsequent portion of its article vi the joa contains the statement that 
during the period of time consenting parties are entitled to receive party share of production,or the proceeds therefrom,consenting parties shall be responsible for the payment of all production,severance,excise,gathering and other taxes,and all royalty,overriding royalty and other burdens applicable to party share of production 
this joa provision,which for convenience of identification we call the royalty provision,is the language principally at issue here.barnes argues that tawes,as a consenting party,is responsible for all royalty owed to her.
d.the resulting lawsuit 
in,barnes sued dominion and moose o g in lavaca county,texas district court to recover damages to real property,breach of contract for failure to pay royalties,fraudulent inducement,and negligent misrepresentation.tawes and the other moose assignees were originally brought into the suit as defendants.under her original contract with dominion,barnes was owed a royalty.no party,including tawes,disputes that barnes was owed a royalty proportional to her land contribution to the pooled unit,or.the remaining was disputed between the parties.
in february of,tawes and marlin data research,mdr acquired moose o g working interest in the baker lease and the wells at a foreclosure sale.the following chart displays the working interest ownership of the wells at issue 
in march of,payout of the proceeds received from the sale of production from the wells was suspended and such proceeds began to be held in suspense pursuant to court order.the production payments are held in two accounts one for the benefit of the working interests,including tawes,based on their respective interests in the wells,and another for the benefit of all the royalty owners.
in april of,moose o g filed in the bankruptcy court a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of title of the united states code.in august,notice of removal was filed,removing the barnes action to the bankruptcy court below as part of the moose o g bankruptcy proceeding.
in september of,the parties notified the bankruptcy court that a settlement had been reached among barnes,dominion,and the moose assignees,but not tawes or mdr.under the terms of the settlement,barnes would receive.barnes agreed to ratify her royalty to the undisputed in all the wells in the pooled unit and release her claims against the parties to the settlement agreement.dominion agreed to release its claims against the moose assignee signatories to the settlement agreement.the bankruptcy court issued a final case management order directing all parties to file amended pleadings and a stipulation of facts and law.barnes amended her complaint to allege that tawes and mdr were responsible for royalties due from and wells that accrued prior to february.in october,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement.
in august of,the bankruptcy court found tawes,but not mdr,liable to barnes for unpaid royalties on the barnes and wells that accrued from the date of first production to february.specifically,the bankruptcy court relied on the royalty provision of the joa stating that consenting parties shall be responsible for all royalty applicable to the party share of production.however,the bankruptcy court found no evidence that barnes was owed royalty.instead,the bankruptcy court held that barnes was owed royalty proportional to her land contribution to the pooled unit,or the undisputed royalty amount.the bankruptcy court held that barnes damages,should not be offset by her settlement with dominion and the other moose assignees because the evidence does not establish which portion of the settlement,if any,was payment of the royalties,as opposed to royalties or damages for her claims of fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation finally,the bankruptcy court rejected barnes claim for attorneys fees.
tawes appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.barnes cross appealed the bankruptcy court decision on attorneys fees.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court holding as to liability,but reversed its decision on attorneys fees and remanded it for factual development.the district court compared mci telecommunications texas utilities electric,with stine stewart,and held that barnes was a beneficiary of the wiua and joa.interpreting the contract under texas law,the district court held that the contract did not preclude recovery against barnes.finally,it held that the parties had bargained for the consenting parties to be fully liable for all royalties due by a party.
iii.legal issues 
barnes rights under the wiua and joa 
as an initial matter,tawes argues that the lower courts erred in holding that barnes was a beneficiary to the wiua and the joa.he claims that the joa was not intended to be for the benefit of lessors and as a result,under texas law,the joa created no liability.
under our reading of texas law,a contract creates a creditor beneficiary only if the signatories l intended to confer a benefit on that and entered the contract to confer that benefit on the third party.mci telecomm,at.the language of the contract must be clear,and the intent of the contracting parties controls.id.a presumption exists that parties contracted for themselves unless it clearly appears that they intended a third party to benefit from the contract.id.for this purpose,there seems to be a distinction between direct or express benefit,on the one hand,and incidental benefit on the other hand.stine,at.that a contract incidentally benefits some third party is insufficient to establish an intent to create a beneficiary.id.the beneficiary has the burden of proof on this issue.mci telecomm,at.
the instant case seems to fall somewhere between stine and mci telecommunications.in stine,the beneficiary was named in a couple divorce agreement as a creditor to whom a debt was owed.stine,at.the divorce agreement also clearly defined the terms of the repayment due to the beneficiary.id.the court noted that the divorce agreement was not solely intended to provide for repayment of the beneficiary.id.at.but the court held that express references to the beneficiary and the clear intent to ensure her repayment created more than an incidental benefit,and was sufficient to make her a creditor beneficiary under the terms of the divorce agreement.id.at.
in mci,however,that company sought to install fiber optic cable along a railroad.mci telecomm,at.years before,texas utilities had installed transmission poles along that same.mci contractually agreed with the railroad to secure such permission as may be necessary on account of any other existing rights in any third party including,without limitation,rights of licensees and mci hereby agrees to exercise the herein granted rights in such a manner as not to interfere in any way with any existing prior rights.id.at.texas utilities claimed mci work damaged its transmission poles and sought to enforce its rights as a creditor beneficiary under mci contract with the railroad.id.the court in mci held that the contract created no beneficiary rights for licensees.id.at.as in mci,the joa identifies a specific group of royalty owners that barnes argues have beneficiary rights.
while the mci contract seemingly identifies a definite group of potential beneficiaries,an arguably significant difference between stine and mci may be that the mci contract does not identify what rights of the class are to be respected.unlike mci,but like stine,the contract here identifies a specific,limited group of individuals and identifies what rights are owed to the those individuals payment of royalties.further,in mci,there was particular language in the contract that explicitly stated that the contract was not to be interpreted as conferring any benefits on parties.id.in fact,opinions in some texas cases state that mci turned on that express language in the contract,pilgrim pride,pet.denied.no party has asserted that such a clause exists in either the wiua or the joa.
barnes also makes an alternative argument that even if she is not a creditor beneficiary,she has a basis of recovery against tawes because they are in privity of estate.liability to the original lessor for the payment of rent or the performance of other lease covenants may arise from either privity of contract or privity of estate.amco trust naylor.she argues that tawes came into privity of estate with her by undertaki
