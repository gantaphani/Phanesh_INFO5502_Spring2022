producers of natural gas typically lease the mineral rights and compensate the owner by means of a royalty calculated as some fraction such as or of the value of the gas produced.in exchange,lessees agree to bear the costs and risks of exploration and production.federal and indian gas leases are no exception.
but the federal government is not your standard lessor.for the detailed ascertainment of the parties rights,its leases give controlling effect not merely to extant department of interior regulations but also to ones hereafter promulgated.see,department of interior,form,at.the regulations have historically called for calculation of royalty on the basis of gross proceeds.see,h federal unprocessed gas,h federal processed gas.but to abide by the statutory mandate to base royalty on the value of the production removed or sold from the lease,b a,interior has allowed two deductions from gross proceeds when calculating value for royalty purposes.one deduction relates to certain processing costs and is irrelevant here the other is for transportation costs when production is sold at a market away from the lease,see also final rule,revision of oil product valuation regulations and related topics,fed.reg.these are evidently the only deductions from gross proceeds.walter oil gas,ibla.marketing costs have therefore not been deductible.see,arco oil gas,ibla.
in the a series of rulemakings by the federal energy regulatory commission somewhat changed the circumstances to which these principles applied.previously,producers most commonly sold gas at the wellhead to natural gas pipeline companies,which then transported it and sold it to local distribution companies less commonly,they made direct sales from producer to an end user or distributor,with the pipeline providing only transportation.see,fpc transcontinental gas pipe line,d.but ferc,starting with order and culminating in order,in effect transformed the pipelines into transporters and required them to separate sales from transportation services,final rule,pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation,and regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol,fed.reg,order,to charge unbundled rates for services such as transmission and storage,id.at,and to assign their merchant services to functionally independent market affiliates,id.at see also restricting pipelines from favoring such affiliates.in effect,the pipelines as such became almost exclusively transporters of gas,and direct sales by producers to end users,distributors,or merchants became the norm.
in response to these changes,the department of interior in amended its gas royalty regulations to clarify its existing policies and to prevent lessees from claiming improper deductions on their royalty reports and payments.final rule,amendments to transportation allowance regulations for federal and indian leases to specify allowable costs and related amendments to gas valuation regulations,fed.reg.final rule.two trade associations representing the gas producers american petroleum institute for the majors,independent petroleum association of america for the independents brought suits challenging these regulations as arbitrary and capricious.their primary contention was that interior had impermissibly refused to permit deductions for costs incurred in marketing gas to markets downstream of the wellhead.dispute focused especially on interior denial of deductions for fees incurred in aggregating and marketing gas with respect to downstream sales transfer fees charged by pipelines for assuring correct attribution of quantities to particular transactions not for the physical transfers themselves and any unused pipeline demand charge,the portion of a demand charge paid to secure firm service but relating to quantities in excess of a producer actual shipments.
the district court granted summary judgment for the producers in broad terms,independent petroleum association of america armstrong,d,ipaa,but then granted interior rule e motion for clarification,independent petroleum association of america armstrong,rcl,amended order unpublished opinion.when the dust had settled,the upshot was to declare that the relevant regulations were unlawful to the extent that they impose a duty on lessees to market gas downstream and disallow the deduction of downstream marketing costs,including the transfer fees,and to the extent that they limit deduction for firm demand charges to the applicable rate multiplied by the actual volumes transported.amended order,slip op.at.the modified order also specified that a producer that sold unused pipeline capacity must credit the united states with the resulting revenue.id.interior now appeals.
we review the district court ruling de novo,as if the agency decision had been appealed to this court directly.kosanke dep t of interior,quoting ftc.on the deductibility of marketing costs we find no legal error in interior rule and therefore reverse the district court on the unused demand charge issue,we affirm the district court.
the producers argue that we owe no deference to interior judgments here,saying that the case involves interpretation of contracts,not of a statute.thus they call for interpretation under neutral principles of contract law,not the deferential principles of regulatory interpretation.mesa air group,department of transportation.but see national fuel gas supply ferc,applying a chevron framework to agency interpretation of contracts,though expressing concern where the agency is.thus the producers briefs point rather summarily to state court decisions,implicitly asking us to treat the matter as would a state court interpreting private leases.but here the contracts themselves lead us back to the agency.as we said,they incorporate the regulations and recognize interior authority to modify them,form,at rights granted are subject to regulations and formal orders hereafter promulgated when not inconsistent with lease rights granted or specific provisions of this lease.id.at reserving to interior the right to establish reasonable minimum values on products see also,department of interior,form,b department of interior,form.
of course the application of new rules to leases may involve secondary retroactivity a new rule that legally has only future effect,and is therefore not subject to doctrines limiting retroactive effect,may still have a serious impact on transactions.see,bowen georgetown university hospital,d scalia,concurring.interior own rules recognize the possibility,explicitly repudiating any authority to alter the royalty rate except downwards,in the lessee favor.a.the legal effect of such secondary retroactivity is to add a nuance to ordinary review for whether the agency has been arbitrary or capricious we review to see whether disputed rules are reasonable,both in substance and in being made retroactive.airwaves,fcc.but this added nuance is quite different from a general denial of deference.
in a related argument,producers urge that deference to interior interpretation of the statute under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,is inappropriate for regulations that affect contracts in which interior has financial interests.
but in the mineral leasing statutes congress has granted rather sweeping authority to prescribe necessary and proper rules and regulations and to do any and all things necessary to carry out and accomplish the purposes of the leasing statutes.federal lands see also,tribal lands a outer continental shelf.these purposes,of course,include the administration of federal leases,which involves collecting royalties and determining the methods by which they are calculated.see california udall,see also independent petroleum association babbitt,rogers,dissenting recognizing that congress authorized interior to prescribe regulations governing mineral leases.
it is thus not surprising that the cases do not support producers theory.though no circuit appears ever to have ruled specifically on the issue of deference to financially agencies,courts have regularly applied chevron in royalty cases.in california,we deferred to interior interpretation of the
