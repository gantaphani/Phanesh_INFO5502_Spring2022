oci wyoming,oci filed this diversity action against pacificorp alleging pacificorp had breached its master electric service agreement with oci by failing to provide a reliable supply of electricity to oci mine and refinery in wyoming.although both parties waived their right to a jury trial,the district court announced at the final pretrial conference its intention to impanel an advisory jury.after a trial,the advisory jury determined that pacificorp had breached the agreement.the advisory jury also determined oci had suffered damages from three of nine outages and calculated oci damages at,which was significantly less than the million in damages that oci had alleged.the district court subsequently denied oci motion to set aside the advisory jury verdict,treating it as a motion to amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b and concluding that substantial evidence supported the advisory jury verdict.the district court subsequently entered judgment in accordance with the verdict of the advisory jury and in the same amount as the advisory jury verdict.
oci appeals from the judgment and seeks a new trial.exercising jurisdiction under,we vacate the judgment and remand with instructions that the district court review the evidence previously presented and reach its own judgment,setting forth sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law without giving deference to the advisory jury verdict.
oci operates a mining facility west of green river,wyoming where it mines and refines trona ore to produce soda ash which is used in the manufacture of glass,chemicals,and detergents.the mine and refinery operate hours a day,seven days a week.during the period at issue,oci relied exclusively on pacificorp for power generation.after years of what oci considered to be unsatisfactory service,pacificorp and oci negotiated a new contract in the master electric service agreement,whereby the parties agreed to continue their business relationship and to share the costs of constructing a new power substation.
after completion of the new substation,the electricity service to oci improved.then in early,oci alleges a series of intermittent power outages began which persisted for nearly three years.on december,oci filed this diversity action against pacificorp for breach of contract although oci initially demanded a jury trial,the parties subsequently filed a joint motion seeking a trial to the court.the district court granted the motion and ordered that the case be tried to the court,sitting without a jury.
about two weeks later,during the final pretrial conference,the district court,sua sponte,announced that it would impanel an advisory jury.the pretrial order directed the parties to submit proposed jury instructions d ue to the i mpaneling of an advisory jury and scheduled the case for trial with an advisory jury on april.at.the case was tried before an advisory jury for nine days.
after the parties rested,the advisory jury concluded that pacificorp had breached its contract with oci.as regards the damages arising from that breach,the advisory jury determined that oci suffered damages from outages that occurred on april,november,and march,but not from outages that occurred on january,march,november,february,june,and december.the advisory jury determined oci was entitled to in damages and,at the close of trial,the district court entered the advisory jury verdict.
oci filed a motion to set aside the advisory jury verdict and for leave to file briefing to assist the court in issuing written findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.at.in its motion,oci reminded the court that although the court could consider the advisory jury findings of fact in reaching its own,ultimately the court wa s the finder of fact and was required to reach its own findings and conclusions of law.id.at.in support of this reminder,oci quoted rule a and cited related case law.id.at.the district court granted oci motion for leave to file briefing and stated that the filing of proposed findings and conclusions would be useful in drafting and promulgating the findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.at.the district court reserved its ruling on oci motion to set aside the advisory jury verdict.id.at.
the district court held a hearing after the receipt of the briefing.at that hearing,the district court explained its view of the role of an advisory jury 
well,i regard an advisory jury as a jury,and the fact that it is advisory means that it is a jury and we called on our good citizens to come in here and spend some time and decide these issues.and i have never yet turned down an advisory jury verdict.
id.at.later the district court elaborated on the deference it gives to advisory jury verdicts well,i just wanted to make the point that whether it is advisory or,in fact,is the given decider is a distinction that i have never really depended on much.id.at.oci expressed its objection to the district court reliance upon the advisory jury verdict i understand that,your honor.and i would respectfully suggest that this case particularly calls for that distinction being made.i do think either side was particularly convinced that this was a great matter for a jury.id.pacificorp indicated it agreed with the district court view of the advisory jury verdict we feel very strongly,as i think you do,judge,that this was a jury trial.the fact issues are now decided.the fact issues are now behind us,and this verdict should be affirmed.id.at emphasis added.
in its subsequent order,the district court treated oci motion to set aside the verdict as a motion to amend the judgment under rule b and denied it.id.at.the district court explained that it 
treats an advisory jury with the same respect as it would any other jury that seriously considers a case and deliberates until it reaches a collective judgment.therefore,when this court chooses to adopt the advice of an advisory jury by entering judgment upon that jury verdict,judgment will be amended only if the advisory jury verdict would have been set aside even if it were not advisory.
id.at.the district court then stated 
the court has reviewed the record in this case with special attention to the testimony of michael rudoff,richard lissa,and paul radakovich.based upon this review,the court finds that there was substantial evidence adduced at trial to support the advisory jury verdict as adopted by the court when it entered judgment on that verdict.

almost two weeks later,the district court entered judgment in the case 
in this breach of contract action,plaintiff oci wyoming sought damages of over million from defendant pacificorp resulting from nine power outages allegedly caused by pacificorp breach of a service agreement between the parties.after a bench trial,an advisory jury,which had been duly impaneled under.a,found that defendant pacificorp had breached the service agreement and that plaintiff oci was entitled to total damages of resulting from three of the nine outages.the court entered judgment on this verdict in open court at the conclusion of the trial.citation omitted.oci subsequently moved to set aside the advisory jury verdict and this court denied the motion.
therefore,in accordance with the verdict of the advisory jury and with the previous entry of judgment on that verdict,the court finds that plaintiff oci is entitled to judgment in its favor.
it is hereby adjudged and decreed that defendant pacificorp breached its master electric services sic agreement with plaintiff oci.
it is further adjudged and decreed that plaintiff oci suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of three power outages april,november,and march.
it is further adjudged and decreed that plaintiff oci is entitled to damages of.
it is further adjudged and decreed that defendant pacificorp shall pay plaintiff oci court costs in the matter.
id.at bold in original.
oci challenges the district court judgment on both procedural and substantive grounds.procedurally,oci contends that the district court first erred when it impaneled an advisory jury under rule in the absence of a motion from one of the parties,and again erred when it adopted the
