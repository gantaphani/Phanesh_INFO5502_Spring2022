plaintiffs exxon mobil corporation and tosco corporation appeal the district court judgment affirming the interior board of land appeals ibla decision invalidating their unpatented oil shale mining claims.the ibla concluded that the claims were null and void because plaintiffs had failed to substantially perform the assessment work required by statute.we affirm.
background 
exxon has twenty and tosco has twelve unpatented oil shale mining claims located in the piceance creek basin in garfield county,colorado.exxon and tosco acquired these claims from their previous owners,who had located them prior to february,in accordance with the general mining law of.
that law,premised on a policy of encouraging exploration of valuable mineral deposits in the western united states provides that one who claims a mineral deposit is known as a locator and is required to perform a certain amount of work each year in prosecution of the claim site,known as the location.cliffs synfuel norton,cir.that annual work requirement,called assessment work,is described in the law as follows 
on each claim located after the day of may,and until a patent has been issued therefor,not less than worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year.
the mining law further contained a provision stating that if a claimant failed to perform the required assessment work for a period of time but later resumed such work before someone else asserted a claim to the same land,the original claimant did not lose his claim.this provision became known as the resumption doctrine 
u pon a failure to comply with these conditions,the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made,provided that the original locators,their heirs,assigns,or legal representatives,have not resumed work upon the claim after failure and before such location.

with the passage of the mineral leasing act in,congress completely changed the national policy over the disposition of oil shale lands.hickel oil shale,d.those lands were no longer open to location and acquisition of title but only to lease.id.the act contained a savings clause,however,which provided that oil shale claims in existence as of february,remained intact,and could pass into private ownership as before,as long as they were thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.thus,if one had a claim that existed prior to february,the claimant would not be required to lease the claimed land from the government,but could perfect title to it so long as the claim was maintained pursuant to pre law.cliffs synfuel,at.
with that general background in mind,we turn to the particular facts of plaintiffs claims.exxon twenty claims were located by its on december.exxon purchased those twenty claims and others on february,for.tosco twelve claims were located by its on december.tosco purchased them on april,for.
exxon filed a patent application for its claims in january.tosco filed its patent application in june.on june,the department of the interior doi determined that exxon had complied with the initial paperwork requirements of the mineral leasing act and issued first half of mineral entry final certificates fhfc s on july,doi issued fhfcs for tosco claims.issuance of those fhfcs relieved plaintiffs of the obligation to perform further assessment work.see silver crystal mines.doi continued to investigate the validity of the claims,however,and on may,the bureau of land management blm initiated a contest of exxon claims and on may,initiated a contest of tosco claims.
the two contest complaints were consolidated for a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the alj issued a decision on january,holding,inter alia,that plaintiffs claims were invalid because plaintiffs failed to comply substantially with the annual assessment work requirement of more specifically,the alj concluded that tosco had failed to perform the required assessment work on its claims for the years through,through,and through,with the exception that no assessment work was required for six of the claims in because a notice of intent to hold those claims was filed for that year.the alj found that tosco did satisfy the assessment work requirement for the years through.
the alj found that,with respect to exxon claims,annual assessment work was required from to,with the exception of.the alj concluded that assessment work had been done for each of exxon claims in,and,and that assessment work had been done for a period on approximately ten claims sometime between and.except for those time periods,the alj determined that no other assessment work had been done on exxon claims between and.exxon filed affidavits stating that it had performed assessment work for the years through,but the alj determined that it was road maintenance work.
exxon and tosco appealed the alj decision to the ibla.the ibla affirmed the alj decision,for substantially the same reasons as the alj.thus,the ibla concluded that plaintiffs had failed to substantially satisfy the assessment work requirement of 
plaintiffs sought review of the ibla decision in the federal district court.they argued that,which created the assessment work obligation,also included the resumption doctrine and that their asserted resumption of assessment work prior to the government challenge cured their prior lapse in assessment work.plaintiffs also argued that the doi own regulations at the time had recognized the resumption doctrine and that the government is estopped from retroactively denying them the benefit of those regulations.the district court rejected this argument.exxon mobil norton,d.the court further found that there was sufficient evidence in the record supporting the ibla holding that there was a substantial lapse in assessment work.finally,the district court rejected plaintiffs estoppel claim,as well as their arguments that their due process and equal protection rights were violated.it declined to rule on the alj decision regarding discovery.
plaintiffs appeal,arguing,as they did below,that,despite the of assessment work decades earlier,they resumed assessment work prior to the government challenge to the validity of their claims,in reliance upon two supreme court decisions and doi regulations following those decisions which a provided that such resumption preserved the validity of a claim and b until,provided that the united states had no interest in whether assessment work was performed at all.br.at.thus,they argue that the ibla decision violates due process and equal protection principles in view of settled law enunciated in unanimous supreme court decisions,interior regulations,and interior practices in patenting other oil shale claims with similar apparent lapses in work.id.plaintiffs also allege that doi failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that assessment work had not been done in prior decades and failed to establish that plaintiffs did not in fact substantially comply with the assessment work requirement.finally,they argue that doi erred in determining that certain road maintenance work performed by exxon was not qualifying assessment work that their performance of at least worth of work per claim satisfies the substantial compliance requirement and that the ibla decision was erroneously premised on the idea that the resumption doctrine no longer exists.

i n reviewing a district court review of an agency decision,the identical standard of review is employed at both levels and once appealed,the district court decision is accorded no particular deference.cliffs synfuel,at quoting valley camp of utah,babbitt,cir further quotation omitted.further,the administrative procedure act applies,under which

due protection 
plaintiffs first argument is that the ibla decision violated their due process rights by retroactively barring them from relying upon valid supreme court decisions and doi regulations following those decisions when they invoked the resumption doctrine to preserve their claims prior to the government challenge to the validity of those claims.as indicated,the general mining law of required o n each claim located not less than worth of labor or improvements each year.under the savings clause of the act,claims,like those of plaintiffs,located prior to the enactment of the act could be subject to patent and therefore private ownership rather than only leasehold if thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.
initially,the supreme court suggested that,while a claimant is required to perform the of annual assessment work,failure to do so does not ipso facto forfeit the claim,but only renders it subject to loss by relocation.wilbur united states ex rel.krushnic.however,the court stated that the law is clear that no relocation can be made if work be resumed after default and before such relocation.see also cliffs synfuel,at noting that even after the enactment of the mineral leasing act,an owner of a pre oil shale claim was under no obligation to perform the requisite assessment work on an annual basis so long as they were able to avail themselves of the resumption doctrine before the claim was relocated by a subsequent claimant citing krushnic,at.the court further suggested that the annual assessment work requirement was not necessary to preserve the possessory right as against the united states,but only as against subsequent relocators.so far as the government was concerned,failure to do assessment work for any year was without effect.ickes dev.quoting krushnic,at.thus,as of,it appeared that the united states had no interest in enforcing the assessment work requirement,and resumption of assessment work before a challenge could cure any default in the performance of such work.plaintiffs argue that they relied upon those decisions,and doi regulations following them,in failing to perform annual assessment work for decades.
as we observed in cliffs synfuel,t he court radically altered these two concepts in the leasing act effect on oil shale claims in hickel oil shale,d 
the court first rejected its earlier formulations that had declared the government to be a disinterested party,unable to assert rights to a oil shale claim upon which assessment work had been discontinued.it stated that if we assume,arguendo,that failure to do assessment work as provided in the act concerned at the time only the claimant and any subsequent relocator,the united states,speaking through the secretary of the interior,became a vitally interested party by reason of the act.
cliffs synfuel,at quoting hickel,at.as the hickel court further explained 
if we were to hold to the contrary that enforcement of the assessment work of was solely at the private initiative of relocators,the maintenance provision of becomes largely illusory,because relocation of oil shale claims became impossible after the act.so if enforcement of the assessment work requirement of were dependent solely on the activities and energies of oil shale relocators,there was no effective enforcement device.
in reviewing its prior decisions in krushnic and,the court in hickel largely confined them to their facts,agreeing with their specific holdings that every default in assessment work does not cause the claim to be lost.id.at.stating that d efaults might be the equivalent of abandonment,however,the court specifically held that token assessment work,or assessment work that does not substantially satisfy the requirements of,is not adequate to maintain the claims within the meaning of of the leasing act.id.characterizing the broad language of krushnic and as dicta,the court concluded that they must be confined to situations where there had been substantial compliance with the assessment work requirements of the act,so that the possessory title of the claimant,granted by,will not be disturbed on flimsy or insubstantial grounds.id.further,the court made it clear that upon default in the performance of assessment work,the united states was the beneficiary while the objective of the act was to open the lands to a beneficial use by some other party,once the original claimant defaulted,the defeasance inevitably accrued to the united states,owner of the fee.id.at.indeed,of the act makes the united states the beneficiary of all claims invalid for lack of assessment work or otherwise.id.at.
in cliffs synfuel,we discussed and applied hickel to a case very similar to this case.claimants in cliffs synfuel had performed assessment work from until and had resumed such assessment work from until,prior to any challenge by the united states,but no assessment work was performed during the period stretching from july,to september.cliffs synfuel,at.we explained our view of hickel as follows 
from the court statement that every default in assessment work does not cause the claim to be lost,it logically follows that in each case we must consider the quantum of the actual assessment work performed and the length of time the claimant failed to meet the annual assessment work required by the mining act of.
id.at quoting hickel,at.we compared the facts of hickel,where the court found the claimants had not substantially complied with the assessment work requirement,with those of krushnic and,where the court found the claimants had substantially complied with the assessment work requirement.noting that in hickel,a nnual assessment work had basically ceased prior to the as well as in the twenty years thereafter,as compared with the brief,defaults in krushnic and,we concluded that the facts in cliffs synfuel are decidedly more similar to the situation which confronted the court in hickel,rather than in krushnic or.id.at.we concluded that u nder these circumstances our decision is driven by the facts and reasoning set forth in hickel.id.
significantly,while we did not hold that the resumption doctrine is completely inapplicable to oil shale claims,we explained its limits the claimant in cliffs synfuel had argued that its resumption of assessment work in,after a period of inactivity,but prior to any challenge to the validity of its claim by the united states,had revived its claim.we held it did not 
on the basis of hickel teachings,we conclude that the years of inaction on appellee claims reflects token assessment work,or assessment work that does not substantially satisfy the requirements of therefore,in this case,the act makes the united states the beneficiary of all claims invalid for lack of assessment work or otherwise.
id.at quoting hickel,at.we went on to state 
in so concluding,we perforce reject appellee suggestion that its assessment work,which took place from through,offsets the previous years of dereliction and restores a legitimate right to the claims by constituting more than token assessment work.the short answer to this is that by appropriate analogy,this argument was rejected by the court in hickel when it noted that a lapse on assessment work might be the equivalent of abandonment applying the rationale of the court,we hold that prior to appellee default in doing the assessment work ma de the united states the beneficiary of all claim
