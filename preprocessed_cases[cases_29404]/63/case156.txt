apache bohai corporation and apache china corporation collectively apache appeal a judgment confirming an arbitration award in favor of texaco china texaco.apache argues that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by invalidating an exculpatory clause in the parties agreement and manifestly disregarded the law by awarding consequential and damages and by failing to apply mitigation principles to reduce the award.because the arbitration clause granted the arbitrator sufficient authority to consider the validity of the exculpatory clause,and because the arbitrator did not ignore any plainly governing principles of applicable law,we affirm.
in the texaco entered into production sharing contracts psc with the chinese national offshore oil corporation cnooc under which texaco agreed to explore,develop,and produce petroleum from blocks and in the bohai bay of china in exchange for a share of any petroleum produced.the psc divided the exploration period into three phases,each of which required drilling commitments from texaco.at the end of each phase,texaco had to elect either to relinquish its entire interest in a block or to continue exploring and relinquish only a portion of its interest.
texaco had until january,to make an election for block and until june,for block.to help meet its drilling commitments,texaco entered into two agreements with apache bohai in which apache agreed to assume texaco drilling commitments in return for a share of any future oil production.apache committed to drill three exploration wells one on each of blocks and and a third on the block of apache choice.
in january apache and texaco elected to enter the next phase of exploration on block.in march,apache proposed an area of block to be relinquished so that exploration on it could continue.on june,apache informed texaco that it was withdrawing from the agreements and would not drill any of the three wells.texaco had only sixteen days remaining to make an election on block and was saddled with the recently acquired drilling commitment on block.apache tendered its interest in the two blocks to texaco,although texaco demanded compliance and refused to accept the tender.
while searching without success for a replacement company,texaco secured two extensions of the election deadlines for block.during the extensions,texaco learned from cnooc that oil had been discovered on a block adjacent to block and that seismic data indicated that the oilfield extended onto block.in november texaco and cnooc negotiated a new deal with the following conditions the exploration well for block could be shifted to block a portion of block containing the oil field was shifted to block a extension was granted for texaco to decide whether to continue exploring block texaco released all remaining acreage of block if texaco chose to continue exploring block,it would not be forced to relinquish any further acreage.in december texaco accepted apache interest in the blocks so it could complete the new deal.
texaco initiated arbitration proceedings against apache as provided in the agreements the arbitrator determined that apache had fundamentally breached its commitment to texaco in reckless indifference to texaco interests.he invalidated the exculpatory clause as void under new york law and awarded texaco over million dollars,of which about million represented consequential damages for texaco loss of a interest in block,and about million represented direct damages for the cost of drilling the three wells apache was obligated to drill.the arbitrator did not reduce texaco recovery by any alleged gains texaco had received from the renegotiated deal with cnooc.the district court confirmed the award.
we review a district court confirmation of an award de novo,but the review of the underlying award is exceedingly deferential.brabham edwards sons,cir.we vacate an award only for certain statutory grounds,including where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,a,or under narrow common law exceptions,such as manifest disregard for the law or contrary to public policy.an award may not be set aside for a mere mistake of fact or law.id.
apache raises two principal arguments for vacation of the award.first,it contends that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by vitiating the exculpatory clause under new york law and awarding consequential damages in the face of the parties clear contrary intentions.second,it contends the arbitrator manifestly disregarded new york law by awarding consequential and damages and by failing to credit apache for texaco successful mitigation.
arbitration is a matter of contract the powers of an arbitrator are dependent on the provisions under which the arbitrators were appointed.brook peak int l,cir.where arbitrators act contrary to express contractual provisions,they have exceeded their powers.delta queen steamboat,cir.if the contract creates a plain limitation on the authority of an arbitrator,we will vacate an award that ignores the limitation 
where limitations on the arbitrator authority are uncertain or ambiguous,however,they will be construed narrowly.action,fid.guar,cir.a reviewing court examining whether arbitrators exceeded their powers must resolve all doubts in favor of arbitration.brook,at.in action industries,the contract precluded consequential damages in connection with installation,use,or failure of equipment but was silent as to damage limitations for design defects.finding the contract ambiguous,we upheld an award of consequential damages for a design flaw against a claim that the award exceeded the arbitrators powers.id.
the contracts contain a broad arbitration clause covering any dispute arising out of the contract,including any questions of validity.where parties have included broad arbitration clauses,we have upheld awards that invalidated contractual provisions.see dole ocean liner express.vegetable,cir.in dole,the agreement stated that a ny dispute,controversy or claim,arising out of or relating to this contract or a breach thereof,shall be finally resolved by arbitration.id.at.the arbitrator,relying on a mississippi clause,decided that the liquidated damages provision was unenforceable under mississippi law.in reviewing the claim that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by invalidating the provision,we concluded that because the determination of whether the liquidated damages provision was legally enforceable was left to the arbitration panel under the contract,the arbitrators did not exceed their powers by finding,as a matter of law,that it was void.id.at.
apache argues that the first seven words of the exculpatory clause,notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement,take the awarding of consequential damages out of the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.apache claims that this language creates a supremacy clause,meant to override all other contractual provisions,including the and arbitration clauses.thus,the arbitrator has no jurisdiction to consider whether new york law would vitiate the effect of the exculpatory clause,and he exceeded his powers by considering the issue 
apache seeks support in asoma seadaniel.the factual setting and analysis in that case are helpful,but not in support of apache claim.
in asoma,the parties had signed a limitation of liability clause providing as follows 
notwithstanding any other provision in this contract,any claims for damage or loss to cargo shall be governed by rules,and any other clause herein repugnant to the rules shall be null and void and of no force and effect as respect to cargo claims any arbitration clause in this contract shall not apply to claims for cargo loss or damage but such claims shall be brought in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,to which jurisdiction owners hereby consent.
id.at.the court observed that the provision removed the issue of cargo claims from the contract broad arbitration provision,so it refused to compel arbitration.id.at.notably,unlike the exculpatory clause under apache characterization,the contractual provision at issue in asoma was not primarily a supremacy clause,but a and clause.the parties in asoma carved out a set of claims and provided an alternative governing law and decisionmaker.asoma holding,that parties can restrict arbitral jurisdiction by designating alternate decisionmakers for subsets of claims,is in accord with a line of our cases regarding labor contracts.
in delta queen,we confronted a collective bargaining agreement that provided the company with the sole responsibility to discipline and discharge for proper cause.because the arbitrator had exceeded his mandate to determine whether the company had proper cause and had proposed to alter the disciplinary decision,we affirmed the district court vacation of that portion of the arbitrator decision.delta queen,at.later cases interpreting delta queen have echoed the following logic if an arbitrator is limited to determining whether an employer showed proper cause for dismissal,and authority to determine discipline is either vested in the company or is,the arbitrator exceeds his powers by fashioning an alternative discipline as in asoma,in the cases in which we found an arbitrator had exceeded his powers,he had intruded on an issue that was reserved for an alternative decisionmaker or was removed from anyone discretion under the contract 
in the exculpatory clause in the agreement there is no indication that the parties did not intend to arbitrate the validity of the exculpatory clause texaco and apache did not designate an alternate forum to determine the clause validity there is no indication that the parties contemplated any judicial involvement in the contract and neither party consented to any court jurisdiction.the agreement included a very broad arbitration clause covering any dispute arising from the agreement,including any question regarding its validity.
the face of the contract suggests that the parties intended to have the issue of the enforceability of the exculpatory clause handled by arbitration.given the requirement that limitations on an arbitrator authority must be plain and unambiguous and that we resolve all doubts in favor of arbitration,we will not read a clause that refers neither to arbitration nor to any other method of dispute resolution as precluding arbitral jurisdiction to consider the validity of the clause the arbitrator did not exceed his powers by considering the validity of the exculpatory clause under new york law.
contrary to apache assertion that this reading renders the exculpatory clause meaningless,we interpret notwithstanding any other provision to control the substantive terms of the contract rather than to designate a decisionmaker for questions of validity.it is a strained interpretation to suggest that the exculpatory clause language was evidence of the parties intention to have a different decisionmaker rule on consequential damages.
apache raises the alternative claim that the award of consequential damages fails to draw its essence from the contract.the essence test is an application of the inquiry into whether arbitrators have exceeded their powers it requires that the award must,in some logical way,be derived from the wording or purpose of the contract.kergosien,at citing executone info.davis,cir.under the essence test,the single question is whether the award,however arrived at,is rationally inferable from the contract.executone,at.
in section of the contract,the parties contemplated that they would be entitled to all remedies arising by law.once the arbitrator determined that the clause was unenforceable,there was no longer any barrier to awarding consequential damages where they are allowable under new york law this result is rationally inferable from the contract,so the award satisfies the essence test.
apache alternate ground for vacating the award is its claim that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law.we recognized manifest disregard for the law as a ground for vacating an arbitrator decision in williams cigna fin.advisors,cir p arties are bound by an arbitrator decision not in manifest disregard of the law citing first options,kaplan,d.judicial review under the manifest disregard standard is extremely limited,however,in line with our deference to arbitration as a favored method of settling disputes when agreed to by the parties.prestige ford ford dealer computer,cir.manifest disregard clearly means more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law.id.
as the supreme court has explained,
plenary review by a court on the merits would make meaningless the provisions that the arbitrator decision is final,for in reality it would almost never be final i t is the arbitrator construction which was bargained for and so far as the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different than his.
united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.although the court in that case was considering arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement and the labor management relations act,we have found its analysis and rationale applicable to our faa decisions and to an arbitrator interpretation of the law.see kergosien,at.
there are two steps in the analysis.first,the error must have been obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator.id.at.furthermore,the term disregard implies that the arbitrator appreciates the existence of a clearly governing principle but decides to ignore or pay no attention to it.id.the governing law must be,explicit,and clearly applicable.prestige ford,at.for the second step,before an arbitrator award can be vacated,the court must find that the award resulted in a significant injustice.kergosien,at.
the parties agree that,in accordance with the provision in their contract,the arbitration is governed by new york law.apache argues that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded new york law by awarding consequential damages in light of the exculpatory clause.the arbitrator found that clause unenforceable as against public policy because apache acted with reckless disregard for texaco rights intentionally abandoned the contract and breached a fundamental obligation of the contract.apache argues that none of these reasons is sufficient under new york law to find the exculpatory clause unenforceable.
p arties to a contract have the power to specifically delineate the scope of their liability at the time the contract is formed,and new york courts regularly enforce limitations on liability provisions.bd.of educ.sargent,webster,crenshaw folley.under announced new york public policy,however,limitations of liability will not apply to exemption of willful or grossly negligent acts.although the public policy was first announced in a series of cases considering delay clauses in construction contracts in two later cases the new york court of appeals considered its application outside that context.
in sommer fed.signal,that court considered an exculpatory clause in a contract that limited liability for any losses or damages caused by performance or of obligations imposed by this contract or by negligent acts or omissions.plaintiff had contracted with defendant to obtain monitoring service and sued after defendant had failed to report a fire signal.the trial court dismissed the case on summary judgment,concluding that the event was a misadventure that did not rise to the standard of gross negligence.the court of appeals concluded that there was a triable issue of fact and discussed the public policy standard as follows 
it is the public policy of this state that a party may not insulate itself from damages caused by grossly negligent conduct.gross negligence,when invoked to pierce an agreed upon limitation of liability in a commercial contract,must smack of intentional wrongdoing.it is conduct that evinces a reckless indifference to the rights of others 
the exculpatory clause can not restrict holmes liability for conduct evincing a reckless disregard for its customers rights.
p ublic policy precludes enforcement of contract clauses exonerating a party from its reckless indifference to the rights of others,whether or not termed gross negligence.
