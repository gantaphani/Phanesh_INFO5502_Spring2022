exxonmobil refining supply company exxon appeals a decision sending to arbitration a grievance filed by the paper,chemical and energy workers international union local on behalf of elizabeth salinas.we affirm.
in january,exxon transferred salinas to the clerical unit as a senior administrative assistant because her medical condition had caused her to become unable to perform the duties of her former instrument technician position.in late january salinas was sent home after being informed that exxon would no longer accommodate her medical restrictions in march she was notified that she would not be permitted to return to work.
that same month,the union filed a grievance alleging that her discharge was based on a disability discrimination.the union amended the grievance in april to allege a termination for unjust cause.
the union requested that the grievance be sent to arbitration because the termination violated article vi of the collective bargaining agreement cba,which provides that the employer may discharge and discipline employees for just cause.article xxi states that an unsuccessful grievance that involves an alleged violation of a specific provision of the cba must be submitted to arbitration 
exxon denied arbitration,contending that salinas was not discharged pursuant to article vi but instead received a disability separation necessary to receive disability benefits.the union then sued to enforce the arbitration provision of the cba.
the district court compelled arbitration,reasoning that on its face the claim that the termination was not for just cause is arbitrable.the court added that there was no evidence supporting exxon characterization of salinas discharge as a challenge to a disability determination,such as evidence that she had received a disability separation.
exxon appeals,contending that the district court erred by applying the rational mind standard of procedural arbitrability and ignoring most forceful evidence that the parties did not intend disability determinations to be subject to the arbitration provision of the cba ignoring evidence with respect to arbitrability from the renegotiation of the disability plan and ignoring the fact that the side agreement with respect to salinas superseded the cba and did not provide for arbitration.
we review de novo an order compelling arbitration.warehousemen helpers union local albertson,cir.therefore,we need not discuss exxon first issue on appeal,which is that the district court used the rational mind standard of procedural arbitrability instead of the standard for substantive arbitrability 
the courts role is very limited when deciding issues of arbitrability.oil,chem.atomic workers int l union,local chevron chem,cir.the court function is to decide whether the claim asserted is the type of claim the parties have agreed to arbitrate.id.in no way are the courts to consider the merits of a claim.id.rather,the court is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.united steelworkers of am.am,d.

with respect to its second issue on appeal,exxon relies on pac.northwest bell.commc ns workers of,cir,to argue that evidence of bargaining history can be most forceful evidence that a particular dispute is not arbitrable.in this circuit,however,evidence of bargaining experience can be introduced only where the contract language is ambiguous as to arbitrability 
accordingly,in this circuit the courts must construe the language of the contract as finally agreed upon in accordance with ordinary rules of construction without reference to the give and take of the bargaining sessions which produced the final terminology.otherwise we would abandon completely the parol evidence rule when dealing with this type of contract.nlrb gulf atl.warehouse,cir only where the contract claim and its relationship to the written contract is vague or unclear is such an inquiry permissible,and then not to alter or vary the plain meaning of the contract but merely to understand the exact setting in which it was consummated.
southwestern bell,at emphases added.
in southwestern bell,we expressly referred implicitly northwest bell inasmuch as it states that t he very nature of a collective bargaining agreement requires that it be read in the light of bargaining history.we noted that the courts must construe the language of the contract as finally agreed upon without reference to the give and take of the bargaining sessions and held that bargaining evidence can not be introduced when there is no doubt that the arbitration clause covers the dispute at issue 
in southwestern bell,we further explained that the union claim that operation of the retirement provisions of the company employee benefit plan infringed seniority rights protected by the cba was a claim which on its face is governed by the contract,and which obviously raised questions regarding the interpretation and application of a contract provision.id.additionally,we rejected the employer argument that it is but a subterfuge to characterize the union claim as arising under the seniority provisions of the contract,the claim actually being one under the employee benefit plan,and thus unless specifically designated.id.at.we noted that though the plan and its application certainly are incidentally involved in this dispute,the union claim is not predicated upon any denial of rights provided under the plan,but rather upon the alleged infringement of contract rights by its operation,which was,unquestionably an arbitrable issue.id.at emphasis added.
the union claim that salinas termination was for unjust cause is a claim that is arbitrable on its face because it requires interpretation of the cba article vi,providing that an employee can be discharged for just cause.also,as in southwestern bell,although the claim may implicate a benefit plan,it is not a disguised benefit plan claim,because the union claim is not predicated upon any denial of rights provided under the plan.rather,it is premised on the alleged infringement of contract by the plan operation or by discrimination if the plan was used as a pretext to discharge salinas.
in other words,salinas is claiming that her termination was not for just cause she is not asserting that it was unwarranted under the disability plan.therefore,her dispute is unambiguously arbitrable on its face,and evidence of bargaining history can not be introduced.
exxon nonetheless argues that,for two reasons,we should not rely on southwestern bell.first,it claims that southwestern bell was overruled by,communications workers of america,d.this argument is tenuous.
the majority opinion in that case,written by justice white for a unanimous court,did not address whether bargaining history can be most forceful evidence of an intent to exclude a dispute from arbitration.the issue instead was whether the court or the arbitrator should decide whether the dispute over the layoff provision was arbitrable.the court of appeals had held that whether the dispute over the layoff provision was arbitrable was an issue for an arbitrator to decide.the supreme court disagreed,explaining that absent an express clause in the contract that provides that arbitrability questions are to be decided by an arbitrator,the arbitrator can not decide the scope of his own jurisdiction.
thus,the holding of does not reach the issue of whether evidence of bargaining history can be most forceful evidence of an intent to exclude a dispute from arbitration.rather,the court expressly declined to reach the arbitrability issue,because the lower court,which had sent that issue to arbitration,had not ruled on it although the concurrence in did indicate that a dispute may not be arbitrable when the party opposing arbitration adduces the most forceful evidence to this effect from the bargaining history,id.at,the concurring justices did not go so far as to declare that extrinsic evidence can be introduced where the contract is unambiguous.
we find no indication in the supreme court caselaw cited by exxon that would allow introduction of most forceful extrinsic evidence even if the contract is unambiguous.the decision that introduced the concept of allowing most forceful evidence to demonstrate an intent to exclude a dispute from arbitration involved a vague not unambiguous provision.in that case,the management function clause purportedly excluded the dispute at issue from arbitration 
therefore,the discussion in warrior gulf of allowing introduction of extrinsic evidence does not address,at all,the issue of whether such evidence could be introduced when the contract is unambiguous.unlike in warrior gulf,there is no ambiguity in this case.
nor is there any clause in the cba,vague or otherwise,that would introduce any doubt as to whether disputes allegedly violating article vi are arbitrable.exxon rejected the union arbitration demand on the ground that arbitration of a claim with respect to salinas termination would violate article xvii a of the cba,which provides that the cba does not affect the eligibility of employees to participate in the benefit plans including the disability plan if this argument were correct,article xvii a would qualify as an express provision in the cba excluding certain types of grievances from arbitration and could render this dispute.
but this reasoning is illogical by its terms,the union could never arbitrate a discharge,such as a discharge for racial or other discrimination,because reinstatement of a discharged employee would make him again qualify for benefits,which would of necessity affect his eligibility to participate in the benefit plan.this would in effect nullify article vi.
furthermore,article xvii a does not mention arbitration.it is unlike the exclusionary clause at issue in southwestern bell,which expressly excluded claims relating to benefit plans from arbitration.it is also unlike the management function clause in warrior gulf.
last,as we explained in southwestern bell,the court in warrior gulf declined to address the issue of whether bargaining evidence could ever be admissible to show whether an issue was excluded from arbitration 
though some disagreement exists among the circuits on the admissibility of evidence of bargaining history to show whether an issue was excluded from arbitration,the rule in this circuit has been clear since the supreme court opinion in warrior gulf,where the majority,faced with having to determine whether an exclusionary clause prevented arbitration of a subcontracting grievance,refused even to mention bargaining history that showed repeated unsuccessful attempts by the union to secure contractual restrictions on subcontracting.
southwestern bell,at citations omitted.therefore,unless and until the supreme court addresses the issue of whether bargaining history is admissible to modify the terms of an unambiguous contract,southwestern bell is good and binding law in this court 
the second argument exxon makes in its attempt to minimize the precedential effect of southwestern bell is even more than is its reliance on the concurrence in.exxon contends that 
the fifth circuit characterized southwestern bell limited exception to the rule as dictum,and rejected the company arbitrability argument,in part,because it offered no extrinsic evidence such as bargaining history to support its interpretation.ibew western electric,former cir.
emphasis added.
but,as is evident from a reading of southwestern bell,the dictum there regards the permission to introduce bargaining evidence when the contract is ambiguous,not the prohibition to introduce such evidence when the contract is unambiguous 
only where the contract claim and its relationship to the written contract is sic vague or unclear is such an inquiry into bargaining history permissible,and then not to alter or vary the plain meaning of the contract but merely to understand the exact setting in which it was consummated but this narrow exception to the general rule of exclusion is not operative here,where both the nature of the union claim and the meaning of the collective agreement are evident 
southwestern bell,at footnote omitted.
this court in southwestern bell had in fact actually held that evidence of bargaining history is not admissible where the contract is unambiguous,which is precisely the issue here.therefore this could not have been dictum regardless of how we described it in western electric accordingly,exxon attempt,at oral argument and in its reply brief,to characterize southwestern bell as inapposite is misguided.
furthermore,in western electric we did not address southwestern bell holding,but only its dictum that allowed introduction of bargaining evidence when the contract was ambiguous.in western electric,the employer conceded that the dispute over each of the forty employees classifications was arbitrable,yet the employer contended that the use of the term an employee manifested an intent to submit to arbitration only issues involving one employee at a time,not an intent to submit to group arbitration.we explained that the contract did not unambiguously provide the interpretation that the employer suggested we stated that if the company intended the words an employee to have such an effect,it had to make its understanding much clearer than this.western,at.
therefore,there was an ambiguity as to the effect of the term an employee.we then noted that although the dictum in southwestern bell allows introduction of evidence of bargaining history when the contract is ambiguous,the employer in that case did not introduce any such evidence.id.at.thus,absent any extrinsic evidence against arbitration,and given the presumption in favor of arbitrability,we resolved the doubt in favor of arbitration.
western electric is thus inapposite not only because it did not reject southwestern bell,but also because,as in the southwestern bell dictum,it allowed introduction of bargaining history and other extrinsic evidence where the contract was ambiguous.in contrast,the contract here unambiguously covers disputes relating to the interpretation of the just cause discharge provision of the cba.
last,exxon argues that nlrb priester son,cir,also supports its argument in favor of allowing the introduction of bargaining evidence.that decision,however,is not inconsistent with either the holding or the dictum in southwestern bell.in that case,as exxon admits,we upheld the nlrb affirmation of an alj reliance on extrinsic evidence to shed light on an ambiguous cba provision.exxon reply br.at emphasis added.again,unlike the contract in this case,the contract there was ambiguous,so introduction of bargaining evidence was permissible under the dictum in southwestern bell.most importantly,that case did not address whether the introduction of bargaining history would be permissible if the contract were not ambiguous.
other courts,as well,have held that unless the cba provides instances of what constitutes just cause and expressly provides that discharges based on those instances are not arbitrable,the question whether an employee was discharged for just cause is arbitrable.where the cba prohibits discharge of regular employees except for just cause,and does not define just cause,and where the cba authorizes the arbitrator to resolve disputes concerning the interpretation or application of its terms,it remains for the arbitrator to determine whether a discharge was for just cause.first supermarkets,retail,wholesale chain store food employees union local,cir.if the employer wished to have an unquestionable right to discharge an employee for any specified conduct,it needed to negotiate for recognition of that right in the cba.id.at
