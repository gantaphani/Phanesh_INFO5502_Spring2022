wah chang,a division of tdy industries,a california corporation,appeals the district court dismissal of its actions against duke energy trading and marketing,avista corporation,and a multitude of other companies all hereafter referred to as the energy companies.wah chang,whose complaints arise out of the energy crisis of,seeks to recover damages because of the difference between the rate it was actually charged for electricity,which was a retail rate based upon the wholesale rate,and the rate that it claims a fair rate would have been were it not for manipulation of the market by the energy companies and others.like the actions of those who have come before it,wah chang actions must fail.we affirm.
background 
as pled by wah chang it purchased electricity for its plant in oregon at retail from pacificorp,a purchaser of electricity in the wholesale spot market.under its purchase contract,wah chang rates were indexed to the wholesale spot market price at the border so that price changes in that market were passed on to wah chang.
during the energy crisis,the wholesale price of electricity increased substantially and so too did wah chang costs.it asserts that the reason for the change was rates that were artificially increased by the energy companies through their anticompetitive and fraudulent manipulation of the wholesale markets,which affected customers,like wah chang,who purchased power in the pacific northwest market.of course,the rates in question were,as a matter of law,a result of tariffs approved by the federal energy regulatory commission under its rate setting approach.we have described the nature of that approach in our prior forays into this territory.see,pub.util.dist.of snohomish county dynegy power,cir lockyer,at.suffice it to say that its legal effect is the same as the effect of any other tariff set by ferc.see,snohomish county,at pub.util.dist.of grays harbor county idacorp,cir dynegy,at.because of that,the district court dismissed these actions.wah chang appealed.

discussion 
while the problems arising out of the energy crisis were serious and even scandalous,we have often discussed them at length.moreover,we have analyzed the approach and have,effectively,said that the claims of those who have come before us must be presented to ferc.thus,we have turned away purchasers of electricity when they have attempted to bring a direct federal rate action against sellers in the position of the energy companies.see grays harbor,at dynegy,at.we have done so on the basis of a number of doctrines,including the filed rate doctrine.
that doctrine is a form of deference and preemption,which precludes interference with the rate setting authority of an administrative agency,like ferc.see dynegy,at.it is a far reaching doctrine.as we have explained 
at its most basic,the filed rate doctrine provides that state law,and some federal law antitrust law,may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.the doctrine applies to rates charged by railroads,natural gas companies,and other interstate operators over whom federal agencies have exclusive power to set rates.more relevant here,the supreme court has extended the doctrine to the federal power act and to electricity rates.
as further developed,the filed rate doctrine has prohibited not just a state court or a federal court applying state law from setting a rate different from that chosen by ferc,but also from assuming a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by ferc.
transmission agency of cal.sierra pac.power,cir tanc citations omitted see also.gas hall,d speculation on what commission might have done is prohibited.and,as we have explained,the doctrine applies to the tariffs and rates in question here,even if they were not set in the traditional way.see snohomish county,at lockyer,at grays harbor,at dynegy,at.
the filed rate doctrine fortification against direct attack is impenetrable.it turns away both federal and state antitrust actions it turns away racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act actions it turns away state tort actions and it even turns away state attempts to assert sovereign power to commandeer power contracts in short,it turns away attempts like wah chang,which necessarily hinge on a claim that the ferc approved rate was too high and would,therefore,undermine ferc tariff authority through the medium of direct court actions against the energy companies 
but,argues wah chang,its actions differ from others we have considered because it did not directly purchase wholesale power.rather,it was a retail customer.that is an asthenic distinction at best.if we do not have a retail customer case on all fours with this one,we do have a case standing on three legs,with the fourth just a millimeter off the ground.we have considered a situation where direct retail residential and commercial customers of a utility sued it and its ferc regulated pipeline subsidiary for alleged antitrust violations.county of stanislaus,at.we determined that all of the customers claims challenged a rate that a federal agency ferc has reviewed and filed.id.at.the claims were,therefore,barred by the filed rate doctrine.id.at.wah chang claims amount to the same thing.try as it may,wah chang can not avoid the fact that it seeks what amounts to having the courts determine what rates the energy companies should have charged instead of the rates they did charge.wah chang would inevitably drag the courts into a determination of what rate would be fair and proper.that is precisely what wah chang can not do.see tanc,at holding that courts can neither set a rate different from that set by ferc nor assume a different hypothetical rate.
wah chang attempts to reinforce its faltering attack on the filed rate fortress by rushing in snippets from various opinions,but those troops are not up to the task assigned to them.for example,wah chang points to the exception for antitrust actions by competitors but ignores the fact that we have not extended that exception to a customer which it admits it is.and,wah chang argues,the doctrine was originally designed to prevent price discrimination among customers which it perceives no danger of here,but,even if its own perception is not obscured,it ignores the fact that an exceedingly strong prop for the doctrine is preservation of the exclusive role of the regulatory agencies wah chang actions would undermine that role.still,wah chang says,it will not have a separate right of action for damages if it does not have this one but lack of a damage remedy is not determinative we will not speculate about other possible remedies against or involving those from whom wah chang actually purchased electricity.
wah chang does point to a case allowing relief where sham protests were filed with an agency in order to delay rate requests by the plaintiff but neither the rates ultimately adopted by the agency nor its own procedures were in question that case avails wah chang nothing it is far removed from the rate claims made here.
finally,wah chang ululates about ferc lax oversight,but laxness does not indicate,much less establish,that wah chang can turn directly to the courts for rate relief.see square d,at.at lockyer,at.to permit it to do so would make the vices suppressed by the filed rate doctrine recrudescent.
in fine,none of these added points overcomes,or even seriously undermines,the fact that what wah chang seeks against the energy companies is a deviation in its favor from the wholesale power rates that wah chang,by its own hypothesis,wound up being charged with 
conclusion 
there may well have been a shadow of wrongdoing brooding over the pacific northwest wholesale power market,but wah chang can not succeed in this forum.the filed rate doctrine bars its action just as it has barred the similar actions brought by other vic
