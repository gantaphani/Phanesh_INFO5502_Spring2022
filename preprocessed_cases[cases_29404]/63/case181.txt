the primary issue on appeal is whether claimants who suffered no physical damage to a proprietary interest can recover for their economic losses as a result of a maritime allision.fourteen businesses and business owners brought claims under the general maritime law,the oil pollution act of opa,the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,and state law.the appellants filed motions for partial summary judgment to dismiss these claims,which the district court denied.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
on june,the barry and its tow,the kirby,allided with the louisa bridge in mary parish,louisiana.kirby inland marine,kirby inland owned the barge taira lynn marine,taira lynn owned and operated the tug and the louisiana department of transportation and development the state owns the bridge.the cargo on the barge,a gaseous mixture of,discharged into the air as a result of the allision.consequently,the louisiana state police ordered a mandatory evacuation of all businesses and residences within a certain radius of the louisa bridge.
taira lynn initiated the underlying litigation under the limitation of liability act,app,in which several hundred claims were filed.the original proceeding also consolidated two declaratory judgment actions involving insurance coverage issues.fourteen businesses and business owners collectively,claimants that are parties to this appeal filed claims in the limitation action seeking to recover damages under the general maritime law,opa,cercla,and state law.
because of the complexity of the case,the district court referred discovery to the magistrate judge who limited the initial phase of discovery to the claims alleging solely economic loss.taira lynn,kirby inland and the state then filed motions for partial summary judgment on the grounds that claimants recovery for economic losses unaccompanied by damage to a proprietary interest is barred by louisiana ex rel.guste testbank,cir en banc.those claims alleging direct property damage personal injury as well as economic loss were not included in the motions.
the district court concluded that it was foreseeable that an allision between a barge and the louisa swing bridge would disrupt the only means of ingress and egress to cypremore sic point.in re taira lynn marine limited,d.reasoning that the claims were confined to a limited geographic region and that claimants were making commercial use of the bridge,the court endorsed a geographic exception to the rule barring recovery for economic losses absent physical damage and concluded that the claimants alleging solely economic losses should have an opportunity to present their claims in court.id.at.the court concluded that not all of the claimants alleged purely economic losses and thus,those claims survived the motion for summary judgment.accordingly,the court denied the motions for partial summary judgment as to each of the fourteen claimants.the court also concluded that the opa and cercla claims were not ripe for summary judgment because they raised genuine issues of material fact and were outside of the scope of discovery.taira lynn,kirby inland,the state,and water quality insurance syndicate collectively,appellants appeal the district court rulings.the district court certified the judgment as appealable pursuant to b and this court granted permission to appeal.
before we address the claims at issue,we find it necessary to emphasize what is not before us.appellants motion for summary judgment did not include claims involving personal injury,physical damage,or the claims of commercial fishermen.thus,the only claims before this court are claims for purely economic losses.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court summary judgment decision de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.am.home assurance united space alliance,cir.a summary judgment motion is properly granted only when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the record indicates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citing.c celotex catrett,d.
iii.claims pursuant to general maritime law 
applicable law 
it is unmistakable that the law of this circuit does not allow recovery of purely economic claims absent physical injury to a proprietary interest in a maritime negligence suit.in robins dry dock repair flint,the supreme court held that a tortfeasor is not liable for negligence to a third person based on his contract with the injured party.in louisiana ex.rel.guste testbank,cir en banc,this court concluded that robins is a pragmatic limitation on the doctrine of foreseeability.we reasoned that i f a plaintiff connected to the damaged chattels by contract can not recover,others more remotely situated are foreclosed a fortiori.at.accordingly,we reaffirmed the rule that there can be no recovery for economic loss absent physical injury to a proprietary interest.id.
summary of the claims 
because of the number of parties involved in this appeal,we find it helpful to briefly summarize the underlying claims.cajun wireline,cajun,a full service slick wireline provider,claims that three of its jack up boats could not perform their duties due to the allision and subsequent evacuation.coastline marine,coastline,a pile driving business,claims it was unable to perform work on its contracts as a result of the evacuations.pam dore,doing business as cove marina cove marina,claims loss of revenues and sales from a convenience store as a result of the evacuation.legnon enterprises legnon claims lost charter revenues and lost sales and revenues due to the evacuation.coy reeks,doing business as riverfront seawalls and bulkheads riverfront,claims he had to leave his equipment on the island during the evacuation and as a result could not work for one week.twin brothers marine twin brothers,a fabrication and dock facility,claims it was forced to halt work in progress for two construction projects.marine turbine technologies mtt claims that it suffered physical damage in the form of toxic gas permeation on its property.north american salt salt company north american claims it had to suspend operations due to the discharge of the gas into the air.morton international morton claims it began to shut down operations before the evacuation order was issued and that its wholly owned subsidiary,cvd incorporated rohm haas advanced materials advanced materials,suffered physical damage.advanced materials is a chemical vapor deposition facility that manufactures material used to make specialty lenses for military equipment and other purposes.it claims that two of its manufacturing runs had to be prematurely terminated and the company lost the materials in those runs and could not sell the products.big d seafood big d,blue gulf seafood,blue gulf,and bagala quality oysters bagala claim lost revenues from their wholesale fishing operations.mason seafood mason claims it lost boxes of dressed crabs that spoiled in a freezer when law enforcement officials shut off the electricity during the evacuation.
claimants alleging no physical damage 
the district court concluded that cajun,coastline,cove marina,legnon,riverfront,and twin brothers suffered no physical damage however,the court endorsed a geographic exception to the testbank rule and concluded that the claimants should have the opportunity to prove that their damages were foreseeable and proximately caused by the allision.the court concluded that blue gulf,big d and bagala either suffered physical damage or satisfied the commercial fishermen to testbank,and denied summary judgment as to those claims as well.the district court concluded that mtt and north american claims of physical damage in the forms of the presence of gas on their properties satisfied testbank accordingly,it denied summary judgment.the court also concluded that morton,along with advanced materials,satisfied the physical damage requirement.advanced materials claims are addressed below.
appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motions for partial summary judgment because these claimants did not suffer physical damage to a proprietary interest,and thus,their claims for economic loss are barred by our decision in testbank.claimants make several arguments in support of the district court denial of summary judgment.cajun,coastline,cove marina,legnon,riverfront and twin brothers argue that their claims should be subject to traditional cause evaluations,asserting that their businesses are located in close proximity to the accident site and that they all worked resided within the evacuated area.they also argue that this case is distinguishable from testbank because that case involved lawsuits,whereas here,fourteen claims are the subject of these motions for summary judgment.blue gulf and big d argue they sustained physical impact and damage from the allision and that they had to destroy or decontaminate their products and equipment.north american and mtt allege they suffered physical damage because the gaseous cargo became physically present on their properties.north american and claim that they shut down operations in order to prevent damage to their equipment and products.
contrary to the district court conclusion,twelve of the fourteen businesses that are parties to this appeal suffered no physical damage attributable to the allision and thus,their claims are barred by testbank.there is no geographic exception to the testbank rule and there is no exception based on the number of claimants.the testbank court expressly rejected the approach urged by claimants,and adopted by the district court in the case at bar.in reserve mooring american commercial barge line,llc,cir,this court reversed the district court conclusion that testbank is merely an application of the general requirement that damage be foreseeable to be recoverable in tort,and concluded that physical injury to a proprietary interest is a prerequisite to recovery of economic damages in cases of unintentional maritime tort.additionally,as we explained above,bagala,big d and blue gulf claims,if any,as commercial fishermen were not included in the motions for partial summary judgment only their claims as wholesale fishermen were included.accordingly,the district court erred in concluding that these claimants satisfied the commercial fishermen exception to testbank.their claims are for economic losses from their wholesale operations,and thus,they are barred by testbank.while other jurisdictions may have abandoned or relaxed the bright line rule of robins and testbank,this circuit has not retreated from testbank physical injury requirement,reserve mooring,at.therefore,the district court erred in denying appellants motions for partial summary judgment as to cajun,coastline,cove marina,legnon,riverfront,twin brothers,blue gulf,big d and bagala.these claimants have not suffered physical damage therefore,their claims are barred by our decision in testbank.
likewise,the district court erred in concluding that mtt,north american,and morton suffered physical damage sufficient to satisfy testbank.mtt and north american arguments that the physical presence of the gas on their property satisfies testbank physical damage requirement are unpersuasive.these claimants have not raised an issue of fact as to whether the gas physically damaged their property nor caused any personal injury indeed,as noted above,such claims were not subjects of appellants motions for partial summary judgment.nor are we persuaded by north american and morton arguments that they mitigated damages by shutting down their operations.
in corpus christi oil gas zapata gulf marine,cir,an allision between a barge and a platform damaged a gas riser,owned by houston pipeline company,which was connected to the platform owned by corpus christi.realizing the allision was about to occur,workers on the corpus christi platform shutdown operations to prevent fire or explosion.during the two weeks it took to repair houston pipeline gas riser,corpus christi flared gas to prevent loss of its wells.this court concluded that e xcept for its acts in mitigation,corpus christi would have suffered great physical damages to its wells.id.at.accordingly,the court affirmed the district court award of damages for the costs incurred in flaring the gas.id.nevertheless,the court disallowed corpus christi damages resulting from the inability to produce and sell its gas during the repair period,reasoning that t he additional economic losses that corpus christi seeks to recover occurred solely and only because of the physical damage that was done to houston property,and that corpus christi lost its gas sale profits because it could not use the pipeline,not because it was flaring its own gas.id.unlike the plaintiffs in corpus christi,north american and morton did not lose any of the salt in their mines and they are not claiming costs of mitigation.instead,their claims are for lost revenues caused by the inability to use their facilities such claims are not recoverable.see id.at.accordingly,the district court erred in denying appellants motions for partial summary judgment as to mtt,north american,and morton.
finally,we note that claimants may not recover under state law.see robert lee ss,cir maritime law specifically denies recovery to non proprietors for economic damages.to allow state law to supply a remedy when one is denied in admiralty would serve only to circumvent the maritime law jurisdiction,supplemented by,cir.these twelve claimants have simply not raised an issue of fact as to whether their economic losses resulted from physical damage to their proprietary interests.accordingly,the district court erred in denying appellants motions for partial summary judgment.
claimants alleging physical damage 
as noted above,mason and advanced materials claim to have suffered physical damage.mason claims it lost boxes of dressed crabs that spoiled in a freezer when law enforcement officials shut off the electricity during the evacuation.advanced materials claims that two manufacturing runs had to be prematurely terminated and the company lost the materials in those runs and could not sell the products.the district court concluded that mason and advanced materials damages met the physical damage requirement of testbank.appellants argue that even if mason and advanced materials suffered damage,the damage was not directly caused by the allision and was unforeseeable.accordingly,they contend the district court erred in denying their motions for summary judgment as to these claims as well.mason and advanced materials argue that their damages were foreseeable and that foreseeability should not be determined on a motion for summary judgment.
contrary to the district court conclusion,neither of these claimants suffered physical damage as a result of the allision.mason crabs spoiled because the electricity was turned off during the evacuation,not because of contact with the barge,the bridge,or the gaseous cargo.likewise,advanced materials claims losses from its inability to sell products that were in the process of being manufactured it is not claiming that its property was damaged as a direct result of the allision.claimants reliance on consolidated aluminum bean consolidated i,cir is misplaced.there,a dredge struck and ruptured a pipeline,which caused a reduction in gas pressure and supply to consolidated power plant.we held that testbank did not bar recovery because consolidated suffered physical damage to its equipment.id.at.unlike the circumstances presented in consolidated i,here,the allision did not physically cause the disruption in electrical power nor did it physically impact advanced materials facilities.accordingly,advanced materials and morton have not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they suffered physical damage to a proprietary interest as a result of the allision.
moreover,even if we were to conclude that mason and advanced materials inability to sell their products qualified as physical damage for purposes of testbank,they would not be entitled to recover because their damages were not foreseeable.in consolidated aluminum bean consolidated ii,cir,we stated 
we perceive a harm to be the forese
