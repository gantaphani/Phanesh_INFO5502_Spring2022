in this case,we decide whether a texas court has personal jurisdiction over an company accused of violating the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta by acting as the transferee of texas oil and gas interests.we hold that,under the facts of this case,the defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of the texas courts and,therefore,reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand for trial.
retamco operating,roi,a texas corporation,sued paradigm oil,paradigm,another texas corporation,in a texas district court,over unpaid royalties related to oil and gas interests in several texas counties.after a finding of discovery abuse,sanctions were assessed against paradigm and the trial court entered a million default judgment against paradigm following this interlocutory judgment,roi amended its petition to include a claim against republic drilling company republic,a california corporation,for violation of the uniform fraudulent transfer act.see.bus.roi claimed that during the pendency of the litigation,paradigm assigned to republic a interest in paradigm oil and gas wells and leases in fayette county and a interest in an option to acquire an interest in a lease in dimmit and webb counties roi alleged that these transfers were fraudulent,and that they led to paradigm insolvency,rendering it unable to satisfy roi claims.
in response to the amended petition,republic filed a special appearance,arguing that it does not have minimum contacts with texas,and that even if it did,roi cause of action did not arise from or relate to those contacts.it also argued that the trial court assertion of jurisdiction offended traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.specifically,republic argued that because the allegedly fraudulent assignment of the texas leases occurred entirely outside of texas court did not have personal jurisdiction over republic.following a hearing,the trial court denied republic special appearance,making no findings of fact or conclusions of law.republic then filed an interlocutory appeal with the court of appeals.the court of appeals reversed,holding that republic is not subject to personal jurisdiction in texas.wl.because we conclude that by its actions republic subjected itself to the jurisdiction of texas courts,we reverse the court of appeals judgment.
under the texas statute,the plaintiff has the initial burden to plead sufficient allegations to confer jurisdiction.american type culture collection,coleman.the defendant seeking to avoid being sued in texas then has the burden to negate all potential bases for jurisdiction pled by the plaintiff.id.when,as here,the trial court does not make findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its ruling,all facts necessary to support the judgment and supported by the evidence are implied.bmc software belgium,marchand,citations omitted.here,roi has pled that republic is subject to personal jurisdiction because it is the fraudulent transferee of texas real and gas interests.republic does not dispute that the property at issue is located in texas or that it was transferred from paradigm to republic.however,republic argues that because the transaction causing the transfer occurred in california,jurisdiction is negated.for the reasons discussed below,we disagree.
personal jurisdiction is a question of law which we review de novo.id.at.texas courts may assert in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident if the texas statute authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction,and the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with federal and state constitutional guarantees.moki mac river expeditions drugg.
the long arm statute 
as an initial matter,republic argues that roi never fulfilled its initial pleading burden to bring republic within the reach of the statute,because roi alleged no acts that constitute doing business under the statute.but the texas statute broad language allows the statute to reach as far as the federal constitutional requirements of due process will allow.id.at citations omitted accord michiana easy livin country,holten,therefore,we only analyze whether republic acts would bring republic within texas jurisdiction consistent with constitutional due process requirements.see moki mac,at citations omitted guardian royal exch,english china clays,
due process constraints 
under constitutional analysis,personal jurisdiction is achieved when the nonresident defendant has established minimum contacts with the forum state,and the assertion of jurisdiction complies with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.moki mac,at quoting int l shoe washington.we focus on the defendant activities and expectations when deciding whether it is proper to call the defendant before a texas court.int l shoe,at.
a minimum contacts 
a defendant establishes minimum contacts with a state when it purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla,d citing int l shoe,at.the defendant activities,whether they consist of direct acts within texas or conduct outside texas,must justify a conclusion that the defendant could reasonably anticipate being called into a texas court.am.type culture collection,at citing volkswagen woodson,d.a nonresident contacts can give rise to either specific or general jurisdiction.am.type culture collection,at.general jurisdiction arises when the defendant contacts with the forum are continuous and systematic.id.at.specific jurisdiction,which is alleged here,arises when the defendant purposefully avails itself of conducting activities in the forum state,and the cause of action arises from or is related to those contacts or activities.burger king rudzewicz,d national indus.sand ass gibson.in a specific jurisdiction analysis,we focus on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.moki mac,at citing guardian royal,at.
purposeful availment 
we consider three issues in determining whether a defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in texas 
first,only the defendant contacts with the forum are relevant,not the unilateral activity of another party or a third person.second,the contacts relied upon must be purposeful rather than random,fortuitous,or attenuated.thus,sellers who reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens of another state are subject to the jurisdiction of the latter in suits based on their activities.finally,the defendant must seek some benefit,advantage or profit by availing itself of the jurisdiction.
moki mac,at internal citations and quotations omitted.additionally,the analysis is focused on the quality and nature of the defendant contacts,rather than their number.am.type culture collection,at.here,these considerations lead us to conclude that republic purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in texas.
republic contacts with texas were purposeful,not random,fortuitous,or attenuated.oil and gas interests are real property interests.renwar oil lancaster,state quintana petroleum,citing sheffield hogg.republic was aware that the oil and gas interests it received were located in fayette,dimmit,and webb counties,texas.thus,republic purposefully took assignment of texas real property.and while republic may not have actually entered the state to purchase this real property,j urisdiction may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically enter the forum state.burger king,at.so long as a commercial actor efforts are purposefully directed toward residents of another state,we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.republic,by taking assignment of texas real property,reached out and created a continuing relationship in texas.under the assignment,it is liable for obligations and expenses related to the interests.this ownership also allows republic to enjoy the benefits and protection of texas laws.michiana,at citing int l shoe,at.unlike personal property,republic real property will always be in texas,which leaves no doubt of the continui
