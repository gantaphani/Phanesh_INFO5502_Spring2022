the petroleum marketing practices act act limits the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or fail to renew a franchise relationship.typically,the franchisor leases the service station to the franchisee and permits the franchisee to use the franchisor trademark and purchase the franchisor fuel for resale.as relevant here,franchisees dealers filed suit under the act,alleging that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively terminate d their franchises and constructively fail ed to renew their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years,increasing costs for many of them.the dealers asserted these claims even though they had not been compelled to abandon their franchises,and even though they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.the jury found against the franchisor and assignee,and the district court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law.the first circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims,holding that the act does not require a franchisee to abandon its franchise to recover for such termination,and concluding that a simple breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a material change effectively ending the lease.however,the court reversed as to the constructive nonrenewal claims,holding that such a claim can not be maintained once a franchisee signs and operates under a renewal agreement.
a franchisee can not recover for constructive termination under the act if the franchisor allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise.
a the act provides that no franchisor may terminate any franchise,except for an enumerated reason and after giving written notice,a b,and specifies that termination includes cancellation,because it does not further define those terms,they are given their ordinary meanings put to an end or annul ed or destroy ed.thus,the act prohibits only franchisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise.the same conclusion follows even if congress used terminate and cancel in their technical,rather than ordinary,senses.this conclusion is also consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termination doctrine as applied in analogous legal contexts,employment law,see pennsylvania state police suders,where a termination is deemed constructive only because the plaintiff,not the defendant,formally ends a particular legal relationship not because there is no end to the relationship at all.allowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a franchise to end would ignore the act scope,which is limited to the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchisees,see a.this conclusion is also informed by important practical considerations,namely,that any standard for identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effectively ending a franchise,even though the franchisee continues to operate,would be indeterminate and unworkable.
b the dealers claim that this interpretation of the act fails to provide franchisees with protection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise ignores the availability of remedies to address such wrongful conduct.the court reading of the act is also faithful to the statutory interpretation principle that statutes should be construed in a manner that gives effect to all of their provisions,united states ex rel.eisenstein city of new york,because this interpretation gives meaningful effect to the act preliminary injunction provisions and its alternative accrual dates.
a franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim under the act.the act text leaves no room for such an interpretation.it is violated only when a franchisor fail s to renew a franchise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the required notice,see,and it defines fail to renew as a failure to reinstate,continue,or extend the franchise relationship,a franchisee that signs a renewal agreement can not carry the threshold burden of showing a nonrenewal of the franchise relationship,c,and thus necessarily can not establish that the franchisor has violated the act.signing their renewal agreements under protest did not preserve the dealers ability to assert nonrenewal claims.when a franchisee signs a renewal agreement even under protest there has been no fail ure to renew,and thus no violation of the act.the act structure and purpose confirm this interpretation.accepting the dealers contrary reading would greatly expand the act reach.

the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa or act,stat,et,limits the circumstances in which petroleum franchisors may terminate a franchise or fail to renew a franchise relationship.in these consolidated cases,franchisees brought suit under the act,alleging that a franchisor had constructively terminate d their franchises and had constructively fail ed to renew their franchise relationships.they asserted these claims even though the conduct of which they complained had not compelled any of them to abandon their franchises and even though they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.we hold that a franchisee can not recover for constructive termination under the pmpa if the franchisor allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise.additionally,we conclude that a franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor may not maintain a claim for constructive nonrenewal.we therefore reverse in part and affirm in part.
petroleum refiners and distributors supply motor fuel to the public through service stations that often are operated by independent franchisees.in the typical franchise arrangement,the franchisor leases the premises to the franchisee,grants the franchisee the right to use the franchisor trademark,and agrees to sell motor fuel to the franchisee for resale.franchise agreements remain in effect for a stated term,after which the parties can opt to renew the franchise relationship by executing a new agreement.
enacted in,the pmpa was a response to widespread concern over increasing numbers of allegedly unfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petroleum industry.see,comment,duke.the act establishes minimum federal standards governing the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum franchises.under the act operative provisions,a franchisor may terminate a franchise during the term stated in the franchise agreement and may fail to renew a franchise relationship at the conclusion of that term only if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the action in question for a reason specifically recognized in the statute.consistent with the typical franchise arrangement,a franchise is defined as any contract that authorizes a franchisee to use the franchisor trademark,as well as any associated agreement providing for the supply of motor fuel or authorizing the franchisee to occupy a service station owned by the franchisor.the act defines a franchise relationship in more general terms the parties respective motor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and responsibilities that result from the franchise arrangement.
to enforce these provisions,a franchisee may bring suit in federal court against any franchisor that fails to comply with the act restrictions on terminations and nonrenewals.see.successful franchisees can benefit from a wide range of remedies,including compensatory and punitive damages,reasonable attorney fees and expert costs,and equitable relief.see b,d.the act also requires district courts to grant preliminary injunctive relief to aggrieved franchisees,if there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits that present a fair ground for litigation and the balance of hardships favors such relief.b.
this litigation involves a dispute between shell oil company shell,a petroleum franchisor,and several shell franchisees in massachusetts pursuant to their franchise agreements with shell,each franchisee was required to pay shell monthly rent for use of the premises.for many years,shell offered the franchisees a rent subsidy that reduced the monthly rent by a set amount for every gallon of motor fuel a franchisee sold above a specified threshold.shell renewed the subsidy annually through notices that explicitly provided for cancellation of the rent subsidy with thirty days notice.marcoux shell oil prods.nonetheless,shell representatives made various oral representations to the franchisees that the s ubsidy or something like it would always exist.ibid.
in,shell joined with two other oil companies to create motiva enterprises llc motiva,a joint venture that combined the companies operations in the eastern united states,at.shell assigned to motiva its rights and obligations under the relevant franchise agreements.motiva,in turn,took two actions that led to this lawsuit.first,effective january,motiva ended the rent subsidy,thus increasing the franchisees rent,at.second,as each franchise agreement expired,motiva offered the franchisees new agreements that contained a different formula for calculating rent.for some but not all of the franchisees,annual rent was greater under the new formula.
in july,shell franchisees hereinafter dealers filed suit against shell and motiva in federal district court.their complaint alleged that motiva discontinuation of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract under state law.additionally,the dealers asserted two claims under the pmpa.first,they maintained that shell and motiva,by eliminating the rent subsidy,had constructively terminated their franchises in violation of the act.second,they claimed that motiva offer of new franchise agreements that calculated rent using a different formula amounted to a constructive nonrenewal of their franchise relationships 
after a trial involving eight of the dealers,the jury found against shell and motiva on all claims.both before and after the jury verdict,shell and motiva moved for judgment as a matter of law on the dealers two pmpa claims.they argued that they could not be found liable for constructive termination under the act because none of the dealers had abandoned their franchises in response to motiva elimination of the rent subsidy something shell and motiva said was a necessary element of any constructive termination claim.similarly,they argued that the dealers constructive nonrenewal claims necessarily failed because seven of the eight dealers had signed and operated under renewal agreements with motiva,and the eighth had sold his franchise prior to the expiration of his franchise agreement.the district court denied these motions,and shell and motiva appealed.
the first circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.in affirming the judgment on the dealers constructive termination claims,the court of appeals held that a franchisee is not required to abandon its franchise to recover for constructive termination under the pmpa.see,at.instead,the court ruled,a simple breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can amount to constructive termination under the act,so long as the breach resulted in such a material change that it effectively ended the lease,even though the franchisee continued to operate its franchise.at internal quotation marks omitted.turning to the dealers constructive nonrenewal claims,the first circuit agreed with shell and motiva that a franchisee can not maintain a claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the pmpa where the franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal agreement complained of.at.the court thus reversed the judgment on those claims.
we granted certiorari.see.
the first question we are asked to decide is whether a franchisee may recover for constructive termination under the pmpa when the franchisor allegedly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to abandon its franchise.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that a necessary element of any constructive termination claim under the act is that the franchisor conduct forced an end to the franchisee use of the franchisor trademark,purchase of the franchisor fuel,or occupation of the franchisor service station 
when given its ordinary meaning,the text of the pmpa prohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise.as relevant here,the act provides that no franchisor may terminate any franchise,except for an enumerated reason and after providing written notice.a b.the act specifies that t he term termination includes cancellation,but it does not further define the term terminate or the incorporated term cancel.we therefore give those terms their ordinary meanings.see asgrow seed winterboer.
the word terminate ordinarily means put an end to.webster new international dictionary ed.see also the random house dictionary of the english language.the term cancel carries a similar meaning to annul or destroy.webster,supra,at see also random house,supra,at to make void revoke annul the object of the verb terminate is the noun franchise,a term the act defines as any contract for the provision of one or more of the three elements of a typical petroleum franchise.thus,when given its ordinary meaning,the act is violated only if an agreement for the use of a trademark,purchase of motor fuel,or lease of a premises is put to an end or annul ed or destroy ed.conduct that does not force an end to the franchise,in contrast,is not prohibited by the act plain terms.
the same conclusion follows even if congress was using the words terminate and cancel in their technical,rather than ordinary,senses.when congress enacted the pmpa,those terms had established meanings under the uniform commercial code under both definitions,however,a termination or cancellation occurs only when a contracting party puts an end to the contract.ed.see also.thus,a franchisee who continues operating a franchise occupying the same premises,receiving the same fuel,and using the same trademark has not had the franchise terminate d in either the ordinary or technical sense of the word.
requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before claiming constructive termination is also consistent with the general understanding of the doctrine of constructive termination.as applied in analogous legal contexts both now and at the time congress enacted the pmpa a plaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship in order to maintain a claim for constructive termination.for example,courts have long recognized a theory of constructive discharge in the field of employment law.see pennsylvania state police suders,tracing the doctrine to the.to recover for constructive discharge,however,an employee generally is required to quit his or her job.see lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law ed.larson,labor and employment law eeoc compliance manual a suders,supra,at,young southwestern savings loan,muller united states steel.similarly,law has long recognized the concept of constructive eviction.see rapacz,origin and evolution of constructive eviction in the united states,depaul.the general rule under that doctrine is that a tenant must actually move out in order to claim constructive eviction.see,at glendon,the transformation of american law,boston college,tiffany,real property,ed.
as generally understood in these and other contexts,a termination is deemed constructive because it is the plaintiff,rather than the defendant,who formally puts an end to the particular legal relationship not because there is no end to the relationship at all.there is no reason why a different understanding should apply to constructive termination claims under the pmpa.at the time when it enacted the statute,congress presumably was aware of how courts applied the doctrine of constructive termination in these analogous legal contexts.see fitzgerald barnstable school,slip op,at.and in the absence of any contrary evidence,we think it reasonable to interpret the act in a way that is consistent with this body of law.
the court of appeals was of the view that analogizing to doctrines of constructive termination in other contexts was inappropriate because sunk costs,optimism,and the habit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the new arrangements work,even when the terms have changed so materially as to make success impossible.at.but surely these same factors compel employees and tenants no less than franchisees to try to make their changed arrangements work.nonetheless,courts have long required plaintiffs asserting such claims to show an actual severance of the relevant legal relationship.we see no reason for a different rule here.
additionally,allowing franchisees to obtain pmpa relief for conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would extend the reach of the act much further than its text and structure suggest.prior to,the regulation of petroleum franchise agreements was largely a matter of state law.see dersch energies,shell oil,comment,emory.in enacting the pmpa,congress did not regulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relationship but instead federalized only the two parts of that relationship with which it was most concerned the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship.see dersch energies,supra,at.congress left undisturbed regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchisees.see a only those state laws governing franchise terminations or nonrenewals.
the dealers would have us interpret the pmpa in a manner that ignores the act limited scope.on their view,and in the view of the court of appeals,the pmpa prohibits,not just unlawful terminations and nonrenewals,but also certain serious breaches of contract that do not cause an end to the franchise.see brief for respondents in,hereinafter respondents brief,at.reading the act to prohibit simple breaches of contract,however,would be inconsistent with the act limited purpose and would further expand federal law into a domain traditionally reserved for the states.without a clearer indication that congress intended to federalize such a broad swath of the law governing petroleum franchise agreements,we decline to adopt an interpretation of the act that would have such sweeping consequences.see,united states bass,
finally,important practical considerations inform our decision.adopting the dealers reading of the pmpa would require us to articulate a standard for identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effectively ending a franchise,even though the franchisee in fact continues to use the franchisor trademark,purchase the franchisor fuel,and occupy the premises we think any such standard would be indeterminate and unworkable.how is a court to determine whether a breach is serious enough effectively to end a franchise when the franchisee is still willing and able to continue its operations and how is a franchisor to know in advance which breaches a court will later determine to have been so serious the dealers have not provided answers to these questions.nor could they.any standard for identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts to a pmpa termination,when all three statutory elements remain operational,simply evades coherent formulation.
the dealers suggest that this interpretation of the pmpa fails to provide franchisees with protection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise.that argument,however,ignores the fact that franchisees still have remedies available to them.the scope of the pmpa is limited the act only those state or local laws that govern the termination of petroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum franchise relationships.see a.outside of those areas,therefore,franchisees can still rely on remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct that does not have the effect of ending the franchise.indeed,that happened in this very lawsuit.the dealers argued in the district court that motiva elimination of the rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their franchises in violation of the pmpa but also amounted to a breach of contract under state law.the jury found in their favor on their claims and awarded them almost million in damages.see app.thus,the dealers own experience demonstrates that franchisees do not need a pmpa remedy to have meaningful protection from abusive franchisor conduct.
the dealers also charge that this interpretation of the pmpa can not be correct because it renders other provisions of the act meaningless.respondents brief.while we agree that we normally should construe statutes in a manner that gives effect to all of their provisions,we believe our interpretation is faithful to this principl e of statutory interpretation.united states ex rel.eisenstein city of new york,slip,at 
to begin,the dealers insist that our reading of the term terminate will require franchisees to go out of business before they can obtain preliminary relief and thus will render useless the act preliminary injunction mechanism.we disagree.to obtain a preliminary injunction,it is true,a franchisee must show,among other things,that the franchise of which he is a party has been terminated.b a i emphasis added.but that does not necessarily mean that a franchisee must go out of business before obtaining an injunction.for example,in cases of actual termination,the act requires franchisors to provide franchisees with written notice of termination well in advance of the date on which the termination takes effect.a.a franchisee that receives notice of termination has been terminated within the meaning of b a i,even though the termination takes effect on a later date,just as an employee who receives notice of discharge can be accurately described as having been discharged,even though the employee last day at work may perhaps be weeks later.thus,franchisees that receive notice of impending termination can invoke the protections of the act preliminary injunction mechanism well before having to go out of business contrary to the dealers assertions,therefore,our interpretation of the act gives meaningful effect to the pmpa preliminary injunction provisions.
our interpretation also gives effect to the act alternative accrual dates.the limitations period governing pmpa claims runs from the later of either the date of termination of the franchise or the date the franchisor fails to comply with the requirements of the act.a.some violations of the pmpa,however,can not occur until after a franchise has been terminated.see,d franchisor must share with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation award when the termination was the result of a condemnation or taking d franchisor must grant a franchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was terminated due to the destruction of the service station and the station subsequently is rebuilt.the second accrual date listed in a,therefore,shows only that the limitations period runs from the date of these types of violations.it does not suggest that congress intended franchisees to maintain claims under the pmpa to redress franchisor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise.
we therefore hold that a necessary element of any constructive termination claim under the pmpa is that the conduct forced an end to the franchisee use of the franchisor trademark,purchase of the franchisor fuel,or occupation of the franchisor service station.because none of the dealers in this litigation abandoned any element of their franchise operations in response to motiva elimination of the rent subsidy they can not maintain a constructive termination claim on the basis of that conduct.
the second question we are asked to decide is whether a franchisee who is offered and signs a renewal agreement can nonethele
