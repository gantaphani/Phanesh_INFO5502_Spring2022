plaintiffs,and retail natural gas suppliers that market and sell natural gas to ohio consumers and one of their ohio customers,sued ohio tax commissioner,richard levin.they alleged that ohio tax scheme is discriminatory and thus unconstitutional under either the commerce clause or equal protection clause because four local natural gas distribution companies benefit from certain tax exemptions and exclusions that they do not benefit from,despite their similar situations.but the district court granted the commissioner motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,reasoning that,while the tax injunction act,did not bar plaintiffs claims,general principles of comity and federalism did.this latter conclusion was incorrect,and we therefore reverse and remand.
plaintiffs commerce energy,which does business as commerce energy of ohio,and interstate gas supply,are retail natural gas suppliers who market and sell natural gas to ohio consumers plaintiff gregory slone is an ohio citizen who purchases natural gas from these retail suppliers.the plaintiff gas suppliers compete with local natural gas distribution companies who market and sell gas to ohio consumers.these companies,unlike the plaintiffs,also own and operate distribution pipeline networks to deliver gas.while the plaintiff retail suppliers pay fees to use the distribution pipelines owned by the local gas distribution companies,the four local natural gas distributors are exempt from state and county sales and use taxes on their natural gas sales and instead pay a gross receipts excise tax that is lower than the taxes that retail suppliers pay.according to plaintiffs,ohio law also excludes these local distributors from commercial activities taxes on taxable gross receipts.finally,plaintiffs also challenge ohio tax provisions that exclude sales of natural gas between local distributors from gross receipts taxes that the plaintiffs are subject to when they purchase natural gas from the local gas distributors.
the plaintiffs sued under the declaratory judgment act,requesting that the district court declare these exclusions and exemptions unconstitutional and enjoin their application.the defendant tax commissioner responded by moving to dismiss these claims under.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court dismissed plaintiffs complaint,reasoning that general principles of comity and federalism barred their claims.plaintiffs appeal.

the first issue is whether the district court properly ruled that the tax injunction act did not bar plaintiffs challenges to the constitutionality of ohio natural gas taxation scheme.the act directs federal courts not to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.it thus deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to hear certain challenges to state tax schemes.california grace brethren church,d.in hibbs winn,d,the supreme court clarified the act scope and reach.the plaintiffs there had brought an establishment clause challenge to income tax credits that provided financial aid to children who attended private schools.id.at.the supreme court held that the act did not bar jurisdiction,and observed that for near a half century,courts in the federal system,including the supreme court have entertained challenges to tax credits authorized by state law,without conceiving of as a jurisdictional barrier.id.at.the court sharply distinguished such cases from those in which the act had barred claims,stating that the former a ll involved plaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes or to gain a refund of such taxes.relief,therefore,would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.id.at.in line with the act primary purpose of protecting state tax revenue,the hibbs court interpreted assessment to mean only the recording of liability of the taxpayer,and thus the act applies only to cases in which state taxpayers seek orders enabling them to avoid paying state taxes.id.at.as the district court correctly recognized,the act does not prevent third parties from pursing constitutional challenges to tax benefits in a federal forum.id.at.and,as with hibbs,the taxpayers here are who do not contest their own tax liability,id.at,and success on their claims would not reduce state tax income the relief they seek would increase the state tax revenue by eliminating some or all of the exemptions and exclusions.
the tax commissioner replies that if plaintiffs are successful then state tax revenues could theoretically decrease in the future because the natural gas distribution companies could possibly file a future lawsuit seeking to enjoin the imposition of other taxes,and,if that future lawsuit succeeded,tax revenues would decrease.this argument is strained,to say the least.indeed,we recently rejected it the act does not strip federal courts of jurisdiction over all claims that might,after this or that happens,have some negative impact on local revenues it strips jurisdiction over claims seeking to enjoin the collection of state tax revenue.bellsouth commc ns,farris,cir emphasis in original.it is thus not enough that there is some theoretical chance revenues might decrease due to a hypothetical future lawsuit hibbs tells us the act is more straightforward it applies only to cases in which state taxpayers seek to avoid paying state taxes where success would operate to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.hibbs,at.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that the tax injunction act does not bar plaintiffs claims.
notwithstanding the act,the district court went on to rule that principles of comity and federalism barred plaintiffs claims.these principles reflect a scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts and thus they sometimes bar federal challenges to state taxation where the act would not.fair assessment in real estate ass n,mcnary,d.in fair assessment,the supreme court addressed the comity principle applicability to suits bringing constitutional challenges to state tax laws under.although the question presented was narrow,fair assessment language was broad t axpayers are barred by the principle of comity from asserting actions against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts so long as plain,adequate,and complete state court remedies are available.id.at.
nevertheless,in hibbs,the supreme disapproving of fair assessment core that it has relied upon principles of comity to preclude original jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.hibbs,at.emphasis added citing fair assessment,at.thus,while the hibbs court did not extensively address comity,it is hard to square that decision with the district court expansive reading of fair assessment.
yet there is a circuit split.the district court heavily relied on directv tolson,cir,which,in dismissing a claim,rejected the idea that hibbs did anything to limit an expansive reading of fair assessment because the comity principle is broader than the act itself,and its scope is not restricted by.directv,at citing fair assessment,at.to the fourth circuit,the comity principle breadth was simply not before the supreme court in hibbs.id.at.
other circuits disagree.the seventh circuit,for instance,has reconciled these cases by holding that fair assessment can not bar each and every challenge to a state taxation scheme because hibbs restrict s comity to cases that could tie up rightful tax revenue.levy pappas,cir quotations omitted.levy explained 
when a plaintiff alleges that the state tax collection or refund process is singling her out for unjust treatment,then the act and comity bar the federal action,as in fair assessment.when a plaintiff alleges that the state tax collection or refund process is giving unfair benefits to someone else,then according to hibbs the act and comity ar
