background 
ryan is the liquidation agent for the class creditors in the confirmed chapter reorganization plan for the couba operating.as part of settlement negotiations in the bankruptcy case,couba agreed to assign certain leases to anec.anec in turn conveyed to ryan a net profits interest npi and an overriding royalty interest ori in a square mile area surrounding these leases,known as the area of mutual interest or ami.the parties settled their differences concerning the ori.the meaning of the npi conveyance is what remains.
concerning the npi,anec conveyed a npi to the oil and gas produced from existing wells on the leases a npi in production from new wells on the leases and a npi in production from new wells drilled in the ami.production periods are monthly.art.i production period.existing wells existed as of the effective date of the confirmed plan november,new wells are those drilled thereafter,art.i effective date,existing wells,new wells,plan ryan,wl,at.
anec refurbished and restarted production on five to seven existing wells,drilled fifteen new wells on the leases,and attempted two wells on the ami.ryan,wl,at.in determining amounts due the class creditors on the npi,ryan contends that costs and proceeds hence the npi should be calculated on a basis and without any carryforward of unrecouped direct costs.anec argues that costs should be allocated on a basis,aggregating all costs from existing and new wells,allowing carryforward of any unrecouped costs.aggregate costs would then be deducted from aggregate revenues,and net profit would occur only after all costs had been recouped.anec also maintains that million it spent to restore existing wells and evaluate the advisability of new drilling qualifies as a direct cost borne by the npi ryan contends that such costs are lease acquisition costs not properly borne by the npi.
the district court determined that the contract conveyance was ambiguous because it was susceptible to different interpretations as to net profits interest.id.at.accordingly,the district court considered extrinsic evidence.id.at.it also mentioned the rule of contra proferentem,and concluded that the conveyance should be construed against ryan and the class creditors as the drafters.id.the court determined that anec interpretation of aggregating and allocating costs on a basis should obtain because direct costs were broadly defined,such costs could not be separated on a basis,and such an interpretation was consistent with the underlying class creditors knew that for the net profits interest to pay,substantial development was necessary,and accordingly also took an overriding royalty interest for a more direct payoff.id.the district court also determined that anec million spent to restore old wells and evaluate drilling prospects qualified as direct costs,as there was no indication in the plan that anec would forego such treatment.id.at.
in addition to the different npi percentages based upon the type of well,the conveyance repeatedly distinguishes between new wells and existing wells insofar as payment and recordkeeping requirements,including a requirement of for costs,art.i direct costs accounts,art.i proceeds,ii.the district court determined that although were called for in the conveyance,they are only necessary in the event aggregate costs for all wells are recouped and profit results.ryan,wl,at.the would then be used to allocate net profits in accordance with the different percentages,for existing wells on leases,for new wells on leases,and for new wells drilled on lands located within the ami.id.the district court reasoned that because the are tied to the definition of new wells and existing wells,the do not support a calculation,with only profitable wells considered for payments.id.the district court also explained that monthly production and payment periods did not mean that costs can not be carried forward and aggregated because the conveyance allows for recoupment.id.
the district court concluded that all existing and new wells whether drilled on leases or the ami were a net profit system and profits only occur after anec recoups all system costs.id.at.it then determined that the system had as of october incurred a net loss of approximately million,after trimming the direct costs claimed by anec of million related to the couba acquisition.id.at.thus,anec has substantial costs reflected in a net loss of million as of october that it can recoup before paying ryan on the npi.on the other hand,ryan expert cpa,walter thomas,found that million was due to ryan based upon five profitable new wells that calculation was based upon revenues and expenses per well,not including field costs which he did not consider a direct cost.aplt.br.
after the judgment in anec favor,anec sought attorney fees pursuant to.stat.ann.tit,claiming that the lawsuit was a civil action to recover upon an open account or an account stated and it was a prevailing party.the district court denied the motion,holding that the conveyance was neither an open account nor an account stated.ryan,wl,at.
as framed by ryan,the merits appeal presents the following issues whether anec is allowed to recoup its entire aggregate costs of developing and operating the leases and ami acreage prior to paying any net profits to ryan and the class creditors whether it is not possible to separate certain expenses listed as direct costs,marketing,transportation of oil and gas,on a basis,whether anec was properly allowed to designate some million as a direct cost for the restoring of existing wells to production and evaluating the advisability of new wells,under the npi conveyance,and whether the npi conveyance should have been construed against ryan and the class creditors.we consider issue concerning ambiguity first and reach the others in turn.thereafter,we turn to the attorney fees appeal in which anec argues that the district court erred in holding that.stat.ann.tit,is inapplicable to this case given its unique facts.

standard of review 
we review the district court legal conclusions in a bench trial de novo findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.a salve regina coll.russell,d anderson city of bessemer city,d.the parties agree that oklahoma law applies,and that the conveyance is ambiguous.aplt.br.aplee.br.we pay deference to the district court findings based upon its observation of the testimony as well as documentary evidence.anderson,at.
where interpretation of an ambiguous contract is aided by extrinsic evidence,the resulting interpretation is factual and can not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.morrison knudsen ground improvement techniques,cir valley improvement ass n,fid.guar,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court has a definite and firm conviction that it is mistaken,even though there may be some evidence to support it.anderson,at.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,a finding adopting one of those views can not be clearly erroneous.see id.at.
initially,the parties seemed to agree that the clearly erroneous standard applies to the first three issues in this case because the court relied on extrinsic evidence to interpret an ambiguous conveyance.aplt.br.aplee.br.anec argues that the fourth issue,whether the conveyance should be construed against the drafter,and presumably the predicate question of whether a conveyance is ambiguous,is a legal issue.aplee.br.
by the time of the reply brief,ryan determined that all issues should be reviewed de novo because whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law and contract construction is a legal issue,according to oklahoma authority.we agree with the parties that whether a contract or provision is ambiguous is a question of law to be determined only with reference to the contract itself.see otis elevator midland red oak realty,cir lee constr.transp.in determining ambiguity,we look at the entire contract.pitco prod.chaparral energy.merely because the parties offer different interpretations of a contract does not make it ambiguous the relevant inquiry is whether the contract is reasonably susceptible to more than one construction such that reasonable persons could honestly disagree as to the meaning.otis elevator,at lee constr,at.once a contract provision is determined to be ambiguous,the trier of fact resolves its meaning,and the trier of fact construction ought not to be set aside unless clearly erroneous.otis elevator,at fowler lincoln county conservation.
although we find that the conveyance is ambiguous regarding aggregation and recoupment of costs,it is unambiguous concerning the need for allocating proceeds and costs to new wells and existing wells.though the process of allocating proceeds and costs as a practical matter is done,there must be aggregation of these amounts within the two categories prior to any payout of npi.thus,we reject the contention that only profitable wells within a category may be considered.accordingly,we will affirm the district court conclusion that costs must be aggregated and carried forward,but reverse its conclusion that all proceeds and costs are part of a net profits system.
the conveyance conveys a net profits interest in and to all of the oil and gas produced from the leases,if,as,and when oil and gas are produced during the terms of the leases.the net profits interest is a right to receive payments of proceeds,and does not represent a working interest or other participating interest,see also,the liquidation agent shall not be responsible for payment of any direct costs or any other costs of any nature.
a net profits interest is a interest that 
is similar to a royalty interest or an ori overriding royalty interest except that the amount to be received is a specified percentage of net profit from property versus a percentage of gross revenues from the property.the allowed deductions from gross revenues to calculate the net profit are usually specified in the lease agreement.while net profits interest owners are entitled to a percentage of the profits,they are not responsible for any portion of losses incurred in property development and operations.these losses,however,may be recovered by the working interest owner from future profits.
charlotte wright rebecca gallun,fundamentals of oil gas accounting ed.again,losses are the responsibility of working interest owners but may be recovered by the working interest owner from future profits.charlotte wright rebecca gallun,international petroleum accounting.
anec must pay by check an amount equal to the net profits interest payable with respect to the oil and gas produced from the leases during the current production period.production periods are monthly,art.i production period.payment dates are days thereafter,art.i payment date.the conveyance requires a detailed statement on or before each payment date clearly reflecting,for existing wells and new wells separately,proceeds,direct costs,credits and debits against the direct costs account for the production period,and the balance of the direct costs account as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding production period.anec is required to keep sufficient books and records to determine amounts payable to ryan on existing wells and new wells,including information relating to the calculation of proceeds,direct costs,the balance of the direct costs accounts.anec is also required to provide an annual report showing production,a computation of proceeds and direct costs,producing wells and wells completed during the calendar year,and classification of the wells as existing or new wells.
the conveyance defines net profits as proceeds reduced by direct costs,art.i net profits.proceeds applies to any production period and means gross proceeds from oil and gas sales from existing well and new wells,art.i proceeds.the definition also requires that proceeds from new and existing wells be determined separate and apart,art.i proceeds.
the direct costs definition also employs the distinction between new wells and existing wells.direct costs means for any production period,on the cash method of accounting,all little direct costs attributable to generating proceeds including the following costs attributable to the working interest of anec or its affiliates in existing wells or new wells,art.i direct costs.the definition then provides specific guidance as to what direct costs are 
i production and severance taxes,ad valorem taxes,royalties,overriding royalties,and other burdens upon production excluding the burden established by this agreement 
ii operating expenses incurred in accordance with the applicable joint operating agreement,or in the event no such joint operating agreement can be located,then those costs of operation set forth in the most recent version of the copas accounting procedures exhibit to the aapl model form operating agreement 
iii drilling and completion costs,and costs of plugging back,reworking,recompleting and plugging and abandoning after commercial production 
iv costs of marketing,transportation,and treatment of oil and gas.
art.i direct costs.
the direct costs accounts definition provides for separate to record direct costs for new and existing wells 
direct costs accounts means a sic bookkeeping accounts established by anec to record the aggregate amount of unrecouped direct costs attributable to the interest of anec or its affiliates in existing wells or new wells.direct costs for existing wells and new wells will be recorded in separate.each account shall have an initial balance of zero and shall be increased at the close of each production period by direct costs if any incurred during such production period,and shall be decreased at the close of each production period by the amount of net proceeds received from the sale of oil and gas during such production period.the balance of the direct costs account shall never be less than zero.
art.i direct costs accounts.thus,the conveyance endeavors to spell out how the npi should be calculated.see wright gallun,fundamentals of oil gas accounting the calculation of net profits,the allowed deductions from gross revenue to compute net profit,should be clearly indicated in the contract.
the district court determined that the conveyance is ambiguous as to the proper calculation of npi because certain provisions suggest that all costs must be recouped before any net profits are recoverable,and others suggest that costs can not from well to well and can not be carried forward from year to year.ryan,wl,at.according to the district court,two provisions suggest that costs for the entire operation should be aggregated before payment.first,direct costs are defined as all direct costs in existing or new wells,not just costs of a particular period.id.second,the definition of direct costs accounts contains an explicit directive to record the aggregate amount of unrecouped direct costs,art.i direct costs accounts.to this we might add that both the direct costs accounts provision and the monthly statement provision of the conveyance speak to direct costs accounts,yet conclude with reference to just one direct cost account,art.i direct costs account,statements see also id,i.
on the other hand,some provisions suggested to the district court that costs should not be aggregated,and that payments should be based only on costs during the production period.first,the direct costs accounts provision creates for new and existing wells to hold direct costs for new and existing wells,art.i direct costs accounts.second,by definition,proceeds and direct costs are tied to monthly production and payment periods.aplt.app,art.i direct
