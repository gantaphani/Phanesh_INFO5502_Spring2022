a group of ecuadorian citizens the plaintiffs who have sued chevron corporation in ecuador appeal from the district court order allowing chevron to depose their consultant.we affirm the district court order directing to submit to a foundational deposition,subject to the limitation described below.
in,the plaintiffs sued chevron in ecuador,seeking to hold chevron liable as the successor to texaco petroleum company the plaintiffs allege that texaco polluted the ecuadorian amazon rainforest over the course of several decades while engaging in oil extraction in the region.this appeal arises out of the plaintiffs ecuadorian lawsuit against chevron.specifically,it concerns richard stalin cabrera vega cabrera,an individual appointed by the ecuadorian court to serve as a neutral expert in the ecuadorian proceedings.the ecuadorian court ordered cabrera to draft a report describing the effect of texaco operations on ecuador environment,accompanied by all the documents that serve as support or a source of information for the report.the court also ordered that these supporting documents be provided to the parties upon the report release.in,cabrera released a report recommending that chevron be held liable for billion in damages,but the ecuadorian court has yet to render a judgment against chevron.
despite cabrera professed impartiality,chevron claims that cabrera actually worked closely with the plaintiffs to produce his report,much of which chevron alleges was secretly ghostwritten by the plaintiffs consultants.consequently,chevron has initiated a series of discovery proceedings in the united states under a,seeking evidence of collusion between cabrera and the plaintiffs consultants.section a allows district courts to order discovery in the united states for use in foreign proceedings in certain circumstances.see,in re clerici,cir.
in the proceedings below,chevron filed a a application seeking discovery from,an environmental consultancy firm in houston.the plaintiffs consultant stratus retained to assist the plaintiffs in mediation and settlement discussions with chevron in,and chevron alleges that and stratus produced a report that cabrera integrated into his report,without disclosing his reliance on it.after the plaintiffs intervened to quash chevron subpoena of,the district court ordered to submit to limited discovery.the court concluded that discovery was appropriate based on the intel factors that the supreme court has directed courts to consider in reviewing requests for discovery in aid of foreign proceedings.see intel advanced micro devices.the court also found that although some of the documents and information sought by chevron could be protected under various privileges,this protection would have been waived by the provision of any documents to cabrera.initially,the district court ordered the plaintiffs to produce a list of documents that were turned over,directly or indirectly,to cabrera,but after the plaintiffs represented that they believed no documents were given to cabrera,the court ordered to submit to a foundational deposition,limited to whether collaborated with cabrera and the extent to which recognizes its work in the cabrera report.the plaintiffs then filed this appeal.
we review de novo whether the statutory prerequisites for granting a relief are satisfied see republic of kazakhstan biedermann int l,cir.however,we review a district court weighing of the intel factors for abuse of discretion.intel,at clerici,at.the plaintiffs raise a number of challenges to the district court analysis of the intel factors first,they argue that allowing chevron to seek discovery from in the united states is inappropriate,since cabrera is subject to the jurisdiction of the ecuadorian court and chevron could ask him to turn over any documents he reviewed.second,the plaintiffs assert that chevron is attempting to evade restrictions on discovery in ecuador.they claim that the ecuadorian court has allegedly not granted chevron requests for copies of documents that the plaintiffs provided to cabrera.see in re microsoft,d,denying a request because applicant had demanded same documents before foreign tribunal.
in our view,the district court did not abuse its discretion.first,we find it senseless to require chevron to seek documents from cabrera,given the plaintiffs denial that they provided any such documents to cabrera and cabrera interest in denying receipt of material.as noted above,the ecuadorian court ordered cabrera to disclose all of the source material for his report.consequently,if cabrera relied on documents but did not disclose them,he is unlikely to turn them over now,as doing so would reveal he violated the ecuadorian court order.second,the record does not clearly demonstrate that chevron is attempting to evade restrictions on discovery in ecuador.it is not clear that chevron ever sought documents from cabrera in ecuador in any event,even if a request for documents were pending before the ecuadorian court,the district court decision to grant a relief would not be an abuse of discretion.the plaintiffs have not argued that chevron request is unduly burdensome,and furthermore,there has been no clear directive from the ecuadorian court that it would reject evidence produced in the united states.euromepa esmerian,cir.the parties have informed the ecuadorian court of the present a proceedings in the united states,but the court has apparently been passive in response,neither lauding nor condemning chevron actions.in these circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting chevron a request.
even if it is proper to allow discovery under a,chevron may not discover information that is immune from discovery.section a provides that a person may not be compelled to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing in violation of any legally applicable privilege.a.furthermore,the provision legislative history suggests that this protection extends to privileges recognized by foreign law,reprinted in.we review factual findings underlying a privilege ruling for clear error and the application of legal principles de novo.united states auster,cir.
the plaintiffs argue that is shielded from discovery under the work product doctrine and the protection accorded consultants by federal rule of civil procedure b b however,the district court ruled that this protection would be waived for any documents that were passed to cabrera.we agree.although work product immunity is not automatically waived by disclosure of protected material to third parties,disclosure does waive protection if it has substantially increased the opportunities for potential adversaries to obtain the information.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed in this case,the disclosure of documents to cabrera,a expert,would waive immunity for disclosed documents and possibly others as well.rule a b provides that when experts testify before a court,they must submit a report disclosing the data or other information they have considered in reaching their conclusions.fed civ.a b ii.relying on this rule,courts have held that when the work product of consultants is provided to testifying experts,immunity is waived for disclosed work product.see,reg l airport auth.of louisville lfg,llc,cir since cabrera is a testifying expert,the district court correctly determined that disclosure of documents to cabrera would waive immunity from discovery under law 
the plaintiffs also contend that is protected from discovery under ecuadorian law.as noted above,the legislative history of a suggests that parties may rely on foreign privileges to shield information from discovery in the united states.in our view,however,to avoid speculative foray s into legal territories unfamiliar to federal judges,parties must provide authoritative proof that a foreign tribunal would reject evidence because of a violation of an alleged foreign privilege.in re application for an order permitting metallgesellschaft ag to take discovery,cir quoting euromepa,at.in this case,although the plaintiffs have submitted an affidavit from an ecuadorian attorney suggesting that th
