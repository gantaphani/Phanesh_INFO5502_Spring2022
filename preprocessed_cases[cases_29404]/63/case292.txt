introduction 
this case arises from a violent episode that occurred on the parabe oil platform nine miles off the coast of nigeria in.the platform was operated by chevron nigeria limited cnl,a subsidiary of the world oil giant.on may,over native nigerians took over the parabe platform to protest cnl destruction of the environment and refusal to provide jobs to the local population.the parties here dispute whether the protest was peaceful.there is no dispute,however,that,after the protest entered its fourth day,cnl sought the assistance of the nigerian government security forces gsf to end the protest.when the gsf soldiers arrived on the platform,they shot a number of the protestors,killing two.
in,the injured protestors and family of a deceased protestor filed a lawsuit in the northern district of california against three chevron companies chevron,raising a number of claims related to the gsf raid of the parabe platform.after ten years of pretrial litigation and discovery,the claims of larry bowoto,bassey jeje,and the families of arolika irowarinun and bola oyinbo collectively plaintiffs were tried before a jury.these plaintiffs brought claims under the alien tort statute ats,nigerian law,and california law.the jury rendered a verdict in favor of chevron on all claims,and plaintiffs now appeal.
this appeal raises challenges principally to the jury instructions and the district court evidentiary rulings.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decisions admitting the pieces of challenged evidence.we also find no error in the jury instructions provided.
there are only two legal issues in this appeal,both relating to statutes congress adopted to incorporate principles of international law.the first issue is whether the federal death on the high seas act dohsa preempts wrongful death and survival claims brought under the ats.the other legal issue is whether corporations can be found liable under the torture victim protection act tvpa.we affirm the dismissal of the ats wrongful death and survival claims and agree with the district court that congress did not intend the tvpa to apply to corporations.
we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
background 
in,the nigerian government entered into a joint venture with chevron to harness the resources of the niger delta.the resulting company,cnl,has since opened a number of oil fields and offshore platforms,extracting billions of dollars worth of oil from nigeria.according to plaintiffs,cnl success has provided little or no benefit to most nigerians.rather,cnl has allegedly shown total disregard for the environment,with oil spills wreaking havoc on local water supplies and fisheries.
in the a number of nigerian tribes,seeking to provide a unified front against cnl,joined forces and formed a group called the concerned ilaje citizens cic.cic sought to have cnl curb its environmental abuses,and to provide more jobs to nigerians.cnl,however,refused to recognize or negotiate with cic,and as a result,tensions between the two escalated.cic sought to get cnl attention by staging a large protest,and chose cnl parabe oil platform as the site.plaintiffs claim that the protest was to be a peaceful one,effectively a that would force cnl to recognize cic concerns.
on may,over members of cic,including plaintiffs,traveled via canoes to the platform.what happened over the next days is a matter of dispute.according to plaintiffs,they came to the platform peacefully and unarmed,holding signs and singing.they claim the cnl workers,most of whom were not nigerian,allowed them onto the platform without resistance,and that there were no tensions between them and the workers throughout the protest.
according to chevron,the protestors were violent and boisterous some had brought weapons and attacked cnl workers.chevron also disputes the contention that the protestors and workers had an amicable relationship.to the contrary,chevron contends its workers were being held hostage and were told they could not leave under threat of violence.
cnl convened a crisis management team cmt to monitor the situation on the platform,and sent a company representative there in hopes of brokering a peaceful end to the protest.according to chevron,these negotiations were unsuccessful,and the situation steadily became more volatile on the platform.faced with the failed negotiations and the deteriorating conditions on the platform,cnl determined that it had to take action to protect the welfare of its workers.on the fourth day of the protest,cnl sought the assistance of the gsf to rescue the workers and stop the protest.
the gsf arrived on the platform via helicopter,opening fire on the protestors shortly after landing.several protestors were injured,including plaintiffs bowoto and jeje.two died as a result of their injuries,including irowarinun.the gsf arrested a number of protestors,and transported them to land where they were allegedly tortured.oyinbo was one of the protestors arrested and allegedly tortured by the gsf.oyinbo died prior to trial for reasons not relevant here.
in,a number of cic protestors who were injured in the parabe protest filed a lawsuit against chevron for injuries sustained during the incident.plaintiffs ultimately did not pursue claims against cnl or any of the individuals involved in the parabe incident.over the next decade,a series of rulings reduced the number of claims.
the district court issued three rulings that are challenged on appeal.first,in a published decision,the district court held that dohsa preempts the summary execution claim brought under the ats.bowoto chevron,d,bowoto i.the court pointed to supreme court decisions holding that dohsa preempts claims and remedies brought under state law and general maritime law.id.at.relying on these opinions,the court reasoned that dohsa provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful deaths that occur on the high seas.id.at.in a later unpublished order,the district court employed similar reasoning to hold that dohsa also survival actions under the ats.bowoto chevron,no.c si,wl.july.
in the final decision at issue,the district court held that plaintiffs could not bring claims against chevron under the tvpa.bowoto chevron,no.c si,wl.the district court observed that the statute permitted claims to be brought only against an individual who committed torture.the district court reasoned that because congress used the term individual,it did not intend for the tvpa to apply to corporations.
the primary claims at trial were common law actions for negligence and intentional torts under california and nigerian law,along with international law claims brought under the ats.the trial lasted over five weeks,with testimony from a total of witnesses.plaintiffs theory at trial was that the parabe protest was peaceful,and that cnl sought gsf assistance knowing the soldiers would violently attack the protestors.plaintiffs further sought to impute cnl wrongful conduct to defendant chevron.
chevron countered these allegations by portraying the protestors as violent and unpredictable,and argued cnl sought the assistance of the gsf as a last resort.chevron further argued that the gsf fired on protestors in.
the jury found in favor of chevron on all claims.plaintiffs have appealed.
i.the plaintiffs may not pursue claims under the alien tort statute 
of the four victim plaintiffs in this case,one died as a result of the injuries suffered on the parabe platform.the family of this plaintiff sought to raise a claim under the ats for summary execution,and also several survival claims rooted in the ats.the district court barred plaintiffs from presenting the summary execution and survival claims to the jury,finding that dohsa preempts ats wrongful death and survival claims.see d at.we affirm the district court dismissal of the ats claims.
the supreme court more than a century ago held in the harrisburg,that maritime law did not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death.congress repudiated this holding in with the passage of dohsa,in order to provide a remedy in admiralty for wrongful deaths more than three miles from shore.mobil oil higginbotham.dohsa creates the cause of action for the decedent immediate family it limits recovery to pecuniary damages,eliminates any contributory negligence bar to recovery,and preserves the ability to bring claims under the law of another country.see see also higginbotham,at describing provisions of dohsa.
due to dohsa comprehensive scope,the supreme court has determined the act displaces other remedies and causes of action.in higginbotham,the court held that dohsa bars recovery of damages for loss of society under maritime law.id.at.the court recognized that dosha does not address every issue of law,but stated that where the act does speak to a topic,courts were not free to supplement the remedies already provided for in the statute.id.at.the court thus found that because dohsa does speak to the issue of damages by limiting recovery to pecuniary loss,plaintiffs could not obtain damages for loss of society under maritime law.id.at.
in offshore logistics,tallentire,the court held that dohsa preempts state law wrongful death statutes.the court noted that in passing dohsa,congress sought to create a uniform remedy for deaths on the high seas,an area where the federal interests are primary,and found that permitting concurrent state law wrongful death suits would jeopardize that uniformity.id.at.
the court later determined that dohsa also preempts maritime law survival claims.see dooley korean air lines.the plaintiffs there contended that dohsa does not preempt such claims,arguing that the statute,which authorizes recovery for losses suffered by the decedent family,says nothing that would preclude raising survival claims on the decedent behalf.id.at.the court rejected this distinction,finding that by authorizing only certain surviving relatives to recover damages,and by limiting damages to the pecuniary losses sustained by those relatives,congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths that occur on the high seas.id.the court went on to hold that b ecause congress has chosen not to authorize a survival action for a decedent pain and suffering,there can be no general maritime survival action for such damages.id.at.the court has thus,in a series of cases,determined that dohsa should be construed according to its terms to provide the remedy under united states law for deaths occurring more than three miles from shore.
against that backdrop,we first examine the district court determination that dohsa preempts all ats wrongful death claims.we do not necessarily agree with the district court determination that higginbotham,tallentire,and dooley foreclose the possibility of there ever being a cognizable ats claim invoking principles of international law to recover for a death at sea.as the court stated in higginbotham,dohsa does not address every issue of law.at.there may then be situations where a plaintiff can simultaneously pursue claims under both dohsa and the ats.see sosa,noting that claims arising out of acts of piracy are recognized under the ats.
with respect to plaintiffs summary execution claim under the ats,however,whether and to what extent the district court may have erred is immaterial so long as the error did not prejudice plaintiffs.there could have been no prejudice if the jury would have found against plaintiffs on this claim in any event.see tennison circus circus enterprises,cir finding that a jury rejection of a sexual harassment claim made any error in failing to instruct on intentional infliction of emotional distress harmless.the jury in this case squarely rejected a wrongful death claim brought under nigerian law that was nearly identical to the summary execution claim plaintiffs contend the district court erroneously dismissed.the wrongful death claim under nigerian law required plaintiffs to prove that irowarinun death was caused by a battery or negligent act by chevron nigeria the nigerian government security forces.summary execution would have required,in material part,plaintiffs to show that cnl gsf committ ed a wrongful,tortious act in excess of their authority over irowarinun that resulted in his death.see forti,describing a summary execution claim.both summary execution and wrongful death under nigerian law therefore require a showing that the decedent died due to the wrongful conduct of the defendant.
we therefore conclude that even assuming the district court erred in dismissing the summary execution claim,there was no prejudice.this is because summary execution and nigerian wrongful death law are predicated on the same facts and similar legal inquiries,so that the jury rejection of the nigerian law claim makes it highly unlikely that it would have found in favor of plaintiffs on a summary execution claim.see tennison,at.we further find that any difference in the burden of proof between the ats,preponderance,and nigerian law,beyond a reasonable doubt standards,is immaterial under the circumstances of this case.the jury rejected a total of common law claims brought by plaintiffs under a variety of burdens of proof.there is no reason to believe the jury would have found a summary execution claim meritorious under any standard.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the ats claim for summary execution.
with respect to plaintiffs ats survival claims,we will not similarly infer that the jury would have rejected these claims,because chevron has not shown that any claim presented to and rejected by the jury was materially similar to the survival claims.we must therefore decide whether dohsa preempts ats survival claims,and for the following reasons we conclude it does.
the supreme court in dooley held that dohsa preempts survival claims brought under maritime law.see at.plaintiffs do not dispute this point,but they argue dooley does not bar survival claims brought under other federal statutes such as the ats.to resolve the issue,we look to the reasoning underlying dooley holding.the court in dooley looked to the precision with which congress defined the dohsa remedy and to the legal principle that a specific statute usually preempts more general remedies.see see also hinck united states,stating that it is a principle,that in most contexts,a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies internal quotation marks omitted.the court described dohsa as a comprehensive statute that expresses congress considered judgment on the availability and contours of a survival action in cases of death on the high seas.id.internal quotation marks omitted.dooley thus held that dohsa preempts all survival claims for deaths on the high seas unless there is clear indication that congress intended otherwise.
there is no evidence that congress intended ats survival claims to remain viable after the passage of dohsa.in contrast to the comprehensive scope of dohsa,the ats is only a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action.see sosa,at.unlike dohsa,the ats does not speak to the issue of survival claims.this court did not even recognize that survival claims were cognizable under the ats until years after dohsa passage.see hilao estate of marcos,cir.we thus hold that dohsa provides plaintiffs only available means for raising survival claims.
plaintiffs point to the jones act and contend it undercuts our conclusion.the jones act,as relevant here,allows the family of a deceased seaman to pursue survival claims on his behalf.see.both the supreme court and this court have suggested that dohsa does not preempt these survival claims.see dooley,at davis bender shipbuilding and repair,cir the heirs of a seaman who has died on the high seas may pursue a claim under dohsa or the jones act.the distinction between the jones act and the ats,however,is that the jones act is itself a comprehensive statute that addresses a specific issue in maritime law.see miles apex marine,stating the jones act establishes a uniform system of seaman tort law.congress passed dohsa and the jones act in the same year in order to provide parallel remedies for the damages a death caused to the seaman family and to the estate.the statutes were intended to repudiate totally the rule of the harrisburg.see dooley,u.at.it is evident that congress intended dohsa and the jones act to work together.see miles,at referring to the jones act as dohsa companion statute.there was no such intent with respect to dohsa and the ats,enacted more than a century apart.
the supreme court decision in kernan american dredging,forty years before dooley,does not provide plaintiffs much assistance.kernan did not involve dohsa at all.it involved the relationship between the federal employer liability act and the jones act.see id.at.the court there assumed,in passing,that dohsa would not preempt a state law survival claim.see id.at presumably any claims,based on unseaworthiness,for damages accrued prior to the decedent death would survive,at least if a pertinent state statute is effective to bring about a survival of the seaman right.dooley,however,later squarely held that dohsa provides the plaintiffs sole recourse for survival claims.
we therefore affirm the district court ruling dismissing the ats claims arising from irowarinun death.
ii.the torture victim protection act does not apply to corporations 
congress passed the tvpa in to carry out obligations of the united states under the united nations charter and other international agreements pertaining to the protection of human rights by establishing a civil action for recovery of damages from an individual who engages in torture or extrajudicial killing,stat.codified at.the question in this appeal is whether congress intended to permit such civil actions against corporations.we agree with the district court that it did not,and hold that the plain language of the tvpa does not allow for suits against a corporation.
we begin with the statutory language of the tvpa.the tvpa liability provision provides that only an individual may be held liable under the act it states 
a individual who,under actual or apparent authority,or color of law,of any foreign nation 
subjects an individual to torture shall,in a civil action,be liable for damages to that individual or 
subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing shall,in a civil action,be liable for damages to the individual legal representative,or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.
note a.the district court here reasoned that by extending liability only to a n individual,congress intended that only natural persons,and not corporations,could be found liable under the act.in so doing,the district court adopted a position consistent with the majority of district courts that have considered the issue.see,corrie caterpillar,d,doe i exxon mobil,d,mujica occidental petroleum,d.but see estate of rodriquez drummond,d,finding corporations can be liable under tvpa sinaltrainal,d,same.
the district court decision did conflict with the one circuit court to mention the issue.the circuit has said that corporations can be found liable under the tvpa.see aldana del monte fresh produce,cir.it does not appear the defendants in that case ever challenged the notion of corporate liability,however,and the eleventh circuit did not explain its reasoning on the issue.see,romero drummond,cir.
we agree with the district court that congress use of the word individual throughout the statute indicates that it did not intend for the tvpa to apply to corporations.indeed,congress has directed courts to presume the word individual in a statute refers to natural persons and not corporations.in the dictionary act,congress provided definitions for a number of common statutory terms that courts are to apply unless the context indicates otherwise.see.one term defined is person,which the dictionary act defines as being broader than a reference to an individual.the act defines person to include corporations,companies,associations,firms,partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies,as well as individuals.u.the dictionary act therefore speaks of corporations and individuals as distinct terms,and we must therefore presume those terms have different meanings.see id.
despite the presumption of the dictionary act,our court has recognized that the use of the word individual in a statute does not necessarily exclude corporations.see united states middleton,cir.in middleton,this court looked to a statute that criminalized hacking into the computer system of one or more individuals.id.the court found that individual encompassed corporations because the statute used the words individual and person interchangeably throughout,thus indicating that congress did not intend for the presumption of the dictionary act to apply.id.at congress used individuals and person in a manner,without reference to the dictionary act.see also clinton city of new york,finding that individual as used in the line item veto act included both natural persons and corporations.
here,in contrast,it is evident that congress drafted the tvpa in such a manner as to limit liability to natural persons.the tvpa consistently uses individual throughout the statute to refer both to the torturer and the victim of torture.see,note a an individual who subjects an individual to torture.corporations,of course,can not be tortured.see middleton,at noting that c orporations can not suffer physical injury internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs ask us to give the same word different meanings in the same statute.they ask us to interpret individual to mean a natural person when referring to the victim,but to mean either a natural person or a corporation when referring to the torturer.this interpretation of the statute runs counter to the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.commissioner lundy,citation omitted.there is no indication congress intended individual to have a variety of meanings throughout the tvpa.
indeed,the legislative history demonstrates that congress rejected the notion of corporate liability.when first introduced in,the tvpa imposed liability on any person who subjected another to torture.see the torture victim protection act hearing and markup before the comm.on foreign affairs on,cong.the house foreign affairs committee amended the bill to substitute individual for person in order to make it clear they were applying the act to individuals and not to corporations.id.when introduced five years later,the tvpa still spoke of liability for individuals.
neither the senate nor house report,moreover,even hint at corporate liability.see the torture victim protection act of,torture victim protection act of.had congress intended for the court to interpret the term individual so broadly as to include corporations,it would have included some evidence of this intent in the legislative history.see in re goodman,cir finding individual as used in a statute did not include corporations because there was no legislative history showing that the section was meant to apply to corporations citation omitted.we thus conclude that both the text and legislative history indicate congress did not intend to allow suits against corporations under the tvpa.
plaintiffs offer an alternative argument that they may sue chevron under the tvpa upon a theory of aiding and abetting.plaintiffs contend that corporations can be found vicariously liable for torture they direct individuals to commit.the tvpa,however,does not contemplate such liability.it limits liability to a n individual who subjects another to torture.see,note a.even assuming the tvpa permits some form of vicarious liability,the text limits such liability to individuals,meaning in this statute,natural persons.the language of the statute thus does not permit corporate liability under any theory.
we therefore affirm the district court ruling that the tvpa does not apply to corporations.
iii.challenges to jury instructions 
plaintiffs raise a series of challenges to the jury instructions,arguing first that the battery instruction incorrectly allocated the burden of proof on a key element,and second that the instructions pertaining to affirmative defenses misstated the law.we review each argument in turn and affirm.
plaintiffs tried their battery claims to the jury under both nigerian and california law.the district court provided a single jury instruction for battery afte
