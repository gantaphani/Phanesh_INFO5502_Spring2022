at the heart of this appeal is a complex regulatory scheme governing federal fuel excise taxes.augustine pesaturo was convicted by a jury on charges that he evaded such taxes,conspired with his employees to do so,and provided a false statement leading to a fraudulent tax return.on appeal,he argues primarily that he was never liable for the taxes he allegedly evaded.the relevant statute was amended in,and the charged conduct occurred when the regulations implementing the statute were in a state of transition.nonetheless,we conclude that a jury could permissibly find that pesaturo was liable for the taxes that underlie his conviction,and that he willfully failed to pay those taxes.we also find pesaturo additional arguments meritless and therefore affirm.
pesaturo owned and operated covenant oil covenant,a fuel delivery company that purchased fuel from terminals fuel storage and distribution facilities supplied by pipeline or vessel.covenant employees loaded the fuel onto trucks and delivered it to customers who used the fuel to power trucks,heating and refrigeration units,and railroad cars,as well as in other applications.in and covenant was a small operation.pesaturo managed the business with the help of one clerical worker and a handful of drivers to operate its three trucks.aside from the storage tanks of these trucks,covenant had no fuel storage facilities.
covenant primarily distributed diesel fuels,including diesel,diesel also referred to as home heating oil,and kerosene.while these three fuels differ only slightly in chemical composition,the methods for taxing them differed significantly.the government imposes a tax upon all three fuels when they are used to power vehicles on the road a tax is not imposed for uses,such as powering farm equipment,heating homes,or operating the refrigeration and heating units that piggyback on trucks and railroad cars,known as reefers.this case arises from the government allegation that pesaturo failed to pay taxes due on substantial amounts of fuel he sold during and.
during that period,diesel was taxed upon its removal from a terminal.in practice,covenant suppliers included the federal excise tax in the price of diesel and remitted the tax to the government,much like a gas station collects gasoline taxes from consumers at the pump.customers who used the diesel in applications could file for a refund of the tax directly from the government.the price of home heating oil and kerosene purchased at a terminal did not include federal excise taxes.home heating oil,which is intended for use,was dyed red to alert buyers and inspectors to its status and to deter unscrupulous sellers from selling it for use without collecting the tax and remitting it to the government.kerosene was not dyed out of concern that the dye would impair the function of unvented space heaters commonly run on kerosene.instead,most terminals required their customers to sign exemption forms accepting responsibility for paying the excise taxes directly to the government if the kerosene was subsequently sold for use 
because all three fuels could power vehicles on the road,and companies like covenant only paid the price for diesel upon purchase from a terminal,an unscrupulous company had incentives to mix diesel with kerosene which was cheaper to obtain because its price at the terminal did not include the excise tax and to sell the resulting mixture as fully taxed diesel or as a blend of diesel and kerosene on which the excise tax had been fully paid.through this scheme,the unscrupulous seller could charge the price for the fuel and keep the tax owed to the government on the kerosene portion of the blend.alternatively,sellers could undercut their competitors prices for diesel by blending untaxed kerosene with the taxed diesel and collecting only a portion of the tax on the kerosene intended for use,thus passing on some of the savings to the customer,while still turning a profit even if the seller did not collect the tax on the kerosene intended for use,it had an obligation to remit that tax to the government.
pesaturo was indicted in on three counts of evading federal excise taxes on sales of fuel in,in violation of one count of conspiring with two covenant drivers to evade excise taxes,in violation of and two counts of filing materially false tax returns,for and,in violation of.after an trial,a jury found pesaturo guilty on all counts,except the final count of filing a false tax return for,which the district court dismissed pesaturo was sentenced to months incarceration on each count,to run concurrently,and three years supervised release he was ordered to pay a fine of,restitution of,and a assessment.in support of the sentence,the district court found that tax was due on all kerosene purchased by covenant in and that was not accounted for by sales to covenant largest customer,merchant despatch transportation mdt,a railroad company that used the fuel in applications.
on appeal,pesaturo primary argument is that the district court misconstrued the statute and regulations governing fuel taxes during the relevant period and that,as a matter of law,he was not liable for the taxes he allegedly evaded and conspired to evade.he asserts four additional claims of error the trial court impermissibly allowed the government to shift the burden of proof to him the evidence did not support a finding that he made false statements on his tax return the evidence was insufficient to establish a conspiracy and the court erred in calculating the tax loss on which his sentence was based and,moreover,his sentence is unconstitutional because it was based on a amount of untaxed was neither charged by the grand jury nor found beyond a reasonable doubt by the petit jury.
before addressing the arguments that pesaturo makes on appeal,we must explain the regulatory regime that governed the payment of excise taxes on sales of diesel and kerosene from to,the period covered by the indictment.
regulatory overview 
the government has historically imposed an excise tax on fuel used in motor vehicles driven on public roads.concerned about tax evasion congress amended the statute governing fuel excise taxes in.in part,these amendments added diesel fuels to the fuels on which federal excise taxes are collected upon their removal from a refinery or terminal by bringing them under this effectively moved the point of taxation further back in the distribution chain,away from the many wholesalers like covenant and toward the less numerous terminals and refineries sales of kerosene,however,did not become subject to tax upon removal from a refinery or terminal until during the transitional period between the amendments and this decision on the taxation of kerosene,congress continued to study whether kerosene should be taxed at the terminal.in the meantime,kerosene was exempt from s imposition of tax at the terminal by regulation and sales of kerosene were governed by the tax,a,which applies to sales of fuel that are exempt from.
section imposes the federal excise tax at the point of sale to consumers,requiring sellers to collect the tax in some circumstances and buyers to pay the tax directly to the government in others.in relevant part,requires the tax to be imposed when fuel is i sold by any person to an owner,lessee,or other operator of a highway vehicle or ii used by any person as a fuel in a highway vehicle.a a i,ii emphasis added.
although was not changed by the amendments,the relevant regulatory internal revenue service of the treasury to the congressional action by changing the regulation implementing,expanding the conditions under which sellers of kerosene are liable for the federal excise tax.the old rule specified that a taxable sale occurred if the fuel is delivered by the seller into the fuel supply tank of the vehicle or,if the fuel is not delivered directly into a fuel supply tank of a vehicle,if the purchaser furnishes a written statement to the seller before or at the time of the sale stating that the fuel will be used for a taxable purpose.in the absence of a taxable sale,the buyer would be liable for the tax if the fuel was used on the road.
the new rule stated that imposes a tax on,inter alia,a ny diesel fuel on which tax has not been imposed by section or a ny liquid other than gasoline or diesel fuel,that is delivered into the fuel supply tank of a highway vehicle.a i,a.it is likely that the diesel fuel referred to in this regulation includes kerosene however,even if it does not,kerosene is surely at least a liquid other than gasoline or diesel fuel,and is thus subject to the tax 
the new rule made the seller of the fuel jointly and severally liable for the tax if the seller knows or has reason to know that the fuel will not be used in a nontaxable use.id.at a ii.the new rule expanded the seller tax liability by eliminating the requirement that fuel be supplied to the fuel tank by the seller or that the seller receive written notice from the buyer that the buyer intends to use the fuel on the road before the seller is liable for the tax,and by making the seller jointly and severally liable if he knows or has reason to know that the fuel will be used on the road.
to summarize,the amendments tightened control over the taxation of diesel fuels by making diesel taxable upon removal from a terminal,and strengthening the regulation governing kerosene sales by broadening the circumstances under which sellers were liable for the tax and imposing joint and several liability on sellers where they had actual or constructive knowledge that the fuel would be put to use.
arguments based on statutory provisions and rules 
on appeal,pesaturo argues that the old rule governs his tax liability for sales of kerosene.alternatively,he argues that,even if the new rule applies,it should be read to require the seller to deliver the taxable fuel into the fuel supply tank of a vehicle before tax liability attaches to the seller and,except for the sales to the undercover irs agents accounting for roughly gallons of liquid fuel,in total,the government evidence involves only deliveries into fuel storage tanks.finally,pesaturo argues that even if delivery into a fuel storage tank is enough to trigger tax liability on the seller of taxable fuel,the government provided insufficient evidence that pesaturo knew or should have known that such sales were for uses.
the old rule or the new rule 
in arguing that the old rule applies,pesaturo points out that the regulation implementing c,supra note excludes kerosene from the definition of diesel fuel between and.he also cites a notice in the federal register informing taxpayers that the irs would not change the tax treatment of kerosene until it had determined how best to implement the tax on kerosene used on the road pesaturo interprets these texts as indicating that the taxation of kerosene would proceed precisely as it had before the as construed by the old rule.the government argues that the exclusion of kerosene from the definition of diesel fuel during this period serves only to exempt sales of kerosene from automatic taxation upon removal from a terminal,and not from the new regulations governing the tax.
we agree with the government that the better reading of these texts and congress intent is to exclude kerosene only from taxation upon removal from a terminal.indeed,the regulation pesaturo cites for the proposition that diesel does not include kerosene,a,makes clear that this regulatory section only provides definitions for purposes of the tax on taxable fuel imposed by section,emphasis added and thus has nothing to say about whether diesel includes kerosene for the purposes of.moreover,a further regulation arising from the amendments,tellingly entitled applicability of regulations relating to diesel fuel after december,provides that s ections through do not apply to sales or uses of diesel fuel after december.the old rule is contained within that range.the regulation continues for rules relating to the diesel fuel tax imposed by section after that date,see,the new rule.id.in sum,the regulations provide no support for the proposition that diesel should be defined to exclude kerosene in relation to and they unequivocally state that the old rule is inapplicable after.
finally,congress adopted the reforms to plug the loopholes through which tax dollars were being siphoned away from the government and into the pockets of unscrupulous sellers.the principal tactic employed by congress was to make sales of diesel taxable at the terminal however,as discussed above,the internal revenue service also tightened the regulations that governed sales of fuel not taxed at the terminal,such as kerosene.
delivery into a fuel supply tank 
pesaturo argues that,even if the new rule applies,covenant was not liable for the tax because the seller incurs tax liability only when the seller delivers the fuel into the fuel supply tank of a vehicle.this argument relies on a misunderstanding of the text and purpose of the new rule.under the old rule,sellers were liable for the tax upon delivery by the seller into the fuel supply tank of the vehicle,emphasis added.the new rule takes a different approach,as reflected in its text.sellers are now jointly and severally liable for the tax if the seller knew or had reason to know the fuel would later be deliver ed into the fuel supply tank by any party.the obligation to collect and remit the tax is no longer linked to the delivery by the seller into the fuel supply tank of the vehicle.
pesaturo would have us ignore these subtle but significant changes to the text and urges us to read delivery by the seller into the fuel supply tank of the vehicle back into the new regulation.however,we find the government interpretation of the regulation more persuasive both textually and in the context of the government stated purpose of increasing fuel tax compliance.if fuel is delivered into a bulk supply tank temporarily for later use on the road and the seller knew or had reason to know of this later use,the seller is jointly responsible for the tax due.the objective is to ensure payment of taxes,and the new provision casts a wider net by extending the seller liability to uses of which he is aware even if they occur further down the supply path 
pesaturo argues that,even if the new rule applies and delivery into a storage tank does not insulate the seller from tax liability,the government presented insufficient evidence that pesaturo knew or should have known how much,if any,of the fuel at issue would be used on the road.
we find pesaturo argument disingenuous.direct testimony at trial established that covenant sold diesel mixed with kerosene on which no tax was remitted to the government to bulk storage tanks owned by three trucking company enterprises,m m transport,and korson company,different occasions between may and march.although pesaturo contends that all three companies had both and uses for fuel,representatives of all three companies testified that they believed the price they paid covenant for fuel included the tax.also,representatives of korson and jag indicated that they bought different fuel from covenant for their and uses.there is no reason to think that pesaturo customers would have paid the much higher price for fuel they intended to use in nontaxable applications.they paid the tax because their use of the fuel required it.
it is true that the jury was given no instruction that the regulation governing required pesaturo to know that sales of kerosene would be put to use.pesaturo failed to object to this omission from the jury instructions at the time of the trial,focusing instead on the judge refusal to instruct the jury that the seller was only liable for the tax when the seller delivered the fuel into the fuel supply tank of a vehicle.however,any error on this point was harmless.the jury was duly instructed that tax evasion required not just that a tax be due and owing,but that defendant willfully attempt ed to evade the tax.see.the jury could only find such willfulness if it also found that pesaturo knew that the fuel sold to buyers such as korson,jag and m m transport would be used on the road 
by the government 
pesaturo argues that the government impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him through a summary witness,gary lindahl,an irs revenue agent who was unconnected to the case but who was present in the courtroom during most of the trial since covenant records indicated no sales of kerosene,lindahl used evidence from the trial to calculate the amount of kerosene covenant could have sold for use.lindahl began with the amount of kerosene purchased by covenant and subtracted kerosene sales to mdt covenant largest customer,who used all of the fuel it purchased from covenant in applications.because sales of kerosene to mdt were also not recorded,the amount of kerosene sold to mdt was imputed based on the total fuel sales to mdt and the testimony of several witnesses that covenant blended kerosene into the fuel sold to mdt at a ratio of kerosene to diesel.kerosene,which has a lower viscosity than either or diesel,was added to the fuel to prevent the fuel from gelling in the fuel lines in cold temperatures.although the witnesses agreed on this ratio,they disagreed as to whether or not covenant sold blended fuel to mdt exclusively during the winter months.those who testified that blended fuel was sold to mdt outside of the winter months noted that railcars were often sent through cold the rocky mountains,for they reached their destinations.as a result,the government assumed the ratio for sales throughout the year.since this would overestimate the gallons of kerosene sold to mdt if the fuel sold to mdt outside of winter was not blended,this approach resulted in a conservative estimate of the gallons of kerosene unaccounted for by sales to mdt and therefore available for sale in taxable uses.
pesaturo argues that,by subtracting kerosene sales to mdt from covenant kerosene purchases to arrive at a figure of gallons available for sale in taxable uses,the government impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant to account for the legitimate sale of that fuel in response,the government characterizes its approach as the normal process of establishing a fact through the use of circumstantial evidence,and notes further that its estimate was necessitated by pesaturo own lack of accurate.indeed,covenant bookkeeper testified that pesaturo instructed her to record all kerosene sales as sales of home heating oil,leading to the absurd accounting result that covenant records showed no kerosene,notwithstanding that covenant had no fuel storage facilities save the storage tanks of its three trucks.
the prosecution never argued to the jury that it had to find that the kerosene was sold for taxable use because of the absence of records otherwise accounting for its sale.instead,the prosecution noted the amount of kerosene,asked the rhetorical question where did the rest go,and answered the question by pointing to the evidence furthermore,the judge carefully instructed the jury 
the burden of proof rests with the government.a defendant has no burden to prove that he is not guilty of what is charged.the burden is always with the government to prove that he is guilty of what the government charges him with the government must establish each element of the offense charged by proof that convinces you and leaves you with no reasonable doubt.
we agree with the government that there was no impermissible burden shifting in this case.
materiality of the adjustments to pesaturo tax return 
pesaturo challenges the jury determination that he willfully made a material false statement regarding covenant tax return in violation of.the government burden under this statute is to prove the following elements 
that the defendant made or caused to be made,a federal income tax return for the year in question which he verified to be true that the tax return was false as to a material matter that the defendant signed the return willfully and knowing it was false and that the return contained a written declaration that it was made under the penalty of perjury.
united states boulerice,cir.
we review de novo whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that pesaturo instruction to his accountant resulted in a materially false representation on covenant tax return.we will affirm if after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states lavoie,cir quoting united states,cir.
covenant accountant testified that,when he found that the company cash balance exceeded its receipts by,pesaturo explained the discrepancy by claiming that the higher number reflected various cash sales for which receipts were unavailable.he further explained that a commensurate amount of cash had been used to purchase fuel from sprague energy and thus both sales and cost of goods sold should be adjusted to reflect these cash transactions.
pesaturo offered no documents supporting the cash purchase of kerosene.moreover,representatives of sprague energy testified at trial that the company rarely sold fuel on a cash basis and only to customers whose was at issue further testimony established that covenant was not questioned by sprague during this period.in addition,both the government and pesaturo stipulated at trial that it was not the policy or practice of valero energy corporation covenant other fuel supplier to accept cash for payment.
based on this evidence,a reasonable jury could have found that pesaturo,alerted to the existence of cash in covenant account,fabricated cash purchases to inflate covenant cost of goods sold in a misguided attempt to neutralize the extra receipts discovered by his accountant.the correct adjustment would have been a adjustment in sales with no adjustment to cost of goods sold.however,that would have increased covenant tax liability,which pesaturo wanted to avoid.
sufficiency of evidence on the conspiracy charge 
pesaturo also argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to support the conspiracy charge.to prove liability under,the government must show that two or more persons conspire d either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states and one or more of such persons d id any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.pesaturo argues specifically that there was insufficient evidence of an agreement between him and the drivers who sold untaxed kerosene to undercover irs agents.however,pesaturo errs in focusing solely on these sales.the taxable sales were made to numerous customers,by multiple covenant drivers,and over an extended amount of time.
pesaturo insists that neither mere employment in a common business enterprise,see ingram united states,d,nor mere association with conspirators,see united states,cir,is sufficient to prove that an agreement existed on which the government could ground a conspiracy charge.the government evidence established more than mere association.testimony at trial established that pesaturo controlled all business decisions at covenant.he scheduled fuel purchases and deliveries,set the price at which fuels were sold,marketed the company products,and even instructed the bookkeeper in how to account for sales of different products.
while the government did not present evidence of an explicit agreement between pesaturo and his drivers,we do not require evidence of an explicit agreement to ground a conspiracy conviction.see united states patrick,cir noting the legal principle that a conspiracy may be based on a tacit agreement shown from an implicit working relationship.given the extent of the evidence regarding the tax evasion,the small size of covenant oil,and pesaturo pervasive control over that enterprise,it is simply implausible to argue that the drivers were acting on their own.
propriety of pesaturo sentence 
under the federal sentencing guidelines,pesaturo sentence was linked to the amount of tax loss attributable to his crimes.see ussg.at his sentencing,the judge calculated the tax loss based on the taxes due on gallons of kerosene bought by covenant but not sold to mdt for use in its applications and the tax loss resulting from the false inflation of covenant cost of goods sold on its tax return resulting in a total ta
