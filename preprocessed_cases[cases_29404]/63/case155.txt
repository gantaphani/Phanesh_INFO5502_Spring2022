energy management corporation emc appeals the district court judgment on remand declaring city of shreveport shreveport ordinance invalid rather than preempted.emc also challenges the district court refusal to award damages,attorney fees and costs.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand the judgment of the district court regarding the declaratory judgment language,holding that the prior panel intended ordinance be preempted by state law.we affirm the district court refusal to award damages and attorney fees and we remand the issue of allocation of costs to the district court for further consideration.
factual and procedural background 
cross lake,the focal point of this litigation,is the main source of water for shreveport,louisiana.energy mgmt.city of shreveport energy mgmt.i,cir.in,the louisiana legislature authorized the transfer of cross lake to shreveport but the state reserved all minerals and mineral rights,as well as the right to drill and operate wells.id.then,in,louisiana established the louisiana office of conservation loc as the exclusive authority to grant drilling permits under louisiana revised statute section f,a city government is specifically precluded from interfering with the decision of the loc on these matters.f.in,shreveport enacted ordinance,forbidding any new drilling within feet of cross lake feet zone and setting up,among other rules,a comprehensive regulatory scheme relating to various aspects of drilling activities within feet of the lake emc,a mississippi corporation that owns louisiana mineral interests under and around cross lake,had already acquired mineral leases from the state by this time,but had not obtained a permit from the loc.emc first attempted to negotiate with shreveport to ease its restrictions within the feet zone.the negotiations proved unsuccessful thus,no permit was ever obtained from the loc,and eventually,emc lost its ownership in the subject leases.
in,emc brought this diversity suit,alleging that shreveport had no authority to regulate drilling around cross lake.energy mgmt.i,at.in that prior appeal,this court concluded,
t he city of shreveport ordinance is preempted by state law and is invalid to the extent that it purports to prohibit the drilling of oil and gas wells in an area within the state of louisiana,an authority granted exclusively by state statute and regulations to the loc.
id.at.this court reasoned that louisiana statutory and case law as well as opinions of the louisiana attorney general supported this decision.id.at.therefore,the matter was remanded to the district court for entry of declaratory judgment declaring that ordinance is invalid to the extent stated above and for consideration of any further relief to which emc may be entitled.id.
on remand,the district court requested briefing from the parties regarding appropriate declaratory judgment language and any additional relief for emc.subsequently,the district court entered the judgment as follows ordinance is hereby declared invalid to the extent that it purports to prohibit the drilling of oil and gas wells in an area within the state of louisiana.energy mgmt.city of shreveport.may,order granting declaratory judgment.the district court did not track the language of the prior panel in energy management i,which stated that the ordinance was preempted by state law.moreover,the district court found that emc was not entitled to additional relief.the court stated 
under louisiana laws and legal principles,oil,gas and other minerals are fugacious matter and are subject to capture.the damages complained of and testified to by emc experts are based on the value of lost production.the sought after minerals are still in place and subject to capture.they are not lost.
id.the court also stated,without explanation,that emc was not entitled to attorney fees but made no comment regarding emc entitlement to costs.see id.because it argues that shreveport is actively the language of the district court as invalidating only the feet provision and continuing to enforce the remainder of the ordinance,emc appeals the district court ruling.
ii.discussion 
a.the district court interpretation of the declaratory judgment.standard of review 
this court has a limited scope of review after remand.volk gonzalez,cir.on a second appeal following remand,the only issue for consideration is whether the court below reached its final decree in due pursuance of this court previous opinion and mandate.id.alteration in original quoting burroughs ffp operating partners,cir.we can consider a prior opinion to determine what was actually intended,but we will not reconsider issues already decided by the earlier panel.burroughs,at.
before we reach the merits of this appeal,we first address shreveport claim that emc lacks standing to contest the entirety of the ordinance and that an opinion issued by this court declaring the ordinance entirely preempted would be nothing more than an advisory opinion.at oral argument,counsel for shreveport explained that because emc was not a loc permit holder,and the state of louisiana is not a party to the suit,this court can not render a judgment as to whether the entirety of ordinance conflicts with state law because such a judgment would amount to an advisory opinion.shreveport argument,however,is incorrect.the panel in energy management i specifically found that emc had standing to bring this suit and nowhere stated that emc standing was limited energy mgmt.i,at.as we have explained,the issues decided by the first panel will not be relitigated.see burroughs,at.shreveport contention that the feet zone portion of ordinance is the only portion invalidated by the district court decision because emc only had standing to contest ordinance as it related to the feet zone,therefore,must fail.likewise,this opinion is not advisory because emc brought suit against shreveport contesting ordinance in its entirety.
this court has previously determined that emc has the necessary standing therefore,our holding today turns solely on our determination of whether the prior panel intended that louisiana law preempt ordinance and,if so,whether the declaratory judgment language of the district court reflects that intent.emc contends that the energy management i panel found ordinance preempted in whole however,the language of the district court opinion does not reflect this conclusion.emc is concerned that this overly narrow language could lead to the enforcement of provisions that do not prohibit drilling but,nevertheless,restrict related activities because the present judgment implies that shreveport retains the ability to enforce costly and unnecessary requirements not required by louisiana for the drilling of oil and gas wells within the state.in contrast,shreveport argues that the only right exclusively statutorily reserved to the loc is the oversight of drilling and,therefore,ordinance is not invalid in its additional respects it asserts that the district court tracked the limiting language of this court energy management i decision.
our duty is to review this case considering whether the court below effected the mandate of the first panel.volk,at.our reading of the energy management i panel opinion clearly indicates that the court evaluated the various regulatory aspects of the ordinance and ultimately determined that ordinance was preempted in its entirety.therefore,shreveport claims on this matter are unsupported by the prior opinion.a closer look at energy management i is not only instructive,but also dispositive.
the prior panel stated 
local power is not unless it was the clear and manifest purpose of the legislature to do so,or the exercise of dual authority is repugnant to a legislative objective if there is no express provision mandating,the courts will determine the legislative intent by examining the pervasiveness of the state regulatory scheme,the need for state uniformity,and the danger of conflict between the enforcement of local laws and the administration of the state program.palermo land planning comm of calcasieu parish,so d.in this case there is no express provision mandating.however,all other inquiries lead to the conclusion that local regulation of oil and gas drilling activities is preempted by comprehensive state regulation of oil and gas activities under the loc.
regulations by the state of oil and gas drilling activity through the loc are clearly pervasive addressing every phase of the oil and gas exploration process from exploration and prospecting to cleanup of abandoned oilfield waste sites in every case which has been brought to our attention involving a challenge to the authority of the loc,its authority has been upheld.
at.the opinion reference not just to drilling but to drilling activities,as well as its statement that the regulations address every phase of the process,supports our interpretation that the prior panel language effectuated the preemption of ordinance in its entirety.furthermore,in support of its determination,the prior panel highlighted louisiana cases upholding the authority of the loc,cases which addressed not only but also other aspects of the drilling process,including disposal 
thereafter,the prior panel relied on louisiana attorney general ag opinions to support its holding.according to the panel,the louisiana ag has consistently concluded that attempts at local regulation of drilling operations are preempted by state law.id one of the opinions addressed whether a local governing body could require permits from oil and gas operators for the use of local roads.op.att y,wl.the ag found such permits to be an impermissible interference with a valid permit issued by the loc.id.likewise,ordinance greatly complicates the drilling process around cross lake and,arguably,interferes with drilling.for example,under section of the ordinance,titled approval required,the ordinance provides that drilling within the feet area may not proceed unless shreveport director of water and sewerage has found that all requirements of the ordinance are met.the ordinance then lists thirteen requirements,site diagrams,spill prevention plans,proof of insurance that must accompany an application for approval.such requirements are analogous to the road permitting requirements found invalid by louisiana courts and the ag opinion.
the prior panel also examined louisiana revised statute section f,the provision which grants exclusive authority to the loc to regulate drilling in louisiana.the panel found one passage from the statute particularly significant 
the statute provides that n o other agency or political subdivision of the state shall have the authority,and they are hereby expressly forbidden,to prohibit or in any way interfere with the drilling of a well or test well in search of minerals by the holder of such permit.
energy mgmt.i,at quoting.f.this language compelled the panel to conclude that it was clear that the process of regulating when and where an oil and gas well may be drilled is entirely vested in the loc.id.finally,the panel noted that the statute gives the commissioner of the loc authority to issue regulations and orders to ensure ground water aquifer safety,which is the same concern motivating the adoption of ordinance.id.
the holding of the prior opinion is clear,in fact,the prior panel leads off by unequivocally stating in the introductory paragraph,we find that ordinance is preempted by louisiana comprehensive regulation of oil and gas drilling.perhaps,as counsel for shreveport argued,the ambiguity in this case lies in the concluding paragraph of the opinion.there,the court stated that the ordinance is preempted by state law and is invalid to the extent that it purports to prohibit the drilling of oil and gas wells in an area within the state of louisiana.energy mgmt.i,at emphasis added.we agree that this language,invalid to the extent that,when read out of context and not in conjunction with the entire opinion,is seemingly limiting as we have explained,however,we do not agree that it was intended by the prior panel to be construed as such.
therefore,we find the following three aspects of energy management i instructive and supportive of our conclusion that ordinance is preempted in its entirety the express language of energy management i does not suggest the ordinance was intended to be invalid only to the limited extent urged by shreveport the cases and the ag opinions on which the prior panel relied relate to more than drilling and therefore suggest to us that energy management i addressed aspects of the ordinance beyond drilling prohibition in the feet zone,contrary to shreveport argument.section f provides that local political subdivisions are expressly forbidden to in any way interfere with the drilling of a well.accordingly,we hold the prior panel opinion held that ordinance is entirely preempted by state law.
b.the district court determination regarding damages 
standard of review 
we review legal conclusions underlying an award of damages de novo.hispanic circus,rex trucking,cir.if the district court committed no legal error,we review its factual findings for clear error.id.
the district court declined to award damages on the basis that the oil and gas underlying the feet zone is not lost.in dismissing emc damages claim,the district court cited the rule of capture,which governs the ownership rights of landowners over the natural resources underlying their land.see.under the rule of capture,o wnership of land does not include ownership of oil and gas the landowner has the exclusive right to explore and develop his property for the production of such minerals and to reduce them to possession and ownership.id.it is indisputable that this is the law in louisiana,but emc urges that there are other avenues for recovery for a mineral lease owner who has lost the ability to enjoy his lease rights.
emc claims that the rule of capture is inapplicable to this case,and that it is entitled to damages under state law.emc explains it established by a preponderance of uncontroverted evidence at trial that the value of lost production from two specific was.furthermore,emc argues that the district court reasoning is without merit because emc lost its mineral leases and,along with that,its ownership rights in the leases and minerals,specifically as a result of shreveport enforcement of ordinance.emc,however,has not clearly explained to us its underlying cause of,how it overcomes the hurdle of its state law takings claim being prescribed emc states that extends protection to all rights guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment and that it provides an independent federal remedy regardless of the availability of an adequate remedy under state law.emc does not offer further explanation regarding the nature of its claim except to state that the takings claim is an alternative claim in case the ordinance was found valid.notwithstanding emc argument,the record reflects that the energy management i panel held that emc takings claim was prescribed therefore,emc takings claim is without merit.
as another potential damage recovery avenue,emc briefly turns from state law to federal law,alleging that shreveport violated its due process rights under the fourteenth amendment,in that the ordinance is arbitrary and unreasonable and that the means employed by the ordinance lack a real and substantial relation to the goal shreveport seeks to achieve.the essence of emc argument is to urge a substantive due process claim under.even though the prior panel made no mention of any claim,we will analyze whether emc should be awarded damages for a substantive due process violation under 
section provides a civil remedy in federal court for violations,under color of state law,of the rights,privileges and immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.findeisen indep.sch,cir.section extends protection to all rights guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment,including substantive due process.id.at.in determining whether emc has alleged a substantive due process violation,this court reviews shreveport actions against the deferential rational basis test that governs substantive due process.simi inv.harris county,cir.in the initial step of this analysis,emc must demonstrate that it has a constitutionally protected property right to which the fourte
