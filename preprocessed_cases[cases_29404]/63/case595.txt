the issue in this case is whether an insurer that posted a million bond to supersede an adverse judgment against its insured may intervene in the insured appeal to assert a potentially dispositive issue that its insured abandoned in order to settle certain uninsured claims in another pending lawsuit.the court of appeals denied the insurer motion to intervene,and the insurer petitioned this court for mandamus relief.we hold that,under the unique facts presented,the court of appeals abused its discretion and,accordingly,conditionally grant the writ of mandamus.
background 
sonat exploration company the owner of several gas wells in louisiana,entered into a master service agreement msa with cudd pressure control.the agreement provided that cudd would conduct snubbing operations,which involved forcing pipe into sonat wells during procedures.the msa provided that cudd and sonat would defend and indemnify each other for any claims brought by their respective employees.it also contained language that sonat contends,in a separate lawsuit,required cudd to provide insurance coverage to sonat lumbermens mutual casualty company was cudd insurer at the time the parties entered into the msa.
in,an explosion occurred during snubbing operations at the otto cummings.well in louisiana.the explosion killed seven people,including four cudd employees,and severely injured three others.when cudd employees and their families brought and lawsuits in texas against cudd and sonat,cudd refused to indemnify sonat and lumbermens did not provide coverage to sonat.as a result,sonat filed a against cudd for indemnity,which was severed from the suit and constitutes the underlying proceeding here sonat also filed a separate action against lumbermens and cudd,claiming that it was an additional insured under cudd policy and,alternatively,that cudd had breached a contractual obligation to procure insurance covering sonat.
sonat eventually settled the suits,and the underlying indemnity action proceeded.one of the issues presented was whether texas or louisiana law applied to the indemnity claim.the parties contended the issue was potentially dispositive because under louisiana statutory law the msa indemnity provision was void,while under texas law it was valid.the trial court granted partial summary judgment in sonat favor,holding that texas law applied and sonat was entitled to indemnity for the damages it had paid to settle the cudd employees lawsuits the case went to trial on damages only,and the jury returned a million verdict in sonat favor upon which the trial court rendered judgment.cudd filed a notice of appeal from the trial court judgment and from all other ruling s,orders and judgments rendered against cudd in this matter.lumbermens posted the million appellate security,and sonat has not offered to release lumbermens from that obligation.
after cudd perfected its appeal in the indemnity case underlying this mandamus proceeding,cudd and sonat entered into a rule agreement in the suit pursuant to which cudd agreed to forgo any further challenge to the trial court ruling,and sonat agreed to nonsuit its pending claim against cudd.two days later,cudd filed its appellate brief in the indemnity appeal,which did not raise the issue.sonat then filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its claim pursuant to the rule agreement,which the trial court granted.ten weeks after cudd filed its appellate brief,lumbermens sought leave to intervene in the court of appeals in order to preserve the issue.the court of appeals denied lumbermens motion,and the appeal remains pending in that court.
ii.standard of review 
at the outset,we note that the issue presented has been somewhat miscast.lumbermens contends the equitable doctrine entitles it to intervene on appeal to assert the issue that its insured abandoned.under that doctrine,a litigant is deemed to be a party if it will be bound by the judgment,its privity of interest appears from the record,and there is an identity of interest between the litigant and a named party to the judgment.motor vehicle bd.of el paso indep.auto.dealers ass n.because one who is virtually represented is already deemed to be a party,theoretically it is not required to intervene in order to appeal.city of san benito rio grande valley gas.however,as a practical matter,one who seeks to invoke the doctrine in order to assert an interest on appeal must take some timely,appropriate action to attain status.see city of san benito,at noting that unnamed class member invoking doctrine had not been laying behind the log by waiting until eve of settlement to intervene el paso indep.auto.dealers ass n,at examining whether party seeking to appeal based on the doctrine had waived its rights cont l cas.huizar,holding that insurer waived right to appeal because it voluntarily paid judgment against insured.in this case,lumbermens filed a motion to intervene in the court of appeals,a vehicle we consider appropriate to obtain status if lumbermens meets the requirements necessary to assert the doctrine,and if equitable considerations do not weigh against allowing lumbermens to participate on appeal.
given the relatively unique procedural posture of this case,it is not surprising that we have not articulated the standard of review by which to measure the court of appeals denial of lumbermens intervention.the parties here assume that an standard governs our review,and we agree.when reviewing a trial court decision to strike a party intervention under rule of the rules of civil procedure we apply an standard.guar.fed.sav.bank horseshoe operating.and although rule does not speak to a party effort to intervene on appeal,we have generally applied an standard when a party seeks mandamus relief from a court of appeals order limiting appellate rights.see rios calhoon,union fire ins.ninth court of appeals.accordingly,we review the court of appeals decision for abuse of discretion.
iii.parties arguments 
lumbermens contends the court of appeals abused its discretion in rejecting lumbermens intervention because,as cudd insurer and the party that posted the appellate security,lumbermens is bound by the judgment in the case.accordingly,lumbermens claims it is entitled to appeal the trial court ruling under the doctrine of virtual representation.see city of san benito,at.lumbermens acknowledges that our rules of procedure provide no specific mechanism for allowing a party to intervene for the first time on appeal.but lumbermens maintains that the million bond it posted to secure the underlying judgment and its potential liability for that judgment vest it with an interest protected under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and the provision of the texas constitution.const.amend.xiv.const.art.i.lumbermens further claims it had no cause to intervene before cudd elected not to contest the trial court determination on appeal.until that point,lumbermens contends,its insured adequately represented lumbermens interests.
on the other hand,sonat claims the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying lumbermens intervention.according to sonat,the doctrine does not entitle lumbermens to participate in the appeal because there must be an identity of interests between the party claiming the doctrine benefit lumbermens and a party to the judgment cudd,and lumbermens has expressly acknowledged that its and cudd interests have diverged.sonat further contends lumbermens has no stake in the appellate proceedings because,if cudd does not prevail in its appeal,lumbermens can invoke a noncooperation clause in cudd policy to deny coverage and ultimately avoid the judgment.sonat also contends that,if lumbermens desired to intervene,it had to do so before the trial court rendered a final judgment and any attempt to intervene on appeal was untimely.and even if intervention on appeal was permissible,sonat maintains,lumbermens waited too long to avail itself of that procedure by failing to seek leave until after all the appellate briefing was completed.finally,sonat asserts that allowing intervention would be bad public policy because it could complicate virtually all appellate proceedings involving liability insurance by enabling insurers to their insureds decisions regarding the appropriate issues to raise on appeal.such a course,contends sonat,would be inconsistent with texas status as a state that generally does not permit insurers to join in tort actions against their insureds.see.civ.c prohibiting joinder of a liability or indemnity insurance company unless the insurer is liable by statute or contract to the injured person.civ.b same.
iv.requirements 
generally,only parties of record may appeal a trial court judgment.el paso indep.auto.dealers ass n,at.on a few occasions,though,we have determined that a person or entity who was not a named party in the trial court may pursue an appeal in order to vindicate important rights.in el paso independent automobile dealers ass n,for example,we held that the court of appeals erred in dismissing the motor vehicle board and attorney general appeal of a judgment declaring texas blue law unconstitutional.id.at.in the underlying case,the el paso independent automobile dealers association sued the el paso district,city,and county attorneys seeking a declaration that the blue law,which made it illegal to sell cars on consecutive weekend days,was unconstitutional.id.at.although the association petition did not name the board or the attorney general as defendants,the association served the attorney general with a copy of its petition in compliance with section b of the texas civil practice and remedies code.id.the attorney general,by letter,declined to participate in the case.although the local officials filed a general denial,they ultimately concluded that the blue law was,in fact,unconstitutional and negotiated a pretrial agreement for findings of fact and conclusions of law in line with that conclusion.id.after the trial court rendered judgment declaring the blue law unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement,the attorney general and the board filed motions in an attempt to intervene.id.the trial court denied the motions.id.we held that the attorney general and the board,who bore responsibilities,were entitled to appeal under the doctrine.id.at.similarly,in city of san benito,we held that unnamed class members who had contested the fairness of a proposed settlement and attempted to opt out of a class action were entitled to appeal the settlement under the same doctrine.city of san benito,at.
in this case,sonat contends lumbermens may not invoke the doctrine benefit because lumbermens has acknowledged that its interests and cudd have diverged,in that cudd no longer wishes to contest the trial court decision.lumbermens responds that its and cudd ultimate reverse the underlying the same.we agree with lumbermens.the identity of interest upon which the doctrine in this case turns relates to protecting the funds that the underlying judgment puts at risk.see huizar,at gonzalez,dissenting that different legal theories may be asserted to defend those funds does not defeat the identity of interest between lumbermens and cudd that the insuring contract creates and the doctrine protects.
in any event,our decisions in el paso independent automobile dealers ass and city of san benito illustrate that the position of one who relies on the doctrine to appeal and the party that formerly represented its interests will have often,if not always,diverged to some extent by the time the beneficiary of the doctrine invokes it.in el paso automobile dealers ass n,for example,the interests of the attorney general and the motor vehicle board in defending the blue laws constitutionality were initially protected by the local attorneys.not until those attorneys abandoned their defense of the statute did the need arise for the attorney general and the board to directly participate in order to protect their interests.despite the diverging positions of the state and local entities regarding the blue law constitutionality,we held that the attorney general and the board were entitled to appeal.at.and in city of san benito,the interests of the named class representatives who supported the proposed class settlement had clearly diverged from those of the settlement opponents.see at.thus,that lumbermens interest in pursuing the issue had diverged from cudd by the time lumbermens filed its intervention motion does not defeat lumbermens ability to participate in the appeal pursuant to the doctrine.
sonat contends lumbermens should not be allowed to invoke the doctrine because it can ultimately avoid coverage for the judgment by invoking a noncooperation clause in cudd policy.but irrespective of any potential coverage dispute between lumbermens and cudd,lumbermens has pledged million to secure the judgment in sonat favor.even if lumbermens could eventually recoup the amount it has pledged through a potential coverage suit against cudd,its obligation to pay the underlying judgment to sonat is immediate and binding in the event cudd appeal is unsuccessful.
in this case,neither the fact that cudd and lumbermens interests in pursuing appeal of the issue have diverged,nor the possibility that lumbermens could later assert a noncooperation defense against cudd,prevent lumbermens from invoking the doctrine.but because the doctrine is equitable,we must determine whether other considerations weigh against applying the doctrine to allow lumbermens intervention on appeal.see huizar,at holding that right to appeal insurer may have had under doctrine was waived by voluntary payment of judgment see also gonzalez banco cent,cir v irtual representation is best understood as an equitable theory rather than as a crisp rule with sharp corners and clear factual predicates such that a party status as a virtual representative of a nonparty must be determined on a basis.citation omitted tyus schoemehl,cir see city of san benito,at emphasizing that intervening class members had preserved appellate rights by attempting to opt out of class and objecting to settlement.
timing considerations 
sonat contends that,even if lumbermens had a right to participate on appeal,the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying lumbermens intervention because lumbermens only attempted to do so after the trial court judgment became final.ordinarily,a trial court does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to intervene after the court has rendered a final judgment.comal county rural high sch.dist.nelson.but our decisions in city of san benito and el paso independent automobile dealers ass demonstrate that one who has been virtually represented may be entitled to invoke a right of participation as a named party after judgment has been rendered.those decisions stem from our recognition that t o hold otherwise would deprive nonnamed parties who will be bound by a judgment of the power to preserve their own interests.city of san benito,at quoting devlin scardelletti,d see also united airlines,mcdonald,d holding that member of putative class was entitled to intervene to appeal denial of class certification after trial court rendered final judgment incorporating named plaintiffs settlement with defendant ross marshall,cir holding that insurer that correctly anticipated its insured would drop its appeal was entitled to intervene to appeal adverse judgment against insured.it is true that,because virtual representation is an equitable doctrine,other factors may weigh against allowing intervention after final judgment has been rendered.while other equitable factors may weigh against allowing a party to invoke appellate rights,the mere fact that the party does not attempt to invoke those rights until after judgment,when the need to invoke them arose,is not dispositive.
timeliness 
sonat argues that lumbermens is not entitled to intervene because it did not attempt to do so until after cudd filed its reply brief in the court of appeals,ten weeks after sonat nonsuited its claims and cudd failed to raise the issue in its initial appellate brief.we have never articulated a particular standard for evaluating the timeliness of a party effort to invoke appellate rights.but we find useful the test that the fifth circuit has recently
