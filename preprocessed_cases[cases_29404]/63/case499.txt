these are consolidated appeals from judgments of the united states court of federal claims dismissing the claims against the united states.the plaintiffs in the first case are conocophillips,conoco,and phillips petroleum company collectively,conocophillips.the plaintiff in the second case is la gloria oil and gas company.the appeals focus on the application of the economic price adjustment clause in the plaintiffs contracts to supply fuel to the government for military uses mostly several kinds of military jet fuel.because the plaintiffs have not shown that the economic price adjustment clause was unlawful,that there was a material mistake in the formation of the contracts,or that there was a breach of contract,we affirm the trial court dismissal of those claims in both appeals.however,we reverse the trial court jurisdictional dismissal of la gloria claims that the government small business and minority programs unlawfully reduced the prices of la gloria contracts,and we remand those claims for further proceedings.
the plaintiffs entered into multiple contracts with the defense energy support center,a purchasing agent for the department of defense,to supply fuel.each of the contracts at issue in these appeals contained an economic price adjustment clause that caused the contract price to be adjusted each month based on a publication known as the petroleum marketing monthly pmm.the pmm is a report by the department of energy that calculates the weighted average price of particular groups of related fuels within five geographic regions.that computation is based on monthly sales data that all refiners are required to submit to the government.after all the contracts at issue had been fully performed,the plaintiffs brought suit in the court of federal claims seeking reformation of the contracts economic adjustment clauses so as to increase the amount due to them under the contracts.
the plaintiffs offered several theories to justify reformation.their principal contention was that the pmm failed to serve as an accurate measure of changes in the market price for the fuels sold pursuant to the contracts.for that reason,they argued,the use of the pmm in the price adjustment clause violated governing regulations,was the result of a mutual or unilateral mistake,and resulted in a breach of the government obligation to pay a fair market price for the fuel.the plaintiffs also argued that reformation of the contracts was necessary to compensate them for the effects of alleged constitutional and regulatory violations related to the government small business and minority preference programs.the trial court rejected all the plaintiffs claims,and the plaintiffs now appeal.
the plaintiffs first contend that the contracts use of the pmm as the basis for price adjustments is contrary to the applicable provision of the federal acquisition regulation far because the pmm was not,was not designed or intended to be used to set or adjust prices,and did not reflect at least the fair market value of military fuel.the pertinent far provision,a ed,allowed the price of goods in certain contracts to be adjusted based on increases or decreases from an level in published or otherwise established prices of specific items or the contract end items.the far defined established market prices as current prices that i are established in the course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and ii can be substantiated by data from sources independent of the manufacturer or vendor.c ed.
in tesoro hawaii united states,which dealt with the same price adjustment clause that is at issue in these cases,we held that the far permitted price adjustment clauses to be based on prices that were established by reference to either a catalog or market sources independent of the manufacturer or vendor.the appellant argued that the pmm could not be used as the basis for a price adjustment because it did not reflect either the contractor price or a catalog price,any other vendor current price.id.at.we rejected that argument,stating that desc use of a epa clause tied to the pmm was authorized under the far.id.
the government points to that statement in tesoro and argues that it disposes of all of the plaintiffs legal challenges to the use of the pmm in these cases.we do not interpret tesoro so broadly,however.while we upheld the use of the pmm against each of the challenges raised by the plaintiffs in tesoro,the plaintiffs in the instant cases have raised an additional and somewhat different argument that requires separate treatment.in these appeals,the plaintiffs contend not only that the pmm did not represent the contractor price or any vendor established price,but also that the pmm was not designed to provide,and did not in fact provide,an accurate measure of the actual and fair market price of the fuels that were the subjects of the contracts.for that reason,they contend that the pmm violated the regulatory requirement that price adjustments be based on published or otherwise established prices.a ed.
the trial court in conoco rejected the plaintiffs argument on the ground that the regulatory requirement that price adjustments be based on increases or decreases from an level in established prices of specific items,a ed,is satisfied if the adjustments are based on market sources independent of the manufacturer or vendor,conocophillips united states,citing tesoro,at.the court concluded that the pmm,as a market publication that compiles the monthly average sales figures reported by refiners,qualified as such a source and therefore satisfied the requirements of the far provision at issue.
we agree with the trial court that the pmm is a compilation of sales figures that constitutes a sufficiently accurate measure of established prices to qualify as a permissible mechanism for price adjustment under far a.it is undisputed that the pmm values reflect the industry actual sales data for a particular month and that the pmm calculates the market price for various fuel groups in different regions by computing an average of the price of each fuel group in each region.the price is thus established by reference to actual sales,independent of the contract manufacturer or vendor.it is also established in the course of ordinary and usual trade between buyer and seller free to bargain,in that it is derived from actual sales of the fuel.whether the pmm was designed or intended to be used to adjust prices is immaterial,as the regulations do not impose any such requirement.
the pmm use of an amalgamation of related products does not render the pmm ineligible to serve as the basis for a price adjustment clause under the regulations.the language of far a,which allowed the contract price to be adjusted based on increases or decreases in published or otherwise established prices for particular items,gave the contracting parties substantial freedom to use references to identify established prices.tesoro,at.under that standard,it was permissible to use a published weighted average of multiple reference items if the reference items are sufficiently similar to the contract items that it was reasonable,at the time the parties entered into the contract,to expect the index to approximate the change in the market price of the contract item.the regulations did not require the use of particular vendors prices,and they also did not require the use of any particular measure of the market.in such a setting,it is not surprising that the regulations gave the parties some flexibility in choosing how price adjustments would be calculated.absent some degree of flexibility,contractual agreements would constantly be subject to through litigation over whether the method chosen in advance for price adjustment turned out after the fact to correlate sufficiently closely to what each party regards as the correct measure of market price.
relying on their experts reports,the plaintiffs complain that the pmm suffers from an index number problem.according to those reports,the index number problem is a result of the fact that the pmm represents a weighted average by volume of multiple different products sold across many lo
