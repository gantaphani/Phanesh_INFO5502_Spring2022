this appeal concerns a dispute under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa.et.the pmpa was enacted by congress in to protect gasoline franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or nonrenewal of their franchises.esso standard oil dep t of consumer affairs,cir.congress noted that the disparity of bargaining power existing between franchisors and franchisees sometimes resulted in franchise agreements that amounted to contracts of adhesion.id.
plaintiff esso standard oil company puerto rico esso had a franchise agreement with defendant jos√© monroig.esso and monroig could not agree to the terms of a renewal agreement,and esso sought a declaratory judgment from the district court that it had satisfied the requirements of the pmpa.in turn,monroig asked for a preliminary injunction under the pmpa to maintain the franchise relationship.the district court denied monroig request for a preliminary injunction,and monroig appeals.we affirm.
background 
beginning in january,monroig ran an esso gas station as a franchisee.under a contract from january,to january,monroig paid monthly rent of.on july,esso sent monroig a contract for a new lease that would begin on january.under this contract,the rent increased by about five percent for each of the first two years to and and did not further increase the third year.other modifications included the removal of a radiator repair shop from the premises and a prohibition against assignment or sublease of the premises.monroig disputed the terms of the renewal.on september,esso sent monroig a notice of nonrenewal based on the parties failure to agree to the terms of the renewal.
for the purpose of continuing negotiations,esso granted five extensions to the prior contract.the last extension expired on june,and since the parties had not come to an agreement,esso stopped delivering gasoline the next day.
ii.notice under the pmpa 
under the pmpa,the franchisor must provide adequate notice to the franchisee of the nonrenewal of the franchise agreement.the general rule is that notice must be given at least days before the nonrenewal takes effect.a.an exception to this general rule allows the franchisor to provide notice on the earliest,reasonably practicable date where the circumstances make a notice unreasonable.id.b.the district court did not address the notice requirements,stating that monroig did not allege that the notice was somehow defective.because our review of the record indicates that monroig did indeed press this point below,we now address the issue.
other aspects of the pmpa must be considered in conjunction with the notice requirements.the pmpa offers a preliminary injunction standard to franchisees that is more forgiving than the common law standard,see id.b,but in order to take advantage of this more forgiving standard,the franchisee request must be timely,see id.b.the timeliness of the franchisee request for a preliminary injunction depends on the notice it received.if a franchisee receives at least days notice,then it has days from the date of its receipt of the notice to file a preliminary injunction motion.id.b a.if a franchisee receives less than a notice,then it has days from the date of the nonrenewal to file a preliminary injunction motion.id.b c.
the existing franchise agreement between esso and monroig was due to expire on january,and esso sent monroig a notice of nonrenewal days before this date.absent other circumstances,this notice would clearly have been sufficient under a.esso argues that it complied with the pmpa and that monroig was required to seek a preliminary injunction by january.monroig argues that the notice was essentially revoked by esso because the parties continued to negotiate for six more months,until june.further,monroig contends that the statute should not be construed to require him to seek a preliminary injunction while in the midst of negotiating a renewal.
we think that the circumstances of this case justify the application of the alternative notice requirements of b.in the absence of any extensions to the original contract,esso had complied with the pmpa notice requirements.this notice is not revoked by the parties mutual agreement to extend the original contract for the purpose of continuing negotiations.monroig knew very well that the failure to come to an agreement on the terms of the renewal meant an end to the franchise relationship.monroig did not know,however,the definitive date of the nonrenewal until the contract negotiations permanently ceased.the pmpa requires the franchisor to include in its notice the date on which nonrenewal takes effect.id.c b.under these circumstances,we find that esso gave notice to monroig of the definitive date of nonrenewal on the earliest,reasonably practicable date.see id.b.
we believe that this outcome supports the policy concerns underlying the pmpa.a franchisor who initially satisfies the notice requirements of a and then continues negotiations with a franchisee is not penalized for its efforts to reach a compromise agreement.in addition,a franchisee is not required to file a preliminary injunction motion while negotiations are ongoing,which would not be conducive to fostering an agreement between the parties.see id.b c.
iii.preliminary injunction standard 
we now address the proper standard for determining whether the preliminary injunction should be granted.esso urges the standard,see bl a ck tea soc y city of boston,cir,and monroig urges the standard outlined in the pmpa,see b.the pmpa authorizes a standard for granting preliminary injunctions that is more forgiving than the common law standard,but in order to benefit from this standard,the franchisee must be timely in its request for a preliminary injunction.see id.b.the pmpa does not specify what a district court should do if the franchisee is tardy in its request.to determine the proper standard,we must determine whether monroig was timely and,if not,what the proper course of action should be.
timeliness 
given our discussion of the notice requirements,above,we have no problem finding that monroig did not timely seek a preliminary injunction.pursuant to our determination that esso gave notice to monroig on the earliest,reasonably practicable date under b,monroig had days from the nonrenewal to timely request a preliminary injunction.id.b c.monroig requested a preliminary injunction on september,which was more than days after the nonrenewal date of june.
standard for an untimely request 
the pmpa does not provide much guidance to courts considering an untimely request for a preliminary injunction.the pmpa merely states that the court need not exercise its equity powers to compel continuation or renewal of the franchise relationship if such action was not timely commenced.id.b.no circuit court has yet addressed this issue.the district court below noted that other district courts have taken three different approaches when the franchisee is tardy in seeking equitable relief outright dismissal of the franchisee claim for equitable relief reliance in part upon the franchisee failure to timely commence an action in denying equitable relief and adjudge the request under the common law standard.see esso std.oil monroig zayas,d.the district court found the third option to be the better reasoned approach and applied the standard.id.we agree with the district court that this is the proper approach.
in the absence of the more forgiving preliminary injunction standard described in the pmpa,courts would apply the standard,which does not include any specific time limitations.congress created the pmpa to rectify the disparity of bargaining power existing between franchisors and franchisees.dep t of consumer affairs,at.by creating a more forgiving preliminary injunction standard in the pmpa,congress gave more power to franchisees.we do not think that congress intended to give with one hand and take away with the other.applying the standard to untimely requests for injunctions therefore comports well with the underlying purpose of the pmpa.
iv.preliminary injunction 
we now apply the standard.we weigh four factors in determining whether a preliminary injunction should
