background 
colonial is a corporation engaged in interstate commerce as a common carrier of refined petroleum products and operates a large diameter refined petroleum pipeline extending from pasadena,texas,to linden,new jersey new york harbor,with stub lines serving parts of tennessee.colonial pipeline is the largest refined petroleum products pipeline in the world,and serves as a transportation system for heating oil,diesel fuel,kerosene,jet fuel and gasoline.colonial has operated the pipeline in tennessee for more than forty years.
under tennessee code annotated g,colonial real and personal property is classified and assessed as public utility property.under a,colonial property is appraised and assessed by the comptroller of the treasury,office of state assessed properties osap.osap appraises colonial property as a single unit pursuant to.the unit value of colonial,which traverses thirteen states,is apportioned to tennessee by a recognized apportionment formula.see and osap then applies the public utility assessment percentage of to tennessee share of colonial unit value.
the record indicates that in the,airlines and railroads sued the tennessee state board of equalization the board or the state board seeking ad valorem tax relief in the form of equalization of ad valorem taxes.prior to this legal action,all public utility operating property in tennessee was assessed at of its equalized value,whether real property or person property.on september,the lawsuit resulted in a new form of equalization adjustment factor to the personal property portion of public utility property.
the classification of colonial property as either real or personal property before september,is not legally significant because both the real and personal property of public utility companies was assessed and taxed at the same rate prior to the equalization adjustment.def.br.at on october,colonial applied to the state board to classify colonial operating pipeline property in tennessee as personal property.subsequently,osap recommended to the state board that substantially all of colonial operating pipeline property be classified as real property,thereby substantially depriving colonial of the equalization relief afforded to personal property by the state board order of september.the board consolidated numerous pipeline classification appeals and on january,an administrative law judge alj conducted a hearing on the appeals.on january,the alj upheld the pipeline classification as real property.on february,colonial appealed to the board.the board held a hearing on january,and affirmed the alj decision on march.on may,colonial appealed the board decision to the tennessee court of appeals.on december,the tennessee court of appeals reversed the board decision finding that the pipelines and surface equipment shall be treated as personal property for purposes of ad valorem taxation.anr pipeline.bd.of equalization,no,wl,at,unpublished case o n february,the state board filed an application for permission to appeal in the supreme court of tennessee.the application was denied on june.pursuant to anr pipeline,osap classified colonial pipeline as personal property for.

on august,colonial appealed its ad valorem property tax assessment.on august,a hearing was held on colonial appeal.on september,colonial received a letter from the comptroller officer stating that t he exception filed on behalf of the company raised issues regarding equalization and classification the issue of classification is a matter pending litigation.colonial maintains that the letter indicates that the board deems itself not to be the proper forum for an administrative appeal of the classification issued presented by the amendment to.colonial filed an appeal with the board on september.since no hearing was scheduled to address the appeal,colonial sued numerous tennessee state agencies and officials in federal court on february,alleging that it ha d no plain,adequate,or complete remedy at law to redress the wrongs complained of apart from the filing of this action.
in the district court,colonial argued that the amendment to deprives it of equalization of the ad valorem taxation of its personal property,and maintained that the pipeline classification as real property is arbitrary,capricious,invidiously discriminatory and without a rational relation to any legitimate government interest in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the tennessee constitution.colonial contended that while motor,airplanes and assessed at a forty percent tax rate for real property and thirty percent for personal property,colonial property is assessed at percent even though it provides and performs similar transportation and delivery services.colonial asserts it is no different from any other transportation company and should be treated the same for property tax purposes.colonial alleges that since tennessee definition of real property was enacted with a discriminatory purpose and results in discriminatory ad valorem taxation,the classification constitutes discrimination against and an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce and supremacy clauses.
colonial sought declaratory and injunctive relief.more specifically,colonial asked the district court to declare that tennessee state statutes governing real property classifications,including,are unconstitutional and unenforceable,and enjoin tennessee from classifying and assessing colonial property in any way other than as provided in anr pipeline,wl,at.
on march,defendants moved to dismiss colonial complaint under.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction arguing that the tax injunction act,and comity principles barred colonial from suing in federal court.defendants maintained that colonial has a plain,speedy and efficient remedy before the board and tennessee state courts.contrary to colonial allegation that no hearing was scheduled to address its appeal,defendants filed an affidavit from an alj assigned to colonial appeal indicating that a status conference was held on september.defendants proffered an affidavit from the comptroller office stating that nothing in the september,letter was intended to indicate that the board was unable or unwilling to entertain colonial appeal of the assessment.
for its part,colonial maintained that a s shown by the taped transcripts of the legislative committee hearings,the individual defendants,members of the state board,acting in concert with members of the tennessee general assembly,actively pursued legislative activity during the legislative session which culminated in the passage and signing of chapter,the contents of which are in direct conflict with colonial position.colonial filed a motion under.d asking for an opportunity to discover facts that would support its allegations of federal jurisdiction.
on november,in a page decision,the district court found that 
the facts presented to the court,while lengthy,are relatively simple and substantially undisputed.the only material factual dispute appears to concern the meaning of the september,letter.taking the letter and the other facts in the light most favorable to colonial,as the court would ordinarily do on a motion for summary judgment,the court finds there are no genuine issues of material fact that require a preliminary hearing or trial before the court may rule on defendants motion to dismiss under rule b.
see colonial pipeline morgan,the district court noted that t he tennessee court of appeals previously demonstrated that it can and will consider colonial constitutional claims because it ruled in favor of colonial and other pipelines in reversing the board property classification decision in.it further noted that 
colonial last involvement with the state review process took more than five years from start to finish,but the undisputed record reflects multiple parties were involved in a complex administrative proceeding.colonial began the state review process again in september,but has allowed the administrative matter to languish while it pursued relief before the tennessee tax study commission,the tennessee general assembly,and in this federal court.defendants produced evidence that the matter remains pending on the state administrative proceeding calendar.
the court found that a taxpayer intentional bypass of state remedies is exactly what the tax injunction act was designed to ward off,and the act bars federal subject matter jurisdiction where taxpayers pursue federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes or to gain a refund of state taxes.alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss holding that as a matter of law colonial does have a plain,speedy and efficient remedy and that the tax injunction act bars this suit.
on november,colonial filed a motion for reconsideration.on january,the district court denied colonial motion.the district court indicated that the court assumed in colonial favor all of the evidence.emphasis in original.it further indicated that m ost of the information in colonial reply brief to defendants motion to dismiss is the same information colonial now includes within its memorandum of law in support of plaintiff motion to reconsider and in the hundreds of pages of deposition testimony and exhibits colonial filed after this case was closed.colonial has not pointed to any intervening change in controlling law,nor is of the case necessary to avoid a manifest injustice.the court carefully considered all of the parties evidence and legal arguments.the court memorandum and order expressly addressed each of the points colonial now seeks to in its motion to reconsider.there is nothing more the court can add to what it already said.colonial filed a notice of appeal on february.
on appeal,colonial argues that the district court erred in finding that the tax injunction act was a bar to federal jurisdiction in the instant case.colonial maintains that tennessee can not provide colonial with a fair and impartial administrative review because the board has prejudged the issues,has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this case,and is not independent of the tennessee executive branch.colonial br.at in addition,colonial argues that the board does not have authority to address the constitutional challenge raised in the instant case,and highlights that its prior appeal took over five years to complete.last,colonial argues that the public policy concerns which the tax injunction act was enacted to address are not present in the instant case.

the tax injunction act 
the district court properly dismissed colonial complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the tax injunction act prohibits colonial from challenging in federal court.in pertinent part,the tax injunction act provides 
t he district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.
the tax injunction act has its roots in equity practice,in principles of federalism,and in recognition of the imperative need of a state to administer its own fiscal operations.tully griffin,d.a federal district court is under an equitable duty to refrain from interfering with a state collection of its revenue except in cases where an asserted federal right might otherwise be lost.id.at.see king sloane,cir the federal courts will not entertain actions for relief from state or local taxes unless federal rights are protected in no other way.see also mandel hutchinson,cir strong public policy of federal noninterference with state taxation schemes has been statutorily embodied in.by express statutory provision,congress has directed that federal courts shall not enjoin or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of the state.king,at.the overall purpose of the tax injunction act is consistent with the view that the plain,speedy and efficient remedy exception to the act prohibition was only designed to require that the state remedy satisfy certain procedural criteria.rosewell lasalle nat.bank,d.since the tax injunction act limit s drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes,california grace brethren church,d quotation marks and citation omitted,a district court does not have jurisdiction over state and local tax matters where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy is available in state court.
the supreme court has interpreted the plain,speedy and efficient exception of the tax injunction act narrowly.see grace brethren church,at.we must construe narrowly the plain,speedy and efficient exception to the tax injunction act.a state remedy is plain,speedy and efficient if it provides the aggrieved party with a full hearing and judicial determination at which a taxpayer may raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax,with ultimate review available in the united states supreme court.rosewell,at.quotation marks and citation omitted see also hedgepeth tennessee,cir the state need only provide a full hearing at which a taxpayer may present and secure a judicial determination at which he or she may raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax.this court has found that t he plain,speedy and efficient remedy contemplated by the tax injunction act merely requires that the state provide certain minimal procedural protections against illegal tax collection.hedgepeth,at cir.state procedures that call for an appeal to a state court from an administrative decision meet these minimal criteria.northwest airlines.state bd.of equalization,cir.the state remedy need not be the best of all possible remedies.alnoa city of houston,cir.t he likelihood of plaintiff success in the state court is not a factor to be considered when determining whether the jurisdictional prohibition of applies.cities serv.gas oklahoma tax comm n,cir.although dela
