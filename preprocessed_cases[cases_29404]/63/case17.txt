appellant manuel colón cabrera filed suit against appellee esso standard oil company under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,seeking to compel esso to remediate environmental contamination at a gas station he owned.after lengthy proceedings in the district court and in a concurrent action in the puerto rico commonwealth courts,colón cabrera filed a motion for voluntary dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure a,stating that the federal lawsuit was no longer necessary in light of esso alleged concession that it would clean up his gas station.the district court held its ruling on the motion in abeyance while the parties engaged in settlement negotiations.although it appeared for a time that the parties would be able to resolve the matter,the negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful.the district court subsequently granted colón cabrera motion,but chose to dismiss the case with prejudice pursuant to rule a and assess attorneys fees and costs against him.
colón cabrera filed this appeal,arguing that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice.the parties offer different portrayals of the proceedings below,but the issue that concerns us here is the district court emphasis on colón cabrera refusal to accept esso settlement offers.we conclude that dismissing the case with prejudice based on appellant refusal to settle was an abuse of discretion.we therefore vacate the dismissal order and remand for further proceedings 
to understand the parties positions in this case,we must explain not only the procedural history of this litigation,but also the path of the concurrent commonwealth action between the same parties that alleged similar,if not identical,claims.
a.the concurrent commonwealth action 
the parties dispute arises out of colón cabrera operation of a gas station under the esso trademark.the property on which the gas station is located turned out to be contaminated with various pollutants,and the responsibility for and extent of the necessary remediation has been a subject of much contention between the parties.
in,colón cabrera initiated a proceeding in the puerto rico commonwealth courts against esso,asserting various claims arising under puerto rico law and seeking damages.in late,he filed a motion for partial summary judgment in that case,which esso opposed in addition to filing its own motion for summary judgment.in march,the puerto rico superior court resolved the motions in colón cabrera favor,holding that esso had made a unilateral declaration of intent that bound the defendant to remediate the contamination at the gas station.the commonwealth court order required esso to investigate the extent of the contamination on appellant property and engage in the necessary remediation,as well as pay any related expenses.esso appealed the decision to the court of appeals of puerto rico.
on october,the appellate court upheld the court of first instance grant of partial summary judgment in colón cabrera favor,and remanded for further proceedings.esso filed a petition for certiorari with the supreme court of puerto rico challenging this decision.on may,the supreme court of puerto rico denied esso petition,leaving undisturbed the grant of partial summary judgment.
b.the federal action and the parties initial settlement efforts 
while the litigation in the commonwealth courts was in its appellate stages,colón cabrera filed a complaint in federal court on october,alleging violations of rcra.this complaint sought,inter alia,civil penalties and an injunction mandating that esso conduct environmental remediation at the site.the company responded with a motion to dismiss,invoking federal rules of civil procedure b and b.
while this motion was pending,the parties engaged in settlement negotiations.the parties attempts to settle the federal case broke down in late,and they decided to resume litigation.after the district court denied esso motion to dismiss on january,the company filed an answer and counterclaim in february of that year.this pleading asserted that esso had repeatedly tried to implement a remediation plan at the gas station,but that colón cabrera had denied it access to the property.
colón cabrera rule motion and the subsequent proceedings 
on march,colón cabrera filed a motion for voluntary dismissal under rule a.he stated that the parties dispute may have arisen from a miscommunication between esso and appellant retained environmental expert,as well as a misunderstanding regarding the scope of the appropriate remediation.contending that esso pleading was the first time that it had expressed a willingness to clean up the contamination of the property,and believing that this purported concession would resolve the federal case,colón cabrera sought dismissal of the federal action without prejudice and without the imposition of attorneys fees or costs.
on its own initiative,the district court immediately issued an order holding appellant motion in abeyance and directed the parties to meet and confer regarding settlement terms.after further negotiations,esso sent appellant an offer on april,which stated that esso would pay in exchange for,inter alia,the dismissal with prejudice of both the federal action and the concurrent commonwealth action.at this time,the supreme court of puerto rico had not yet ruled on esso petition for certiorari in the concurrent commonwealth action.colón cabrera rejected this offer,stating that he was unwilling to dismiss the commonwealth action until he had a better sense of the damages he could obtain via that lawsuit.at the least,he did not wish to engage in negotiations regarding damages until the remediation work had been completed at the gas station.
as the parties could not reach an accord,the district court informed them that it would move forward with a previously calendared scheduling conference on may,to discuss pretrial proceedings and trial.colón cabrera requested that the scheduling conference be converted to a settlement conference because he believed that an agreement could be reached with respect to the federal claims.the court granted this motion,and set the settlement conference for the same day as the previously set scheduling conference.the requested conference took place,but the parties could not come to terms even with the court facilitation.a text entry on the district court docket states that t he court recommended that th e case be settled and granted additional time for the parties to continue negotiations.the court also set a trial date for june.
as noted,on may,the day after the parties settlement conference,the supreme court of puerto rico denied esso petition for certiorari in the concurrent commonwealth action,meaning that the grant of partial summary judgment in colón cabrera favor remained standing.
on may,appellant filed a pleading with the court indicating that despite the settlement conference lack of success,the parties were on the verge of resolving the case.he specifically stated that the issue of monetary compensation has been resolved and that he ha d accepted the monetary compensation offered by defendant esso.he asked for more time to fine tun e the terms of the settlement and release,and stated that he would inform the court once that process was complete.
d.the june hearings and the district court order 
colón cabrera had spoken too soon.on june,about two weeks later,he filed another pleading indicating that settlement negotiations had stalled yet again.this pleading stated that esso is refusing to grant plaintiff a complete release under the same conditions that esso is requesting from plaintiff and again requested that an upcoming scheduling conference be converted to a settlement conference.the court denied that request.
the court held a pretrial conference on june.despite the court previous denial of plaintiff request to convert this hearing into a settlement conference,the parties reported the status of their negotiations to the judge and discussed with him the wording of a clause in the proposed settlement agreement that was a sticking point.this hearing was continued to a settlement conference set for the next day,when colón cabrera counsel stated that his client was still unwilling to settle.the court inquired whether appellant insisted on obtaining a release for things that are totally unrelated to this whole situation,and counsel replied in the affirmative.the parties agreed that the court should rule on colón cabrera pending rule motion but esso argued that the motion should be granted with prejudice and with the imposition of fees and costs.the court characterized the parties inability to settle the matter as very unfortunate and told plaintiff counsel that your client is a very stubborn man.the court then took the matter under submission.
two days later,the district court issued an order granting colón cabrera motion for voluntary dismissal and dismissed the case with prejudice.the court explained the essence of its decision in a brief paragraph,observing that colón cabrera had been given numerous opportunities to settle this case and that t he court granted plaintiff several extensions to negotiate the terms of the settlement and plaintiff has refused to do so.the court also stated that it had considered defendant efforts and expenses in preparing this case for trial and in offering to settle,as well as the costs associated with plaintiff repeated delays in deciding whether to settle.finally,the court stated that it would award attorneys fees and costs to esso,but did not set the award amount.
colón cabrera filed a timely motion to alter judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and for relief from judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,both of which the district court summarily denied.this appeal followed.

b.the district court analysis 
the central issue before us is whether the court abused its discretion by factoring colón cabrera refusal to settle into its decision.resolving this issue requires us to identify the precise relevance that the course of settlement negotiations may have under rule a.
voluntary dismissal under rule a is conditioned on court permission to protect the nonmovant from unfair treatment.grover by grover eli lilly,cir.such unfairness can take numerous forms,including the defendant effort and expense of preparation for trial,excessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the plaintiff in prosecuting the action,insufficient explanation of the need to take a dismissal,and the fact that a motion for summary judgment has been filed by the defendant.doe,at quoting pace express,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for example,it is appropriate to consider whether a party proposes to dismiss the case at a late stage of pretrial proceedings,or seeks to avoid an imminent adverse ruling.in re fema trailer formaldahyde prods.liab,cir see also brown.baeke,cir.a plaintiff should not be permitted to force a defendant to incur substantial costs in litigating an action,and then simply dismiss his own case and compel the defendant to litigate a wholly new proceeding.
despite the variety of circumstances that may weigh in favor of dismissing the case with prejudice,the inclusion of a plaintiff handling of settlement negotiations into this analysis requires particular care.the decision to settle is a highly subjective one that represents a desire to waive permanently a party claims for the sake of finality.see ehrheart verizon wireless,cir the choice to settle implicitly acknowledges calculated risks and reflects the deliberate decision of both parties to opt for certainty in terminating their litigation.this choice must be left to the individual litigant judgment.see del rio blower,cir there is no duty to settle cases,or to reduce one claims.while the law favors the voluntary settlement of civil suits,it does not sanction efforts by trial judges to effect settlements through coercion.kothe smith,cir citation omitted.accordingly,using the discretion conferred by rule a to penalize a plaintiff for not settling a case places too much coercive power within the hands of the district judge.see goss graphics,dev,cir if parties want to duke it out,that their privilege.
as this case procedural history shows,the district court played an assertive role in facilitating settlement talks between the parties.the court put substantial effort into encouraging negotiations,including deferring a ruling on the rule motion and holding settlement conferences with the parties.some of these actions were taken in response to appellant requests,and were directed toward the laudatory goal of bringing the case to a less acrimonious and conclusion.we appreciate the district court efforts in this regard.
nevertheless,the record also demonstrates that the district court permitted the information gleaned through its involvement with the settlement talks to exert undue influence over its disposition of appellant rule motion.the written order on the motion notes colón cabrera numerous opportunities to settle this case and his refusal to do so despite being given several extensions of time.the order also notes esso efforts and expenses in preparing this case for trial and in offering to settle,as well as the costs it incurred during colón cabrera repeated delays in deciding whether to settle.these facts are identified as the basis for dismissing the case with prejudice.these observations echo the disappointment the court expressed from the bench at the june,hearing,where it called colón cabrera refusal to settle very unfortunate and chastised him for his obstinacy.
given these statements,it is clear that the district court disfavored colón cabrera rejection of multiple opportunities to settle his federal case,blamed him for the failed settlement talks,and decided that appellant conduct justified dismissal with prejudice.relying on colón cabrera failure to settle was an abuse of discretion.even if the district court view of the settlement talks had a legitimate basis,dismissing the case with prejudice based on colón cabrera adherence to his negotiating position effectively penalized appellant for not resolving his claims in the manner that the district court viewed as most reasonable.using rule in this way intruded too heavily into a decisionmaking process that should have been left to the parties.
notwithstanding this concern,we perceive a crucial distinction between a party decision as to whether to settle,and the party comportment during the settlement negotiations themselves.the plaintiff lack of diligence and the defendant resulting costs are appropriate factors to consider under rule a.see doe,at.his handling of the settlement negotiations may have been relevant if,for example,colón cabrera had failed to participate i
