background 
william gilley filed this lawsuit in on behalf of himself and other wholesale purchasers of carb gasoline in the state of california.carb gas is a fuel,and since it is the only type of gas that can be sold in california.the complaint alleged that,major oil producers,violated of the sherman act by entering into a conspiracy to limit the supply of carb gasoline and to raise prices.
the allegations of the complaint were plainly similar to those alleged in aguilar,a suit filed in california superior court in.that suit was brought under the cartwright act,cal.bus.code et,california equivalent to the sherman act.aguilar,d,at.the plaintiff in aguilar was a retail purchaser and consumer of gasoline and sought to represent a class of retail purchasers.the plaintiff in this action was a wholesale purchaser and retail dealer of gasoline and sought to represent a class of wholesale purchasers.both plaintiffs were represented by the same attorneys,and both actions targeted the same defendants for essentially the same allegedly unlawful conduct.because of the similarity in the cases,the district court hearing this case stayed the suit pending the outcome of aguilar.
in aguilar,the state superior court granted summary judgment to the defendants,concluding that there was insufficient evidence presented by the plaintiffs to allow a reasonable juror to find a conspiracy to limit supply and raise prices among the several gasoline companies.id.at.the california supreme court affirmed.id.at.as a result,defendants in this case brought a motion for summary judgment arguing that gilley claims were barred by collateral estoppel.in response,gilley offered a proposed amended complaint,which the court found insufficient.the district court,however,granted gilley leave to provide another proposed amended complaint,which he did.
on may,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on that complaint,holding that gilley was precluded by aguilar from relitigating whether a conspiracy existed to limit supply and raise prices.however,the court granted gilley further leave to amend the complaint to allege that each of the bilateral agreements,entered into independently between various defendant gasoline companies,ha s effects and therefore violate s the sherman act.
on may,gilley filed the third complaint,alleging that bilateral exchange agreements had the effect of unreasonably restraining trade in violation of of the sherman act and in violation of cal.bus.code.on march,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss that complaint with prejudice.with respect to the claim,the court explained that gilley had not alleged any theory as to how any individual exchange agreement,which accounts for a small percentage of the relevant market,is able to inflate the price of carb gasoline.the district court rejected gilley argument that the court could consider the aggregate effects of the individual bilateral agreements to allege an anticompetitive higher gas prices.
gilley appealed to this court,which reversed and remanded,holding that the district court erred in not giving gilley an opportunity to correct the newly identified deficiencies.after the remand,the second amended complaint sac was filed.
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the sac,holding that plaintiffs failed to allege that the exchange agreements,when considered individually,would be capable of producing significant anticompetitive effects.we now review the district court dismissal of the sac.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b.knievel espn,cir.all allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the party.id.on a motion to dismiss in an antitrust case,a court must determine whether an antitrust claim is plausible in light of basic economic principles.bell alt.twombly,d.
we address the following issues in this appeal the preclusive effect of the california supreme court decision in aguilar the pleading standard for claims the sufficiency of plaintiffs sac and the state law claim under cal.bus.code 
the preclusive effect of the california supreme court aguilar decision.
gilley does not dispute that the decision in aguilar has some preclusive effect in the current lawsuit,but he contends that his current claim is not entirely extinguished by aguilar.in contrast,defendants argue that all of the allegations as pleaded in the sac are precluded by aguilar.we conclude that gilley claims are precluded by the california supreme court decision.
section of the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.the supreme court has clearly established that the section is limited to prohibiting unreasonable restraints of trade.see texaco dagher,d.whether a plaintiff pursues a per se claim or a rule of reason claim under,the first requirement is to allege a contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy.
the core of the plaintiff claims in aguilar was a per se claim based on an alleged unlawful conspiracy among petroleum companies.the california supreme court opinion in aguilar states 
just as the superior court order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment was not erroneous as to aguilar primary cause of action for an unlawful conspiracy under section of the cartwright act to restrict the output of carb gasoline and to raise its price,neither was it erroneous as to her derivative cause of action,which was for an unlawful conspiracy under the unfair competition law for the same purpose.
the petroleum companies carried their burden of persuasion to show that there was no triable issue of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to aguilar unfair competition law cause of action.they did so by doing so as to her cartwright act cause of action.again,they carried their burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy,but she did not carry her shifted burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the presence of an unlawful one.
it is true,as aguilar argues,that her unfair competition law cause of action is not based on allegations asserting a conspiracy unlawful under the cartwright act.but it is indeed based on allegations asserting a conspiracy,specifically,one unlawful at least under the unfair competition law itself.as stated,the petroleum companies showed that there was no triable issue of the material fact of conspiracy.aguilar claims that conspiracy is not an element of an unfair competition law cause of action in the abstract as a matter of law.correctly so.see bus.but she simply can not deny that conspiracy is indeed a component of the unfair competition law cause of action in this case as a matter of fact.
id.at emphasis in original.
this portion of aguilar holds that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy that was per se illegal or otherwise illegal under the sherman act.
the preclusive effect of aguilar is woven through the numerous court decisions in gilley federal action.gilley filed this class action in,and its proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of aguilar.after the california supreme court issued its opinion in aguilar,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.gilley opposed the motion and also offered to file an amended complaint.the district court granted the motion for summary judgment.the district court held that pursuant to the doctrine of issue preclusion,gilley was barred from relitigating the conspiracy alleged in aguilar.the court denied gilley request to amend the complaint to allege continuing violations of antitrust laws subsequent to the time period involved in aguilar,reasoning 
the exchange agreements were already judged by the california supreme court not to be evidence of a conspiracy.the court finds that the proposed amended complaint merely alleges the ongoing use of these supply agreements and not any new conduct.issue preclusion therefore bars gilley from relitigating whether use of the ongoing agreements constitute an illegal conspiracy under the sherman act.
the district court,however,agreed with gilley that his claim has not been litigated to the extent that he is alleging that the individual bilateral exchange agreements violate the laws due to their effect.accordingly,it granted gilley leave to file an amended complaint only to the extent that it alleges that each of the bilateral agreements,entered into independently between various defendant gasoline companies,have unreasonable effects and therefore violate the sherman act.
gilley amended his complaint.defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint fac.the district court granted the motion,explaining 
after careful scrutiny of the fac,the court has been unable to discern any allegation that any of the parties in any of the bilateral agreements entered these agreements with an unlawful intent or purpose to restrain competition.in the few instances that plaintiff does allege an improper purpose,he does so by alleging joint action among all,or substantially all of the defendants.as discussed below,plaintiff pleading of such joint purpose or action regarding the various defendants is improper and will not be considered by the court.therefore,plaintiff has failed to properly allege concerted action regarding any individual bilateral exchange agreement.
the district court dismissed the case with prejudice,commenting that because plaintiff was already granted leave to amend his complaint previously,and at this late date was unable to set forth a valid claim,it appears that plaintiff can not allege sufficient facts constituting a valid claim.
gilley appealed,and we reversed and remanded to allow gilley an opportunity to file a further amended complaint.we held that the district court had abused its discretion by denying gilley an opportunity to amend his complaint.
when gilley filed a second amended complaint,defendants again moved to dismiss,and the district court granted the motion.it explained 
plaintiffs do not allege that each exchange agreement has a discrete effect on competition which can be viewed together with the separate effects of the other exchange agreements.instead,plaintiffs allege the existence of a network of exchange agreements that allow defendants to coordinate their production and output,thereby limiting the amount of carb gasoline on the rack or spot market and allowing defendants to raise prices to branded dealers.
even if a single defendant and all of the defendants who contracted with that defendant cumulatively had sufficient market power to substantially impair competition,plaintiffs would need to make the further showing that all of these defendants worked together through the use of the exchange agreements and strategic shutdowns or decreased production to stabilize the spot market and avoid the depression of gasoline prices 
plaintiffs can not avoid the fact that their sherman act claim is,at its core,a conspiracy claim.plaintiffs theory of recovery rests upon the existence of a web of exchange agreements that allegedly allows all of the defendants to engage in a precise dance of with the goal of maintaining the delicate balance of carb production.coordinated action is essential to plaintiffs claim.
after four attempts to plead around a conspiracy claim,plaintiffs still fail to allege that the bilateral exchange agreements,viewed independently,constitute an unreasonable restraint on trade.plaintiffs inability to establish a causal connection between the individual exchange agreements,and anticompetitive harm is fatal to plaintiffs sherman act claim.
a critical aspect of the district court perspective was its determination that the sac did not allege that each exchange agreement has a discrete effect on competition which can be viewed together with the separate effects of other exchange agreements.rather,the district court saw the sac as alleging a network of exchange agreements that allow defendants to coordinate their production and output.in essence,the district court read the sac as not alleging that the bilateral agreements violate the laws due to their effect,but rather that the agreements facilitate coordinated action by the defendants that unlawfully restrains trade.we agree.
this distinction is critical.if the bilateral agreements in themselves have an illegal effect on competition when aggregated,then the bilateral agreements constitute the contract,combination or conspiracy required for a claim under of the sherman act.if,however,the bilateral agreements only facilitate coordinated activity,then to maintain a claim under of the sherman act,gilley must show some meeting of the minds,some contract,combination or conspiracy,between those defendants whom gilley alleges coordinated their actions.although a plaintiff might well be able to do so in the abstract,here,gilley is precluded by aguilar from asserting that the defendants so conspired.
the second amended complaint implicitly,if not explicitly,asserts a conspiracy.the charging paragraphs of the sac describe the defendants parallel actions and imply the existence of a conspiracy.the sac asserts 
california carb gas supply is generally manufactured primarily by defendants,california branded refiners,who are engaged in the business of refining,distributing and selling almost of the carb gas in the state of california during the class period.california remains largely isolated from external sources of supply.
all california refiners,now also major retail marketers,control supply and pricing from production to distribution,in part,through supply agreements that require dealers to purchase gasoline exclusively at each branded refiner present dtw price,a price that is always greater than the rack price and cost of distribution.
california refiners weekly refinery production decisions are influenced by,among other things,spot price impact,refiner margins,bilateral exchange partners market needs,ability to draw inventory from bilateral exchange partners,and overall market supply.
with the impending introduction of carb gasoline in,each of the defendants or their predecessors in interest,entered into new sales exchange agreements with other defendants,many of which provided for the provision of carb gas as mutually agreed ama with no minimum or maximum.
the determination that these paragraphs assert a conspiracy is reinforced by the next paragraph of the sac which reads 
the sales and exchange agreements known to plaintiffs that are subject of this action are listed on the attached exhibit on information and belief,plaintiffs allege that defendants have entered into other sales and exchange agreements,presently unknown to plaintiffs,with similar intent and effect.
certainly the tenor of this paragraph is that the similar intent and effect violates antitrust laws.moreover,in light of the preceding paragraphs and the failure to assert any other specific violation of the sherman act,the alleged violation must be one of conspiracy or collusion.
this allegation of conspiracy is carried forward in the sac allegations against particular defendants,starting with chevron it lists three exchange agreements
