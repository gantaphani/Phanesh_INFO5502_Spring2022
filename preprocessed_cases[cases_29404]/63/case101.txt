appellant washington gas light company washington gas operates a natural gas substation on chillum road in prince george county,maryland chillum site.beginning in,washington gas sought to expand that substation with the addition of a liquefied natural gas lng storage tank.washington gas initially requested approval for this proposed expansion from prince george county county,which denied the request based on recently enacted county zoning plans county zoning plans.
thereafter,washington gas filed a federal action seeking a declaration that the county erroneously denied washington gas permission to proceed under ann.the mandatory referral statute a declaration that the natural gas pipeline safety act psa,natural gas act nga,and state law preempt the county zoning plans and an injunction prohibiting the county from enforcing the allegedly preempted county zoning plans.
the district court initially dismissed the mandatory referral claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and,in the alternative,on burford abstention grounds.in a subsequent order,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county on the state and federal preemption claims,thus denying washington gas request for declaratory and injunctive relief.
washington gas appeals the district court order,dated february,dismissing the mandatory referral claim and the district court subsequent order,dated march,granting summary judgment on the federal preemption claims we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the mandatory referral claim pursuant to burford the psa does not preempt the county zoning plans because the psa only preempts safety regulations and the county zoning plans are not safety regulations and the nga does not preempt the county zoning plans because washington gas is a local distributor of natural gas and,therefore,is not subject to the nga.
therefore,the district court judgment,as set forth in its february,and march,orders,is affirmed.
washington gas distributes natural gas to retail customers in the washington,area,including portions of maryland and virginia.currently,washington gas operates a natural gas substation at the chillum site.the chillum site was initially approved for natural gas storage and compression in.the scope of washington gas operations at the chillum site has expanded,with county permission,on several occasions since that time.specifically,in,the county granted washington gas permission to construct a branch headquarters at the chillum site.then,in and again in,the county permitted washington gas to construct additional office and storage space there.
washington gas began seeking approval to add lng storage tanks to the chillum site in.in pursuit of this proposed expansion,washington gas initially sought to invoke the mandatory referral statute,land use lexis this statute,sets forth a method through which certain public organizations may obtain approval for a project without having to go through local zoning review.see pan am.health org.montgomery county,paho.however,the county determined that the mandatory referral statute was inapplicable in this case.thus,washington gas ultimately sought to obtain zoning approval rather than to proceed through mandatory referral.accordingly,the county held several hearings on this zoning request.
however,on march,during the pendency of the zoning proceedings,the county adopted the county zoning plans.the county zoning plans,known as the west hyattsville district overlay zone whdoz and the transit district development plan tddp,were aimed at maximizing development in the area around the west hyattsville metro center.the county zoning plans prohibited all industrial usage in that area,which included the chillum site.based on this enactment,the county denied washington gas zoning approval on august.
thereafter,washington gas appealed to the county council,which denied the appeal.washington gas then appealed the denial to the circuit court for prince george county,maryland,which dismissed the appeal on ripeness and exhaustion grounds.
as the state and county proceedings were ongoing,washington gas also appeared before the maryland public service commission mdpsc in two separate matters relevant to the proposed expansion.first,in november,washington gas wrote a letter to the mdpsc requesting regulatory approval for the proposed expansion.in particular,washington gas requested the mdpsc to certify that the proposed expansion complied with maryland regulations governing thermal radiation and vapor exclusion zones by letter dated march,the mdpsc engineering staff determined that washington gas proposal was consistent with the pertinent safety regulations.notably,the letter was expressly limited to safety considerations,indicating,this opinion refers to analyses discussed herein and it does not state the technical staff position on any other matter pertaining to the proposed chillum facility 
second,in november,washington gas initiated mdpsc review of its annual gas portfolio plan,a required annual presentation in which a public utility details how it intends to meet customer demand over the next five years.this review is conducted pursuant to the mdpsc rate regulation authority as set forth in,pub.util.as the district court noted,these annual reviews are limited to rate regulation and,therefore,t hey are not general reviews of all aspects of public utilities in maryland and do not include thorough reviews of a public utility conformity with local land use plans.the proposed expansion was discussed during that review.however,because the proposed expansion,even if authorized by the county,would not have been completed within the next five years,the mdpsc did not express any opinion on the propriety of the proposal.
following completion of the zoning proceedings and the ensuing state appeal,washington gas brought this federal action on april,in united states district court for the district of maryland.the initial complaint was amended on july,the first amended complaint.the first amended complaint sought a declaration that maryland mandatory referral procedure applies to the lng project the mandatory referral count a declaration that the psa,the nga,and maryland state law preempt the county zoning plans and an injunction preventing the county from enforcing the county zoning plans.
the county filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and,in the alternative,to abstain from asserting jurisdiction over the case.washington gas filed a motion for summary judgment.prior to holding a hearing on these motions,the district court issued a memorandum opinion on january,outlining the various issues before the court and expressing tentative opinions as to how it would resolve those issues.
first,as to the county motion to dismiss,the district court indicated it would likely deny that motion,except with respect to the mandatory referral count.on that count,the district court indicated it would likely grant the county motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted because there is no state law cause of action delineated,and certainly no federal question involved.
as to the county motion to abstain,the district court indicated it would likely deny that motion,again with the exception of the mandatory referral count.on that count,the district court indicated that it would abstain from deciding the issue because f ederal adjudication of the mandatory referral count would disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy regarding zoning procedures and the state mechanisms for land use planning.
finally,as to washington gas summary judgment motion,the district court indicated it would likely deny that motion in full,as there still remained issues of fact relevant to state and federal preemption.
the district court then conducted a hearing on these motions on february.later that day,the court entered an order granting the county motion to dismiss and the county motion to abstain as to the mandatory referral count denying the county motions to dismiss and to abstain as to the other counts in the first amended complaint and denying the entirety of washington gas motion for summary judgment.in so doing,the district court expressly adopted its reasoning articulated in its prior memorandum opinion.the district court then granted washington gas leave to file another complaint the second amended complaint.
the second amended complaint,filed on february,contained all of the original claims,excluding the mandatory referral count,and added a few factual allegations.notably,the second amended complaint alleged,for the first time,that washington gas is an interstate pipeline under the psa and that it was subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc under the nga.
washington gas then filed a second motion for summary judgment,which the district court denied.specifically,the district court rejected washington gas characterization of its operations as purely interstate,concluding that washington gas was,instead,an intrastate facility under the psa and a local distributor of natural gas under the nga.accordingly,the district court held that washington gas is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction in the state in which its gas is consumed,in this case maryland.
on march,washington gas filed its third and final amended complaint the third amended complaint.in the third amended complaint,washington gas averred that,even assuming it is not an interstate pipeline,the county zoning plans are still preempted by the nga,the psa,and state law 
thereafter,the county filed a seeking a declaration that neither federal nor state law preempted the county zoning plans.the parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment.by a memorandum opinion dated march,the district court granted the entirety of the county motion and denied the entirety of washington gas motion.the district court rejected washington gas argument that the psa comprehensively regulates lng facility siting,concluding instead that the psa preemptive effect only extends to safety standards.because the district court also found that the county zoning plans were not,in fact,safety standards,the court concluded the county zoning plans are not preempted by the psa.additionally,the district court concluded,because washington gas is a local distributor of natural gas exempt from regulation under the nga,the nga does not preempt the county zoning plans.washington gas timely appealed.
washington gas appeals the district court february,order arguing that the district court erred in abstaining from deciding the mandatory referral count under burford.washington gas also appeals the district court march,order arguing the psa impliedly preempts the county zoning plans because they are,in fact,safety regulations and the nga impliedly preempts the county zoning plans by granting exclusive authority to the mdpsc.
we review the district court decision to abstain under burford for abuse of discretion.see mlc,llc town of pines,cir.
we review de novo the district court award of summary judgment to the county on washington gas federal preemption claims.see city bank of indiana turnbaugh,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also.a.because the facts here are undisputed,this case presents only questions of law.
the district court abstained from resolving washington gas mandatory referral count under the abstention doctrine articulated in burford sun oil.under this doctrine,courts may abstain when the availability of an alternative,federal forum threaten s to frustrate the purpose of a state complex administrative system.martin stewart,cir.specifically,burford abstention is permissible when 
f ederal adjudication would unduly intrude upon complex state administrative processes because either there are difficult questions of state law whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar or federal review would disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.

ordinarily,federal courts have an unflagging obligation to exercise their jurisdiction.mlc,at quoting deakins monaghan,d.thus,abstention remains the exception,not the rule.id.quoting nopsi,at.however,abstention importance in our system of dual sovereignty can not be underestimated.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,federal courts must exercise their discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy.burford,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in concluding that burford abstention was warranted here,the district court indicated 
federal adjudication of the mandatory referral count would disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy regarding zoning procedures and the state mechanisms for land use planning.plaintiff has not alleged that the mandatory referral provision interferes with any federal rights.rather,plaintiff asks this court to declare that,under maryland law,public utilities are subject only to mandatory referral.such a declaration would have far reaching effects that transcend the importance of this section.
as noted,maryland mandatory referral statute exempts certain public utility projects from local zoning review.in particular,this statute enumerates the public entities to which it applies,including a publicly owned or privately owned public utility.see,land use lexis.washington gas argues that,as a privately owned public utility,mandatory referral plainly applies to its proposed expansion.washington gas further argues that the district court abused its discretion in abstaining under burford because the issue involves,a straightforward question of statutory construction and,therefore,an adjudication of the issue does not disrupt a coherent state policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.br.of appellants.
the county counters that washington gas reading of the statute is overly simplistic and that it ignores other language in the mandatory referral statute which restricts the siting authority of public utilities.specifically,the county argues that the reference to public utilities in the first section of the statute refers only to the fact that certain public officials have siting authority to authorize certain utility structures,and that ultimate authority to approve a proposal under the mandatory referral statute is conferred on public entities not a privately owned utility.br.of appellees.
moreover,the county points out that,in paho,we certified a similar question to the maryland court of appeals.specifically,in paho,an international organization sought to construct its headquarters in montgomery county,maryland,notwithstanding local zoning restrictions that would have prohibited that use.before this court,the organization argued that it was exempt from local zoning under the mandatory referral statute.rather than construe the mandatory referral statute,this court certified the question to the maryland court of appeals.thus,in the present case,the county argues that our decision to certify a question to the maryland court of appeals in paho demonstrates that the construction of maryland mandatory referral statute is a difficult and important issue of state law and,accordingly,that issue should be decided by the state.
notably,cases involving questions of state and local land use and zoning law are a classic example of situations where burford should apply.mlc,at internal quotation marks omitted.while zoning and land use cases do not automatically warrant burford abstention,in cases where plaintiffs federal claims stem solely from construction of state or local land use or zoning law,not involving the constitutional validity of the same and absent exceptional circumstances,the district courts should abstain under the burford doctrine to avoid interference with the state or locality land use policy.id.
in this case,resolution of washington gas mandatory referral count turns on whether maryland mandatory referral statute should have been applied.that question turns entirely on the meaning of the phrase privately owned public utility as it is used in maryland mandatory referral statute.thus,washington gas mandatory referral claim turns entirely on the construction of state or local land use law.in these circumstances,precedent dictates that burford abstention is appropriate.
federal preemption 
under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,federal law is the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.accordingly,state law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.see aes sparrows point lng,llc smith,cir quoting cipollone liggett group,d.in determining whether a state law is preempted,we are guided first and foremost by the maxim that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.epps jp morgan chase bank,cir quoting wyeth levine,d.
preemption generally occurs in one of three circumstances.first,a federal law preempts state law when congress expressly declares its intention that state law be preempted.see epps,at see also cipollone,at.second,a federal law impliedly preempts state law when congress has occupied the field by regulating so pervasively that there is no room left for the states to supplement federal law.epps,at internal quotation marks omitted see also schneidewind anr pipeline,d.third,federal law preempts state law when the federal and state laws actually conflict.see epps,at.ordinarily,congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.cipollone,at.
with these general preemption principles in mind,we turn first to the question of whether the psa preempts the county zoning plans.
psa framework 
the psa stated purpose is to provide adequate protection against risks to life and property posed by pipeline transportation and pipeline facilities by empowering the secretary of transportation to prescribe minimum safety standards for pipeline transportation and for pipeline facilities.a.accordingly,the psa generally authorizes the secretary of transportation to prescribe and enforce minimum safety standards for locating new lng facilities and for the design,installation,construction,inspection,and testing of those facilities.see a b.
however,under the psa,the secretary of transportation may not prescribe or enforce safety standards for an intrastate pipeline facility or intrastate pipeline transportation to the extent that the safety standards and practices are regulated by a state authority that submits to the secretary annually a certification for the facilities and transportation.a.in maryland,the mdpsc is the authorized state authority that submits the required annual certifications to the secretary of transportation.see md code,public util.a lexis.
the psa contains an express preemption provision,which states,in relevant part 
preemption.a state authority that has submitted a current certification under section a of this title may adopt additional or more stringent safety standards for intrastate pipeline facilities and intrastate pipeline transportation only if those standards are compatible with the minimum standards prescribed under this chapter.a state authority may not adopt or continue in force safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities or interstate pipeline transportation 
c.accordingly,we have held that the psa expressly preempts state and local law in the field of safety.see,tenneco pub.serv.comm of,cir the psa text,its legislative history,administration implementation,and judicial interpretation,attest to federal preemption of the field of safety with respect to the establishment and enforcement of standards regulating the interstate transmission of gas by pipeline.
washington gas argues that the psa preempts the county zoning plans expressly,impliedly,and by conflict.we disagree on all counts.as noted,the psa expressly preempts the field of pipeline safety.see c.here,however,because the county zoning plans are not safety regulations,they do not come within the express preemption provision of the psa.as the district court properly held,the county zoning plans are land use regulations designed to foster development around the west hyattsville metro station.this interpretation finds support in the final version of the tddp,which indicates that its main purpose is to maximize the public benefits from the west hyattsville metro station.to further this purpose,the tddp articulates the following specific goals 
promote development near the metro station and create a sense of place consistent with the neighborhood character areas.
ensure that all new development or redevelopment in the transit district is.
restore,protect,and enhance the environment by protecting environmentally sensitive areas,minimizing the impacts of development,and expanding recreational opportunities and trail and bikeway connections.
maximize residential development opportunities within walking distance of the metro station.
id.in light of these goals,it is clear that the county zoning plans are primarily local land use regulations as opposed to safety regulations.
in texas midstream gas servs.city of grand prairie,cir,the fifth circuit reached a similar conclusion on analogous facts.there,a gas company sought to construct an interstate natural gas pipeline facility in grand prairie,texas.under grand prairie zoning regulations,the facility would have needed to comply with a foot setback requirement under which all facilities needed to be set back at least feet from a nearby road.the gas company sought a declaration that the setback requirement was preempted by the psa arguing,as washington gas does here,that the psa broadly preempts the siting of natural gas facilities.the fifth circuit disagreed,holding that the psa preemptive effect is limited to the field of pipeline safety and that the setback requirement was not a safety standard but,rather,was primarily aimed at developing neighborhood aesthetics in the area.see texas midstream,at t he setback requirement primarily ensures that bulky,unsightly,noisy compressor stations do not mar neighborhood aesthetics.
washington gas attempts to distinguish texas midstream by arguing that,in that case,the local regulation did not completely prohibit the company from siting the proposed facility in its preferred location,whereas,in this case,the county zoning plans would completely prohibit washington gas from using its preferred location.this is a distinction without a difference.logically,the power to impose a zoning requirement includes the power to preclude any proposed usage of the zoned area that can not comply with such requirement.thus,the fact that the county zoning plans arguably have a more significant effect on washington gas than the setback requirement did on the regulated utility in texas midstream is of no moment here.
washington gas also argues that the county zoning plans are safety regulations in disguise and,therefore,are preempted by the psa.br.of appellants.the district court properly rejected this argument.at their core,the county zoning plans are local land use provisions designed to foster residential and recreational development.even assuming safety concerns played some part in the enactment of the county zoning plans,those concerns would have been merely incidental to the overall purpose of the county zoning plans.this is insufficient to justify a finding that the county zoning plans were,in fact,safety regulations.see,e,texas midstream,at however,this incidental salutary effect on fire safety does not undermine congress intent in promulgating the psa,as it is neither direct nor substantial.
washington gas next argues that,through the psa,congress comprehensively addresses the siting of lng facilities and,therefore,the psa and the regulations adopted thereunder impliedly preempt the county zoning plans.br.of appellants.we reject this argument.because the county zoning plans are beyond the scope of the psa express preemption provision,it is unlikely that they are impliedly preempted.see,coll.loan slm,cir because congress deemed it necessary to specifically preempt certain state la
