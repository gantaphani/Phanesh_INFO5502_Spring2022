the green river formation,located in eastern utah,is the site of potentially valuable oil shale deposits.oil shale is a sedimentary rock containing an organic material called kerogen which,upon destructive distillation,produces a substantial amount of oil.andrus shell oil,d.once mined,oil shale can be a valuable fossil fuel.this case involves an attempt by cliffs synfuel to patent four oil shale mining claims in uintah county,utah,which encompass approximately acres of the green river formation.
congress enacted the general mining law of,which essentially gave away valuable mineral deposits,including oil shale deposits,to whomever first located them.the law was premised on a policy of encouraging exploration of valuable mineral deposits in the western united states.utilizing the terminology of mining custom,the mining act provides that one who claims a mineral deposit is known as a locator and is required to perform a certain amount of work each year in prosecution of the claim site,known as the location.the act describes this assessment work 
all records of mining claims made after may,shall contain the name or names of the locators,the date of the location,and such a description of the claim or claims located by reference to some natural object or permanent monument as will identify the claim.on each claim located after the day of may,and until a patent has been issued therefor,not less that worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year 
if a claimant failed to perform such work for a period and then later resumed work before anyone else asserted a claim on the same land,his claim remained intact.this became known in later years as the resumption doctrine 
u pon a failure to comply with these conditions,the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made,provided that the original locators,their heirs,assigns,or legal representatives,have not resumed work upon the claim after failure and before such location.
congress enacted the mineral leasing act in,which completely changed the national policy over the disposition of oil shale lands.hickel,at.thereafter,one could no longer simply explore the land,stake a claim and allege title in every situation.rather,lands containing certain valuable mineral deposits,including oil shale,came within the dominion of the united states and could be offered to the public only through lease from the government 
however,of the act contained a savings clause which left intact those claims for oil shale which were already in existence as of february,so long as such claims were thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.
the leasing act provides in pertinent part 
the deposits of coal,phosphate,sodium,potassium,oil,oil shale,and gas,herein referred to,in lands valuable for such minerals,shall be subject to disposition only in the form and manner provided in this chapter,by lease only except as to valid claims existent on february,and thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated,which claims may be perfected under such laws,including discovery.
thus,if one had a claim that existed prior to february,the claimant would not be required to lease the claimed land from the government,but could perfect title to it so long as the claim was maintained pursuant to pre law.discovery of a valuable mineral is not the only prerequisite of patentability.the mining law also provides that until a patent is issued a claimant must perform worth of labor or make of improvements on his claim during each year andrus,at.citing.
the dispute before us centers on this savings clause in which former locators of a claim were grandfathered in,provided they qualified.the secretary contends that appellee purported claim does not come within the purview of this exception to the leasing act.the district court disagreed and entered judgment in favor of appellee.the issue is now joined before us.
in,cliffs synfuel filed a mineral patent application with the utah state office of the bureau of land management covering four oil shale mining claims,which were originally located in.on october,issued a first entry final certificate final certificate and on february,transmitted the application to a blm certified mineral examiner in vernal,utah,for a field inspection and mineral report.the mineral report was issued on june.a government contest was initiated by against all four claims alleging lack of discovery on or before february,lack of discovery at the present time,and failure of the claim owners to comply with the annual assessment work required in.on the basis of these charges,requested that all four claims be declared invalid and cancelled.
a evidentiary hearing in salt lake city was held on december and,before an administrative law judge of the interior department office of hearings and appeals.appellee presented testimony and evidence supporting its position that the required discovery had been timely on each claim,and that annual assessment work,which had been for years,had resumed in in satisfaction of the resumption doctrine codified at.
the determined that all four of appellee claims met the standards for discovery under the law as it existed both in,as well as the present.he thus rejected the government two discovery challenges.however,the determined that the four claims were still invalid for failure to comply with the annual assessment work requirement of.in so ruling,he relied on the interior department interior board of land appeals ibla or board decision in united states herr,ibla,to conclude that in light of hickel,the appellee did not meet the statutory requirements.
cliffs synfuel appealed the decision to the board,asserting that the resumption doctrine was still in effect in year the claim owner resumed assessment work,after years of inactivity.an administrative judge of the board affirmed the ruling.
appellee thereafter filed a complaint in the district court for a review of the board final order,as authorized by the administrative procedure act,appellee requested that the court reverse the agency action on the ground that its decision was arbitrary,capricious and otherwise inconsistent with current law.the district court granted the relief,concluding that the board had misinterpreted the hickel decision 
in sum,hickel does not hold that failure to do assessment work,even substantial noncompliance with the assessment requirement,is somehow,or results in the ipso facto loss of rights under a pre mining claim.rather,the hickel decision stands for the proposition that the department of the interior has standing to challenge the holder of oil shale mining claims for failure to substantially comply with the assessment requirements.the ibla decision,following herr,seemingly discarded and straightforward language to reach an alternative,strained,and erroneous reading of hickel.this was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.

in reaching its conclusion the court held that although appellee failed to perform the necessary annual statutory assessment work for years,as mandated by,its resumption of assessment work in,before the initiation of a government contest action,cured the year lapse.the court concluded that the four claims were valid and in good standing and granted appellee motion for summary judgment,vacated the board decision,and directed the department of the interior to diligently process patents for the claims.this appeal followed.
in her appeal,the secretary contends that the district court failed to respect the fundamental interpretation of and as set forth in hickel in the following discrete particulars the necessity for the claimant to perform annual assessment work each year that token assessment work,or assessment work that does not substantially satisfy the requirements of,is not adequate to maintain the claims within the meaning of of the leasing act.hickel,at.and,most important for our purposes,that by the terms of the mineral leasing act of,the united states becomes the beneficiary of all pre oil shale mining claims that are invalidated because of a failure to perform the annual assessment work for a substantial period of time.the secretary argues that the effect of this,insofar as oil shale mining claims are concerned,is that where there has been a history of decades of failure to respect the annual assessment requirements,the savings clause exception of mineral leasing act of does not apply.
this appeal concerns a federal question arising under the provisions of the general mining law of,et,the mineral leasing act of,et,and the administrative procedure act.consequently,the united states district court for the district of utah had jurisdiction of the underlying action pursuant to.this court has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to a,which provides for jurisdiction of appeals from district court interlocutory orders granting injunctions.

additionally,when reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers,a court must apply the analysis set forth by the court in chevron,natural res.def.council,d.this court has interpreted chevron as follows 
when reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,we first determine whether the statute is unambiguous.if the intent of congress is clear then we must give effect to that intent.the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.if,however,the statute is ambiguous or silent on the issue in question,we must determine whether the agency determination is based on a permissible construction of the statute.if so,we will defer to the agency interpretation.
in determining the meaning of a statute,we look at not only the statute itself but also at the larger statutory context.we may ascertain the intent of congress through statutory language and legislative history.

we now turn to the hickel court interpretation of the mining act of and the mineral leasing act of.
the enactment of the mineral leasing act of marked a complete change in the national policy over the disposition of oil shale lands.hickel,at.the act removed oil shale and other specified minerals from subsequent location and private appropriation under the general mining law of.thereafter such lands were no longer open to location and acquisition of title but only to lease.id.
the act provides 
any person having a valid claim to oil shale under existing laws on january,shall,upon the relinquishment of such claim,be entitled to a lease under the provisions of this section for such area of the land relinquished as shall not exceed the maximum area authorized by this section to be leased to an individual or corporation.
the relinquishment may be resurrected,however,under the savings clause of the act if the claim was valid prior to february,and thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated,which claims may be perfected under such laws,including discovery.
in hickel,the court addressed the interrelationship of these two statutes and supplied the answers to two questions,which we must now consider in the resolution of this case what is the nature of the assessment work required to be taken by claimants for their claims to be thereafter maintained and what role is assigned to the united states when the claimants fail to satisfy those requirements 
prior to hickel,the court had taken the view that,even after the enactment of the mineral leasing act,an owner of a pre oil shale claim was under no obligation to perform the requisite assessment work on an annual basis so long as they were able to avail themselves of the resumption doctrine before the claim was relocated by a subsequent claimant.wilbur krushnic.moreover,defaults in assessment work did not mandate that the lands subject to oil shale claims be automatically returned to the government.instead,the court intimated that failure to perform assessment work made the claims subject to relocation only by third parties but that s o far as the government was concerned,failure to do assessment work for any year was without effect.ickes dev.citing krushnic,at.
the court radically altered these two concepts in the leasing act effect on oil shale clams in hickel,a case in which oil shale claimants sued the department of the interior seeking a reinstatement in the late of claims cancelled in the early on the ground that the amount of labor or improvements specified in had not been made during each year.hickel,at.the court first rejected its earlier formulations that had declared the government to be a disinterested party,unable to assert rights to a oil shale claim upon which assessment work had been discontinued.it stated that if we assume,arguendo,that failure to do assessment work as provided in the act concerned at the time only the claimant and any subsequent relocator,the united states,speaking through the secretary of the interior,became a vitally interested party by reason of the act.hickel,at.further,the court said 
if we were to hold to the contrary that enforcement of the assessment work of was solely at the private initiative of relocators,the maintenance provision of becomes largely illusory,because relocation of oil shale claims became impossible after the act.so if enforcement of the assessment work requirement of were dependent solely on the activities and energies of oil shale relocators,there was no effective enforcement device.
the court then delineated what actions are required to thereafter maintain an oil shale claim 
we agree with the court in krushnic and that every default in assessment work does not cause the claim to be lost.defaults,however,might be the equivalent of abandonment and we now hold that token assessment work,or assessment work that does not substantially satisfy the requirements of,is not adequate to maintain the claims within the meaning of of the leasing act.to hold otherwise would help defeat the policy that made the united states,as the prospective recipient of royaltie
