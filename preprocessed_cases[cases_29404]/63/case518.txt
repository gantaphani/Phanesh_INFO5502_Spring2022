almost seven years later,on march,doe and shell entered into a consent order settling claims by doe regarding shell crude oil and refined petroleum product operations during the consent order period of january,through january.shell oil,doe cch.shell did not acknowledge any specific violation of the mppar,but agreed to pay approximately million plus accrued interest to doe for distribution to parties injured by shell alleged violations,thus creating the shell restitution fund.id.at.oha,on january,instituted a special refund proceeding in accordance with subpart v to facilitate distribution of the shell restitution fund to former shell purchasers.id.at.
oha first established a presumption that the shell restitution fund should be dispersed equally among all of shell sales of refined petroleum products during the consent order volumetric presumption.id.at.under the volumetric presumption,a claimant,upon proving the number of gallons purchased from shell during the consent order period,was not required to submit any further evidence of injury.id.at.the claimant could then obtain a refund amount determined by multiplying the number of gallons bought from shell during the consent order period by the volumetric factor of per gallon id.at.however,a claimant could attempt to demonstrate that its injuries were in excess of the amount it could obtain under the volumetric presumption by requesting an refund.see id.at.under an refund claim,a claimant bore the burden of demonstrating that it was injured by overcharges from shell,and that its injuries resulted in a specific amount of monetary harm.international drilling energy watkins,in order to receive an refund,a claimant had to prove that it had paid a refiner an amount that exceeded the maximum allowable price under the mppar.id.
