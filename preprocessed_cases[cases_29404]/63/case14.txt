this case arises at the intersection of environmental law and bankruptcy law.it involves the important question of whether a contempt fine assessed by a state court against a is entitled to administrative expense priority under b a.on the facts of this case,we hold that it is,and so affirm the bankruptcy court order,as did the district court.see order granting motion for allowance of administrative expense claim,in re munce superior petroleum,jmd.may.
the in contempt fines and attorneys fees was levied against munce superior petroleum products,and harold munce collectively,mspp,appellants here.the fines resulted from mspp failure to comply with an earlier state superior court order compelling it to take particular actions to bring its facilities into compliance with new hampshire environmental law.both of these state court orders the one assessing the fine and the one ordering specific compliance actions were issued after mspp filed its chapter petition,though the underlying violations of new hampshire law began and were the subject of a consent preliminary injunction entered by the state court before mspp filed its chapter petition.
the bankruptcy court granted the new hampshire department of environmental services des motion to give the fines administrative expense priority and the district court affirmed.under reading brown,and our case law,we affirm.
background 
mspp engages in a number of business ventures,primarily involving fuel distribution and the ownership and operation of convenience stores.to this end,mspp stores fuel in oil tanks at three different facilities.all of the facilities are licensed by des,and are subject to extensive state regulations.
most of mspp facilities are located near the androscoggin river,along route in gorham,new hampshire.new hampshire law requires these kinds of bulk oil facilities to have secondary containment systems installed.admin.env wm a.these systems are designed to protect the surrounding areas in the event of leaks and even catastrophic tank failures,and include pipes and retaining structures constructed around the oil tanks.id.at.
des notified mspp of secondary containment system violations,along with other violations of environmental laws,by letters dated october,september,november,and july.mspp did not remedy any of its violations in response to these letters.
procedural history 
in july,des brought an action against mspp in state court,alleging that mspp had engaged in a series of violations of state environmental laws and seeking injunctive relief and assessment of civil penalties.des argued that the scope and number of violations of the environmental statutes,the long history of violation,and the unresponsiveness of mspp to des compliance and enforcement activities amount to a complete disregard of the basic requirements for safe management of petroleum products.des charged that the violations posed significant risks of environmental harm and hazards to public safety,and that mspp had gained an unfair economic advantage over its competitors through its noncompliance.
on august,the state court entered an preliminary injunction.it required mspp to bring its bulk oil facilities into full compliance or take the facilities out of service within thirty to sixty days.mspp did not comply by january,and des filed a motion to hold mspp in contempt.the state court held a hearing on that motion on march,in which both parties were represented by counsel.des offered evidence that mspp had wholly failed to comply with the preliminary injunction,while mspp contended in its offers of proof that it was in substantial compliance.
on march,while the motion for contempt was pending,munce superior petroleum products filed for bankruptcy under chapter mspp continued to operate the businesses as a.are required to comply with state environmental laws.see ohio kovacs,w e do not question that anyone in possession of the estate site must comply with the environmental laws of the state of ohio.plainly,that person or firm may not maintain a nuisance,pollute the waters of the state,or refuse to remove the source of such conditions.
as a result of the automatic stay,the state court stayed its proceedings.see a.on june,des filed a motion in the bankruptcy court pursuant to b,asking the bankruptcy court to declare that the stay did not apply to the des state action.after a hearing,on june the bankruptcy court ruled that the automatic stay did not apply to the des state court action because it was brought for the purpose of protecting public health and safety,and the environment,and to effectuate public policy.
with the stay lifted,on september,the state court issued an order granting des motion for contempt.the court reasoned 
the basic problem that the state raises to the court and upon which it bases its request for contempt,is that the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements for certification the respondent mspp had the affirmative obligation within specific timelines to take certain action with respect to certifications.the respondent failed to do so.the potential for environmental contamination disaster is very real in connection with these facilities.
the state court ordered mspp to take all of the tanks out of within ten days,and stated that it would assess penalties of per day of noncompliance if mspp did not meet the deadline.mspp did not appeal the contempt order,nor did it seek a stay in the bankruptcy court.nor did it comply with the order.
on february,des filed a motion in the state court seeking the assessment of contempt penalties against mspp,citing mspp failure to comply with the court september,order.after a full hearing,on april,the court entered an order in favor of des,ordering mspp to pay civil penalties in the amount of representing per day for days of noncompliance following the initial grace period,plus an additional in costs and fees.in so holding,the state court noted 
it was not the court intention to separately assess penalties on each of the facilities for.the respondents responsibility is to comply with the state regulations with respect to the operation of its business.the court finds,after review of the pleadings and offers of proof,that the respondents are not in compliance with the state regulations.the court further finds that the respondents have not complied with the court order of september.
emphasis added.the court made an affirmative finding that mspp inaction caused environmental harm des,through its offer of proof,indicated that an inspection done on august,showed significant evidence of overfilling and spills in the area of these tanks.mspp also did not appeal from that state court order.
on april,des filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking to have the state court fine classified as an administrative priority claim against mspp pursuant to b the bankruptcy court granted the motion and ordered mspp to pay des claim.the district court upheld that decision,munce superior petroleum,dep t of envtl,and this appeal followed.
