in the consolidated cases of independent petroleum association of america babbitt samedan oil deer,we held that a policy letter written by an associate director of the minerals management service clarifying the royalty consequences of settlement payments was not a rule subject to the requirements of the administrative procedure act and the decision of an assistant secretary of the department of the interior in samedan oil,was arbitrary and capricious.on remand,the district court granted in part samedan oil corporation samedan motions for entry of an order implementing the mandate of this court and for injunctive relief,independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt,but denied a similar motion made by the independent petroleum association of america ipaa,see id.at.the district court concluded that ipaa was not a party to samedan case and that ipaa remaining general challenge to the authority of the department of the interior to charge royalties on nonrecoupable settlement not challenge final agency action.id.at.accordingly,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over ipaa claim and therefore dismissed its complaint.ipaa now returns to this court asking us to reverse the lower court decision.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
the instant appeal continues a long history of litigation focusing on whether the department of the interior doi should be permitted to collect royalties from companies that lease land from doi when those companies receive payments based on their settlement agreements with gas pipelines doi initially took the position that under its gross proceeds rule,see,h,h,gas producers owed royalties for receiving such payments.in,the fifth circuit rejected this position,holding that r oyalty payments are due only on the value of minerals actually produced,physically severed from the ground.no royalty is due on payments unless and until gas is actually produced and taken.diamond shamrock exploration hodel,cir.doi subsequently amended the gross proceeds rule to reflect this holding,remov ing the requirement to pay royalties on payments at the time the payment is made but continuing to require royalties when gas is taken.revision of gross proceeds definition in oil and gas valuation regulations.in a may,letter,the associate director of doi minerals management service mms sought to clarify the gross proceeds rule,stating that some or all of a settlement payment is or will become royalty bearing if production to which specific money is attributable occurs.letter from james shaw,associate director for royalty management,mms,addressed to payor may,hereinafter may letter.in other words,according to the letter,the only relevant question is whether or not the gas which was originally spoken for in the settled contracts is eventually sold to someone.independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt ipaa i,emphasis in original.
in august,the independent petroleum association of america,an association of roughly independent explorers and producers of natural gas and oil,responded to the letter by filing a suit seeking injunctive relief to prevent doi from collecting royalties on unrecoupable settlement payments.ipaa complaint argued,inter alia,that doi adopted a new rule through the may letter without following the procedures required by the administrative procedure act apa,and doi efforts to collect royalties based on the settlement agreements violated the statutes governing the royalties owed under doi leases.in,in an effort to simplify some of the procedural aspects of the ipaa litigation,doi and ipaa entered an agreement whereby mms would issue up to orders to companies to pay royalties based on their settlement agreements.agreement,independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt.the companies could then appeal these orders to an assistant secretary of doi,who would issue decisions that could become appropriate vehicles to seek judicial review on the merits of the may letter.id.at.
later that year,mms issued an order to samedan oil corporation requiring it to pay royalties on settlement payments made by southern natural gas company.samedan appealed the order to doi assistant secretary for indian affairs.the assistant secretary upheld the order based on the policies articulated in the may letter.see samedan oil.samedan appealed to the district court seeking judicial review of the assistant secretary decision.then,as we explained in ipaa i,the district court consolidated samedan challenge with ipaa challenge to the may letter.ipaa i,at.after the district court granted summary judgment for doi in both cases,samedan and ipaa appealed to this court.
on appeal,we reversed the district court granting of summary judgment,holding that the may letter was not a rulemaking requiring apa procedures,id.at,and the assistant secretary samedan decision was arbitrary and capricious in light of doi adoption of the diamond shamrock holding,id.at.accordingly,we held that doi was precluded from collecting royalty payments from samedan.see id.
on remand,ipaa and samedan filed motions with the district court seeking an order implementing the mandate of the court of appeals and a permanent injunction against doi from collecting royalties from samedan.independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt.the district court granted samedan motion for injunctive relief,see id.at,and denied ipaa motion to implement this court mandate,see id.at.in denying ipaa motion,the district court ruled that our decision in ipaa i only addressed ipaa claim concerning mms may letter,not its complaint concerning doi efforts to collect royalties based on settlement agreements.see id.at.the district court explained that our holding concerning the assistant secretary samedan decision extended only to samedan,not to ipaa.noting that ipaa had not sought to join samedan case,the district court reasoned that ipaa could not be considered a true party to samedan case,but must stand or fall on its own.id.consistent with this reasoning,the district court reviewed whether it had jurisdiction to hear ipaa broad challenge to doi royalty policy.although recognizing that further administrative review would be futile in light of doi insistence that it would continue to apply the policies underlying the may letter,the court ultimately ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because ipaa does not face any final actions which it may challenge.id.at.accordingly,the district court dismissed ipaa claim.ipaa appeals from this ruling.
ii.analysis 
doi contends that the issues raised by ipaa are not properly before this court.following the district court dismissal of its claim,ipaa filed a motion pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure asking the district court to amend its judgment,arguing that nothing in the law of the circuit conflicts with adopting a futility exception to the finality requirement.independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt,mem.ipaa suggested that in its case futility should create finality and subject matter jurisdiction.id.the district court denied this motion,concluding that our circuit has constrained the futility exception to the requirement of exhausting administrative remedies before seeking judicial review.see id.at.the court noted that ipaa argument conflate d the doctrines of finality and exhaustion,id.at,and held that futility can not create agency action for purposes of jurisdiction,id.at.
ipaa notice of appeal states that ipaa appeals from the district court order denying plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment dismissing the complaint.doi points out that the arguments ipaa makes on appeal deal solely with the district court dismissal of its complaint,not its rule e motion.because ipaa notice of appeal refers only to the district court denial of this motion without referencing the dismissal of its complaint,doi suggests that,in light of rule c of the federal rules of appellate procedure,ipaa arguments concerning the dismissal of its claim are not properly before us.
under rule c,a notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.nevertheless,a party failure to designate the proper order it intends to appeal is not necessa
