background 
a.the patents in suit 
the patents in suit encompass processes for making drag reducing agents dra that are injected into oil and gas pipelines to reduce friction inherent in pumping operations.by reducing friction,a supplier is able to pump more liquid more efficiently.the active ingredients in dras are high molecular weight polymers.
developed in the,the first dras were with a consistency.these dras,however,were difficult to handle.operators had difficulty storing and injecting the gel,and the dras had difficulty dissolving in the oil.
eventually,a second,dra was developed with improved handling and dissolution characteristics.dras involve grinding a polymer at cryogenic temperatures and mixing them in a suspending material.one problem with dras,however,is that the cryoground polymer may stick together or agglomerate after they are ground.to prevent agglomeration,operators coat the polymer with a partitioning agent during grinding.
the patent 
in general,the patent teaches a process by which polyalphaolefin drag reducing polymer particles could be suspended in a water or liquid medium that was with respect to the solid polymer particles.conoco brought suit alleging infringement of claim,which reads 
a process for the preparation of a stable nonagglomerating suspension of a solid oil soluble polyolefin friction reducing agent obtained from the polymerization of olefins containing from to about carbon atoms which comprises 
subjecting said solid polyolefin friction reducing agent to grinding at cryogenic temperatures in the presence of an inert solid material to provide free flowing,finely divided polymer particles coated with said solid material,and 
combining the coated polymer particles with a water soluble polymeric thickening agent and a suspending material selected from the group consisting of water and mixtures,whereby a stable nonagglomerating suspension of the solid friction reducing agent is obtained.
patent,emphasis added.
the patent 
according to conoco,even though the patent was widely accepted,it still had flaws.some refiners were reluctant to inject a substance into certain products like gasoline or diesel fuel.furthermore,the commonly used metal stearate partitioning agent was not ideal for gasoline injection due to the metal emissions it caused during use and the formation of a thick paste that could not be injected when suspended in a medium.
the invention disclosed in the patent represents a process by which polymer particles could be suspended in alcohols glycols using a fatty acid wax partitioning agent to provide a stable,nonagglomerating suspension.at trial,conoco alleged that eei infringed claims of the patent.claim,a representative claim of the three,reads 
a method of reducing turbulent drag in a hydrocarbon liquid stream flowing though conduits,which comprises 
a forming a solid hydrocarbon soluble polyolefin friction reducing agent from olefins containing from to carbon atoms 
b finely dividing said soluble polyolefin friction reducing agent in the presence of a partitioning agent to provide a free flowing,polyalphaolefin material,said partitioning agent being a fatty acid wax 
c dispersing the polyalphaolefin particles in a substantially nonaqueous suspending fluid medium selected from the group consisting of alcohols containing or less carbon atoms,glycols and and 
d adding said suspension to said hydrocarbon liquid stream in an amount of up to ppm of said reducing agent to reduce friction during turbulent flow through said conduits.
patent,emphasis added.the main contention in these claims is the use of the term fatty acid wax.the specification notes that fatty acid waxes are necessary during the cryogrinding process.
during prosecution,the applicants claimed from the beginning that the dra was formed with a fatty acid wax partitioning agent such as stearamides.the examiner rejected the claims as obvious because,even though the prior art taught the use of talc,clay and metal stearates as partitioning agents,the prior widiger patent taught the use of stearamides for preventing adhesion of films in the food packaging industry.
the applicants responded by pointing out that the widiger patent was nonanalogous art.however,the examiner maintained the rejection,stating 
the definition of a fatty acid wax is an ester of fatty acids and alcohols,the applicants include stearamides in their definition of the fatty acid wax.it seems that the applicants is sic defining the fatty acid wax as the fatty acids and its derivatives thus the metal stearates of johnston seems to be functionally equivalent to stearamide.
conoco subsequently cancelled its original claims and submitted new claims that continued to claim the fatty acid wax limitation.upon submission of the new claims,one proposed claim,claim,did not contain the fatty acid wax limitation.this element was later added by examiner amendment with no explanation.
after a meeting between the applicants and the examiner to explain the differences between metal stearate partitioning agents in a water or system and fatty acid waxes in a nonaqueous system,the examiner allowed the claims of the patent,explaining that 
johnston et do not teach or reasonably suggest their coating agent to be a fatty acid wax such as stearamides and the like.although widiger et teach slip additives of amides such as stearamide for preventing the adhesion between surfaces of polyolefin articles,since applicant has shown the criticalities of using fatty acid wax as the partitioning agent over metal stearates the salt forms of the fatty acid wax in the video tape provided during the interview of august,thus,the instant claims are deemed novel.
emphasis in original.
claim construction 
before trial,the parties asked the court to explicitly construe mixture in the patent and fatty acid wax in the patent.the court construed mixture to be a suspending material containing more than negligible amounts of water and alcohol.markman order at.the court rejected eei proposed construction that incorporated language from the specification noting a mixture that contained water.furthermore,the court read the specification to require more than negligible amounts of water because the specification required an aqueous suspending material that it defined as a medium made from,with or by means of water.id.at citing webster new international dictionary ed.
the court construed fatty acid wax to be stearamides and similar amide derivatives.id.at.the court recognized that the applicants accepted the examiner more limited definition of fatty acid wax during prosecution that excluded the derivatives of fatty acids such as metal stearates.
alleged infringing activity 
eei began producing dras in with a product.in late,eei developed and began selling a dra called xpand high internal product ratio hipr.the original process for making hipr used as a suspending medium,and the district court found that hipr contained the following materials percent percent pe percent percent percent and percent.
the district court found that,the accused suspending material,contained to percent water and to percent ethanol.the remaining ingredients consist primarily of a denaturing agent known as methyl isobutyl ketone mibk,which is added to industrial alcohols to avoid paying liquor taxes and to avoid human consumption.eei presented evidence that consisted of the following materials percent percent percent other percent percent percent percent percent percent.the district court found that any and components in,such as the ammonia,heptane and mibk,were impurities.
in april of,eei switched from its original process that used to its current process that used.was composed of hexanol as a suspending medium therefore,the current process did not infringe the patent because the suspending medium was not composed of a mixture.however,conoco claimed the current process infringed the patent.
at trial,eei conceded that the current process met every element of claims of the patent except for the requirement that the partitioning agent be a fatty acid wax.eei current process uses wax as the partitioning agent.wax is not a fatty acid wax or stearamide as defined by the patent.it is a straight hydrocarbon wax.
district court orders 
summary judgment 
before trial,eei moved for summary judgment of on the patent claims.it argued that conoco was estopped from alleging infringement because the inventors argued during prosecution that fatty acid wax applied to stearamides and the like,therefore excluding all other equivalent compounds.the district court denied the motion and stated that conoco was not estopped because the fatty acid wax limitation was present throughout prosecution,the limitation was not amended for reasons related to patentability,and during prosecution conoco only surrendered application of the limitation to metal stearates,not hydrocarbon waxes.furthermore,even if there had been a narrowing of the claims,the district court held that conoco could rebut any estoppel presumption because the evidence indicated that the use of wax was unforseeable and only tangentially related to the metal stearate disclaimer.
findings of fact and conclusions of law 
after conducting a bench trial,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law.in regards to the patent,the court found that eei hipr product was a stable nonagglomerating suspension when it entered the pipeline based on eei memos and expert testimony.further,eei original process contained a meaningful amount of water in its suspending medium that made it a mixture for purposes of the claims.the court found that any mixture over to percent water was not negligible in this context because it would impact the density and suspension capabilities of the suspending medium.findings of fact and conclusions of law at.last,the court found that all other and components,such as mibk,were impurities that were not to be counted against the exclusive consisting of language.thus,eei original process for manufacturing hipr literally infringed the patent.
next,the district court found that the wax was equivalent to the fatty acid wax limitation in the patent under the test.the wax served the same function by preventing agglomeration of the polymer in a nonaqueous suspension.the wax performed this function in substantially the same way by coating the polymer during the cryogrinding process.the wax achieved the same result by creating a polymer suspended in a nonaqueous solution.
contempt hearing 
in the district court final judgment,it enjoined eei to cease all manufacturing,offers for sale,and sales of its infringing hipr slurry drag reducing agent product effective immediately.eei,however,continued to manufacture its hipr product and substituted pe wax for the wax.conoco moved to find eei in contempt of the injunction.the court denied the motion because its order was unclear and could be read to allow the use of pe wax.the district court clarified its order and extended the injunction to include eei reformulated process using pe wax.
eei filed a timely appeal in this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a bench trial,we review a district court decision for errors of law and clearly erroneous findings of fact.brown williamson tobacco philip morris.claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo.see cybor fas,en banc.whether an accused device meets all the limitations of those claims is a factual question we review for clear error.see playtex,procter gamble.
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is also a factual question that we review for clear error.see biovail.int l andrx.however,we review issues relating to the application of prosecution history estoppel de novo.see festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,en banc.
we review a district court decision to extend injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.see eli lilly medtronic.we review the factual findings during a contempt proceeding for clear error.additive controls measurement,flowdata.
b.the patent 
first,eei contends that it did not literally infringe the patent because the district court erred in its claim construction and infringement analysis.as part of its recitation of error,eei claims that the district court erred by construing mixture to mean more than negligible amounts of water,by finding was a suspending medium consisting of a mixture,and by finding the accused product to be stable and nonagglomerating.
first,eei asserts that the district court misconstrued the term mixture because it did not limit the term composition to at least percent water as described in the specification.in phillips awh,we reaffirmed our often stated rule that the words of a claim are generally given the ordinary and customary meaning that they would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention,en banc quoting vitronics conceptronic.however,this person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears,but in the context of the entire patent,including the specification.id.at see also markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d holding that the claims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.indeed,an inventor may use the specification to intentionally disclaim or disavow the broad scope of a claim.phillips,at.
however,this intention must be clear,see teleflex,ficosa am,the patentee may demonstrate an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim term by including in the specification expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction,representing a clear disavowal of claim scope,and can not draw limitations into the claim from a preferred embodiment,see phillips,at w e have expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single embodiment,the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment.moreover,when a claim term is expressed in general descriptive words,we will not ordinarily limit the term to a numerical range that may appear in the written description or in other claims.renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,modine int l trade comm n.
here,the specification states that the amount of alcohol employed in the suspending material may vary widely but it usually forms between about and weight percent of the suspending material,and more usually between about and about weight percent.patent,emphasis added.eei maintains that this language explicitly limits the amount of alcohol in the suspending medium to a numerical and percent.however,this language refers to a preferred embodiment of the invention,and the given numerical ranges are not used in a context meant to limit the claims.in fact,the language itself inherently recognizes that the numerical range should not limit the claim by noting that the amount of alcohol may vary widely and usually falls within a numerical range.thus,the patentee did not limit the claim term as eei suggests and the district court did not err in its claim construction.
consisting of and stable nonagglomerating suspension claim terms 
next,eei argues that the district court erred by misconstruing the terms consisting of and stable nonagglomerating suspension.eei suggests that the court has erred in its claim construction and that we should review the construction of both terms de novo.conversely,conoco argues that eei waived its right to ask for explicit claim construction on both terms because it conceded they were not in dispute by not raising the issue before,during,or after trial 
normally,a district court faced with a patent infringement suit engages in a analysis,involving construing the disputed claims of the matter of comparing the accused device to the patent matter of fact.cybor,at.however,legal issues in patent infringement suits are not immune to the doctrine of waiver on appeal,and except for certain circumstances,those issues not raised below at the district court can not be heard for the first time on appeal.interactive gift express,compuserve.thus,a party may not introduce new claim construction arguments on appeal or alter the scope of the claim construction positions it took below.id.at see also ntp,research in motion.moreover,litigants waive their right to present new claim construction disputes if they are raised for the first time after trial.see eli lilly aradigm.
in eli lilly,the appellant argued that the district court erred by not construing a claim before sending the underlying inventorship issue to the jury.id.however,we held that because the appellant waited to raise the argument until after the presentation of all the evidence to the jury,it waived the right to seek a construction of the newly disputed terms.id.as a result,the appellant implicitly conceded that the meanings of the terms in the claim are clear and not in need of construction.id.
on the other hand,a district court may engage in claim construction during various phases of litigation,not just in a markman order.we have recognized that district courts may engage in rolling claim construction,in which the court revisits and alters its interpretation of the claim terms as its understanding of the technology evolves.guttman,kopykake,citing sofamor danek group.
in the present case,eei suggests that we review the terms consisting of and stable nonagglomerating suspension de novo.because consisting of is a term of art in patent law with its own construction,mpep,see also vehicular techs.titan wheel int l,we will apply that legal construction,discussed below,and review the court infringement analysis for clear error the second term,stable nonagglomerating suspension,is not such a term of art.as conoco suggests,eei waived its right to have that term construed and therefore conceded that the construction was clear and not in need of construction.however,the district court explicitly construed the term in its findings of fact and conclusions of law stating,
the court reads the term stable nonagglomerating suspension to mean that the polymer particles are stable and not agglomerating at the time that the dra is introduced into the pipeline 
under the patent,a product is stable when the polymer particles are suspended in water or a mixture of water and alcohol with the addition of a water soluble thickening agent,if needed other things being equal the nearer the density of the suspending medium is to the density of the polymer,the easier it is to form the stable suspension of the invention.
because the court explicitly construed the term sua sponte and applied that construction to the facts,we must review its construction de novo.see allen eng g bartell,reviewing a court claim construction within its findings of fact and conclusions of law after a bench trial de novo.
consisting of 
first,eei alleges that the patentee use of consisting of limits the scope of the patent to exclude products performing only the recited steps of the patent and nothing else.eei contends that the district court erred by allowing the accused process suspension medium to include mibk,a,in spite of the limitation that the suspending medium consist of water or a mixture.
transitional phrases,such as comprising,consisting of,and consisting essentially of,are terms of art in patent law that define the scope of the claim with respect to what unrecited additional components or steps,if any,are excluded from the scope of the claim.mpep accord vehicular techs,at.the phrase consisting of signifies restriction and exclusion of unrecited steps or components.mpep.although consisting of is a term of restriction,the restriction is not absolute.the patent board of appeals has interpreted consisting of to close the claim to the inclusion of materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated therewith.ex parte davis,pat.office see also bethell koch,noting the parties concession of a similar meaning of consisting of.
we have explained that consisting of does not exclude additional components or steps that are unrelated to the invention.see norian stryker.in norian,the district court for the northern district of california found as a matter of law that a product containing an unrecited element did not infringe patent the patent because the transitional phrase consisting of excluded the additional element from the protection of the patent.id.at.specifically,the patent taught a kit containing specified chemicals the infringing kit contained all the recited elements of the patent,but added one element unrelated to the invention disclosed in the spatula.id.the district court held that adding the spatula to an otherwise infringing product avoided infringement of the patent.
on appeal,we reversed the district court holding and explained,
consisting of is a term of patent convention meaning that the claimed invention contains only what is expressly set forth in the claim.however,while consisting of limits the claimed invention,it does not limit aspects unrelated to the invention.it is thus necessary to determine what is limited by the consisting of phrase.
id.at citation omitted.we held that the invention disclosed in the patent was directed to a kit containing specified chemicals,and although the claims explicitly recited that no other chemical could be included in the composition,a competitor could not avoid infringement by adding a component unrelated to the invention.id.
similarly,impurities that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would ordinarily associate with a component on the consisting of list do not exclude the accused product or process from infringement.eei contends that mibk is not an impurity because it was purposely added to the alcohol to denature it.however,the intentional addition of a component does not change its status as an impurity ordinarily associated therewith.see davis,at.
mibk is a common impurity in industrial alcohols in order to prevent a liquor tax from being applied.if,however,mibk had been added to adjust the stability of the suspending medium or prevent agglomeration of polymer,it may not have been an impurity and therefore eei would most likely not infringe.thus,impurities normally associated with the component of a claimed invention are implicitly adopted by the ordinary meaning of the components themselves see phillips,at the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
the district court found as a matter of fact that consisted of water and alcohol and that any and components,such as mibk,were impurities.this conclusion was based on the testimony of eei expert,who acknowledged that the small amounts of ammonia and heptane in the suspension were impurities and was impeached by prior testimony indicati
