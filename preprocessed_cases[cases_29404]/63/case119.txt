factual and procedural history 
feliciana corporation,duncan underwood,everett desha,and the seeligson oil company collectively,the working interest owners owned a texas oil well named striebeck.the working interest owners designated hoc as the operator of the well,and hoc hired bay rock to supervise and manage the drilling of the well.under bay rock supervision,striebeck suffered a blowout,causing property damage and the loss of gas from the well.in the wake of the blowout,bay rock contacted cudd pressure control to obtain services.hoc incurred the costs to control,repair,evaluate,and complete the well after the blowout.hoc had a policy with paul,and paul paid the costs incurred by hoc pursuant to a settlement agreement after hoc demanded coverage for the costs.
thereafter,paul and the working interest owners brought suit in texas state court,accusing bay rock of negligently causing the blowout.a state court jury found that bay rock was negligent and awarded paul and the working interest owners the costs incurred to control the well the costs incurred to repair,evaluate,and complete the well and the value of the gas lost in the blowout.the san antonio court of appeals affirmed,and the texas supreme court denied bay rock petition for review and its petition for rehearing 
bay rock had a commercial general liability policy the cgl policy and an umbrella policy the umbrella policy collectively,the policies with.defended bay rock in the state court action under a reservation of rights letter.after judgment was entered against bay rock,brought this diversity action in federal district court,seeking a declaration that bay rock damages were not covered by the policies.and appellees both moved for summary judgment.the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment and denied motion.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
raises a number of arguments for reversing the district court grant of summary judgment.first,argues that paul had no right to bring the underlying state court action.second,asserts that the damages awarded against bay rock do not fall within the policies general grants of coverage.finally,argues that certain exclusions or limitations remove from coverage the damages at issue.we will address each of arguments in turn 
paul subrogation rights 
argues that paul lacked the legal capacity to bring the underlying liability suit as hoc subrogee and,therefore,there is no coverage for the damages awarded against bay rock.the district court found that the issue of paul right of subrogation was litigated in the state court action and that was barred from it.under texas law,a party legal authority to sue or be sued,is an issue that can not be attacked in a separate proceeding.see presley republic energy drilling,wl,at worth,no pet.nevertheless,argues that it is not collaterally estopped from paul subrogation right because it was not in privity with bay rock.we disagree.
an insurer in a coverage case will be barred from a particular issue from the underlying liability case if the issue raised in the coverage suit was raised and determined in the liability suit the issue determined in the liability suit was essential to the judgment in the liability suit and the necessary requirement of privity exists between the insurer and the insured.see getty oil ins.of,columbia mut.ins.fiesta mart,cir.the requisite degree of privity between an insurer and its insured can exist if the insurer controlled the insured defense in the liability suit and the insurer and the insured do not hold conflicting positions with respect to the issue determined in the liability suit.see state farm lloyds borum,pet.denied showing that privity can be established if the insurer controls an insured litigation and is not in conflict with the insured as to the particular issue to be see also benson ford,wanda petroleum,cir citing a liability insurer assum ing control of a defense as an example of the control necessary to find privity.controlled bay rock defense,and its position with respect to paul subrogation right is the same as bay rock position.accordingly,we conclude that was in privity with bay rock,and,as a result,is collaterally estopped from paul right of subrogation 
b.the policies general grants of coverage 
asserts that the district court erred in finding that the damages awarded against bay rock fell under the policies general grants of coverage.brief raises two arguments to support its assertion the damages awarded against bay rock are not covered because hoc did not have an ownership interest in striebeck and the damages at issue are not covered because they were not because of property damage as required by the policies.this section will address each of arguments in turn.
ownership argument 
argues that the damages awarded against bay rock are not covered because hoc did not have an ownership interest in striebeck.the terms of the policies do not require hoc to have an ownership interest in striebeck for there to be coverage,and does not cite any authority that supports such a proposition.accordingly,we conclude that first argument is without merit.
the policies contain similar grants of coverage.the cgl policy states that will pay those sums that bay rock becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage similarly,the umbrella policy states that will indemnify bay rock for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit because of property damage the cgl policy and the umbrella policy both define property damage,in relevant part,as physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.accordingly,to prove coverage,bay rock only had to show that it was legally obligated to pay the damages awarded against it and that the damages awarded were because of physical injury to tangible property.nothing in the policies require the have an ownership interest in the property that was damaged for coverage to exist.
to support its ownership argument,also asserts that the underlying state lawsuit established that hoc suffered no injury in the blowout.this argument,however,does not show that hoc needed to have an ownership interest in striebeck for there to be coverage.moreover,the underlying state lawsuit actually established the opposite of assertion because the state court jury found that hoc incurred losses and awarded it damages as a result 
accordingly,hoc lack of an ownership interest in striebeck did not defeat bay rock claim for coverage.
because of property damage 
also argues that the damages awarded against bay rock were not related to any physical injury to tangible property and,therefore,are not covered by the policies.specifically,argues that the following costs are not covered the costs to control striebeck and the costs to repair,complete,and evaluate the well the district court found that all of these damages were the result of physical injury to tangible property and,therefore,they were covered by the policies.argues that the district court finding was erroneous.to support its argument,argues that appellees f
