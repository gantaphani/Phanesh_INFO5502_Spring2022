in the early morning hours of october,omega protein,inc omega vessel struck an oil platform owned by samson contour energy e p llc samson.on appeal,we must consider whether the district court erred in assigning fault equally between omega and samson,and whether the court erred in allowing omega to limit its liability under.finding no error,we affirm.
omega vessel gulf shore gulf shore is a steel hulled fishing vessel used to catch and process menhaden,a fish found in the gulf of mexico.gulf shore had various navigational aids,including an autopilot,a furuno model radar,and a pinpoint navigational chart system.the radar was equipped with an alarm,which emits a sound when an obstacle enters a field specified by the operator.the pinpoint system shows computerized navigational charts on a screen and displays the vessel progress across the chart.between midnight and on october,gulf shore left its base of operations in cameron,louisiana to proceed to fishing grounds at freshwater bayou,louisiana.at the helm was captain luther stewart.before that night,stewart had served as a menhaden pilot and captain for approximately twenty years.omega did not provide stewart with training on how to use the radar,and had no policy requiring him to use the alarm.stewart had not read the radar manual and was unaware of the alarm capabilities.gulf shore proceeded in an easterly direction at a speed of between nine and eleven knots.the weather was good,seas were calm,and visibility was seven to eight miles 
after gulf shore had been underway for several hours,the vessel chief engineer entered the wheelhouse to inform stewart that a component of the vessel refrigeration system had malfunctioned.stewart scanned the horizon to see if any obstacles were in the vessel path.seeing none,he turned on the wheelhouse lights to examine the part.he agreed that the part was broken,and unless it was replaced,the vessel could not fish and would have to return to port.stewart used his cell phone to call omega plant in cameron,hoping to arrange an air drop of a replacement part.stewart only reached a security guard at the cameron plant,and left a message for the marine department.stewart then called omega plant in abbeville,louisiana to see if the part was in stock there.while stewart was on the phone,and some ten to fifteen minutes after he turned on the wheelhouse lights,gulf shore struck omega oil platform platform.the platform is situated near a cluster of oil platforms known as the joseph harbor rigs.
after the allision gulf shore circled platform.stewart observed no lights and heard no sounding devices.three other crew members of gulf shore likewise testified that the platform lacked functioning lights or a fog horn.herbert fisher,captain of anna amy,a vessel owned by omega,testified that he passed platform prior to the allision on the morning of october.he stated that the platform lacked operational lights and sounding devices.another captain,lawson schools of cote blanche bay,also an omega vessel,testified that after the allision,he saw no lights operating on platform.he testified that when he had passed the same platform at night on other occasions,it was unlit.
following the allision,various employees and agents of samson boarded platform and inspected its lighting systems.baker energy was in charge of maintaining the lights on the platform.baker employee,troy whetstone,testified that he conducted tests just a few hours after the allision.whetstone placed a piece of electrical tape over the photocell of each of the four lights to simulate darkness.in each case,the light turned on as intended.terry smith,operations manager of wet tech energy a contractor hired by samson to perform quarterly inspections of platform lights arrived at the platform several hours after whetstone conducted his inspections.he performed tests on the electrical currents,batteries,solar panels,foghorn,and lights,and found no evidence to suggest that the lights and horn had not been working the previous night.smith also performed some routine maintenance.both smith and whetstone testified that they did not repair the platform lights.
additionally,samson hired george hero,an electrical engineer,to test the lighting systems on october,one week after the accident.hero was to determine whether there was evidence of any recent modifications or repairs to the lighting and foghorn systems or any evidence that the systems should not have been operational on october.hero opined that he saw no evidence that the lights had been repaired,and no evidence that the lights had been inoperative one week earlier.
the district court conducted a bench trial in february.in its judgment of march,the court found that omega sufficiently proved that platform did not have operational lights on the morning of the accident.the court discredited the testimony adduced by samson,noting that baker energy had not kept monthly maintenance reports for platform.moreover,the court disregarded the testimony by smith and hero,noting that it is entirely possible that the lights were repaired prior to their inspections,namely by whetstone.the court found that samson had committed a statutory violation by failing to have operable lights on a fixed structure.see.consequently,the vessel was not presumed to be at fault for the allision,and the burden remained on samson to prove negligence.
the court next found that samson carried its burden because it proved that captain stewart violated the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs.see foll.namely,stewart violated rule by failing to maintain a proper lookout by sight and hearing,as well as all other available means.see colregs.turning on the wheelhouse light created a mirror effect which greatly diminished stewart night vision.use of a cell phone likewise prevented stewart from maintaining a proper lookout.moreover,the court found that stewart had violated rule by failing to use all available means,the vessel radar to determine if a risk of collision existed.see colregs.namely,the mirror effect prevented stewart from seeing the radar display.the court emphasized that there was substantial testimony that captain stewart did not make effective use of his radar while navigating through the joseph harbor rigs.
once samson proved stewart negligence,the court noted that the burden shifted to omega to prove that it did have knowledge or privity of stewart acts.because the court characterized the cause of the allision as a mistake of navigation,it asked whether omega exercised reasonable care in selecting a qualified and competent master the court noted that stewart had all of the requisite licenses to operate gulf shore,and stewart record from twenty years of working on and operating menhaden vessels for omega was clean.the court found that omega had exercised reasonable care in selecting stewart as captain.consequently,the court found that omega lacked privity or knowledge of stewart negligence,and was therefore entitled to limit its liability.in light of these findings,the court apportioned fault for the allision and resulting damages equally to omega and samson.
samson moved for a new trial,or to alter or amend judgment.it contended that the court verdict was against the weight of the evidence the court erred by failing to apply trico marine assets diamond b marine services,cir and the court had failed to make findings of fact or consider facts tending to show that gulf shore was unseaworthy.after briefing and oral argument,the court entered a memorandum ruling on july,denying samson motions.samson appeals both the district court judgment and its denial of relief.we have jurisdiction over this appeal because it seeks review of an interlocutory decree determining the rights and liabilities of parties to an admiralty case.see a astarte shipping allied steel export,cir holding that appellate jurisdiction is present if the district court order has the effect of ultimately determining the rights and obligations of the parties with regard to the merits of the litigation.
as with any bench trial,following a maritime limitation case tried to a district court,the appellate court reviews findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo.see in re towing,cir.questions of fault,including determinations of negligence and causation,are factual issues,and may not be set aside on appeal unless clearly erroneous.trico marine assets,at.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson bessemer city,d.findings based on the credibility of witnesses demand even greater deference.tokio marine fire ins,flora mv,cir citing.a anderson,at.if a finding is based on a mixed question of law and fact,this court should only reverse if the findings are based on a misunderstanding of the law or a clearly erroneous view of the facts.bertucci contracting antwerpen,cir quoting flora mv,at.the appellate court likewise reviews the grant or denial of limited liability for clear error.see trico marine assets,at in re hellenic,cir.
we first consider whether the district court findings regarding the cause comparative fault allision are clearly erroneous before asking whether limitation of liability was proper.
samson contends that the lights of platform were operational on the night of the allision the allision could have been prevented if a the vessel had been equipped with functional navigational aids or updated charts,or b if stewart had used his radar alarm and the district court erred in its apportionment of fault.samson casts the court alleged missteps as errors of law which should be reviewed de novo.omega responds that the court in all instances properly stated the controlling legal standard,and merely rendered findings of fact that were contrary to samson preferences.consequently,argues omega,the court findings regarding fault and the cause of the allision are subject to reversal only if they are clearly erroneous.
first,samson recites the evidence tending to show that the lights on platform were operational.troy whetstone testified that he tested the lights following the allision by placing a piece of electrical tape over the photocell,and found that the lights turned on.samson also emphasizes that terry smith of wet tech energy believed that the lights had been operational,and george hero,an expert on electrical engineering,opined that there was no evidence of repairs.nevertheless,the district court discredited this theory,noting that it appeared that whetstone had repaired the lights.the district court instead relied on the testimony of six witnesses who viewed the platform on the night of the allision,both before and after gulf shore hit it,and testified that the lights were off.all of those witnesses were affiliated with omega in some way,while the witnesses presenting the contrary view were agents of samson there simply were no neutral witnesses present at the scene of the allision.because the evidence regarding the lighting of platform is at best in equipoise,we may not overturn the district court findings and credibility determinations subsumed therein as clearly erroneous.see bertucci contracting,at citing anderson,at.in re towing,at credibility determinations are the province of the trier of fact,which in this case is the district court.citations omitted.
in line with its theory that the lights of platform were operational,samson contends that the court misapplied the presumption that when a moving vessel allides with a stationary object,the vessel is presumed to be at fault,and has the burden of demonstrating a contributing fault by the stationary object.see the oregon.however,this presumption only applies in the absence of evidence of fault.see in re towing,at.here,because omega proved that platform was unlit,the district court concluded that samson committed a statutory violation.in light of this finding,the court was correct to disregard the presumption of the oregon.see id.the district court did not operate under a misunderstanding of the law and its findings were not based on a clearly erroneous view of the facts.see bertucci contracting,at.there was no error on this point.
despite finding platform at fault,the district court still held that samson proved that stewart negligence was a contributing cause of the allision stewart failed to maintain a proper lookout and failed to make effective use of the radar.samson agrees that stewart was at fault for the allision,yet contends that the district court findings regarding the cause of the allision are incorrect.namely,samson avers that stewart only made the decision to turn on his wheelhouse lights because the pinpoint navigational chart and the furuno radar did not show samson platform the cluster of twenty platforms in which it miles dead ahead.samson contends that the evidence proves that the navigational aids were defective or outdated.moreover,samson notes that omega failed to train stewart in how to use his navigational aids,specifically the alarm.it thus lays the blame for the allision not on stewart mistake of navigation,but rather on omega approach to management of the gulf shore,particularly the training and supervision of stewart additionally,samson insists that even if platform had no operational lights,this did not contribute to the allision,because the mirror effect caused by the wheelhouse lights would have prevented stewart from seeing the platform lights.samson presses causation because this issue bears on whether omega can limit its liability.
omega responds that there is no evidence that the navigational aids aboard gulf shore were or defective.according to omega,the evidence shows that stewart failed to use the aids prior to the allision,not that the radar and pinpoint system failed to show platform.omega notes that the platform had been in place for over twenty years,and would have been on any nautical chart of the area.it submits that the district court finding,that the allision was caused by a combination of stewart failure to maintain a lookout or properly use his functional navigational aids,together with the platform lack of lighting,is not clearly erroneous.
on direct examination,stewart testified that he did not look at his radar or pinpoint chart prior to turning on the wheelhouse lights.he testified that he relied solely on his visual scan of the horizon to determine if any objects lay in gulf shore path.on cross examination,however,stewart appeared to testify that he did not see the platform on the radar or pinpoint system before or after the allision.stewart also stated that he never used the chart for that,and that he did not use his radar to specifically look for platform after the allision happened.i think that was probably the furthest thing from my mind at the time.
in denying samson motion for relief,the court rejected the theory that the radar or pinpoint system were defective or,and also rejected samson argument that stewart lack of training in the use of the radar alarm caused or contributed to the accident the court expressly found that the lack of operational lights on platform precluded stewart from seeing the platform before he turned on the wheelhouse lights,contributing to the allision.in light of stewart testimony that visibility was seven to eight miles on the night of the allision,if the platform lights had been on,they would have been visible when stewart last scanned the horizon,when gulf shore was two to three miles away from platform.
having reviewed the entire record,we are not left with the firm conviction that the district court made a mistake in finding that stewart failure to use his navigational aids caused the allision.see transorient navigators southwind,cir.the evidence simply does not compel the conclusion that outdated or defective navigational aids were a factor.in re towing,at.we affirm the district court rulings,which are plausible in light of the record as a whole.
samson also argues that the district court apportionment of fault was clearly erroneous.samson pos
