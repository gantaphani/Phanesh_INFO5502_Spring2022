williston basin interstate pipeline company williston claims that it has lost and is continuing to lose natural gas stored in its elk basin storage reservoir due to the operation of gas production wells owned by howell petroleum corporation and anadarko petroleum corporation howell anadarko.two of those wells are located within the lateral boundaries of williston storage reservoir,but are completed in geologic formations the morrison and sundance formations below the geologic formation in which williston stores its natural gas the cloverly formation.williston brought an action in federal district court,seeking damages and injunctive relief pursuant to its state law claims of conversion and negligence and also seeking to condemn the two howell anadarko wells located within the lateral boundaries of the elk basin storage reservoir.the district court dismissed williston action.in this appeal,we consider williston arguments that the district court erred in dismissing williston complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim under the natural gas act nga.williston contends that the district court erred in holding that williston needed authorization from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc before it could condemn wells,and therefore erred in dismissing williston condemnation claim.williston also contends that its state law claims raised a substantial federal question because they were aimed at enforcing a duty created by the nga.we reject both of williston arguments and affirm the district court.
williston is an interstate natural gas pipeline company that delivers gas to a variety of customers in montana,north dakota,south dakota and wyoming.as part of its operations,williston stores gas in the elk basin storage reservoir within the elk basin field,which is located in southern montana and northern wyoming.the elk basin storage reservoir is located in an underground geological formation the cloverly formation from which the producible natural gas has already been removed.williston now uses this formation for storage and withdrawal of its stored natural gas,and has installed seven active wells in the reservoir for this purpose.
as an interstate natural gas company,williston is subject to federal regulation.see a,b.the nga authorizes ferc to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.see id.a a.williston gas storage facilities are regulated by ferc since those facilities are a critical part of the transportation of natural gas and sale for resale in interstate commerce.schneidewind anr pipeline,d see also a providing that t ransportation includes storage.under the nga,a natural gas company must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn from ferc before it can engage in the acquisition,construction,operation or extension of any facility.c a.natural gas companies must operate their facilities in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in their cpcn and in ferc regulations.see id.a,c a,e.
the elk basin storage reservoir was previously owned by billings gas company billings.in,ferc issued billings a cpcn to acquire and use the elk basin cloverly gas reservoir for purposes of underground storage.billings gas.the cpcn stated that the reservoir was more fully described in the application in these proceedings and exhibits appended thereto.id.at.utilities then acquired the reservoir and operated it until,at which time ferc approved williston application for a cpcn to acquire and operate natural gas facilities including the elk basin storage reservoir.the cpcn noted again that the facilities were more fully described in the application.williston basin interstate pipeline utils.
billings,and williston operated the elk basin storage reservoir until without any notable interference.during this period,howell petroleum corporation owned leases and mineral interests in oil and gas producing formations in the elk basin field.problems began in when anadarko petroleum,a corporation engaged in natural gas exploration and production,purchased all of howell stock.soon after the stock purchase,drilled several wells within the elk basin field,including wells and.well was completed in the sundance formation and well was completed in the morrison and sundance formations.although the morrison and sundance formations are located below the cloverly formation where williston natural gas is stored,both wells are located within the lateral boundaries of the elk basin storage reservoir and their well bores cross through the cloverly formation to reach the lower geologic formations.
on january,williston filed a complaint in district court against,alleging that d efendants have caused and are causing the loss of williston storage gas.williston claimed it conducted an analysis of elk basin storage reservoir data which indicated that the loss of gas in williston storage reservoir was directly correlated to increased production from wells.the complaint asserted state law conversion and negligence claims and sought damages and injunctive relief.
after filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter and diversity jurisdiction,williston filed an amended complaint which added a claim for condemnation under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure this amended complaint sought condemnation of wells and under the authority of williston cpcn.williston did not allege that its cpcn specifically described the property williston sought to condemn,nor did williston provide the district court with a copy of the map exhibits which accompanied its cpcn application,or with any other application materials depicting the lateral and vertical boundaries of the reservoir approved by ferc in the or order.in the absence of any ferc authorization to condemn the two wells,argued,among other things,that williston amended complaint failed to state a condemnation claim and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over that claim.on july,the district court granted motion to dismiss williston federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.
we first review williston challenge to the district court dismissal of williston condemnation claim.because the district court order discussed only jurisdictional grounds for dismissal,it apparently dismissed williston condemnation claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.however,the parties agree that the district court may have dismissed this claim for failure to state a claim.because we can affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record,see foster wilson,cir,we will consider both bases for dismissal.
we first consider williston argument that the district court could not dismiss williston condemnation claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.as a general rule,when t he question of jurisdiction and the merits of the action are intertwined,dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is improper.see safe air for everyone meyer,cir.such an intertwining of jurisdiction and merits may occur when a party right to recovery rests upon the interpretation of a federal statute that provides both the basis for the court subject matter jurisdiction and the plaintiff claim for relief.see id.citing sun valley,ernst,cir.as the court explained in steel citizens for a better environment,d,if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,then the court has jurisdiction over the dispute,and can not dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.id.at.quoting bell hood.there is an exception to this general rule,however a suit may sometimes be dismissed for want of jurisdiction where the alleged claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.bell,at.see also steel,at.
here the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over williston condemnation claim based on the court construction of two provisions of the nga,h and c a,as read together section h states that in order to bring a condemnation claim the natural gas company must have a cpcn and the acquisition must be necessary.see h permitting a condemnation action when a holder of a cpcn can not acquire the necessary required for its natural gas pipe lines,or the necessary land or other property required for pipeline operation facilities.section c a,in turn,precludes a natural gas company from acquiring or extending a facility without a cpcn from ferc authorizing such acts or operations.
according to the district court,in seeking to condemn wells and,williston was undertaking to extend its facilities.pursuant to c a,a natural gas company may not extend its facilities without a cpcn authorizing the extension.because ferc had not issued williston a cpcn specifically authorizing an expansion of williston facilities to include wells and,the district court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to entertain williston condemnation claim.
williston does not contest the district court determination that williston would need a cpcn specifically authorizing an extension of its facilities before williston could undertake any such extension.however,williston argues that it is not bringing its condemnation claim for the purpose of extending its facilities pursuant to c a.rather,williston contends that it is bringing its condemnation claim for the purpose of operating and maintaining its existing facilities.in other words,williston asserts that loss of natural gas from the reservoir impairs its operations,and williston needs to condemn wells in order to prevent further losses.because williston is not attempting to extend its storage capacity or otherwise extend its operations,williston claims that the acquisition of the wells would not constitute an extension of facilities that would trigger the restrictions imposed by c a.therefore,williston contends it does not need a cpcn authorizing its acquisition of these wells.
instead,williston relies on h,which gives the holder of a cpcn the right to acquire a to construct,operate,and maintain a pipe line or pipe lines for the transportation of natural gas,and the necessary land or other property for the location of stations or equipment necessary to the proper operation of such pipe line or pipe lines.h emphasis added.this language,williston argues,supports williston position that its existing cpcn gives williston the right to condemn property it needs for the operation and maintenance of its existing facilities without further authorization from ferc.
williston argument required the district court to consider c a and h and evaluate the merits of williston proposed interpretation of these statutes.because williston right to proceed with its condemnation claim would be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,steel,at.internal quotation marks omitted,dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction is improper.
the bell exception to this rule is inapplicable here.while the district court was correct to reject williston interpretation of c a and h,see infra at,the interpretation itself has not been foreclosed by our precedent.see oneida indian nation of county of oneida,d.moreover,despite argument that williston condemnation claim is facially deficient under rule,we can not say the claim is so immaterial,insubstantial,or frivolous on its face as to defeat federal jurisdiction.see bell,at.see also fed.civ.current version at fed.civ.
we nonetheless affirm the district court dismissal of williston condemnation claim on the ground that williston complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see foster,at fed.civ.b.to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,the plaintiff must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.w e may generally consider only allegations contained in the pleadings,exhibits attached to the complaint,and matters properly subject to judicial notice.we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.outdoor media group,city of beaumont,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
williston argues that it has stated a claim for relief under h by alleging that the property it seeks to condemn is necessary to the continued operation and maintenance of its existing facilities.under williston interpretation of h and c a,see supra at,williston is not seeking to extend its facilities,and thus can proceed with its condemnation claim without further authorization from ferc.based on this interpretation,williston contends that it has sufficiently stated a claim for relief,and the district court erred in dismissing its condemnation claim.williston does not dispute that it would lack authority to condemn howell anadarko wells,and thus would not be able to state a claim for relief,if acquisition of those wells constituted an extension of williston facilities.therefore,our determination regarding whether dismissal was proper under rule b turns on our answer to the question whether williston is seeking an extension of its facilities for purposes of c a.
we start with the plain language of the statute.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d.although the nga does not define what constitutes the extension of any facilities,see c a,the common usage of the word extension at the time the nga was enacted would include an expansion of the physical boundaries of a facility by adding additional property see webster new international dictionary of the english language ed defining extension as enlargement in dimension,area,duration,or scope.williston has not pointed to any language in the nga or implementing regulations supporting williston interpretation of the word extension as excluding the addition of property in cases where such property is useful for a natural gas company operation or maintenance of its existing facilities.
rather,the structure of the nga and its implementing regulations indicate that c a applies in every case where a natural gas company acquires additional property,even for operation and maintenance purposes.the nga gives ferc comprehensive authority over the control of natural gas companies facilities.see schneidewind,at.a natural gas company must obtain from ferc a certificate of public convenience and necessity before it extends any facility,because ferc must first be assured that the project will be carried out in compliance with ferc rules and regulations,and that the project is in accordance with the public interest.id.at.allowing a natural gas company to condemn property beyond the scope of its cpcn whenever that property could be useful for the operation or maintenance of an existing facility would create a significant gap in ferc oversight of new projects and acquisitions,one of the principal goals of c a.see id.moreover,it is inconsistent with a key congressional goal in enacting the nga,namely,to have ferc balance the competing public interests involved in a proposed project through the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity.see e schneidewind,at.see also consol.edison of,ferc may authorize or certificate any pipeline project that the agency determines is necessary or desirable in the public interest.internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,williston proposed interpretation of the word extension in c a as excluding acquisitions of property useful for operation or maintenance is contrary to ferc implementation of the nga.ferc has consistently interpreted the nga as requiring natural gas companies to obtain a cpcn before expanding a facility physical boundaries to include additional property,even when the natural gas company is undertaking such expansion for the purpose of establishing a buffer zone to prevent gas migration from an existing storage reservoir.in implementing the congressional scheme,ferc has promulgated regulations to ensure that landowners will be informed of any proposed infringement of their property rights,and will have an opportunity to contest such proposed infringements,prior to condemnation proceedings.thus the applicant for a cpcn is required to submit a complete map of the proposed project,a,and provide notification to all affected,id.d,including owners of property interests whose property i s within the area of proposed new storage fields or proposed expansions of storage fields,including any applicable buffer zone.id.d iv.the cpcn applicant must inform the landowner of its rights at the commission and in proceedings under the eminent domain rules of the relevant state.id.d v.landowners then have an opportunity to intervene and protest the proposed project.see id.even when ferc provides a mechanism for giving qualifying natural gas companies advance approval to acquire,construct,modify,replace,and operate facilities for the remediation and maintenance of an existing underground storage facility,id.a,b,ferc does not allow such qualifying companies to expand their storage facilities physical boundaries.rather,natural gas companies may undertake the specified improvements without prior ferc authorization provided the storage facility certificated physical reservoir and buffer boundaries remain unchanged.id.these regulations,which provide multiple layers of protection for landowners,are inconsistent with williston proposed interpretation of the nga as allowing a natural gas company to condemn property for operation or maintenance purposes without having to obtain ferc approval.
anr pipeline,further signals ferc rejection of an interpretation of the nga that would allow natural gas companies to expand their storage facilities physical boundaries without ferc authorization.in anr pipeline,ferc considered an application by anr,a natural gas company that sought to condemn property it deemed necessary to prevent migration of stored gas beyond its existing storage field boundary.at.anr sought a revised,larger boundary for its storage field in order to acquire,through eminent domain if necessary,the property rights it needs to protect the stored gas.id.ferc described its role under c as follows 
since anr is an interstate natural gas pipeline engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,it is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and to section c c of the nga.where appropriate,the commission has granted jurisdictional storage field operators amended certificate authority to revise their storage field boundaries in order to allow them to initiate condemnation procedures to seek storage easements that will allow for continued efficient operation of their certificated gas storage facilities.
anr pipeline,at.as indicated in anr pipeline,ferc must authorize natural gas companies to seek condemnation of additional property needed for efficient operation,and will grant such authorization only where appropriate and required by the public convenience and necessity.id.there would be no need for a natural gas company to apply to ferc for an amended authorization if it were free to condemn property required for efficient operation or maintenance purposes without ferc approval.see see also trunkline lng,determining that the acquisition of property for dispersion exclusion zones,constitutes an extension of the certificated facilities and requires from ferc.
the sixth circuit reached a similar conclusion in the leading case of columbia gas transmission v.an exclusive gas storage easement,cir.in that case,a natural gas company,columbia,sought to condemn an easement for underground storage of natural gas in property that was one to two miles away from columbia storage field.see id.at.columbia possessed a cpcn which did not cover the property it sought to condemn,but columbia argued that it did not need an amended cpcn because the property it sought to condemn contained gas that had migrated from columbia gas storage reservoir and the easement was necessary to protect its certificated natural gas storage pool.see id.at.
the district court had disagreed.noting that a natural gas company certificated facilities were those described in the map attached to its application for a cpcn,columbia gas transmission v.an exclusive gas storage easement,see a requiring the attachment of a detailed geographical map to an application for a cpcn,the district court held that a cpcn holder power of eminent domain extends only to the property located within the geographical area designated on the map or maps attached to the application for the certificate of public convenience and necessity as required by the ferc regulations.at.the sixth circuit affirmed the district court,ruling that h allowed columbia to condemn the additional property,but only if it first secure d a valid certificate of public convenience and necessity encompassing that property.at.see also b j oil gas fed.energy reg.comm n,noting ferc authority to enlarge a storage field boundary when expansion is necessary to preserve the integrity of the storage field.gas pipeline acres of land,holding that a natural gas company was not entitled to expand the scope of an easement authorized by its cpcn without further authorization.
williston efforts to distinguish columbia gas are unavailing.williston notes that wells are drilled through the elk basin storage reservoir and are within the lateral boundaries of williston storage facility,while in columbia gas the wells were drilled in areas beyond the lateral boundaries of the natural gas company facility.however,c and h make no distinction between extensions to property interests outside the lateral boundaries of a certificated facility and those outside the vertical boundaries of a certificated facility.columbia,like williston,was attempting to use a condemnation action to stop a third party from engaging in gas production operations that were allegedly capturing gas from columbia storage pool,and the sixth circuit held that the nga required columbia to first obtain an amended cpcn.the fact that williston condemnation action is aimed at stopping the production of gas in a lower geologic formation is not material.williston is seeking to acquire property that belongs to another party,the acquisition of which has not been specifically authorized by ferc.
because williston strained interpretation of the word extension is inconsistent with the structure and logic of the nga and with ferc regulations,we agree with the sixth circuit that a natural gas company may not condemn additional property that is not specifically described in its existing cpcn,even if the natural gas company seeks to acquire such property in order to operate and maintain an existing storage facility.in the typical case,the property covered by the existing cpcn will be specifically designated in the map exhibits attached to the application for the cpcn pursuant to a.williston does not dispute that the facility described in williston application for a cpcn does not include leasehold interests in the two wells completed in the sundance and morrison formations.therefore,williston cpcn provided no basis for a condemnation order under h.accordingly,williston amended complaint failed to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,twombly.at,and the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint.
the district court also acted well within its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.see c the district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim if the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction see also foster,at holding that the decision whether to continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims after all federal claims have been dismissed lies within the district court discretion.
we next turn to williston argument that the district court erred in holding that it lacked federal subject matter jurisdiction over williston state law claims.williston argues that it does not need to rely on supplemental federal jurisdiction over its state law claims,because the state law claims themselves invoke federal subject matter
