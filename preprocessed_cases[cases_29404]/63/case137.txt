louis solana and brendan lally commenced an action in admiralty against gsf development driller i,her engines,tackle,and apparel,in rem,and against globalsantafe drilling,globalsantafe,and globalsantafe hungary services collectively gsf,in personam.solana and lally asserted that they were entitled to recover,as pure salvors,at least one percent of the value of a drilling unit.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gsf.although we agree with the district court that the facts of this case do not support a salvage award,the present record does not support the district court conclusion that,as a matter of law,the parties agreed that the plaintiffs would be compensated in the same manner that they had previously been compensated.we accordingly reverse the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
for purposes of reviewing the summary judgment that was granted in favor of the defendants,we accept the plaintiffs assertions regarding the facts as true.the development driller i ddi is a drilling platform that was fabricated for use in the gulf of mexico,and its cost was in excess of.in the summer of,the ddi was anchored in grand isle block but had never performed drilling services because its cracked,submerged thruster housings were damaged and undergoing repair.as hurricane katrina approached,globalsantefe evacuated all of its and anchored rigs in the gulf of mexico,including the ddi,pursuant to its existing hurricane procedures.as part of that process,the ddi power was shut off,and its crew was flown to the shore.
prior to the events giving rise to this suit,louis solana had worked for globalsantafe drilling company and its predecessor for almost twenty years.he had been permanently assigned to the ddi for more than two years before arrival of katrina,initially serving as senior mate for about eight months before he was promoted to the position of offshore installation manager,which was the senior marine officer and the equivalent of the ddi captain.the parties dispute whether solana maintained a,schedule while assigned to the ddi,but they agree that his service had been performed on at least a somewhat similar basis.he was in the midst of his time off when the ddi was evacuated on august,but the parties agree that he had intended to return to the ddi on august as the captain of its crew.
brendan lally had worked for gsf since,had served on the ddi as a senior dynamic positioning operator and ballast control operator,and was evacuated from the ddi as katrina was bearing down on it.neither lally nor solana had signed ship articles.they were employees.they were compensated for time spent aboard the ddi but not for their time ashore.after lally was evacuated from the ddi,he found lodging in lafayette,louisiana,for which he,not gsf,paid.the day after the evacuation,august,gsf requested that lally travel to houston,texas to attend a seminar at a hotel on august,and he complied.that evening,he was asked by a representative of gsf,randy clevenger,if he and others who had been evacuated would return to the ddi to attempt to save the vessel.lally knew at this point in time that the drilling rig was listing as much as to degrees,which he said was a much larger list than i have ever experienced aboard a drilling vessel.he normally kept the ddi trimmed to within a degree of tolerance.lally affidavit states that based on the degree of the list in the wake of katrina,we all knew it indicated ddi must have sustained serious damage in the storm.lally and a number of other crew members agreed to return to the ddi,but several did not.
solana was in nevada when the ddi was evacuated,but on august he traveled with his wife to houston at his own expense.the following day,gsf asked if solana would be willing to come in from his time off to lead a team of volunteers to save ddi.in solana words,i was requested to have the team board dead ddi,restart her generators,conduct a damage assessment,keep her from sinking,and attempt to stabilize her.i agreed to lead the team.solana affidavit reflects that gsf maintained a description for the offshore installation manager position that solana held,and t hose duties do not include boarding a sinking,unstable drill unit to restore power,stanch flooding,and correcting her severe list,all in circumstances of grave danger.
the morning after gsf requested solana,lally and others to return to the ddi,the assembled team and randy clevenger were flown from houston to lafayette and then to the ddii,the ddi sister vessel,which sustained little damage from the storm.en route,they passed by the ddi and saw that it was severely listing,was out of position,and was dragging anchors.after arriving at the ddii,solana learned that none of the pilots of the larger helicopters were willing to ferry the group to the ddi because of its list.however,a pilot of a small helicopter agreed to transport a group of thirteen,two or three passengers at a time.the helicopter was unable to land on the ddi because its deck was sloping,and each group of the boarding team jumped from the airborne helicopter onto the ddi deck.the last of the group was onboard the ddi by the afternoon of august.
within three hours,emergency power had been established,and by that evening,the main power was essentially restored,although there were repeated blackouts.however,flooding was progressing and the situation was worsening.the team was gradually able to improve the vessel trim and counteract flooding.they advised gsf of the extent of damage,and gsf engaged a professional salvage firm.that firm salvage master boarded the ddi the following day,august,but due to the list of the drilling unit,it was not until the following day,september,that the professional salvage team came aboard the ddi to begin operations.solana and lally worked with the professional crew for the next few days,until september,when the platform was stabilized.eventually ddi was moved to port,and final repairs were completed eight months later.
solana and lally sued gsf in the eastern district of louisiana,demanding payment as salvors of ddi.after discovery,gsf moved to dismiss or,alternatively,for summary judgment.the defendants asserted that crew members are not entitled to a salvage award for assistance rendered to their own vessel and that though there are exceptions to this principle,solana and lally did not come within them.the defendants maintained that the ddi had not been abandoned,solana and lally returned to it to repair damage as part of the crew,and they were paid their usual salary for the time they spent on the ddi after hurricane katrina.
solana and lally responded by arguing that they were volunteers when they returned to the ddi the drilling unit was in peril they,along with professional salvors,were successful in saving it and they therefore are entitled to pure salvage.relying on the common law,solana and lally contended that in certain circumstances,crew members can be salvors.
in a brief supplemental response to the defendant motion for summary judgment,solana and lally argued for the first time that the united states is a party to the international convention on salvage the ddi was subject to that convention,and they were entitled to recover as salvors under article of the convention because there were no employment contracts in effect when they returned to the ddi following katrina.at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment,counsel for the plaintiffs additionally noted that the ddi is registered in vanuatu,which is also a signatory to the convention.at the same hearing,the plaintiffs advanced an alternative argument urging the district court to conclude that if there was a contract pursuant to which solana and lally boarded the ddi,the court should consider whether the services they rendered exceeded their normal duties and would entitle them to a salvage award.
the district court ruled from the bench at the close of the hearing.the court concluded that the undisputed facts established an oral contract and that solana and lally expected to be paid even if their efforts were unsuccessful.the district court cited a decision from the eleventh as supportin
