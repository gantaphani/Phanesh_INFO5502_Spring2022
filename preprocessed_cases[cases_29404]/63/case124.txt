appellant eog resources,eog and appellees collectively,chesapeake own mineral leases in a unitized pool of natural gas in bossier parish,louisiana.in,chesapeake drilled three wells without obtaining eog permission,in alleged violation of an operating agreement between the two.eog filed suit for breach of contract.chesapeake argued that it did not breach the operating agreement and that the suit was an impermissible collateral attack on orders of the louisiana commissioner of conservation.we reverse the judgment of the district court that the suit was an impermissible collateral attack,vacate the district court finding as to breach of contract,and remand for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
eog and chesapeake each own mineral leases in section of bossier parish,lousiana and are successors in interest to a operating agreement that formed a joint unit for development of the two leases.beneath section are three natural gas zones,as explained by the district court 
the hosston travis peak zone in the sligo field,bossier parish,louisiana,was defined in the louisiana office of conservation order,effective september.that order,as amended and supplemented by the series of orders,established rules and regulations and created drilling and production units for the exploration for and production of gas and condensate from the hosston travis peak zone in the sligo field,bossier parish,louisiana.one such unit was a unit designated as hoss tp sur comprised entirely of section.
the cotton valley d zone in the sligo field,bossier parish,louisiana,was defined in the louisiana office of conservation order,effective september.that order,as amended and supplemented by the series of orders,established rules and regulations and created drilling and production units for the exploration for and production of gas and condensate from the cotton valley d zone in the sligo field,bossier parish,louisiana.one such unit was a unit designated as cv d suaa comprised entirely of section.
the lower cotton valley zone,reservoir a,in the sligo field,bossier parish,louisiana was defined in the louisiana office of conservation order,effective october.that order,as amended and supplemented by the series of orders,established rules and regulations and created drilling and production units for the exploration for and production of gas and condensate from the lower cotton valley zone,reservoir a,in the sligo field,bossier parish,louisiana.one such unit was a unit designated as lcv ra sub comprised entirely of section.
eog,chesapeake,wl,at.the operating agreement covers and affects the parties gas and gas rights in the first and second zones,but not the third.chesapeake,which holds a percent share of the zones,was named operator of the agreement,with authority to manage,develop,and operate said leases subject to the operating agreement.the operating agreement contains a provision requiring the operator to obtain the consent of eog,the,prior to drilling 
no additional well shall be drilled by operator for the joint account unless and until mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto,and no expenditure shall be made by operator as to any one project or item in excess of the sum of five thousand without the written consent of the 
the operating agreement defines joint account as the combined interest of the parties in the unit.
the operating agreement governed the parties development of section for years.in,chesapeake filed applications with the louisiana office of conservation seeking to designate alternate unit wells for,among other units,the hoss tp sur,the cv d suaa,and the lcv ra sub.the commissioner of conservation held hearings on the proposed alternate wells in.eog did not attend the hearings despite receiving notice.after the hearings,the commissioner issued several orders permitting the drilling of the alternate wells at issue.these orders were each issued and promulgated by the commissioner as being reasonably necessary to conserve the natural resources of the state,to prevent waste,to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells,and otherwise to carry out the laws of the state.the commissioner found that it was reasonable and in the interest of conservation to permit chesapeake to drill,designate and utilize the proposed alternate wells.the commissioner also found that the wells were necessary and in the interest of conservation and would efficiently drain the relevant unit.
meanwhile,chesapeake sent three letters to eog proposing to drill three alternate wells pursuant to the operating agreement the chatman alternate well,the roy alternate well,and the roy alternate well.these wells were all located in section and were alternate wells slated to produce gas from all three of the zones described above.eog never provided written consent for the three wells,but there is some indication in the record that employees of eog raised objections on its behalf in conversations with chesapeake representatives.on may,chesapeake withdrew its proposals to drill the wells pursuant to the operating agreement and drilling the wells in accordance with provisions of title,section of the louisiana 
chesapeake suspended eog share of revenues from these new wells and offset eog portion of the drilling and completion costs.in addition,chesapeake offset an additional percent risk fee attributable to the wells and completion costs allocable to the lower cotton valley zone,reservoir a,which is not subject to the operating agreement.this suit followed.eog argues that its agreement to pay costs is limited by the provisions of the operating agreement,including the consent requirement,and that having breached this provision,chesapeake can not enforce its right to collect development costs.eog seeks a declaratory judgment that chesapeake breached the operating agreement and wrongfully withheld its percent share of development proceeds.chesapeake argues that it did not breach the operating agreement and that eog suit constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on orders of the commissioner of conservation.
the district court deferred for summary judgment and held a bench trial.at the close of eog case,chesapeake moved for and was granted a judgment on partial findings pursuant to rule c.the district court issued a memorandum ruling containing findings of fact and conclusions of law,and this appeal followed.

collateral attack 
louisiana revised statutes et create a commissioner of conservation to prevent the waste of the state oil and gas resources.the commissioner has authority over all persons and property necessary to enforce effectively the provisions of this chapter and all other laws relating to the conservation of oil or gas.id.a.prior to drilling,a tract owner must obtain a determination from the commissioner that a proposed well will not waste oil and gas reserves.see nunez wainoco oil gas,so d,cert.denied,describing the commissioner powers.the commissioner has specific powers to 
make such inquiries as he thinks proper to determine whether or not waste of oil and gas exists or is imminent and the authority to collect data to make investigations and inspections to examine properties,leases,papers,books,and records to examine,survey,check,test,and gauge oil and gas wells,tanks,refineries,and modes of transportation to hold hearings to provide for the keeping of records and the making of reports to require the submission of an emergency phone number by which the operator may be contacted in case of an emergency and to take any action to enforce his powers.
ann.b.after notice and hearing,the commissioner can issue a broad range of orders and regulations aimed at preventing waste.id.c.
the commissioner has the obligation to declare drilling units in oil and gas fields,the maximum area that can be efficiently and economically drained by one wel
