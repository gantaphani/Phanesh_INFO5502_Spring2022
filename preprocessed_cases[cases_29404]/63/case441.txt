under federal law,firms that extract natural gas from leased federal,tribal,or offshore lands pay the government royalties calculated as a percentage of the value of the production they extract.this case involves a valuation dispute concerning gas that is sold twice first by the producer to a gas marketing firm it controls,and then by the controlled marketing firm to.the secretary of the interior valued the gas production based on the contract price of the resale.challenging that decision,the producer argues that the secretary should have valued the production based on the lower contract price of the initial sale.because the applicable regulation unambiguously requires valuation based on the initial sale,we reject the secretary contrary interpretation.though we express no opinion on whether the secretary might have statutory authority to value production based on the resale price,the secretary may not do so by interpreting a regulation to mean the opposite of its plain language.
through its minerals management service mms,the department of the interior issues and administers gas leases for federal lands,indian tribal and allotted lands,and the outer continental shelf.see mineral leasing act,et federal lands mineral leasing act for acquired lands,et acquired federal lands,indian tribal and allotted lands outer continental shelf lands act,et outer continental shelf.see generally indep.petroleum ass babbitt.under such leases,private companies sell gas production directly and then compensate the government with royalties calculated as a percentage of the value of the production removed or sold from the leased lands.b federal lands a outer continental shelf b b indian tribal and allotted lands.concerned that the system of accounting with respect to royalties and other payments due and owing on gas produced from federal,tribal,and offshore lease sites is archaic and inadequate,a,congress enacted the federal oil and gas royalty management act fogrma,et,which directed the secretary to establish a comprehensive inspection,collection and fiscal and production accounting and auditing system to provide the capability to accurately determine gas royalties owed,and to collect and account for such amounts in a timely manner,a.
pursuant to fogrma and the leasing statutes,the mms promulgated a regulation establishing methods for determining the value of the production for royalty calculation purposes.see revision of gas royalty valuation regulations and related topics,codified at unprocessed gas,processed gas.the regulation establishes three different valuation methodologies,depending on the particular entity to whom producers first sell the gas.gas sold directly to purchasers under ordinary arm length contract s is valued on the basis of gross proceeds accruing to the lessee a defined term meaning total direct and indirect consideration under the contract.b i unprocessed gas,b i processed gas,defining arm length contract and gross proceeds.gas sold to marketing that purchase gas exclusively from producers that own or control subsequently resold by the marketing affiliates pursuant to arm length contracts is valued on the basis of downstream resales.b i unprocessed gas,b i processed gas,defining marketing affiliate.gas sold to owned or controlled affiliated entities that,because they purchase at least some gas from sources other than their owning or controlling producer,are not marketing affiliates is valued on the basis of the first applicable of three benchmarks.c unprocessed gas,c processed gas.the first benchmark values gas based on gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale under its length contract,provided that those gross proceeds are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from comparable sales in the same field or area.c unprocessed gas,c processed gas.the second benchmark values gas based on information relevant in valuing gas,including other reliable public sources of price or market information.c unprocessed gas,c processed gas.the third,which values gas based on another proxy for market price under an arm length contract,is irrelevant to this case.c unprocessed gas,c processed gas.finally,and central to this case,the regulation contains a notwithstanding any other provision of this section,under no circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production.h unprocessed gas,h processed gas.
appellants fina oil and chemical company and petrofina delaware,are natural gas producers holding onshore and offshore federal leases.like the parties,we shall call appellants fina.fina natural gas company fngc is a natural gas marketer that purchases gas from producers for resale to downstream.though controlled by fina,fngc is not a marketing affiliate because it purchases gas from both fina and other gas producers.fina therefore paid royalties based on its contract price with price which,according to fina,complies with the first benchmark or,if the first benchmark is inapplicable,with the second.
in,the mms issued an order rejecting fina use of the benchmarks,requiring fina instead to base its royalty valuation on the higher prices that fngc receives from subsequent downstream arm length sales.fina appealed to the interior board of land appeals,but while that appeal was pending,the board decided seagull energy,may,which reversed an mms order substantially similar to the order in fina case and squarely rejected the mms position that gas sold to affiliates and later resold to must be valued based upon the resale price.
seagull proved.two weeks after it was issued,the acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management,with the secretary of the interior concurrence,expressly overruled seagull in a decision called texaco exploration production,docket no.g may.though texaco involved the valuation of oil,not gas,it presented the same legal issue we face here because the mms oil valuation and gas valuation regulations are identical for all relevant purposes,see revision of oil product valuation regulations and related topics,codified at,and because the oil was sold by a producer like fina to a affiliate like fngc.holding the benchmarks inapplicable in valuing oil production resold at a profit by a affiliate,texaco expressly rejected seagull reasoning on two grounds.first,texaco noted that the gross proceeds provision requires all valuations to equal at a minimum the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee,a term the decision interpreted as referring to the total consideration received by the corporate family to which the producer and affiliate belong.because the benchmarks measure only what the producer receives through transfers,not the total consideration the corporate family receives from resale,texaco reasoned that the benchmarks yield valuations less than gross proceeds accruing to the lessee whenever a affiliate resells gas for more than it originally paid its controlling producer.thus,texaco found that in such instances the gross proceeds provision supersedes the benchmarks,requiring the producer to calculate value based on its affiliate resale proceeds.second,finding that oil and gas lessees have an implied duty to include in production valuations any increase in value resulting from marketing activities,texaco concluded,alternatively,that a lessee may not base valuations on sales to a affiliate that later turns around and performs marketing activities.texaco at.
because the assistant secretary issued texaco under her discretionary authority to step into the mms director shoes and directly hear appeals from mms orders,texaco binds the board.see texaco at blue star,finding board bound by decision made by assistant secretary standing in the shoes of a subdepartment of the department of the interior marathon oil,same.accordingly,the board summarily denied fina appeal,concluding that t he arguments raised by appellants with respect to the value of production for royalty purposes have all been addressed in texaco we therefore adopt the analysis and rational sic contained therein to affirm mms.fina oil chem,june.
