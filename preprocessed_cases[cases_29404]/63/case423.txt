the natural gas act of provides that n o company shall,with respect to any transportation or sale of natural gas make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage.b.the act fundamental purpose is to protect natural gas consumers from the monopoly power of natural gas pipelines.see associated gas distribs.ferc.congress has directed the federal energy regulatory commission to enforce the statute and regulate the pipelines.since the,ferc has done so primarily through rules that require pipelines to carry gas on equal terms and not to grant undue preferences or discriminate in favor of gas sold by the pipeline itself.see id.at united distribution ferc.
in,acting pursuant to its statutory authority,ferc issued standards of conduct to regulate natural gas pipelines interactions with their marketing affiliates.marketing affiliates are the separate affiliates of pipelines that sell natural gas the affiliates arrange to purchase gas at the wellhead and to transport and distribute it to buyers.the standards required pipelines and their marketing affiliates to function independently and imposed restrictions on the sharing of information between them.ferc promulgated those rules because of i the theoretical threat that pipelines would favor their marketing affiliates by selectively divulging information about pipeline operations,thereby impeding market competition and ii a factual record consisting of complaints by other sellers who were competing with pipelines marketing affiliates and of documented abuses by pipelines and their marketing affiliates.
the pipelines petitioned for review,but we denied the petition in relevant part.we recognized that ferc must take into account the substantial efficiencies and benefits of vertical integration.we nonetheless upheld the order because ferc had sufficiently demonstrated both a theoretical threat of pipelines granting undue preferences to their marketing affiliates and substantial record evidence of actual abuse.see tenneco gas ferc.
in,ferc significantly revised and extended the standards so that they would apply to pipelines relationships not only with marketing affiliates but also with other entities in the industry such as producers,gatherers,processors,and traders that are affiliated with pipelines.in vastly expanding the reach of the standards,ferc again relied on both a claimed theoretical time,of pipelines granting undue preferences to those record evidence that,according to ferc,indicated that abuse by pipelines and affiliates was a real problem in the industry.the two dissenting ferc commissioners objected,however,that the factual record on which ferc relied was barren and did not contain a single example of abuse involving affiliates,much less evidence of an problem.
several pipelines petitioned for review in this court.we conclude that ferc asserted factual premises do not withstand scrutiny and that the order does not reflect the reasoned decisionmaking required by the administrative procedure act.we therefore hold that the order is arbitrary and capricious as applied to natural gas pipelines.we will grant the petition,vacate the order as applied to natural gas pipelines,and remand.because of our disposition,we need not consider the separate arguments against the order raised by calypso pipeline and the local natural gas distribution companies.
the natural gas supply chain consists of a variety of entities.some of them,such as producers,gatherers,processors,pipelines,and local distribution companies,perform the physical processes required to extract,refine,transport,and distribute gas.other entities,such as marketers and traders,operate on the financial side,coordinating sales and trading in the natural gas commodity market.
producers establish new wells and extract natural gas from the ground.gatherers transport the gas from the wellhead to a processing plant.from there,processors distill pipeline quality natural gas by removing various hydrocarbons and fluids some processing is done initially at the wellhead or later in the supply chain.natural gas pipelines either intrastate or interstate carry gas to local distribution companies and to large industrial and commercial customers.finally,local distribution companies deliver gas to retail consumers,subject to price regulation by state utility commissions.
natural gas marketers sell natural gas and oversee the steps needed to arrange transportation of gas from the wellhead to the.frequently affiliated with another entity such as a producer or pipeline,marketers identify customers,arrange gas transportation and storage,and ensure that adequate supplies are available to satisfy the purchasers demand.
in recent years,entities referred to as natural gas traders have actively participated in the natural gas spot market and the natural gas derivatives market.in the spot or physical market,traders enter into contracts for the delivery of natural gas.in the derivatives market,traders buy and sell derivative instruments like futures that are based on the underlying natural gas commodity.traders participate in those markets primarily to hedge against risk or to profit from speculation on future price changes.
like railroads,water pipelines,cable television lines,and telephone lines,natural gas pipelines traditionally have been considered natural monopolies.in other words,the costs of entering the market are so high because of the large fixed cost of building a pipeline that it is most efficient for only one firm to serve a given geographical region.see richard posner,economic analysis of law,at ed see also united distribution ferc,associated gas distribs.ferc.as natural monopolies,pipelines if unregulated would possess the ability to engage in monopolistic pricing for transportation services and discriminate against unaffiliated entities that seek to transport gas.
as this court has explained,federal regulation of the natural gas industry is designed to curb pipelines potential monopoly power over gas transportation.united distribution,at.federal regulation began in after congress passed and president franklin roosevelt signed the natural gas act.stat.codified as amended at et.that act conferred jurisdiction on ferc predecessor,the federal power commission,to regulate the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas.see b,a.the act also established a certification system and required the commission to ensure that all rates were just and reasonable and that natural gas companies did not grant undue preference s.see id,c a.under this system,the commission for decades regulated both the wellhead price and the city gate price the price charged by pipelines to and local distribution companies.see generally stephen breyer paul macavoy,energy regulation by the federal power commissionn.
in,congress passed and president carter signed the natural gas policy act,stat.that act began the gradual deregulation of prices at the wellhead.in the aftermath of the act and as a result of other legal and economic developments in the early,ferc launched a new regulatory approach.the commission concluded that it could best fulfill the statutory purposes by allowing customers to purchase gas at the wellhead free from regulation and by preventing pipelines from abusing their monopoly power over the transportation of gas.at the time,pipelines served not just as transporters of gas but also as the primary gas marketers they would purchase gas at the wellhead themselves,transport it over their systems,and sell it to local distribution companies or other.see associated gas,at.the problem was that pipelines could exclude third parties from using the transmission facilities when pipelines wanted to favor the pipelines own sales.see id.
to achieve its regulatory goals,ferc issued its landmark order in.see regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol,order,stats.regs.rehearing orders omitted.order declared the bundling of transportation and marketing services unduly discriminatory and conditioned blanket certification which allowed pipelines to avoid costly individual certifications on open access to pipelines transmission facilities.the order served to help deregulate the sales market,where there are no natural barriers to market competition,while simultaneously preventing activity by the monopolistic pipelines in the transportation market.this court upheld the regulatory scheme as consistent with ferc authority to prevent natural gas companies from granting undue preferences.see associated gas,at approving bulk of order regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol,order,stats.regs.readopting in large part order am.gas ass ferc,remanding record of order am.gas ass ferc,largely upholding additional orders and.
in,ferc followed up on order by issuing order,which fully mandated the unbundling of transportation and marketing by directly requiring pipelines to offer transportation service on a basis.see pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation and regulation of natural gas pipelines after wellhead decontrol,order,stats.regs.rehearing orders omitted.we upheld that order in large part.see united distribution,at.
in the,as ferc unbundled interstate pipelines marketing and transportation functions by requiring pipelines to transport gas on equal terms,pipelines began to withdraw from the sales market for a variety of legal and economic reasons.see tenneco gas ferc.instead of selling gas directly,pipelines established marketing affiliates that would sell gas in a competitive market free from regulation.before long,however,marketers objected that providing equal and open access to violating that principle in spirit by granting their marketing affiliates undue preferences,such as by divulging inside information regarding future capacity that would provide competitive benefits to pipelines affiliates.see id.at.
in response to pipelines undue favoritism toward their marketing affiliates,ferc promulgated order,which set out standards of conduct to govern the relationship between pipelines and their marketing affiliates.see inquiry into alleged anticompetitive practices related to marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines,order,stats.regs.rehearing orders omitted.order required pipelines to provide equal treatment to sellers in areas such as scheduling,transportation,and speed of service ordered contemporaneous disclosure of transportation information to all potential shippers if disclosed to an affiliate and required independent functioning of pipeline and marketing affiliate employees.see tenneco,at.
order was narrowly targeted in certain important respects.first,ferc chose not to extend the standards to relationships with affiliates,such as producers,gatherers,and processors.ferc concluded that imposing the standards on relationships with affiliates was unnecessary because of the absence of evidence of abusive practices between pipelines and affiliates and in light of the availability of complaint procedures for aggrieved persons.order,at.second,the order did not apply to pipelines that do not conduct any transactions with their marketing affiliates.ferc found that there is no possibility for abuse of the affiliate relationship where the pipeline and marketing affiliate do not conduct any transactions with each other.id.at.
pipelines and other entities filed petitions in this court challenging the contemporaneous disclosure and independent functioning requirements of order.see tenneco,at.we began by stating that vertical integration in the natural gas industry produces benefits for consumers and that ferc must take those benefits into account when regulating the pipelines.see id.at.we nonetheless upheld the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to transportation information because the record demonstrated both a straightforward theoretical threat of abuse and substantial record evidence that pipelines had been granting their marketing affiliates undue preferences.see id.in light of the theoretical threat and the record of abuse,we also upheld the independent functioning requirement,noting that it preserved some benefits of vertical integration,particularly in contrast to the more draconian possibilities of complete physical separation,divorcement,or divestiture.id.at.
some nine years later,in,ferc considered taking a step it had rejected in order.ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking announcing its plan to broaden the definition of an affiliate covered by the standards of conduct to include affiliates.see notice of proposed rulemaking,standards of conduct for transmission providers,stats.regs,at,id.at.ferc cited its concern that a transmission provider market power could be transferred to its affiliated businesses because the existing rules do not cover all affiliate relationships and pointed to s ignificant changes in the range of services offered by various companies in the natural gas industry.id.at.the notice of proposed rulemaking indicated that the costs of compliance with the standards could be million per cost that eventually would be borne in part by consumers.see id.at.
in their comments,the pipelines suggested that the proposal was perhaps a solution in search of a problem.comments of interstate natural gas association of america,at.after receiving input from the pipelines,other industry participants,and various organizations,ferc went ahead and promulgated order in november.see standards of conduct for transmission providers,order,stats.regs.ferc conducted four more rounds of notice and comment to clarify various aspects of the new regulations.see order,stats.regs,order,stats.regs,order,stats.regs,order,ferc.for ease of reference,we will refer to these orders collectively as order.
ferc based the new standards on the same principles of and independent functioning as the old standards.see standards of conduct for transmission providers,tenneco,at.the central provisions are 
a independent functioning.a pipeline employees who engage in transmission operations ordinarily must function independently of its marketing or energy affiliates employees,with an exception for emergency circumstances.a.further,a pipeline generally may not permit its affiliates employees to engage in transmission system operations or reliability functions or to access the system control center.id.a i ii.
b.a pipeline must ensure that its affiliates employees have access only to the information available to all transmission customers and that such employees are prevented from obtaining information about the pipeline transmission system.id.a.
c posting requirements.a pipeline must post online such information as the names and addresses of its affiliates,the organizational structure of its parent corporation,a list of facilities shared with affiliates,a list of business units and job descriptions,a schedule for implementing the standards,and a written log detailing the circumstances and manner in which the pipeline exercised its discretion under any terms of its tariff.id.b,e,c.
order ushers in two fundamental changes from order.first,it extends the standards beyond pipelines relationships with their marketing affiliates to govern also pipelines relationships with numerous,gatherers,producers,local distribution companies,and traders.see order,at.the order includes a broad,multipart definition of energy affiliate as an affiliate that engages in or is involved in transmission transactions in energy or transmission markets or manages or controls transmission capacity of a transmission provider in energy or transmission markets or buys,sells,trades or administers natural gas or electric energy in energy or transmission markets or engages in financial transactions relating to the sale or transmission of natural gas or electric energy in energy or transmission markets.d.the definition also includes local distribution companies,other than those that make only sales where the point of delivery is on or directly interconnected with the local distribution company distribution system.id.d,d v.
second,the new standards cover a pipeline relationships even with those affiliates that do not hold or control any capacity on the pipeline.see id.a,d.for example,a pipeline is subject to the standards in its relationship with an affiliated producer that transports gas only on other pipelines.ferc apparent rationale was that pipelines could communicate information to affiliates who in turn could profit in the natural gas financial markets.ferc believed that a pipeline could,for instance,inform its affiliate of an upcoming transmission constraint that would affect the price of the commodity in the new york mercantile exchange,enabling the affiliate to enter into a profitable futures contract and gain a competitive advantage.see order,at.
two ferc commissioners strongly disagreed with ferc new intervention in the natural gas market.commissioner kelliher stated that the flaw in the standards of conduct final rule is the lack of record evidence to support expanding the scope beyond marketing affiliates.order,at statement of kelliher,comm r,dissenting in part.in his view,suspicion is not a sufficient basis for expanding the scope of standards of conduct beyond marketing affiliates.id.he explained that the record evidence of abuse related to marketing affiliates,not affiliates,and stated i do not see how a record of affiliate abuse limited to marketing affiliates argues in favor of expanding the scope of the rule beyond marketing affiliates.to my mind,it argues in favor of keeping the scope of the rule where it was.indeed,there appears to be no factual basis to support expanding the scope beyond marketing affiliates.id.finally,citing this court decision in dominion resources,ferc,commissioner kelliher expressed his concern that the order would diminish industry efficiencies without advancing the ferc policy of preventing unduly discriminatory behavior.order,at statement of kelliher,comm r,dissenting in part.commissioner brownell also dissented.she stated that there was insufficient evidence to support eliminating the exemption for affiliated producers,gatherers,and processors.order,at statement of brownell,comm r,dissenting in part.
several entities timely filed petitions for review in this court.they include the interstate natural gas association of america,a trade group that represents interstate pipelines.no electric utilities petitioned for review of the standards as applied to them.invoking the standards in the administrative procedure act,et,the petitioners challenge multiple aspects of the orders the extension of the standards to affiliates the extension of the standards to entities that do not hold or control capacity on their affiliated pipelines,including the elimination of the exemption for local distribution companies that make sales only on pipelines the favorable treatment of local distribution companies as compared to producers,gatherers,and processors with respect to the exemption for local distribution companies that make only sales the restriction of the activities of risk management employees and lawyers and the waiver log requirement.in addition,petitioner calypso pipeline challenges the application of the standards to a certificate holder that has not commenced the transportation of natural gas but has begun soliciting business.we have jurisdiction under b.
the administrative procedure act governs our analysis.we review ferc order to determine whether it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.an agency policy decisions are entitled to deference so long as they are reasonably explained.covad communications fcc.under the arbitrary and capricious prong of the standard,we must ensure that ferc has examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.normally,an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.id.the apa establishes a scheme of reasoned decisionmaking.allentown mack sales,nlrb,d quoting state farm,at.
we also adhere to the principle set out in sec chenery.a n administrative order can not be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.see also.pub.serv.comm ferc,consol.edison of ferc.we will neither supply our own justifications for an order nor uphold an order based on ferc post hoc rationalizations.see echostar satellite,fcc.an important corollary is that where ferc has relied on multiple rationales and has not done so in the alternative,and we conclude that at least one of the rationales is deficient,we will ordinarily vacate the order unless we are certain that ferc would have adopted it even absent the flawed rationale.see consol.edison of,at,nuclear regulatory comm n.
to justify order,ferc has relied on both an asserted theoretical threat of undue preferences and a claimed record of abuse.the commission did not seek to justify the order based solely on the theoretical danger.therefore,if we find that the claimed record evidence does not support the order,we can not uphold it.see chenery,at.
in tenneco,we carefully examined ferc adoption of standards of conduct to govern relationships between pipelines and their marketing affiliates.our analysis in that case guides our evaluation of order extension of the standards of conduct to relationships between pipelines and their affiliates.
we began by emphasizing that vertical integration creates efficiencies for consumers.see tenneco gas ferc,in a competitive market,the efficiencies of the relationship should produce benefits for consumers.citing areeda turner,antitrust law,at.see generally robert bork,the antitrust paradox ed.as to vertical information sharing,we stated that the sharing of information between pipelines and their marketing affiliates has efficiency benefits.at.in considering structural separation requirements,we similarly recognized that there are efficiencies to be derived from such integration and any separation reduces those benefits to some extent.id.at.
we pointed out that the commission,by contrast,appear ed to believe that any advantage a pipeline gives its marketing affiliate is improper.id.at.we rejected this theory and explained that advantages a pipeline gives its affiliate are improper only to the extent that they flow from the pipeline market power.otherwise vertical integration produces permissible efficiencies that can not by themselves be considered uses of monopoly power.id.quoting berkey photo,eastman kodak,cir.
tenneco thus stands for the proposition that ferc can not impede vertical integration between a pipeline and its affiliates without adequate justification.see at.we upheld order in relevant part because ferc presented an adequate advancing both i a plausible theoretical threat of between pipelines and their marketing affiliates and ii vast record evidence of abuse.
as to the theoretical threat,we accepted ferc explanation that there is at least a theoretical danger that pipelines will favor their marketing affiliates in providing information,and that the result would be.id.at.ferc had relied on a department of justice report that stated the affiliate relationship creates an incentive for the pipeline to withhold information that otherwise would be made available to the affiliate competitors.withholding this information from shippers reduces their ability to arrange transactions efficiently.id.quoting comments of the united states department of justice in response to the notice of inquiry,at.the threat of pipelines enabling their affiliates to secure capacity sooner than their competitors or otherwise to benefit from knowledge about the transmission system was readily this threat stemmed from the pipelines monopoly position.
as to record evidence,we explained that t he record also contains evidence that the discriminatory and distribution of information is not just a theoretical danger,but a real one.id.at emphasis added see also id.recounting representative example of marketer that lost out on capacity when pipeline apprised affiliate of availability of capacity before dis
