facts and proceedings 
in this texas diversity breach of contract suit,we must interpret a tax indemnity provision in a stock purchase agreement spa.in the district court,marathon sought to recover from cms on two claims for cms breach of the tax indemnity provision of the spa as to million that marathon paid to the republic of equatorial guinea to settle certain tax audit claims and for cms breach of the tax indemnity provision of the spa as to in withholding taxes paid by marathon for the month of december.the district court ruled in cms favor on both issues on summary judgment.
cms enterprises company,a subsidiary of cms energy corporation,an oil and gas exploration and production company,was the parent company of cms oil and gas company.until january,one of cms exploration and production operations was located off the west coast of africa,in the republic of equatorial guinea cms had a contractual arrangement with equatorial guinea in which cms and its produced oil,gas,and condensate offshore for export and sale.
on october,cms and marathon holding limited executed an spa in which marathon bought all of the issued and outstanding stock of three cayman island companies that held title to oil and gas reserves and had ownership interest in a liquefied petroleum gas plant located in equatorial guinea.on january,cms sold to marathon holding all of its equatorial guinea assets through a stock sale 
the negotiations leading up to the sale focused on the tax indemnity provisions.cms prepared financial documents showed that cms had a large net operating loss on its books and on its tax returns filed with equatorial guinea.specifically,as of december,cms showed a net operating loss of,which cms represented to marathon had a tax asset value of.during the negotiations,marathon requested that the draft spa proposed tax and indemnity provision be changed to expressly require cms to indemnify marathon for certain tax increases that might result from a reduction of cms net operating losses.in particular,marathon proposed that section provide 
it is understood,however,that seller cms shall pay all taxes resulting from the transaction contemplated under this stock purchase agreement and that seller cms shall be liable for any tax occurring after december,to the extent a net operating loss deduction is reduced or disallowed by the relevant governmental authority or a depreciation deduction is reduced or disallowed for bases incurred prior to january,
this provision,however,was not included in the final spa.
in the same draft,marathon also proposed adding a provision that would have obligated cms to indemnify marathon for any breaches of cms representations of tax items in section a of the spa.the proposed subsection c of section stated 
seller cms agrees to protect,defend,indemnify,and hold harmless buyer from and against,and agrees to pay c any liability arising from a breach by seller of its representations,warranties and covenants in section and article vii.
this requested indemnity for cms representations of tax items was likewise not included in the final spa.
finally,marathon also proposed a provision that would have required cms to warrant the amount and availability to marathon of certain tax attributes,which included net operating losses.the proposed subpart m to section stated 
m schedule sets forth as of the date hereof i the basis of the companies and the alba companies in its assets for equatorial guinea income tax purposes,and ii the amount of any net operating loss,net capital loss,unused investment credit or other credit collectively referred to as the tax attributes of the companies and the alba companies for equatorial guinea tax purposes.these tax attributes will be available to buyer.
this proposed provision also was not included in the final spa.
instead,after all of the meetings and drafts exchanged and discussions between the parties the spa final tax indemnity provision provides 
indemnification by seller.seller hereby agrees to protect,defend,indemnify and hold harmless the buyer indemnified parties,the companies and the alba companies from and against,and agrees to pay a any taxes net of any realized tax benefits associated therewith of the companies or the alba companies but only in an amount proportional to seller direct or indirect interest in the relevant alba company for the period to which such taxes relate attributable to the time period prior to january,including,for the avoidance of doubt,any taxes of the companies or the alba companies for the period prior to january,that are set forth on schedule but only to the extent such taxes exceed the amount reserved for taxes on the settlement statement 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement,no claim for taxes shall be permitted under this section unless such claim is first made before the expiration of the statute of limitations including applicable extensions for the taxable period to which the claim relates or if no such statute of limitations exists,prior to the date on which such claim is otherwise barred by law.
pursuant to the spa,marathon and cms closed the sale in january cms oil was renamed marathon production.
at the time of the spa closing,cms had provided marathon with a settlement statement,setting forth the amount of withholding taxes accrued for the month of december,which were due to be paid to equatorial guinea in january.on january,marathon paid in withholding taxes for the month of december.cms oil had only accrued in withholding tax liability for december.as a result,marathon paid in withholding taxes for which it was not reimbursed by cms.on january,marathon notified cms that it had made the withholding tax payment,and requested indemnity for.on receipt of the letter,cms notified marathon that cms was reviewing the request.on october,cms formally denied marathon claim for indemnity for the withholding tax payment.
meanwhile,shortly after the sale in january,marathon received notice that the government of equatorial guinea was auditing cms oil tax returns for the years.as of december,the size of cms oil net operating loss had increased to the government indicated that it sought a reduction in marathon production net operating losses and a payment of additional tax as a result.marathon,in communication with cms,handled the negotiations with equatorial guinea.in may,after lengthy negotiations,marathon and equatorial guinea resolved all outstanding tax audit issues for the years.the settlement agreement provided that marathon production in net operating losses would be reduced by,which resulted in a revised net operating loss of.this tax loss position reduction,the settlement agreement provided,will result in additional taxes paid to the state of usd.thus,in consideration of the tax audit settlement,which cancelled all tax claims for marathon agreed to and paid to equatorial guinea in may.on june,cms denied marathon request for indemnity for this payment and again denied marathon request for indemnification as to in withholding taxes.
this lawsuit followed.the district court originally denied cms motion for partial summary judgment on marathon indemnity claim for the tax settlement.after marathon filed a motion for partial summary judgment and cms replied,however,the district court withdrew its prior memorandum and order and granted cms motion for partial summary judgment and denied marathon motion for partial summary judgment on the tax settlement claim.later,the district court granted cms motion for summary judgment and denied marathon for summary judgment on marathon claim for withholding taxes the district court held that marathon claim for indemnity was.final judgment dismissing marathon claims with prejudice was then entered.marathon now timely appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard as the district court.duffy leading edge,cir crawford formosa plastics,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draws all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see crawford formosa plastics,at.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.id.
marathon first issue on appeal calls on us to determine whether the parties contractual indemnity provision obligated cms to indemnify marathon for million in taxes paid to equatorial guinea in as a result of marathon settlement of equatorial guinea tax audit claims that spanned the period.

applying these principles,we turn to the spa indemnity provision.section provides that seller cms hereby agrees to indemnify marathon and agrees to pay any taxes attributable to the time period prior to january.the issue,then,is whether marathon payment in settlement of the equatorial guinea government tax audit claims constitutes payment of t axes attributable to the time period prior to january,within the meaning of the spa.if so,cms is obligated to indemnify marathon.to decide this question,we must look at the plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning of taxes attributable to a time period,unless the spa shows that the phrase was used in a technical or different sense.
cms contends that we should affirm summary judgment in its favor on marathon million claim because the spa and the circumstances surrounding its execution reveal that the contracting parties,informed by tax practices,did not intend to require the indemnification claimed.because the taxes at issue resulted from income that marathon generated in,cms maintains,those taxes are attributable to the period after january.marathon advocates a more expansive interpretation of the tax indemnity provision because the million was paid in settlement of the tax audits for,marathon insists,the payment was attributable to the time period prior to january,and,thus,indemnity is mandated.marathon contends that the facts and circumstances surrounding the execution of the spa,and the custom and usage evidence as to the interpretation of section a,are disputed and do not support summary judgment in favor of cms.we disagree.the spa plain language,informed by the uncontroverted usage evidence,supports the decision of the district court.
we first observe that,by obligating cms to indemnify marathon for any taxes attributable to a time period,section a appears to call for indemnity when marathon pays taxes as defined by the spa for the period with respect to which liability to pay the tax arises.this interpretation of the phrase taxes attributable to a time period is supported by the structure and intent,as well as the defined terms of the spa.and we are impressed that the undisputed negotiations regarding marathon changes to the spa were rejected.
isolating the defined terms,section a obligates cms to indemnify marathon for certain taxes paid by marathon.notably,the spa definition of taxes,though broad,does not include net operating losses instead,net operating losses are tax items or tax attributes.that the spa,on its face,distinguishes between these terms seriously undermines marathon proposed construction of section.but there more.the parties prior negotiations in drafting the spa provide the relevant context for resolving the parties dispute regarding the meaning of the tax indemnity provision the record shows that marathon proposed language would have required cms to expressly warrant the amount of the net operating loss and to indemnify it for any reduction of the loss and breach of the warranty.critically absent from the final draft of the spa,however,are marathon requested net operating loss warranty and the requested net operating loss indemnities.furthermore,although the parties agreed to include a representation as to tax items which include net operating losses,the final spa did not include marathon requested indemnity for a breach of that specific representation.
marathon seeks to soften the blow of this marathon suggested proposals,which would have included indemnity for net operating losses,was not incorporated into the final pointing to alleged oral promises of full indemnity made by cms during prior negotiations.this conflicting evidence,says marathon,creates a disputed issue of fact,making summary judgment in cms favor inappropriate.marathon insists that the parties intended for cms to indemnify marathon for any changes to net operating losses at several times during the negotiations,we are told,cms representatives orally stated that they were providing marathon with a full tax indemnity for any taxes relating to cms period of ownership.marathon argues that these statements lend support to its broad interpretation of the tax indemnity provision.we disagree.marathon attempt to invoke oral statements to manufacture a disputed issue of material fact as to the parties prior negotiations is foreclosed by fundamental maxims of contract interpretation.it is,and we underscore again,that courts may not consider oral statements by the parties of what they intended the contract to mean in determining the meaning of an otherwise unambiguous integrated contract.city of pinehurst spooner addition water,quoting restatement of contracts.the oral statements allegedly made by cms representatives that marathon would have full tax indemnity or that marathon proposed edits were redundant,offer us no guide as to the meaning of the spa.accordingly,the alleged oral representations do not present a fact issue as to the construction of the disputed provision that would preclude summary judgment in cms favor.
the spa terms,and the circumstances surrounding their negotiation,support cms proposed construction of the disputed provision.we find that the district court properly considered the operative uses of the relevant terms in the spa in interpreting the indemnity provision.
cms submitted operative usage evidence that infor
