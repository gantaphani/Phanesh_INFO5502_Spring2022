the project on government oversight pogo,a organization,appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment holding it liable for violating a.that statute prohibits a private party from making a contribution to the salary of an executive branch official as compensation for his services as a government employee.the district court found there was no genuine dispute that pogo violated a by issuing a check to a department of interior economist.we conclude,however,that there was a genuine dispute as to whether pogo issued the check as compensation for the economist government service.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
pogo is an organization that investigates,exposes and seeks to remedy systematic abuses of power,mismanagement,and subservience of the federal government to special interests.appellant br.in december,pogo began investigating whether oil companies were committing fraud by undervaluing the amount of oil that they extracted from federal and indian lands,resulting in the underpayment of royalties owed to the united states.over the next three years,pogo undertook numerous efforts to focus public attention on the issue.on june,after concluding that the government was unlikely to pursue the matter,pogo filed two qui tam actions in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas.the actions alleged that major oil companies had violated the false claims act,by undervaluing the oil they extracted and then underreporting and underpaying the oil royalties they owed after pogo filed the suit,the united states intervened and entered into settlement agreements that eventually totaled million.
during the course of its investigation,pogo spoke with many people,including robert berman,a senior economist at the interior department.beginning in,pogo executive director,danielle brian,had between twenty and thirty telephone conversations with berman in which they discussed oil royalty issues.in,brian asked berman whether he wanted to join pogo as a in the qui tam actions that the organization intended to file.see supra note.although berman declined pogo offer to be a,he subsequently entered into an agreement with pogo providing that he would receive of any money that pogo recovered through the litigation.see.pogo also agreed to give a share to robert speir,an economist at the department of energy,with whom it also had discussed the issue of oil royalties.see id.
after pogo received its million share of the first settlement in the qui tam actions,pogo attorney lon packard informed kenneth dodd,the assistant united states attorney working on the qui tam litigation,that pogo intended to give berman a portion of its recovery.see def.pogo statement of material facts.although dodd informed other officials at the justice department of pogo intention,no one told pogo to abandon its plan to remunerate berman.see id.at.in addition,berman consulted his government ethics officer to determine whether he could legally accept the proposed payment.see brian dep.july.berman reported to brian that the ethics officer advised that he could accept it.see id.on november,pogo issued a check to berman in the amount of.the face of the check indicated that it was a public service award,and the accompanying letter from pogo explained that it was given to berman for his work to expose and stop the oil companies underpayment of royalties for the production of crude oil on federal and indian lands.
on january,the justice department filed a civil complaint against berman and pogo charging,inter alia,that the payment and receipt of the violated a.the government moved for summary judgment on the a count on april,and pogo on june.a year later,on june,the district court convened the parties and told them that the case appeared for summary judgment counsel,i have looked over this file and i tell you what my inclination at this point is.i do not think that i could grant either m otion for s ummary judgment.hr g tr.june.noting that the case was fact depend e nt,id.at,the court told the parties i going to ask you to come back here in two weeks and tell me when you could try the case.id.at.

section a provides,in relevant part 
whoever receives any salary,or any contribution to or supplementation of salary,as compensation for his services as an officer or employee of the executive branch of the united states government,from any source other than the government of the united states or 
whoever makes any contribution to,or in any way supplements,the salary of any such officer or employee under circumstances which would make its receipt a violation of this subsection 
shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section of this title.
a.the referenced section,a,provides that whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense shall be imprisoned for not more than one year,a,and that whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years,a.section b authorizes the attorney general to bring a civil action,as he did in this case,against any person who engages in conduct constituting an offense under section,and provides that upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the evidence,such person shall be subject to a civil penalty.b.
in light of the statutory language,both parties agree that one element of the offense that the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence is that pogo made a contribution to or supplementation of berman salary as compensation for his services as an officer or employee of the united states.a see appellee br,appellant br.as we held in united states muntain,f or there to be a violation of,the contribution must have been received as compensation for services and those services must have been rendered as an employee of the united states,internal quotation marks omitted accord united states raborn,cir.
services that a government employee provides other than as part of his official responsibilities do not satisfy this requirement.in muntain,for example,we found that the assistant to the secretary for labor relations at the department of housing and urban development hud,who functioned as hud chief liaison with organized labor and chief spokesman on labor relations matters,did not violate a by receiving compensation for promoting a private insurance scheme to labor unions.see at.in reaching that conclusion,we indicated that the statute is violated if the compensation is for the s ervices rendered to the government,or if the employee renders the same or similar services to both the government and a private person.at quoting op.att y.the statute does not,however,prohibit payment for services rendered exclusively to private persons or organizations and which
