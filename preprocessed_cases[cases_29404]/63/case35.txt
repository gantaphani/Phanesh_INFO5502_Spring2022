petitioner londonderry neighborhood coalition lnc seeks review of a decision by the federal energy regulation commission ferc or the commission to certify a natural gas project.lnc argues that the commission certification of the project was tainted by its failure to assess adequately the full environmental impact of the proposed undertaking.the commission disputes the substance of lnc arguments and,in addition,interposes a challenge to this court jurisdiction over the appeal.we find the commission jurisdictional argument sound and dismiss the petition for review.
under the natural gas act nga,the commission has certificate authority over companies that engage in the transportation or sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce.to assure the orderly development of natural gas supplies,nga c a prohibits any company or person from constructing or operating pipeline facilities prior to obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the commission.id.c a.in accordance with nga e,the commission shall issue such certificates to qualified applicants once it determines that the proposed service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience or necessity id.e.the commission is also authorized to attach to certificates such reasonable terms and conditions as the public convenience and necessity may require.id.
the commission has no jurisdiction over facilities used strictly for the local distribution of natural gas.id.b.likewise,as dictated by the federal power act fpa,the commission has no jurisdiction to regulate electric generation facilities.id.b.

in this case,the commission was called upon to authorize a natural gas project proposed by the tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee.the project encompassed the replacement of miles of existing pipe with pipe,enabling the delivery of natural gas from massachusetts to a power generation plant being constructed in londonderry,new hampshire by a separate private entity,the aes londonderry,llc aes.tennessee gas pipeline will be connected to the generation plant by a mile,distribution lateral to be built by energynorth natural gas,energynorth.both the aes power plant project and the energynorth lateral project fall outside the jurisdiction of ferc and are,instead,subject to authorization by the state.see b b.
in july,aes applied to the appropriate state body,the new hampshire energy facility site evaluation committee efsec,for approval to construct and operate the power plant.in addition to the request specifically dealing with the power plant,the proposal also sought approval for three related subsidiary the energynorth were necessary for the power plant operation.on may,after a comprehensive review process,efsec certified the projects,finding that the facility would not have an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment or public health.in august,the new hampshire supreme court upheld this certification in the face of a challenge by lnc.appeal of the londonderry neighborhood coalition.
meanwhile,aes signed a contract with tennessee for provision of the needed supply of natural gas.tennessee already had in place,as part of its concord lateral system,two parallel line and a ten feet apart in a combined running from dracut,massachusetts into new hampshire.to service the power plant,tennessee proposed to remove the line and replace it with a line.
on december,as required by the nga,tennessee applied to ferc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to implement the project of replacing the existing pipeline in the concord lateral system with a larger one.tennessee application was subsequently amended on january.on march,the commission issued a notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment for the project and requested public comments regarding environmental issues.in that notice,the commission made a preliminary decision not to address the impact of the aes and energynorth projects,noting that they had been approved by the state and had received all the necessary federal permits.after receiving comments from lnc a nonprofit organization comprised of over local citizens and the united states fish and wildlife service arguing that,under nepa,the commission was required to consider the cumulative environmental impact of all three projects,the commission issued a environmental assessment on august.despite the objections of lnc and the fish and wildlife service,the assessment did not address the environmental impact of the aes or energynorth projects.
on october,after receiving further comments from lnc and other entities,the commission issued an order authorizing the tennessee pipeline project,subject to certain conditions the october,order.in that order,the commission relied on the environmental assessment and again held that it was unnecessary to consider the two facilities in its review.the commission further found that the pipeline replacement would have no significant environmental impact and ruled that an eis was therefore unnecessary.
following the october,order,the town and school district of londonderry filed a timely motion for rehearing on november.see a providing that motion for rehearing must be filed within thirty days of the issuance of the order.lnc also submitted a motion for rehearing,though it was received and filed one day late on november.on november,lnc moved for an extension of time to file its request for rehearing,explaining that the untimeliness of its motion for rehearing was due to an error by the postal service.according to lnc,the original rehearing motion was sent via express mail service,which guarantees overnight delivery.in a supplemental motion filed on december,lnc asked,in the alternative,that its motion for rehearing be deemed a motion for reconsideration.
on december,the commission issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration.since this order states that rehearing has been timely requested,it presumably referred only to the town and school district motion for rehearing.on may,the commission issued an order granting,in part,and denying,in part,rehearing and request for reconsideration the may,order.the may,order denied lnc motion for an extension,holding that the commission had no authority to excuse lnc untimely motion for rehearing,but agreed to treat that motion as a motion for reconsideration.the order then partially granted that motion and the town rehearing request with respect to one narrow issue the may,order otherwise denied both motions,including lnc challenges regarding the aes and energynorth projects.on may,the commission authorized construction of the tennessee pipeline project.
on june,lnc filed with the commission a request for rehearing of the may,order and,on june,requested a stay of the may,and may,orders.after tennessee announced on june,that construction on the pipeline project had begun one week earlier,lnc,without waiting for rulings on its requests for rehearing and a stay,filed with this court a petition for review of the may,and may,orders.on june,the commission dismissed the requests for rehearing and stay,stating since the may order does not alter the october order finding with respect to cumulative impacts,the commission decision on that issue is final and further rehearing does not lie for any party to the proceeding.tennessee gas pipeline,ferc,wl.
in addition to filing its petition for review of the may,and may,orders,lnc filed a motion with this court to stay construction of the tennessee pipeline.ferc and tennessee both filed motions opposing the stay along with motions to
