to avoid litigation,the commission encouraged kansas gas producers to settle their refund disputes with pipelines.in and the commission approved omnibus settlements for northern and panhandle,respectively,under which the settling producers paid only a portion of their refund liabilities,and the two pipelines waived any claim to further refunds.northern natural gas northern omnibus,ferc,at panhandle pipe line panhandle omnibus,ferc,at.
burlington,however,refused to join these agreements.during the period of uncertainty between our remand in colorado interstate gas and the commission order requiring refunds,burlington had entered into settlements of its contract disputes with the two pipelines.the settlements had focused primarily on the problems posed by purchase obligations that the pipelines had found extremely onerous in the market conditions of the,but included language seeming to dispose of all claims relating to the contracts in question.see northern settlement agreement para,at releasing the parties from any and all liabilities,claims,and causes of action,whether at law or in equity,and whether now known and asserted or hereafter discovered,arising out of,or in conjunction with,or relating to the said contracts accord panhandle settlement agreement para,at.after the commission resolved the uncertainty and required refunds of the kansas tax reimbursements,burlington denied any ad valorem tax liability to the two pipelines,arguing that its earlier settlements had released it from such claims.notice of petition for adjustment,burlington res.oil gas,ferc docket no,request for resolution,burlington res.oil gas,ferc docket no.may.
the commission eventually ordered hearings in the matter,northern natural gas,ferc panhandle pipe line,ferc,and ruled in favor of the pipelines,finding the burlington settlements to be unlawful and unenforceable,burlington res.oil gas northern order,ferc,reh g denied northern rehearing,ferc panhandle pipe line,ferc,reh g denied,ferc.because the ngpa forbids a purchaser from paying more than the maximum price for a first sale of gas,the commission reasoned,it equally barred a settlement agreement if the producer would be permitted to retain the excess over the maximum price ceiling.northern order,ferc,at p emphasis added see also id.at pp.it ordered burlington to refund the excess revenues the company had collected,resulting in the petition we granted in burlington 
before examining the commission proffered distinction between the burlington and the omnibus settlements,we must consider the actual meaning of the burlington settlements.on remand the commission noted correctly that the burlington settlements main purpose was to exchange immediate payments for a reduction in the pipelines future obligations.it proceeded to announce that ad valorem liabilities could not be eliminated in any settlement,remand order,ferc,at p,especially through the boilerplate language that burlington employed,rehearing order,ferc,at p.
but we held in burlington i that the contract language does not reasonably permit exclusion of any claim that relates to payments made under the contracts,including northern and panhandle refund claims against burlington.at.whether or not the ad valorem liabilities were within the main purpose of the settlements,they were within their language,written at a time when,as the background described above makes clear,the law was deeply unsettled and the parties would have had reason to seek accord.northern suggests that we revisit our holding in burlington i,portraying our construction as dictum and asking that the commission,with the benefit of extrinsic evidence,be allowed to construe its settlement language first.but if northern which intervened in burlington i thought that any of our essential reasoning was in error,it should have petitioned for reconsideration,which it did not.burlington i construction has thus become law of the case,which northern can not challenge here.see lashawn barry,en banc.
burlington i required the commission to explain why,if it considered the burlington settlements to be unlawful and unenforceable,it had approved the ostensibly similar omnibus settlements.at.the producers joining the omnibus settlements paid only a portion of their full refund liability to the pipelines,and in some cases their liabilities were forgiven entirely.thus,they too had been allowed to retain excess revenues over the maximum price ceiling.in its initial effort prior to our decision to distinguish the two groups of settlements,the commission attributed the differential treatment to the prosecutorial discretion the agency wields in determining how to expend its resources in the enforcement of the ngpa ceiling prices.northern rehearing,ferc,at p.rather than take this assertion at face value,we charitably interpreted it in burlington i as betray ing a recognition that the ngpa does not render unlawful all private agreements allowing a producer to retain funds collected pursuant to unlawfully high prices.at.we then remanded to the commission for an explanation of which agreements were prohibited and why.see id.at.
the commission,however,appears too proud to accept such interpretive charity.it insists that all such agreements including,it seems,the omnibus settlements are unlawful and unenforceable.remand order,ferc,at p see also ferc br.
we find this line of argument no less baffling than we did in burlington i.the commission approval of the omnibus settlements betrayed no hint that the agreements might be unlawful.rather,the commission found the settlements a reasonable compromise,
