plaintiff mark,mark filed this action alleging that defendants corporation and oryx energy company breached the terms of seismic data license agreements and also misappropriated seismic data owned by mark.mark prevailed on its claims at trial and was awarded in compensatory damages.now appeals,attacking each aspect of the jury liability findings,as well as the amount of the damage award.mark has filed two,the first of which challenges,on a provisional basis,three of the district court rulings at trial,and the second of which challenges the district court denial of its motion for attorney fees.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm the district court judgment in all respects.
pgi,mark and the seismic data 
in the and,a company called professional geophysics,pgi developed,at substantial expense,a collection of geophysical information called seismic data.pgi in turn licensed that data,for a fee,to members of the oil and gas industry for exploration purposes.in,pgi declared bankruptcy and mark,a company,purchased pgi database for million,or approximately per mile for approximately miles of data.mark then began,and continues to this day,to license that data.
in the early,the sun exploration production company sun,a delaware corporation headquartered in houston,texas,entered into a series of license agreements with pgi covering approximately miles of seismic data.in december,sun created a subsidiary called sun operating limited partnership solp and transferred to it a group of assets,including the seismic data licensed from pgi.in doing so,however,sun apparently did not transfer to solp any of the underlying license agreements.in may,sun changed its name to oryx energy company oryx.
between and,an corporation,entered into a series of license agreements in its own name with pgi and mark covering approximately miles of seismic data.itself,however,did not engage in any oil or gas exploration.instead,all such exploration was conducted by its subsidiaries,including oil and gas corporation kmog.
merger between and oryx and subsequent changes 
on october,and oryx entered into a written agreement pursuant to which oryx would merge into.that merger was approved by the companies shareholders on february.
communications between and mark re merger 
on october,mark,aware of the pending merger between and oryx,sent a letter to oryx reminding it that oryx had licensed certain pgi seismic data and that t hose licenses we re not transferable,as stated in the agreements.app.at.the letter went on to state 
however,mark will allow the data to be transferred and licensed to upon the payment of a transfer fee and the execution of a current mark license agreement.this offer to transfer the data is valid for thirty days from the date of this letter.if,however,does not wish to transfer the data,then mark is requesting the immediate return of its data within thirty days.
id.oryx apparently responded to the letter by telephoning mark and asking additional questions about the proposed transfer fee.id.at.
on november,marilyn davies,the president of mark,sent another letter to oryx stating,in pertinent part 
as we discussed,mark would authorize kerr mcgee to have access to this seismic data for about per mile if all of the data was retained.the fee would go higher if kerr mcgee chose to retain only certain data sets instead of the entire volume.as you know,the current price for most of this data is per mile with discounts for volume deals.mark fee is just about of the current fee.with the authorization of access,mark would require kerr mcgee to execute a new license agreement in its name agreeing to protect the data of mark.
since the actual consummation of the merger deal wo take place until quarter,mark will extend its offer to transfer the data until thirty days after the change date.
no further response was received from oryx until february,when patricia horsfall,oryx manager of exploration,sent a letter prepared for her by attorney carlos salazar to mark stating,in pertinent part 
contingent upon approval of the merger by the companies shareholders,your records will need to be changed to reflect the name change of the licensee,under the referenced seismic data license agreement s,from oryx energy company to oil gas corporation,a subsidiary of,located in houston.
on february,davies sent a letter to horsfall stating that the pgi seismic data is not transferable,assignable,and can not be made available to without prior written approval from mark and the payment of an authorization or transfer fee.id.at emphasis in original.davies letter further stated that,in the absence of such authorization or transfer fee,the licenses of all pgi seismic data in oryx possession w ould be automatically terminated upon the closing of the merger,and all data must be returned.id.
on march,salazar,counsel,sent a letter to mark stating 
please be advised that corporation will not pay a transfer fee for any data subject to a license from pgi to oryx energy company or any of its predecessors.we are in the process of packaging all data identified on our records as being subject to any such license and will be shipping it to you as soon as packaging is complete.
on march,davies acknowledged salazar march,letter and requested that all data be returned to mark storage facilities in houston,texas.id.at.davies letter outlined all of the types of material that needed to be returned to mark,and stated,in conclusion,that any and all licenses to pgi seismic data re sic now terminated.id.at.
shortly thereafter,however,changed its position.on april,salazar sent mark a letter stating 
we have just been made aware of the decision of the appellate court in your case,txo production and marathon oil co mark.
please be advised that has put on hold the return to you of any pgi data,pending final resolution of this case.
on july,davies sent salazar a letter stating,in pertinent part 
there is,of course,no provision in your contract which allows you to rely upon pgi or mdm transactions with other parties.the issues involved in the marathon matter were decided in mdm favor in the trial court.however,as we all know,we are perhaps years away from a resolution in the appeals courts.moreover,the issues and underlying facts are different than those of the oryx transaction with pgi.would you please tell me on what basis,has the right to hold the data previously licensed to oryx 
salazar responded to davies letter on august,stating 
corporation disagrees with your interpretation of the recent decision of the texas court of appeals in your case against txo production company and marathon oil company.in its decision,the appeals court reviewed the texas merger statute and very clearly ruled that a provision prohibiting transfers to third parties does not apply in the case of a merger unless the provision specifically says so.our agreements with pgi do not provide that a transfer is prohibited even in the event of a merger.
the facts in our case are in fact almost identical to those in your case with txo and marathon and our agreements with pgi contain the very same language which the appeals court interpreted.therefore,as the surviving corporation in the statutory merger with oryx,corporation has the right to retain the oryx pgi data without paying a transfer fee.we are also confident that the texas supreme court will agree with the appeals court decision,if presented with the issue.
on august,davies sent a letter to salazar stating that t he option of returning the data ha d been withdrawn,and enclosed an invoice in the amount of reflecting the charges based on the discount given to a volume license purchase.id.at.on august,salazar sent a letter to davies stating that it remain ed intention to retain the data and to not pay a transfer fee.id.at emphasis in original.
this lawsuit 
on february,mark filed suit against and oryx in colorado state court asserting claims for misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,tortious interference with contract,and unjust enrichment.on march,removed the action to federal district court in colorado,premised on diversity jurisdiction.
during discovery,it was determined that was in possession of miles of mark seismic data that was not covered by any of the existing license agreements between pgi or mark and,sun,or oryx.this discovery gave rise to an additional claim of misappropriation by mark against.
the final pretrial order in this action,issued on november,noted that mark asserted five claims for relief misappropriation of trade secrets against oryx misappropriation of trade secrets against breach of contract against oryx and tortious interference with contract and civil conspiracy.the pretrial order noted that,although oryx no longer existed because it merged into in,mark claim ed some of the acts of the defendants arose before the merger between the two companies and that,a s a result of the merger,all claims we re now against id.at.
the case proceeded to trial on september.during trial,the parties and the district court focused on three categories of seismic data underlying mark claims 
category category encompassed approximately miles of seismic data licensed by from prior to oryx merger into 
category category encompassed the miles of seismic data licensed directly by from prior to the merger and 
category category encompassed approximately miles of seismic data found during discovery to be in possession but not covered by any license agreements this is sometimes referred to as the bootleg data.
at the conclusion of all the evidence,the jury found that 
oryx breached one or more of the license agreements it entered into with,covering category data,by trans ferr ing the license agreement s to kerr mcgee corp,without prior approval,id.at,and that mark suffered in damages as a result of the breach 
breached one or more of its own license agreements with,covering category data,by transfer ring license s to kerr mcgee oil gas corporation without prior consent,by failing to return all data to mark,and by failing to safeguard mark trade secrets,and that mark suffered in damages as result of this conduct,id.at and 
gained access to and possessed pgi data,category data through improper means beginning in at least,id.at,also,after the merger with oryx,wrongfully transferred control of the category data to a subsidiary,and that mark suffered in damages as a result of misconduct regarding the category and category data.
on september,the district court entered judgment in favor of mark and against in the amount of.in doing so,the district court purportedly applied the rule prohibiting multiple recovery and awarded mark only that amount of damages determined by the jury to constitute the entirety of mark losses on its tort claim.id.at.mark moved to amend the judgment pursuant to.e,and asked the district court to stack the awards and enter judgment in the combined amounts reflected on the verdict form and to award it prejudgment interest on that amount.id.the district court denied mark motion with regard to the request for the stacking of the breach of contract and tort damages awards,but granted the motion with regard to the request for prejudgment interest.id.at.accordingly,the district court entered an amended judgment reflecting the prejudgment interest awarded to mark.the district court also denied mark motion for attorney fees.filed a motion entitled renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule b or alternatively,motion for new trial,for remittitur,to alter and amend the judgment pursuant to rule and rule e,urg ing the district court on numerous grounds either to throw out the jury verdict and enter judgment in its favor,to enter judgment for a greatly reduced amount,or to order a new trial.id.at.the district court rejected motion in its entirety.
on february,filed a notice of appeal from the district court amended judgment resulting in appeal.on february,mark filed a notice of from the district court amended judgment resulting in appeal.on july,mark filed a notice of appeal from the district court order denying its motion for attorney fees resulting in appeal.
asserts five general issues in its appeal.in the first three of those issues,attempts to challenge the validity of each of the jury liability findings.fourth issue concerns the proper remedy in the event we conclude the jury misappropriation findings are not sustainable.lastly,fifth issue concerns the purported excessiveness of the damages awarded by the jury.we address these issues in order.
challenges to the jury liability findings regarding category data 
as noted,the jury found in mark favor on two claims regarding the category data,that oryx breached the terms of one or more of its license agreements with by transferring those license agreement s to without approval from mark,and that,wrongfully transferred control of the category data to one of its subsidiaries.on appeal,challenges both of these liability findings.
a the jury finding that oryx breached the terms of one or more license agreements 
first attacks the jury finding that oryx breached the terms of one or more of its license agreements with by transferring those license agreement s to without mark approval.more specifically,notes that the district court instructed the jury in instruction that a merger between a licensee and another entity will breach the terms of the licensee agreement with a licensor only if the license agreement so provides,id.at,and it asserts that none of those license agreements expressly made merger a breach.
the threshold question we must resolve is what standard of review to apply in analyzing arguments.unfortunately,does not clearly specify whether it is seeking to challenge the district court denial of its rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law or its rule motion for new trial.reviewing the record on appeal,we note that the arguments currently asserted by were first presented in its rule a motion at the close of mark evidence,and later in the rule b portion of its combined brief.we therefore conclude that is challenging the district court denial of its rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law.
we review de novo a district court denial of a rule b motion,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,in this case,mark.hardeman city of albuquerque,cir.in doing so,we will reverse a district court refusal to grant judgment as a matter of law only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
after reviewing the trial transcript,we conclude that was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to the issue of whether oryx breached the terms of one or more of its license agreements with.during its,mark presented testimony from leon herzog,an individual who had worked for a variety of seismic data owners,including mark,and was familiar with license agreements typically used in the seismic data industry.mark questioned herzog about the language of the license agreements between and.herzog opined that those license agreements,including both the type a and type b agreements now referred to by,precluded oryx from assigning the agreements or underlying data to via merger,and would have required to enter into a new agreement with.at.mark also presented the testimony of robert gray,a geophysicist who was accepted by the district court as an expert on custom and practice in seismic data licensing.id.at.like herzog,gray opined that language of the type used in the type a agreements at issue precluded the licensee from transferring the license agreement via merger.id.at.lastly,mark presented testimony from john moye,a attorney who the district court recognized as an expert on mergers and contracts.moye opined that the language of the type a agreements prohibit ed the disclosure of seismic data to any other third person.id.at.similarly,moye opined that the language of the type b agreements allowed for seismic data to be conveyed to a surviving company in the event of a merger only if certain requirements,including the signing of a sublicense agreement and the payment of a fee,had been met.id.at.in light of this testimony,we readily conclude the district court did not err in denying rule b motion with respect to the jury finding that oryx breached the terms of one or more of its license agreements with by transferring those license agreement s to without mark approval.
b the jury finding that,wrongfully transferred control of the category data to one of its subsidiaries 
also attacks the jury findings that oryx and misappropriated category seismic data.more specifically,contends that there was no evidence of any wrongful transfer of the category data from oryx or to a subsidiary,as was necessary to a finding of misappropriation under the district court instructions.according to,the evidence presented at trial established that all of the category data was transferred by to solp prior to the merger,and that after the merger,the category data was not transferred to any other entity,but rather remained where it had been for almost solp.aplt.br.at.although acknowledges that in july of solp changed its name to oil gas onshore lp onshore lp and assigned its direct ownership in onshore lp to an intermediate subsidiary,oil gas onshore llc,it asserts that these events did not effectuate a transfer of solp original assets,including the category data.
the threshold question we must again address is what standard of review to apply to arguments.turning to the record on appeal,the specific arguments now asserted by were presented to the district court in the rule b portion of its motion.importantly,however,did not assert these arguments in its rule a motion at the close of mark,and is thus precluded from relying on them as a basis for rule b relief see marshall columbia lea reg l,cir holding that a rule a motion is a prerequisite to a motion under rule b.
that leaves only the possibility of rule relief,the granting of a new trial.in the rule portion of its motion,argued,in summary fashion,that the jury finding that,after the merger,wrongfully transferred the miles of oryx seismic data to a subsidiary wa s decidedly and overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence.app.at emphasis in original.out of an abundance of caution,we shall treat this summary argument as incorporating,by reference,the more detailed arguments asserted in the rule b portion of its motion.in turn,we will treat appellate arguments as a challenge to the district court denial of its motion for new trial.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a motion for new trial under rule a.sanjuan ibp,cir.if a new trial motion asserts that the jury verdict is not supported by the evidence,the verdict must stand unless it is clearly,decidedly,or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence.anaeme diagnostek,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
after reviewing the record on appeal,we conclude that arguments do not justify the granting of a new trial.it is true that presented evidence in its defense suggesting that the category data was not transferred to kmog,and instead was left in the former oryx subsidiary solp aplt.br.at citing app.at.however,mark presented evidence during its that,viewed in the light most favorable to mark,would have allowed the jury to reasonably infer that in fact transferred the seismic data to kmog.most notably,mark presented the testimony of carlos salazar,former counsel who drafted the horsfall letter and subsequently engaged in direct communications with mark regarding whether would pay mark a transfer fee following the merger.salazar acknowledged that in the horsfall letter,as well as in similar letters he drafted for to send to its other seismic data licensors,he advised that,following completion of the merger,intended to transfer its seismic data to kmog.during,did not ask salazar whether the proposed transfer of data to kmog actually took place.notably,however,salazar was asked on redirect whether the data was transferred to a new subsidiary of corporation app.at.salazar responded,for lack of a better mean,they were physically assigned to oil gas corporation.they the books they were given oil gas corporation was given responsibility and authority for the offshore assets that had been acquired via the merger.id.in addition to salazar testimony,the evidence presented at trial also suggested that the employees of and its subsidiaries generally paid little heed to corporate formalities,instead viewed and its subsidiaries as a family,and readily shared seismic data without regard to any limitations imposed by the underlying license agreements.in light of this evidence,we can not say that the jury misappropriation findings were clearly,decidedly,or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence.anaeme,at.
challenges to the jury liability findings regarding category data 
the jury found,with regard to the category data,that breached one or more of its own license agreements with by transfer ring license s covering category data to kerr mcgee oil gas,kmog,without prior consent,by failing to return all data to mark,and by failing to safeguard mark trade secrets.app.at.contends on appeal that the jury findings can not be sustained because there was no evidence of any assignment to kmog of a license to category data,did not have a duty to return data to mark under the terms of the parties license agreement,and did not have any duty to account for the category data during the term of the license agreement.also asserts that mark has suffered no damages as a result of the purported failure to return or safeguard the category data.
raised these arguments for the first time in both the rule b and the rule portions of its motion.because,however,did not assert these arguments in its rule a motion at the close of mark,it is precluded from obtaining rule b relief on the basis of those arguments.thus,we confine our review to determining arguments justify the granting of a new trial under rule.
as previously noted,mark presented,during its,the testimony of attorney carlos salazar.salazar testified,in pertinent part,that itself did not engage in any oil and gas exploration.id.at.instead,salazar testified,such exploration was handled by subsidiaries.id.further,salazar testified that he and other employees considered to be a family of companies,and did see anything wrong with affiliates and subsidiaries exchanging seismic data information.id.at.later,during presentation of its own evidence,thomas schultz,a geophysicist testified,under by mark counsel,that a was headquartered in oklahoma city,b kmog was headquartered in dallas,and c the people who were using the seismic data after the merger were in dallas,id.at.marilyn young,a attorney who oversaw family of subsidiaries,testified as part of evidence and admitted,under by mark counsel,that wanted all of its oil and gas exploration and development and production to go through kmog,id.at,and that,in,the subsidiaries were reorganized in a fashion such that kmog oversaw onshore lp,id.at.
in addition to this testimony,the jury was presented with a copy of the agreement between and mark.that agreement,which expressly supersede d,modifie d,amend ed,and replace d all previous understandings and agreements between the two parties,required,absent written permission from mark,to maintain the data on its premises at all times and prohibited from provid ing copies of the data to third parties for removal from premises for any purpose.id.at.notably,the agreement provided that these requirements appl ied even in the event of a corporate reorganization or a merger,and that no disclosure could be made to any parties involved in such actions,even if such parties we re the surviving entities after such corporate reorganization or merger.id.at.lastly,the agreement provided that in the event of a breach by,mark could terminate the agreement and require the return of all physical evidence of the data including any reprocessing of the data.id.
in light of this evidence,we are unable to conclude that the jury findings regarding the category data were clearly,decidedly,or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence.anaeme,at.thus,in turn,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for new trial as to the category data issues.
