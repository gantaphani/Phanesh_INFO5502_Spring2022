the,saginaw bay pipeline company,cms saginaw bay company,saginaw bay lateral company,and cms saginaw bay lateral company collectively the plaintiffs,saginaw bay,or the pipeline companies have contested the district court disallowance,following a bench trial,of their claim against the united states of america through the internal revenue service hereinafter the defendant,the government,or the for reimbursement of in income tax payments,deposited under protest,which the had assessed via tax deficiency notices for the five calendar years through.see saginaw bay pipeline united states,wl,ordering final judgment for the defendant united states saginaw bay pipeline united states,d denying,on,summary judgment to all litigants.the sole issue in controversy was and remains whether,under prevailing law,the plaintiffs underground natural gas pipelines should be depreciated over a period,as argued by the plaintiffs,or instead should be subject to depreciation,as asserted by the government and as resolved by the district court.the factual and legal epicenter of the dispute is whether or not the subject pipeline system is a gathering pipeline as defined and developed herein used in the gas production process even though the plaintiffs are not themselves producers of natural gas.
in the late,shell western exploration and production,swepi,a division of shell oil company shell,commenced negotiations with the michigan consolidated gas corporation michcon for michcon construction and operation of a steel pipeline system to transmit unprocessed natural gas known in prevailing industry parlance as raw or wet natural gas from swepi gas wellheads in eighteen distinct production fields located in the michigan east central basin to its natural gas processing plant situated in kalkaska,michigan the kalkaska facility.michcon,through its subsidiary mcn corporation,formed the plaintiff entities for that purpose.between and,the plaintiffs constructed,in accordance with swepi specifications,a subterranean steel pipeline network traversing six michigan counties which linked swepi east central basin gas fields to the kalkaska facility.
that system consisted of a central line leading into the kalkaska processing plant,which was fed by lateral adjoining pipes which linked specific wellheads to field separators and ultimately to the main pipeline.the main pipeline had a daily maximum capacity of million cubic feet of wet gas.at all times material to this litigation,although the plaintiffs owned and operated the pipeline system,the transient raw natural gas remained the property of its producer throughout the transportation process the producers compensated the plaintiffs for the use of the pipeline on a contractual basis.
natural gas,in its raw form when extracted from the earth at the wellhead,is typically contaminated with numerous impurities,including,among other things,butane,ethane,pentane,propane,water,nitrogen,carbon dioxide,other inert gases,sulphur,sand,and drilling fluids.all adulterants must be substantially removed at a purification site such as the kalkaska facility,leaving only dry methane gas,prior its sale to residential or commercial consumers.the cleansed,dry petrochemical fuel is then exported from the purification plant to distributors or other customers via lines which,for purposes of this decision,shall be denominated transmission or distribution pipelines,which are pipelines designed and operated solely for the carriage of dry hydrocarbon gas,sometimes referred to in the fossil fuel business as gas.by contrast,because the saginaw bay pipeline was designed to,and was operated as,a conduit for wet natural gas,it constituted a species of natural gas transportation pipeline frequently described,within prevailing natural gas industry nomenclature,as a natural gas gathering pipeline 
because the respective functions of gathering pipelines,vis a vis transmission or distribution pipelines,as defined herein,are entirely distinct,the operating standards for the two systems are correspondingly dissimilar.for example,whereas transmission or distribution pipeline systems are typically unable to safely accommodate any significant presence of solid or liquid contaminants,gathering pipelines including the saginaw bay system must be equipped to handle at least limited amounts of the components of raw natural gas.additionally,because raw natural gas ordinarily burns at a higher temperature than dry natural gas,transmission or distribution line service contracts generally provide for the transport of fossil fuel having a relatively low heating value,usually no more than british thermal units btus whereas gathering lines including the saginaw bay system transport raw gas with higher energy values,typically ranging between and btus.the saginaw bay service contracts specified that the gas shall have a total heating value per standard cubic foot of not less than british thermal units.emphasis added.
likewise,a gathering system must be constructed to function at relatively low pressures over comparatively short distances.the saginaw bay system could tolerate no more than pounds per square inch psi of pressure,and covered only miles.by contrast,a transmission or distribution line usually functions at comparatively higher pressures over longer distances,often totaling hundreds of miles.
perhaps most significantly,gathering pipelines must be flushed out process labeled pigging to avert or delay excessive pipeline corrosion and the accumulation of foreign obstructive materials,given the ubiquitous presence of contaminants dissolved within wet natural gas whereas transmission or distribution lines conveying only clean dry gas never require that type of expensive and routine maintenance.record proof reflected that,during the interval pertinent to the instant action,at least some portions of the saginaw bay system required pigging twice or thrice daily.
consequently,because the purposes and functions of gathering lines are commercially distinct from those of transmission or distribution lines,the coordinate economic costs and investment risks accompanying each are also diverse.the unique expenses and production delays affiliated with the regular pigging of gathering pipelines are obvious examples.the singular risks of serious damage to gathering lines by corrosion or obstruction,and the attendant initial need to construct a comparatively sturdy gathering pipeline relative to a transmission or distribution line,constitute further examples.
additionally,a functional transmission or distribution line will ordinarily retain a useful and profitable economic life for as long as gas dealers or consumers connected by that line to the processing plant continue to purchase heating gas however,a gathering line more likely may become obsolete,redundant,or otherwise unprofitable prior to its natural expiration,if,for example,the field wellheads it services become depleted or otherwise unproductive,or comparatively inexpensive alternate sources of raw natural gas accessible to the processing plant become competitively available.accordingly,gathering lines are not only more costly and to construct,maintain,and operate,but also generally have a shorter operational life span than transmission or distribution lines.
because both transmission or distribution natural gas pipes,and gathering natural gas lines,constitute property used in a trade or business,the owner of either type of pipeline is entitled to a reasonable allowance for annual depreciation of that asset against the owner ordinary business income for a finite number of years.see a.the depreciation allowance for tangible property used in a trade or business should be ascertained by reference to three the depreciation method,recovery period,and convention for the business asset at issue.see b,a.the adversaries sub judice have agreed that the instant controversy involves only element two,the selection of the proper depreciation recovery period for the saginaw bay pipelines.
the plaintiffs,as taxpayers,must carry the burden of proving their entitlement to a claimed deduction which has been contested by the helvering taylor.however,if doubt exists as to the construction of a taxing statute,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.hassett welch.
the applicable depreciation recovery period is keyed to the class life of the subject property.e.an asset class life is defined by referencing the class life category prescribed by the secretary which reasonably reflects the anticipated useful life of that class of property to the industry or other group.m repealed,incorporated by reference into i the treasury regulations the regulations posit a functional standard for assigning asset classifications a b iii b.
however,the treasury secretary has promulgated two material,specific,natural gas industry asset life classifications which facially may encompass the saginaw bay pipeline wit,asset class defined to include gathering pipelines and other property used in the production of natural gas,which has a listed class life of fourteen years and an associated general depreciation system recovery period of seven years and asset class defined to include assets used in the carrying of gas by pipes,which triggers a listed class life of years,and an accompanying general depreciation system recovery period of fifteen years in re revenue procedure,proc,wl hereinafter the revenue procedure.
the pipeline companies have maintained that the saginaw bay pipeline network fits into asset class,and hence they should be entitled to comparatively accelerated depreciation.by contrast,the argued,with success before the district court,that the plaintiffs pipelines belong in asset class,which authorizes depreciation.
to date,the only sister circuit to confront a similar contest has been the tenth circuit,which,on nearly identical facts reversed the united states tax court application of depreciation,in favor of the writeoff.duke energy natural gas commissioner,cir.that court ruled that,although duke energy was not itself a producer of natural gas,its gathering systems were primarily used by gas producers to transmit wet natural gas to purification plants.id.at.moreover,after weighing factors such as the comparatively low operational pressures,generally confined geographical areas serviced,and relatively short potential economic life spans attributable to duke gathering pipe systems,the tenth circuit concluded that,as a functional issue,t he net effect is that the economic character of duke gathering activities is more akin to production than pipeline operation.id.at.
indeed,the united states posture that the depreciation status of pipelines which in fact are used as gathering lines should depend not upon their function and the costs and risks associated with their operation,but instead upon the business identity of their owners,would,if adopted,lead to the absurd result that pipelines used for identical gathering purposes would be depreciated over seven years if owned by a producer of natural gas,but would instead be subject to depreciation if owned by a pipeline company engaged in the trade of transporting wet natural gas for hire.as compellingly expressed by the duke energy court 
furthermore,were we to read a distinction into the asset classes requiring taxpayers to place the gathering systems of nonproducers in asset class and the gathering systems of producers in asset class,we would thereby create an inconsistent regime for the depreciation of assets.if placed in different classes,gathering systems used for the same purpose and serving identical wells would fall under different depreciation schedules depending upon the producer or nonproducer status of the asset owner.moreover,if a producer sells a gathering system to a nonproducer such as duke,the system would shift from one asset class to another without any change in its function or characteristics,and the system new owner would be forced to depreciate the asset over a far longer period.absent an explicit distinction based on ownership in the revenue procedure,we decline to create such an inconsistency.

the government retort was anchored in an elaborate historical construct which tediously traced the pedigree of business property depreciation federal tax laws since the inception of modern national income taxation in in a bid to illustrate that,over the years,the united states had commanded varying tax treatments of similar business assets used for similar purposes on the sole basis that the respective owners of those assets were engaged in different commerce.that effort was unavailing,because,since at least the early,the united states has explicitly renounced an approach to asset classification in favor of a system.see a b iii b applicable to property placed in service after december,which posits,among other things,that p roperty shall be classified according to primary use even though the activity in which such property is primarily used is insubstantial in relation to all the taxpayer activities.emphasis added.the duke energy court had correctly rejected the same argument by the 
the government argues that in previous iterations of the asset classes in dispute,the irs distinguished between assets owned by gas producers and those owned by.see,proc,wl superseding proc,proc,wl establishing asset class proc,wl establishing guideline class b,which e xclude d gathering pipelines and related storage facilities of pipeline companies.we first note that all of the relevant provisions of the earliest revenue procedures the government cites to support its interpretation of the current asset class descriptions have been explicitly superseded.see proc,wl superseding proc,proc,wl superseding proc.
more importantly,the language of the most these prior iterations does not establish that gathering systems of nonproducers have been distinguished from those of producers for depreciation purposes since.see proc,wl superseding proc,while noting that the change was not intended to modify the composition of the existing classes of proc.proc,which establishes the immediately prior and still relevant iteration of the applicable sentence of the description of asset class,states that the class i ncludes assets used for drilling of wells and production of petroleum and natural gas,including gathering pipelines and related storage facilities,when these are related activities undertaken by petroleum and natural gas producers.this description relies upon essentially the same language as the current asset class in stating that when gathering systems are used for the drilling and production processes of producers,they belong in asset class.we are no more persuaded by the government argument that the words undertaken by which refer to activities necessarily implies that the assets must be owned by producers than we are persuaded that the words used by necessarily require ownership.the relevant earlier asset class descriptions provide us with no clear mandate to distinguish between gathering systems based upon ownership,and we therefore will not do so

this reviewing court has carefully considered the trial court written opinions and final judgment,the briefs and all arguments of counsel,the material contained within the joint appendix,and the controlling legal authorities.it finds that the district court committed reversible legal and factual error by ruling that the saginaw bay pipelines at issue herein were not gathering pipelines subject to depreciation under the revenue procedure asset class definition.this court finds the tenth circuit reasoning and conclusions articulated in duke energy natural gas commissioner,cir,to be logically persuasive and factually on point,and thus adopts its analysis and ruling.this court further concludes that the subsequent conflicting analysis and decision of the united states tax court in clajon gas commissioner,wl,was legally and unpersuasive.
in conclusion,this reviewing court rules that every natural gas carriage pipeline which functions as a gathering pipeline in the methane gas production process by transporting impure raw or wet natural gas from the field wellheads to a cleansing and processing facility qualifies as a gathering pipeline subject to general depreciation system depreciation
