this is a putative class action under the commodities exchange act cea,alleging manipulation of natural gas futures and options prices.richard hershey and roberto gracey plaintiffs purchased and sold new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas futures contracts.plaintiffs sued energy transfer partners,and its affiliates collectively,defendants for allegedly manipulating the price of natural gas delivered at the houston ship channel hsc and alleged economic harm to their nymex natural gas futures contracts caused by that manipulation.plaintiffs purport to represent a class of natural gas futures and options contracts traders over the period of defendants alleged manipulation.
the commodities futures trading commission cftc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc alleged in previous enforcement actions that defendants created and then exploited price differences between the hsc and the henry hub,a major confluence of natural gas pipelines and the settlement price for all nymex natural gas futures contracts.we must now decide whether plaintiffs may bring a proper claim under the cea for the alleged manipulation of hsc prices.because we find that plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege that defendants specifically intended to manipulate nymex natural gas futures contracts,we affirm the district court dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
a.the natural gas futures market 
natural gas is a commodity a tangible good bought and sold in commerce.black law dictionary ed.this tangible good produces a variety of intangible financial derivatives,traded on public markets by investors who have little interest in actually obtaining the natural gas.the market at issue here is nymex,although most of defendants allegedly manipulative trades occurred on the intercontinental exchange ice,an competitor of nymex.
if the buyer purchases the commodity for cash and the seller delivers the good on the spot,it is called a spot sale.thus,a spot sale reflects the current price,and therefore the actual present value,of the commodity.arguably the most important commodities transaction is the futures contract an agreement to buy or sell a standardized asset such as a commodity,stock,or foreign currency at a fixed price at a future time.black law dictionary,supra,at.the asset that is the subject of the future is called the underlying.the modifier underlying has an important effect on commodity the underlying commodity of a futures contract is a specific good,governed by the terms of the futures contract.see three crown.caxton,noting that,in a claim under the cea provision at issue here,the commodity underlying refers to the commodity specified within the particular futures contract and finding that particular treasury notes were not the commodity underlying treasury bill futures or eurodollar futures see also leist simplot,cir noting that the contract involved in this case,the may maine potato futures contract,is for pounds of maine grown potatoes of a specified quality to be delivered at specified points in cars of the bangor aroostook railroad,between may and may.
a future hedges,or limits,risk and allows for speculation.for example,if party a thinks that the price for natural gas will increase,it can acquire a future for the later delivery of natural gas at a current set price to avoid paying a possibly higher price at a later date.party b believes that the price will decrease and agrees to deliver the natural gas to party a at the later date for the agreed price.party b may profit from the transaction by waiting to actually acquire the natural gas for delivery until a later date,thereby benefitting from the difference between the amount received for the future and the actual cost to acquire the natural gas.
most parties who trade in natural gas futures do not want and simply would be unable to take physical delivery of the natural gas.instead,these parties trade in natural gas futures like traditional investors trade in stocks and bonds the parties financially offset the future by further futures trading as one would sell a stock on the public market.for these parties,the difference between the contract price and the offsetting transaction represents the loss or profit.
the futures contract has two positions,a long and a short.the long party pays for the contract and is obligated to take delivery.the short party receives payment for the future and is obligated to make delivery.if a short party holds the future until it comes due,the prompt month,then the futures contract becomes a presently enforceable contractual obligation to deliver the natural gas.the parties on opposing sides of the future do not deal with one another rather,they make their trades through a clearinghouse,such as nymex.see in re natural gas commodity litig.natural gas litig,d.the clearinghouse allows futures parties to offset their obligations easily,which introduces fluidity to the market.
the public markets for futures standardize the contracts.everything,except for price,remains the same from one futures contract to the next the nymex natural gas futures contracts rules apply to all natural gas bought and sold for future delivery on nymex with delivery at the henry hub.id.each nymex futures contract represents ten billion british thermal units of natural gas.id.the price for the natural gas that is delivered at the henry hub is the settlement price of the nymex natural gas futures contract 
the henry hub is a physical delivery point near erath,louisiana,and the confluence of many interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines.amaranth,d at.the spot price of physical delivery at the henry hub underpins every natural gas future on nymex,regardless of whether that future goes to physical delivery.see nymex rulebook,
the henry hub is not the exclusive delivery point for all natural gas in the united states.defendants purchases and sales represent the bulk of the trades involving natural gas delivered through the hsc,a major conduit of natural gas to the texas market.because the price of delivery can vary among hubs,many large traders in natural gas commodities practice of taking advantage of the price differential among markets.black law dictionary,supra,at.defendants here used natural gas futures basis swaps to accomplish this arbitrage.a swap is a pure financial instrument based on the difference between two fluctuating values.in the natural gas basis swaps here,the value of the swap is the difference between the settlement price of the nymex natural gas futures contract for a given contract month and that of the monthly index at the hsc for that same month.put simply,the wider the gap between prices at the henry hub and the hsc,the more money defendants stood to make from their basis swaps.
although prices differ between delivery hubs,those differences quickly converge because of the nature of the public market.this convergence is due,in large part,to a system of price reporting.through internet terminals connected to ice or nymex,traders can see the flow of trades.additionally,platts,a reporting agency,collects certain price and volume information from trading participants,and publishes the monthly inside ferc gas market report iferc.the public pricing information influences traders forecasts and impacts decisions to acquire natural gas.the public pricing information will reflect any dips or spikes in prices,which in turn impacts the priace at other hubs,demonstrating a high correlation between prices of natural gas at hubs nationwide.
cftc and ferc enforcement actions against defendants 
plaintiffs allegations substantially mirror the allegations in regulatory actions against defendants by the cftc and ferc.in july,the ferc issued an order to show cause and notice of proposed penalties ferc order to show cause alleging that defendants engaged in manipulative trading on the same day,the cftc filed a complaint in the northern district of texas against defendants,alleging market manipulation and seeking injunctive and equitable relief,along with civil penalties under the cea 
the ferc order to show cause alleges,with great specificity,defendants use of financial constructs and coordinated trades to manipulate hsc prices 
energy transfer partners etp dominated sales of gas at hsc,often comprising percent or more of total sales.etp reported its fixed price sales at hsc to iferc and thus was able to use its domination of the market to virtually set the iferc hsc index.in spite of etp sales activity at hsc,it was consistently a net buyer of monthly gas priced at the iferc hsc index,and thus was positioned to benefit from the lower prices it caused in the months it manipulated sales at hsc 
at the same time,etp had entered into basis swaps to leverage its benefit from suppressing monthly physical prices at hsc thus,etp profited if the difference between prices at hsc and the nymex contract widened,the price at hsc became lower relative to the higher priced nymex contract because etp had the power to suppress price at hsc,this was not really a bet at all,but a manipulation that was spectacularly successful in october realized more than in unjust highly profitable in eight other months from january through december.
ferc order to show cause,at.
the cftc settled with defendants for million the consent letter permanently enjoined defendants from any further manipulation of any commodity defendants also settled with the ferc,for million,and agreed to periodic independent audits 
plaintiffs action 
plaintiffs purchased long positions in nymex natural gas futures,and sold those position at a loss the same day.after the cftc and ferc actions,plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint,alleging commodity futures market manipulation and aiding and abetting under c,a,and a.these two traders purport to represent a class of others similarly situated,defined in their complaint as a ll persons a who sold nymex natural gas futures contracts,or b purchased or sold nymex natural gas options contracts between december,and december,plaintiffs allegations are based on the cftc and ferc actions.the crux of this case,however,is whether plaintiffs can wrestle the cftc and ferc allegations into a private cause of action.
plaintiffs theory of liability is as follows defendants had the power to suppress prices at hsc because of their dominant market position at that hub.defendants manipulated nymex futures and options contracts by selling,during the bidweek,large quantities of natural gas for delivery at hsc to depress the price of the natural gas at that hub to an artificial level.defendants provided the artificially low price information to platts,knowing that those prices would be reflected in hsc monthly price index.those reported figures resulted in a published index that contained manipulated and artificial figures.defendants engaged in this manipulation intending to drive the hsc price down against the henry hub price so they could profit from the difference between the two delivery hubs.the low hsc monthly index caused the nymex price to fluctuate artificially,resulting in a lower price.plaintiffs suffered damages by trading nymex natural gas futures and options contracts at artificial prices during the enumerated class period.
d.the district court dismissal 
defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint,arguing that plaintiffs failed to allege that defendants specifically intended to manipulate the price of natural gas at the henry hub,and thus plaintiffs failed to allege the cea requirement that the manipulation be specifically directed toward the underlying commodity of the contract.it would be illogical,defendants argued,for defendants to intend to depress henry hub prices if they allegedly benefitted from the difference between henry hub and hsc prices.plaintiffs responded that the underlying of a nymex futures contract is natural gas generally,rather than gas delivered at the henry hub,because the henry hub spot price merely sets national benchmark.because the hsc and henry hub prices were correlated,plaintiffs argued that defendants manipulation of the hsc price would necessarily drive down the cost of gas at the henry hub.
the district court agreed with defendant and dismissed the case with prejudice.the district court reasoned that the private right of action under the cea applies only to alleged manipulation of the price of the commodity underlying the contract,a,and found that the commodity underlying plaintiffs nymex natural gas futures is the natural gas bought and sold for delivery at the henry hub.
the district court held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim because they did not allege facts tending to show that defendants had specifically intended to manipulate the cost of natural gas delivered at the henry hub.plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider,which the district court denied.plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under over the final order of the district court dismissing plaintiffs amended complaint.we review de novo the district court dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.epco carbon dioxide,jp morgan chase bank,na,cir citation omitted.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,plaintiffs amended complaint need only include a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.d etailed factual allegations are not required.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly,
however,the complaint must allege sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim that is plausible on its face.id.at quoting twombly,at.a claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.at citing twombly,at.a court should not accept threadbare recitals of a cause of action elements,supported by mere conclusory statements,which do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.id.at.
b.the private right of action under the cea 
the cea provides a private right of action against individuals who purchased or sold a futures contract if those individuals manipulat ed the price of any such contract or the price of the commodity underlying such contract.a d.the parties do not dispute that plaintiffs acquired and sold nymex natural gas futures contracts during the period of defendants alleged manipulation.however,we have yet to define manipulation under the cea,nor have we defined commodity underlying.
specific intent for manipulation claims under the cea 
to be liable for commodities fraud,a defendant must possess the intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,discussing scienter requirement for securities fraud.the obligation to plead specific intent may be traced back to decisions establishing an agency burden of proof.see grossman citrus assocs.of cotton,citing in the matter of cox,transfer binder comm.fut.cch at cftc july,see also in re soybean futures,the court recognizes that a manipulation claim requires a showing of specific intent,that is,a showing that the accused acted or failed to act with the purpose or conscious object of influencing prices.quoting in re.farm bureau coop,transfer binder comm.fut.cch at cftc.
although we have not had an opportunity to specifically adopt a pleading standard for commodities manipulation claims,the specific intent standard appears to have substantial support.see amaranth,d at applying specific intent standard against private cause of action cftc enron,no,wl,at,applying specific intent to claim by cftc against firm for market manipulation natural gas,d at discussing different manipulation standards,each of which includes the specific intent requirement grossman.at collecting cases.in volkart,freeman,we established that manipulation is any and every operation or transaction or practice calculated to produce a price distortion of any kind in any market either in itself or in relation to other markets,cir citation omitted.despite this broad standard,we noted the importance of specific intent,stating that there must be a purpose to create prices not responsive to the forces of supply and demand.id.because the specific intent standard is grounded in sound reasoning and precedent,we adopt it for private cau
