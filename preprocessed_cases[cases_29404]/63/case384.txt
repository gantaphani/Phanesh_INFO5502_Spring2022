background 
plaintiffs evelyn scrivner,gary switzer,and larry switzer scrivner obtained oil and gas leases on a number of properties in oklahoma.later,scrivner assigned those leases to others,including defendant sonat exploration company.as consideration for these assignments,scrivner reserved an overriding royalty interest in said leases.on april,scrivner brought this diversity action under oklahoma law against defendant,asserting claims of breach of covenant to market gas for the highest and best price equitable accounting and breach of fiduciary duty.plaintiff ranch sued defendant in the same court and under the same theories,so the district court consolidated the two suits for trial.on january,the day trial was to begin on both suits,the parties reached a settlement.the settlement agreement required defendant to assign to plaintiffs additional royalty interests in the leasehold estate created by the oil and gas leases executed by the plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest covering the lands described in exhibits and.app.at.in exchange,plaintiffs moved to dismiss with prejudice the two cases at bar and a separate suit pending against defendant.following the dismissals,the district court retained its jurisdiction to monitor the parties consummation of the agreement.
on february,plaintiffs rejected defendant attempted assignments as noncompliant with the terms of the agreement.when defendant refused to alter the assignments,plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce settlement agreement.defendant responded with its objection to plaintiffs motion to enforce settlement and to enforce settlement agreement or,alternatively,to vacate.on july,the court denied plaintiffs motion,granted defendant cross motion without a hearing,and ordered defendant to proffer the assignments in the forms defendant had prepared.
on november,the court granted defendant application for attorney fees under the provisions of the agreement without specifying a final amount.plaintiffs appealed that order on december.see scrivner sonat exploration,cir.filed december,ranch sonat exploration,cir.filed december.the court clarified the amount of attorney fees in an order filed on december,which plaintiffs also appealed.see scrivner sonat exploration,cir.filed january,ranch sonat exploration,cir.filed january.
we made two jurisdictional inquiries.first,we asked whether our exercise of jurisdiction was premature in light of the district court initially incomplete attorney fee award.however,the court subsequent order clarifying the amount allays any concerns regarding appealable finality.app.at.we thus dismiss appeals and and find jurisdiction under for and.second,we questioned our jurisdiction on the merits,since the district court retained jurisdiction over the enforcement of the settlement agreement.however,while the district court retained jurisdiction over the original actions until the agreement was consummated,the court finally resolved all issues before it in its order of july,and thus our jurisdiction is warranted under for appeals to that order.
on appeal,both scrivner and challenge the district court ruling on their motion to enforce and the award of attorney fees.however,because appeal on the motion to enforce was not timely,we will only consider scrivner appeal on the merits before evaluating the appeals of both plaintiffs on the attorney fee award defendant appeals the court ruling on his alternative motion to vacate the settlement agreement,requesting rescission of the agreement only if we hold scrivner interpretation to be correct.
ii.settlement agreement interpretation 
both scrivner and defendant concur that the settlement agreement required defendant to assign to scrivner additional royalty interests in mineral leases.both agree that the assignments were to be the equivalent of raising the revenue interest of scrivner,et so that if the royalty interest of scrivner,et under a lease was then its royalty interest will be increased to.app.at.the two differ,however,on the question four percent of what scrivner contended that the agreement required a four percent increase in scrivner royalty interest in the leases on all of the properties referenced in the agreement.defendant argued that it only had to assign a four percent royalty increase attributable to the leases that it owned,which included only portions of the scrivner properties referenced in the agreement.the district court held that the term overriding royalty interest,which was used repeatedly to describe the interest to be assigned by defendant,had a specific meaning in the oil and gas industry an interest carved out of the working interest of a mineral lease.it followed,the court reasoned,that one interest carved out of another can not exceed the original,and thus the parties could not have intended that defendant carve out portions of leases that it did not own to give to scrivner.in addition,the court noted that the agreement does not state that the overrides are to be computed based on the original leases,but from the leasehold estate created by the oil and gas leases executed by the plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest covering the lands described in exhibits and.app.at quoting settlement agreement,app.at.thus,the court concluded,the agreement indicates the parties intent to assign scrivner additional royalty interests in the referenced oil and gas leases that were owned by defendant.
we review the district court interpretation of the settlement agreement de novo.see valley bank abdnor,cir.under oklahoma law,courts interpreting a contract must consider the entire agreement so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable.stat.tit.if the language of a contract is clear and without ambiguity,the court is to interpret it as a matter of law.similarly,the existence of an ambiguity is a decision to be made by the court.corbett combined communications,citation omitted.in addition,i f a contract be ambiguous in its terms,the court should examine the entire contract for the purpose of declaring the meaning and intentions of the parties as expressed by the entire contract.standard accidental ins.goldberg.if the meaning of the contract is apparent on the face of the instrument,then no extraneous evidence is proper to give a different construction.james talcott,finley.finally,t echnical words are to be interpreted as usually understood by persons in the profession or business to which they relate,unless clearly used in a different sense.okla stat.tit,emphasis added.
in this case,the court correctly noted the use of the term override and its usual interpretation in the industry.however,the court misconstrued the use of that term in conjunction with the remainder of the contract.the agreement states that defendant is to assign to plaintiffs an interest in the leasehold estate created by the oil and gas leases executed by the plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest covering the lands described in exhibits and.app.at emphasis added.in further describing the assignment,the agreement states that it will be the equivalent of raising the revenue interests of scrivner,et.under each lease its minerals are subject to.app.at emphasis added.nowhere is the increase described as a portion of defendant interests in fact,the agreement makes it clear that it is scrivner interests that will increase under scrivner leases on the referenced wells.in addition,the agreement specifically references its exhibit,which lists not only eleven of the thirteen scrivner leases owned by defendant,but six additional scrivner leases as well.the use of the term override implies a carveout,but the parties here expressed an intention to carve a portion out of the royalties derived under the referenced scrivner wells,not those of defendant.
it is not surprising that the unusual nature of this carveout was confusing to the district court.even defendant concedes in its brief that it is required to deliver additional interests in the form of an override calculated as if the face of the scrivner group leases had a percent royalty percentage.ans.br.at emphasis added.although due to the last minute nature of its a
