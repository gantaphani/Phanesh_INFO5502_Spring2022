this case involves the application of the louisiana oilfield act the act to an agreement between ensco offshore company and centin llc for repairs on a dismantled fixed platform rig.the district court denied ensco motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of centin.the court concluded that the act invalidated the choice of law provision and defense and indemnity clause in the parties contract 
in august of,ensco entered into a day work drilling contract with amerada hess corporation in which ensco agreed to provide the fixed platform rig ensco for use on approximately six wells off the coast of louisiana.before ensco could fulfill its contract obligations to amerada,ensco required extensive refurbishment work.ensco hired centin to perform the necessary services.
centin signed a master service contract with ensco in which centin agreed to provide goods and services on ensco land and offshore drilling rigs.the master service contract provided the general rights,duties and obligations of the parties.the contract required that its terms be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the provisions of the general maritime law of the united states.the contract also required centin to defend and indemnify ensco for claims arising from injuries related to the contract the agreement did not require work on any specific platform owned by ensco.ensco controlled each specific job through work or purchase orders.
ensco instructed centin to perform services on the ensco through several specific purchase orders and field requisitions.no reference was made in any purchase order or field requisition to the wells operated by amerada.centin performed all of the work at the coral marine fabrication yard in amelia,louisiana.
on march,plaintiff jesse verdine,a centin employee,filed suit against ensco for damages he received while working on the ensco.ensco filed a complaint against centin seeking defense and indemnity for verdine claim.centin denied ensco claim for defense and indemnity based on the louisiana oilfield act.see.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
after reviewing the evidence,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of centin.the court determined that the act applied to the parties agreement and that the statute therefore voided the contract choice of general maritime law.ensco eventually settled with the plaintiff,and the district court entered its final judgment dismissing the case on august.ensco timely appealed.
we review a district court order granting summary judgment under the same standard that guided the district court.see roberts energy dev,cir.ensco argues on appeal that the act does not apply to the parties agreement and that the parties choice of maritime law should control.if maritime law applies to the contract,the defense and indemnity provision will be enforceable against centin.see dupont sandefer oil gas,cir.
in federal diversity cases involving conflicts of law,the law of the forum state,here louisiana,governs.see roberts,at citing klaxon stentor electric.louisiana generally allows parties to select the law that will determine the outcome of disputes arising from a contract.see.ann.matte zapata offshore,cir.the louisiana civil code states 
all other issues of conventional obligations are governed by the law expressly chosen or clearly relied upon by the parties,except to the extent that law contravenes the public policy of the state whose law would otherwise be applicable under article.
ann.the parties are in agreement that,notwithstanding the provision,louisiana law would govern the terms of the contract.
louisiana contract law generally allows a principal to be indemnified against his own negligence so long as that intent is clearly expressed.rodrigue,so d at.the oilfield act creates a public policy exception to the general rule.see id.if the act applies to the agreement,then we must conclude that the choice of law provision and the defense and indemnity clause will be void as a matter of public policy.if the act does not apply,then the defense and indemnity provision will be enforceable under either maritime law or louisiana contract law.we therefore limit our analysis to whether the act applies to the parties agreement.
the louisiana legislature adopted the act to eliminate defense and indemnity provisions forced on louisiana oilfield contractors.see.ann.a.the purpose of the legislator,and thus the policy interest of the state,is to protect certain contractors,namely those in oilfields,from being forced through indemnity provisions to bear the risk of their principal negligence.rodrigue,so d at.subsection c explains the agreements to which the act applies 
the term agreement,as it pertains to a well for oil,gas,or water,or drilling for minerals which occur in a solid,liquid,gaseous,or other state,as used in this section,means any agreement or understanding,written or oral,concerning any operations related to the exploration,development,production,or transportation of oil,gas,or water,or drilling for minerals which occur in a solid,liquid,gaseous,or other state,including but not limited to drilling,deepening,reworking,repairing,improving,testing,treating,perforating,acidizing,logging,conditioning,altering,plugging,or otherwise rendering services in or in connection with any well drilled for the purpose of producing or excavating,constructing,improving,or otherwise rendering services in connection with any mine shaft,drift,or other structure intended for use in the exploration for or production of any mineral,or an agreement to perform any portion of any such work or services or any act collateral thereto,including the furnishing or rental of equipment,incidental transportation,and other goods and services furnished in connection with any such service or operation.
ann.c emphasis added.
given the act broad definition of agreement,courts have construed subsection c liberally.see roberts,at copous odeco oil gas,cir.early cases achieved a considerably expansive application of the act by focusing solely on subsection c related to language.in livings service truck lines of texas,so d.cir,the court of appeals applied the act to an agreement involving a contractor inspection of pipe.at the time of the inspection,the pipe was part of the owner inventory and was not designated to any specific well.see id.at.the court concluded that the act applied to the agreement even though the services were not rendered in connection to a well.see id.at.the court reasoned that subsection c only required the agreement to relate to the exploration,development,production,or transportation of oil,gas or water.id.quoting.ann.c.
similarly,in day ray mcdermott,so d.cir,the court of appeals applied the act to void a hold harmless agreement between two contractors.gulf oil company hired ray mcdermott,to construct an offshore drilling platform in mcdermott yard in amelia,louisiana.see id.at.gulf also hired ultrasonic specialists,to inspect the welds made by mcdermott employees.see id.before allowing the ultrasonic employees onto the premises,mcdermott required ultrasonic to execute a hold harmless agreement.see id.mcdermott argued that the contract relating to the construction of an offshore platform was too remote in relation to drilling oil.see id.at.the court dismissed this argument,concluding that subsection c only required the agreement to relate to a structure intended for use in the exploration for or production of any mineral.id.at quoting.ann.c.
the scope of the act application diminished as a result of this court ruling in transcontinental gas pipe line transportation insurance company,cir.in transcontinental,we recognized that subsection c requires not only that an agreement relate to the broad list of exploration,production,and transportation activities,but also that an agreement pertain to an actual well.see id.at.the opinion explained the application of subsection c as a test 
first,there must be an agreement that pertains to an oil,gas or water well.if the contract does not pertain to a well,the inquiry ends.only if we determine that the contract has the required nexus to a well may we procee
