this is an appeal by the assignee of an oil and gas lease on federal land from the dismissal of its action against the assignor and others.the dismissal was entered after the trial court vacated the amended judgment in the assignee favor on the ground the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in the lease.we conclude the matter presented only issues concerning the contractual relationship between the parties and tort claims the interests of the united states were not implicated in the litigation and the jurisdiction of the federal courts was not exclusive.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural summary 
this case arises out of an assignment of an interest in certain mineral leases.western states international,western states and gas and oil technologies,gas oil,now known as united pacific energy corporation upec entered into an agreement to sell and assign a percent interest in certain oil and gas leases to tearlach resources california limited tearlach california,a wholly owned subsidiary of tearlach resources limited tearlach,a canadian corporation.some of the leases were for oil and gas rights on land owned by the united states government,leased pursuant to the mla or the act subsequently,weatherford artificial lift systems,sued gas and oil,western states,and tearlach california,alleging gas and oil leased two pumping units from weatherford for use at its wells,but defaulted in payment it alleged western states and tearlach held some interest in the leasehold of the wells.weatherford sought judgment for the amount owed and foreclosure of an oil and gas lien.
gas and oil and western states against tearlach california,then initiated their own separate action against tearlach,tearlach california,and two of tearlach corporate officers,malcolm fraser and charles ross.the western states parties first amended and first amended complaint made similar allegations they entered into a written letter agreement with tearlach in which tearlach agreed to purchase a percent interest in the oil property known as the north kern front.because tearlach was not a united states corporation,the assignment could not legally be made to it,so fraser and ross formed tearlach california to hold the assigned interest in the leases.the western states parties were induced by the fraudulent representations of fraser and ross to make the assignment.the western states parties alleged the leases included a combination of privately owned leases and leases owned by the united states government and managed by the bureau of land management blm.
in the western states parties action,tearlach,tearlach california,fraser,and ross filed a against western states,upec,and their officers and principal shareholders,ingrid aliet gass,david smuskevietch,and glenn morinaka.the tearlach alleged fraudulently induced to enter into the letter agreement to purchase a percent interest in the oil property.it alleged causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,negligence and negligent misrepresentation,declaratory relief,an accounting,constructive trust,and conversion.
the western states parties action and the weatherford action were consolidated.tearlach filed a motion to domesticate a foreign judgment,asking that the court enter judgment in its favor and against the western states parties based upon an million judgment tearlach had obtained against the western states parties in canada.according to tearlach,the canadian judgment was based on the same transaction and allegations of fraud presented in the consolidated cases.the motion was denied.the tearlach parties also filed a motion for summary judgment,again seeking entry of judgment based on the canadian judgment.that motion also was denied.
a week before the trial date,the attorney for the western states parties filed an ex parte application to be relieved as counsel.the application was granted.the western states parties did not appear for trial.the trial court took evidence and,on february,entered judgment in favor of the tearlach parties and against the western states parties and aliet gass on both the western states parties and the tearlach parties it awarded the tearlach parties damages in excess of million.on march,the trial court entered an amended judgment adding a declaration that western states transferred to tearlach california,effective on or before december,a percent working interest in the oil and gas property known as the kern front field,including the witmer a,b west,and sentinel a lease,and the mitchell lease.
nine months later,on december,the western states parties and aliet gass moved to vacate the amended judgment and dismiss the tearlach parties,asserting the judgment entered by the trial court was void.they argued the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims made in that pleading because the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of claims involving ownership of interests in federal mineral leases.the trial court granted the motion to vacate the amended judgment.it denied the tearlach parties motion for reconsideration and dismissed their on the ground the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the claims it contained.the tearlach parties appeal from the dismissal of their.
discussion 
vacating judgment 
the court may on motion of either party after notice to the other party,set aside any void judgment or order.code civ,subd.d.the statute does not place any time limit on bringing such a motion.additionally,the court has equitable power to set aside a void judgment at any time.it is well settled that a judgment or order which is void on its face,and which requires only an inspection of the or record to show its invalidity,may be set aside on motion,at any time after its entry,by the court which rendered the judgment or made the order.citations.citations.reid balter th.a judgment absolutely void may be attacked anywhere,directly or collaterally whenever it presents itself,either by parties or strangers.it is simply a nullity,and can be neither a basis nor evidence of any right whatever.andrews superior court of san joaquin county cal d.
we reject the tearlach parties arguments that the western states parties and aliet gass failed to meet the requirements for vacating a judgment under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,and that the motion was untimely.the motion to vacate was not based on subdivision b of that section,which applies to judgments entered through a party mistake,inadvertence,surprise or excusable neglect.the motion was brought pursuant to subdivision d of that section and the court inherent power to set aside a void judgment.neither the substantive requirements nor the time requirements of subdivision b applied to the motion.the issue before this court is whether the trial court correctly determined that the judgment was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,warranting vacation pursuant to either code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,or the trial court inherent power to vacate a void judgment.
ii.subject matter jurisdiction 
standard of review 
questions of subject matter jurisdiction are questions of law,which are reviewed de novo.belleri united states,robbins foothill nissan th.
federal and state jurisdiction 
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,possessing only that power authorized by constitution and statute.citation.gunn minton.the united states constitution provides that the federal judicial power shall extend to all cases,in law and equity,arising under this constitution,and the laws of the united states and to controversies to which the united states shall be a party,art.iii,cl.the grant of power in the constitution is not,however congress must define the controversies over which the federal courts may exercise jurisdiction.merrell dow pharmaceuticals,thompson,stevenson fain.congress has authorized federal courts to exercise original subject matter jurisdiction in many actions,including all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states,civil actions commenced by the united states id,certain civil actions brought against the united states for damages id.a,and civil actions to quiet title to an estate or interest in real property in which an interest is claimed by the united states id.f.
state courts often have concurrent jurisdiction of federal claims.in considering the propriety of jurisdiction over any particular federal claim,the court begins with the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction.citations.congress,however,may confine jurisdiction to the federal courts either explicitly or implicitly.thus,the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction can be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive,by unmistakable implication from legislative history,or by a clear incompatibility between jurisdiction and federal interests.citations.gulf offshore mobil oil.
in yellow freight system,donnelly yellow freight,the court considered whether federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions brought under title vii of the civil rights act of,et.title vii.the court stated under our system of dual sovereignty,we have consistently held that state courts have inherent authority,and are thus presumptively competent,to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the united states.citations.to give federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over a federal cause of action,congress must,in an exercise of its powers under the supremacy clause,affirmatively divest state courts of their presumptively concurrent jurisdiction.citation.yellow freight,supra,at.the text of title vii did not divest state courts of jurisdiction.it provided that the federal district courts shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter.citation.yellow freight,at.however,u nlike a number of statutes in which congress unequivocally stated that the jurisdiction of the federal courts is exclusive,title vii contains no language that expressly confines jurisdiction to federal courts or ousts state courts of their presumptive jurisdiction.the omission of any such provision is strong,and arguably sufficient,evidence that congress had no such intent.
the court concluded the legislative history of title vii did not demonstrate an intent by congress to make federal jurisdiction exclusive.yellow freight,supra,at pp.further,there was no incompatibility between title vii procedures and state court jurisdiction.id.at.the court had no reason to question the presumption that state courts are just as able as federal courts to adjudicate title vii claims.id.at.accordingly,the court held the presumption of concurrent state court jurisdiction had not been overcome.ibid.
the western states parties cited nothing in the mla making jurisdiction of the federal district courts exclusive.in their brief,they argue cancellation or forfeiture of leases can only be done in united states district court,citing united states code section a.that section,however,merely states any lease issued under the provisions of this act may be forfeited and canceled by an appropriate proceeding in the united states district court.it does not state that such an action must be filed in federal court,or that the jurisdiction of the district courts is exclusive.in any event,this action did not involve forfeiture or cancellation of a lease,and the western states parties have not cited any provision of the act that grants federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of disputes between the parties to an assignment of an interest in an oil and gas lease.
although the western states parties motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the tearlach parties argued the action was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts,it did not identify any act of congress that conferred on the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of the type of claims made in the tearlach parties.instead,the motion was based directly on the provision of the united states constitution extending judicial power to controversies to which the united states shall be a party,art.iii,cl.the effect of this constitutional provision,however,is not to vest jurisdiction in the inferior courts over the designated cases and controversies but to delimit those in respect of which congress may confer jurisdiction upon such courts as it creates.only the jurisdiction of the supreme court is derived directly from the constitution.every other court created by the general government derives its jurisdiction wholly from the authority of congress.that body may give,withhold or restrict such jurisdiction at its discretion,provided it be not extended beyond the boundaries fixed by the constitution.citations.the constitution simply gives to the inferior courts the capacity to take jurisdiction in the enumerated cases,but it requires an act of congress to confer it.citation.kline burke construction.thus,the question before this court is whether congress has enacted any statute conferring on federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of the types of claims alleged in the tearlach parties.
federal courts have been granted jurisdiction of various civil actions against the united states,including actions alleging tort or contract claims.see.jurisdiction of some types of claims is expressly made exclusive in the federal courts.for example,federal district courts have exclusive original jurisdiction of certain civil actions against the united states for money damages for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the negligence of a federal employee.id.b.the district courts also have exclusive jurisdiction of actions to quiet title to an estate or interest in real property in which an interest is claimed by the united states.id.f.
the united states was not a party to the consolidated actions.none of the causes of action in the tearlach parties was alleged against the united states.citing united states alabama alabama,the western states parties and aliet gass argue that the was against the united states because a proceeding against property in which the united states has an interest is a suit against the united states.id.at.in alabama,the united states brought an action to quiet title to certain real properties it owned.the state of alabama had assessed taxes on the properties and,when they became delinquent,the county court sold the properties to the state and issued certificates of purchase.regarding the tax sales,the court stated a proceeding against property in which the united states has an interest is a suit against the united states.citation.the united states was an indispensable party to proceedings for the sale of the lands,and in the absence of its consent to the prosecution of such proceedings,the county court was without jurisdiction and its decrees,the tax sales and the certificates of purchase issued to the state were void.ibid.title to the property claimed by the united states had been directly placed in issue the county court attempted to divest the united states of its title by conducting the tax sale of the properties and issuing certificates of purchase to the buyer.
this action is not a proceeding against property in which the united states claims an interest,as was the case in alabama.the tearlach parties did not claim ownership of the property,nor did they challenge the title of the united states to the property.they did not dispute the right of the united states to lease the property for purposes of extracting oil and gas from it.the tearlach parties alleged a contract between them and the western states parties,by which tearlach california would acquire a percent interest in the western states parties oil and gas leases in exchange for shares of tearlach.the alleged the western states parties induced the tearlach parties to enter into the contract by making false and fraudulent representations.it alleged the western states parties breached the contract,committed torts,and damaged the tearlach parties by misappropriating and misusing funds and failing to pay amounts owed to the tearlach parties,or failing to repay amounts advanced to them.the tearlach parties sought to recover the consideration it paid to the western states parties under the contract,amounts it paid to protect its investment,such as expenses it paid that were the responsibility of the western states parties,and attorney fees.although the contained a cause of action for declaratory relief,which alleged a controversy about the parties respective rights in connection with the contracts,leases,and the assets which are the subject of this litigation,as well as concerning the legal status of the parties and their positions in connection with the oil and gas properties,the tearlach parties did not dispute the title of the united states to the property or the validity of the western states parties lease.the allegations of the concerned the obligations between private parties under their contract,as well as tort liability for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and conversion.the tearlach parties did not challenge the interest of the united states in the property.
the western states parties and aliet gass contend state courts have no jurisdiction over any type of ownership interests in federal lands,whether the united states is named as a party or not.the quote from united states fullard leo cir,they cite in support of this proposition,however,comes from the dissent to that opinion,and has no precedential value.united states romain cir.the western states parties and aliet gass also assert the circuit has interpreted as specifically not granting concurrent state court jurisdiction in ventura county gulf oil cir.ventura county,however,did not address any issue of concurrent state and federal court jurisdiction.the issue in that case was whether the county could impose on a lessee of federal mineral rights a requirement that the lessee obtain a county permit under its local zoning ordinances before the lessee could exercise the rights it was granted under the lease and drilling permits it acquired from the united states.the court statement that a certain provision of united states code section was not a recognition of concurrent state jurisdiction referred to jurisdiction to regulate mineral leases and drilling on federal land,not to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts to adjudicate claims involving federal mineral leases.ventura county,at.
another case the western states parties relied on,leiter minerals,united states leiter,also does not establish that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of actions between private parties,involving the assignment of an interest in mineral leases on federal land.in leiter,the petitioner filed suit in a louisiana state court against the lessees of federal mineral rights,contending its predecessor in interest reserved the mineral rights in its deed to the united states and,pursuant to louisiana law louisiana act of,the reservation of rights was imprescriptible.petitioner sought,among other things,a declaration that it owned the mineral rights under the federal land and an accounting for the minerals removed by the lessees.the united states then filed suit against the petitioner and other interested parties in federal district court to quiet title to the mineral rights.the district court granted the request of the united states to enjoin prosecution of the state court action,and the appellate court affirmed,concluding that,under the quiet title provisions,the district court was vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine title to the mineral rights.leiter,at.
the court considered the propriety of enjoining the state court action in light of the federal statute prohibiting a court of the united states from granting an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court,except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.the court stated the suit in the federal court was the only one that could finally determine the basic issue in the litigation whether the title of the united states to the mineral rights was affected by louisiana act of.the united states was not a party to the state suit and,under settled principles,title to land in possession of the united states under a claim of interest can not be tried as against the united states by a suit against persons holding under the authority of the united states.citation.although the state court might mould petitioner suit to try title into a suit for possession or might merely order to account for minerals removed,nevertheless such proceedings could not settle the basic issue in the litigation and might well cause confusion if they resulted in a judgment inconsistent with that subsequently rendered by the federal court.leiter,supra,at pp.further,since the position of the united states is essentially a defensive one,we think that it should be permitted to choose the forum in this case,even though the state litigation has the elements of an action characterized as quasi in rem.we therefore hold that the district court properly exercised its jurisdiction to entertain the suit in the federal court and to prevent the effectuation of state court proceedings that might conflict with the ultimate federal court judgment.id.at.
thus,the court in leiter did not approve the injunction on the ground the state court lacked jurisdiction of the controversy because the jurisdiction of the federal district court was exclusive.rather,it recognized that the issue of title to the mineral rights had to be decided in federal court,but seemed to concede that other issues,such as accounting for the minerals removed,would be within the jurisdiction of the state court.
the western states parties and aliet gass seem to argue that the united states is a necessary party to the litigation,because it involves an interest in real property owned by the united states,and exclusive jurisdiction of an action in which the united states is a party is in federal district court.federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction of actions to quiet title to real property in which the united states claims an interest,f.that jurisdiction applies,however,only when the united states interest in the property is in issue.for a court to exercise jurisdiction under the quiet title act id,the united states must claim an interest in the property at issue,and there must be a disputed title to real property.citation.robinson united states cir.although a dispute as to an interest in property,such as an easement,may be sufficient,there must be a dispute that actually challenges the federal government title.id.at.
an interest in mineral deposits under a lease from the united states is an interest in real property for purposes of the quiet title act.mafrige united states.however,where the interest of the united states is not being challenged,the united states need not be made a party to the litigation.in alaska consolidated oil fields rains cir rains,the plaintiff sued to foreclose a mechanics lien for work done in connection with the drilling of oil wells.the defendants appealed the judgment against them,asserting the land on which the work was done was operated by them under oil and gas prospecting permits issued under the mla because the property was owned by the united states,the defendants questioned whether they held a sufficient interest in real property to subject them to the mechanics liens alleged.the court stated 
it is clear that the decree of foreclosure would not be binding in any way upon the united states,and that the only interest which could be sold under the decree would be the interest of the appellants in and to the land in question.it would be necessary in order that the rights of the permittee be transferred to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale that the purchaser secure the consent of the secretary of the interior to the assignment.citation.if the appellants have such an interest in the land as may properly be subjected to a decree of foreclosure for mechanics liens for labor done upon the property,they can not be heard to complain of the fact that a purchaser at a foreclosure sale would not thereby secure title to the permit,in the absence of the consent of the secretary of the interior and the acceptance by him of the purchaser as the permittee under the original permit.so far as the interest of
