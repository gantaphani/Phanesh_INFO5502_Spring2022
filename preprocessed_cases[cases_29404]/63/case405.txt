the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission adopted extensive revisions to its financial forms and reporting rules for interstate natural gas pipelines.however,the commission declined to adopt petitioner request for additional and more detailed reporting requirements for gas for pipeline operations.petitioner,the american gas association aga a national trade association of gas utility the commission failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking,offering only conclusory and unsupported explanations.because the commission failed to respond to the reasonable concerns of a dissenting commissioner,we grant the petition for review.
pursuant to its authority to ensure j ust and reasonable rates,a,the commission has substantial discretion to prescribe rules and regulations concerning annual and other periodic or special reports,and to determine the manner and form in which such reports shall be made,id.a.ferc requires natural gas companies to file either ferc form form,annual report for major natural gas companies,or ferc form form,annual report for nonmajor natural gas companies,id.all natural gas companies also must file ferc form form,quarterly financial report of electric utilities,licensees and natural gas companies,id.
after determining a pipeline existing rate is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory,or preferential,ferc is authorized to change the pipeline rates,either upon its own motion or in response to a complaint.a.the commission relies on investigations and complaints under section of the natural gas act nga,to monitor pipeline rates,especially since the commission no longer reviews rates triennially,as it once did.see pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation under part of the commission regulations,and regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol,order,ferc stats.regs.preambles,order on reh g,order,ferc stats.regs.preambles,order on reh g,order,ferc order see also complaint procedures,order,ferc,wl,at noting c omplaints enable the commission to monitor activities in the marketplace and provide an early warning system for identifying potential problems.ferc or the complaining customer has the burden of showing the existing rate or practice is unjust or unreasonable and that the rate proposed is just and reasonable.see,transcon.gas pipe line ferc.both rely on pipeline data reported on forms,and as the basis for initiating section complaints and satisfying their burden of proof.see,e,pub.serv.comm of fuel gas supply,ferc at panhandle complainants sw gas storage,ferc at.if the commission or the complainant succeeds,ferc can order a new just and reasonable rate to replace the existing one.see a.
in february,the commission opened an inquiry to determine whether the annual and quarterly financial forms provide d sufficient information to the public to permit an evaluation of the filers jurisdictional rates,and whether these forms should otherwise be modified to improve their usefulness.assessment of information requirements for ferc financial forms,ferc,wl,at.seven months later,the commission proposed rules amending the financial reporting requirements of natural gas companies.see revisions to forms,statements,and reporting requirements for natural gas.proposed,to be codified at.pts,nopr.the stated purpose of the proposed amendments was to provide pipeline customers,state commissions,and the public the information they need to assess the justness and reasonableness of pipeline rates.id.at.noting the decline in section filings since the elimination of triennial rate review,the commission affirmed its reliance on section complaints and concluded a section complainant must have access to the information needed to meet the burden of proof.id.at.specifically,the commission determined the data on forms,and must be sufficient to support a complaint.id.
pipelines consume fuel when they operate equipment that transports gas through pipelines and in and out of storage facilities,but they also incur a certain amount of gas through leakage and meter errors.years ago,ferc required interstate pipelines to unbundle the transportation and sales components of their services and separately state the rates and charges for the services they provide.see order.in the commission view,customers should only pay for the services they use.see panhandle eastern pipeline,ferc at.ferc generally allows pipelines to recover separately the cost of fuel used to provide various services by requiring customers to pay a fuel charge equal to a certain fuel retention percentage.
in an earlier proceeding ferc asked whether fuel cost recovery policies should be modified.see fuel retention practices of natural gas companies,ferc,wl.the commission found pipelines were retaining or carrying over enormous fuel costs million in beyond what was consumed,lost,or unaccounted for.see id.at.the commission,however,declined to take any immediate action,instead stating it would rely on section complaints from pipeline customers to monitor.fuel retention practices of natural gas companies,ferc,wl,at.
in the nopr here,the commission noted that with increased gas prices,the disposition of fuel has become an important component of pipelines cost of transportation.see nopr.at.the commission therefore proposed adding a new schedule to forms,and new pages and requiring pipelines to report detailed information regarding the acquisition and disposition of gas.id.at.the new schedule,the commission believed,would help users of the forms more readily determine whether pipelines are their revenue requirements.under the proposed rule,pipelines would be required to report the difference between the volume of gas received from shippers and the volume of gas consumed in pipeline operations each month the disposition of any excess gas and the accounting recognition given to such disposition,including the basis of valuing the gas and the specific accounts charged or credited and the source of gas used to meet any deficiency and the accounting recognition given to the gas used to meet the deficiency,including the accounting basis of the gas and the specific accounts charged or credited.id.in addition,in order to provide more clarity for gas purchase activity,the commission also proposed requiring pipelines,which had previously only been required to report volumes of gas purchases in the aggregate,to report the volumes applicable to each of their gas purchase expense accounts.id.
the commission also acknowledged that additional reporting might be necessary to protect pipeline customers from of discounted,negotiated,or recourse rates.see.id.at.although ferc permits pipelines to discount their generally applicable rates where competitive market conditions warrant,see c see also united distrib.ferc,and to negotiate individualized rates,see alternatives to traditional ratemaking for natural gas pipelines,ferc,ferc regulations restrict pipelines ability to charge a different fuel rate than the generally applicable one established in the tariff.with respect to discounted rates,pipelines can not discount the fuel use component unless they can demonstrate the relevant service does not use fuel.see,ozark gas transmission,llc,ferc,wl,at.moreover,under ferc negotiated rate policy,pipelines can not impose fuel costs on their existing,rate customers.see generally alternatives to traditional ratemaking for natural gas pipelines,ferc.instead,pipelines must bear the cost of any of their costs themselves.see dominion transmission,ferc.the commission therefore proposed adding a new schedule requiring pipelines to report the revenues and volumes applicable to discounted and negotiated rate services.see nopr.at.the requirement,the commission stated,would help customers identify the level of services provided under each rate schedule and thus protect them against.see id.
in its comments,petitioner agreed the proposed reporting revisions would help parties assess whether pipeline rate and fuel charges remained just and reasonable.see comments of the am.gas ass at,docket no.however,petitioner argued greater clarity regarding gas purchase and sale
