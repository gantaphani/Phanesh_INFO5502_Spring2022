the petitioners in this case are small municipalities to which we refer collectively as the municipalities that buy natural gas transportation services from the natural gas pipeline company of america natural.in,natural filed tariffs with the federal energy regulatory commission the commission proposing to change the way that it allocates capacity that becomes available on its pipeline.after several rounds of negotiations and comments,the commission issued orders approving natural new capacity allocation plan.the municipalities have filed a petition for review of those orders,challenging two aspects of the plan.although we are not unsympathetic to their concerns,we find that those concerns should be addressed during the commission next ratemaking proceeding regarding natural pipeline and were not relevant to the commission decision in this capacity allocation case.we therefore enforce the commission orders.
much of our decision in this case turns on the distinction between two types of proceedings before the commission.in a ratemaking proceeding,the commission sets the maximum and minimum rates that a pipeline can charge its customers,essentially by determining the total cost of operation,adding a fair profit for the pipeline company,and then deciding on a fair allocation of the total costs among the pipeline customers.the overriding policy concern in a ratemaking proceeding is to establish rates that require each customer to bear a fair and proportional share of the pipeline costs.this case,however,does not involve ratemaking.instead,this case involves the general terms and conditions under which natural,the procedure by which it allocates available capacity on its pipeline among its customers.as we shall see,the interests and policy goals at issue in such a proceeding differ markedly from those involved in a ratemaking case.
before we proceed to the specific disputes before us,a bit of background on the basic concepts at issue is in order.first,a few of the issues that commonly arise in ratemaking cases are relevant here.natural,like most other pipeline companies,sells the gas it transports to various types of customers,including industrial users,large intrastate gas companies,and the municipalities,which in turn provide residential and small business gas service in their areas.the municipalities are captive customers of natural pipeline because no other pipeline reaches their areas.many of natural other customers,however,have a choice between using natural and using competing suppliers.because the customers capacity needs vary widely and because some but not all of the customers are captive,determining each customer fair share of the pipeline fixed costs can be difficult.
since the,the commission has had a general policy of encouraging competition among natural gas pipelines.in furtherance of this general goal,the commission a decade ago undertook a rulemaking procedure that resulted in order,which is its latest major policy statement on how it will set rates for interstate pipelines.see order,ferc.pipelines generally offer two basic types of service.first,pipelines sell firm capacity,which represents a guarantee that a certain amount of gas will be available for the buyer.second,pipelines sell interruptible service,which allows customers to buy additional gas as long as capacity is actually available on the pipeline,but does not guarantee capacity availability.in order,the commission determined that pipelines should price their services based on rates,so that each customer would pay both a reservation charge based on the amount of firm capacity committed to the customer and a usage charge based on the actual amount of gas the customer consumed.the commission believed this structure would aid competition between pipelines,because it would reduce price distortions inherent in a rate based only on consumption.
when the commission issued order,however,it realized that switching from rates to rates could shift some costs from large industrial users to smaller users.in general,users such as the municipalities,which serve primarily residential customers,have a high seasonal variation between their peak demand and their average usage.because these users need a firm capacity commitment that will cover their peak demand,they often are not using their entire firm capacity.industrial users,on the other hand,tend to have fairly constant rates of usage,so that their average usage is much closer to their peak demand.in the industry,a customer average usage divided by its peak demand is called that customer load factor.a low load factor indicates a wide disparity between average and peak usage,while a high load factor indicates a fairly constant rate of usage.separating out reservation firm charges from usage charges will generally increase the total bill for customers with low load factors and decrease the total bill for customers.
in order to mitigate this effect on small,consumers,the commission in order allowed pipelines to continue using rates for these customers.these rates were calculated in a way that would incorporate both the customer portion of the pipeline fixed costs and the customer actual usage into a single rate that would be applied to the volume of gas the customer consumed.the rates were not intended to reflect the exact amount the small customers would have paid under the rates.rather,in calculating the rates,the pipelines and the commission imputed to the small customers a load factor higher than their actual load factors.the combined effect of these adjustments was to charge the small customers a smaller percentage of the pipeline fixed costs than they would have paid under the rate.the municipalities buy gas from natural under one of these special rates.
as we have noted,the ratemaking process results in a range of rates that a pipeline is allowed to charge.the important question in this case relates to the next stage of the process how the pipelines determine the rate they will charge to individual customers.the rate schedules the commission sets for a pipeline can vary according to geography,and most pipelines also have different rate schedules for different types of service or classes of customers.each of these rate schedules incorporates a set minimum and maximum rate.most pipelines are free to charge a customer any rate between the minimum and the maximum set for that customer area and class of service,with the qualification that pipelines may not unduly discriminate between similarly situated customers.see b.
despite the rule against unreasonable discrimination,pipelines are generally allowed to offer discount rates below the maximum rate but above the minimum to attract customers in competitive markets.see,c.the commission believes that allowing discount rates is good for in competitive markets,because it drives down prices,and that allowing discount rates is also good for all customers on a pipeline,even for those who are not in competitive markets,because discount rates can prevent the pipeline from losing business to other pipelines or to other types of energy.more business on the pipeline,the commission reasons,means each customer pays a smaller percentage of the pipeline fixed costs.for these reasons,the fact that one customer receives a discount to meet market competition while another customer,in a captive market,does not,is not necessarily considered undue discrimination between customers.see associated gas distrib.ferc.the commission discount policy is one of the key points of contention in this case.
with this background in mind,we turn to the function of the commission that is more directly relevant in this case the regulation of the process by which pipelines allocate their capacity.pipelines have contracts with many of their customers for firm capacity,and customers such as the municipalities generally have the right to renew their firm capacity contracts indefinitely.when firm capacity contracts expire and are not renewed or when the pipeline expands its capacity,the pipeline has new firm capacity to allocate among its customers.
until the,pipelines generally allocated available firm capacity on a,basis.more recently,however,the commission has turned to an auction system,under which pipelines are encouraged to auction available capacity in a way that limits their discretion while maximizing their total revenues.according to the commission,the new system fosters efficiency by ensuring that the customer willing to pay the most for the firm capacity within the allowable rates is the one who receives it.this approach also benefits all users of the pipeline,because it ensures that customers who are willing to take the largest chunks of available capacity receive that capacity.this reduces the system unused capacity,which in turn allows the pipeline to spread its fixed costs among a larger customer base.finally,awarding capacity to the highest bidder helps the other pipeline users,because if that bidder pays more toward fixed costs,the other users ultimately pay less.in this case,the commission approved this type of auction system for natural the municipalities challenge various aspects of that decision.
in,natural ran into trouble with the commission for unfairly awarding available firm capacity to an affiliated company at discounted prices.as a result,the commission required natural to develop a new system for allocating firm capacity that would leave the pipeline with less discretion,and thus less opportunity to engage in undue discrimination.when natural filed its new tariffs,it proposed,in keeping with the commission current policy,to switch to an auction method for allocating capacity.in auctioning capacity,natural planned to use a net present value method to award capacity to the bidder who would produce the greatest total revenue for the pipeline.the net present value method takes into account only the reservation charge the customer would pay,not the anticipated usage charges.the commission had approved this auction method for several other pipelines.
natural also proposed that it would establish a system of reserve prices and that it would not be required to accept any bids below the reserve prices.the reserve prices would,of course,fall between the maximum and minimum allowable prices under natural current rate schedule.natural believed that it needed to set different reserve prices in different regions,in different markets,and for different types of customers,because it needed to be able to take into account both differences in its costs of service and competition from other suppliers in setting the price at which it would sell to each customer.in most cases,the commission allows pipelines to set an unlimited number of reserve prices for different customers,as long as the pipeline can justify the distinctions it is making.natural case was different.because it had a history of undue discrimination,the commission wanted to impose more restraints on natural reserve prices.natural proposed a system under which it would use a to set different reserve prices for different markets that it identified,based on such factors as and market competition.
before the commission,the municipalities challenged natural proposal on a number of grounds they renew two of those challenges here.first,they argued that basing the auction solely on reservation charges discriminates against small customers like themselves who pay a rate,because their rate does not include a reservation charge.these customers would be forced to bid at a rate to compete with the other bidders.forcing them into a rate is wrong,they argued,because if small customers on natural system paid a rate,they would be shouldering a disproportionate percentage of the pipeline fixed costs and effectively subsidizing larger users.the municipalities sought an evidentiary hearing in which they hoped to prove that the rate on natural system accurately reflects their proportionate fixed costs.second,the municipalities challenged the reserve pricing proposal,arguing that it is unduly discriminatory for natural to take factors other than into account in setting its reserve prices.
the commission rejected both of the municipalities challenges and approved natural proposal with some modifications not relevant here.the commission approved the net present value auction system as consistent with its policy of awarding available capacity to the highest bidder.in so holding,the commission denied the municipalities re quest for an evidentiary hearing,noting that it had recently approved almost identical auction systems on other pipelines and that the evidence that the municipalities wanted to present was relevant only to ratemaking,not to capacity allocation.the commission also determined that natural proposed reserve pricing system struck a good balance between allowing natural the flexibility to meet market competition and preventing natural from unduly discriminating in favor of its affiliates.
after the commission issued its final orders,the municipalities filed this appeal.since the time the appeal was filed,natural has further modified its reserve price system,with the commission approval.the system the commission originally approved turned out to be unworkable,and so the commission permitted natural to change to a system under which it may set an unlimited number of different reserve prices for different customers,but it must set and disclose the reserve prices before the bidding opens.natural current auction system still bases bids only on reservation charges,and natural still has the ability to set different reserve prices on bids from customers whose is identical.
our review of the commission orders in this case is deferential.congress has entrusted the regulation of the natural gas industry to the informed judgment of the commission,and therefore a presumption of validity attaches to each exercise of the commission expertise.northern indiana pub.serv.ferc,cir nipsco.our review of the commission orders is therefore narrow and circumscribed and is limited to assuring that the decision is reasoned,principled,and based upon substantial record evidence.id.in conducting this limited review,we will consider whether the commission abused or exceeded its authority,whether each essential element of the commission order is supported by substantial evidence,and whether the commission has given reasoned consideration to each of the pertinent factors in balancing the needs of the industry with the relevant public interests.peoples gas light coke ferc,cir.we find that the orders the municipalities challenge satisfy these standards.
we begin our inquiry by considering the municipalities argument that a bidding system based only on reservation charges impermissibly discriminates against small customers who pay rates.recall that under the bidding system the commission approved in this case,natural customers compete for capacity on the pipeline on the basis of the net present value of their bids,and that net present value is determined with reference only to the reservation charges that the customer would pay on the capacity it seeks.because a rate has no specified reservation charge,a bid based on a rate would result in a net present value of zero,and the small customer would always lose out to a larger customer bidding based on a rate which includes a reservation charge.the municipalities might be able to win new capacity based on their rates if there were no other bidders,but otherwise the municipalities could only compete by agreeing to pay rates for the new capacity.
the commission concedes that small customers would not be able to compete at their rates under the net present value bidding system,but argues that the system is consistent with the commission policy of using auctions to increase pipeline efficiency.in its orders in this case,the commission noted that the rate is a form of subsidy from the large users to the small users,in that the small users pay less under the rate than they would under the rate.the commission went on to hold that,while there may be policy reasons supporting the use of the rate for the municipalities current capacity,there is no policy reason the commission should allow the municipalities to grow at their subsidized rates,at the expense of larger customers who are willing to p
