on september,a natural gas transmission pipeline owned and operated by pacific gas electric company pg e ruptured in san bruno,california.the ensuing explosion and fire killed eight people,injured dozens more,and caused widespread damage to property.fearing a recurrence,the city and county of san francisco san francisco filed suit against the secretary of transportation secretary and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration the agency,alleging that the agency failed to comply with the natural gas pipeline safety act of,et pipeline safety act.
under the pipeline safety act,the agency promulgates minimum federal safety standards for natural gas pipelines and pipeline facilities.the california public utility commission cpuc has assumed jurisdiction to regulate and enforce the pipeline safety act requirements as to intrastate pipelines within california.san francisco alleges that the agency violated the pipeline safety act when it approved the cpuc certification that its regulatory activities meet the minimum federal standards set by the agency,and when it disbursed funding to the cpuc to support monitoring and enforcement of intrastate pipelines in california.
the issue in this case is whether san francisco claims may proceed,either under the administrative procedure act apa or under the pipeline safety act citizen suit provision.we conclude that they may not.
the soil beneath our feet is crisscrossed with natural gas pipelines.there are million miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines throughout the united states,including natural gas pipelines in california.we rely on these pipelines to supply our critical energy needs,but they also pose public safety risks.pipelines transport highly flammable,often highly pressurized,natural gas to urban areas through many aging pipelines originally designed for use in lower population density regions.
although interstate pipelines have been subject to federal regulation since,states retained exclusive jurisdiction over regulation of pipelines wholly within their borders until.in that year,congress enacted the pipeline safety act,which empowered the secretary to promulgate minimum federal safety standards for all natural gas pipelines and facilities.since its creation in,the agency has administered the pipeline safety act pursuant to delegation by the secretary.
intrastate pipeline regulation remains distinct from that of interstate pipelines.although states may not directly regulate or impose additional or more stringent safety standards on interstate pipelines,c,the pipeline safety act provides a strong role for state involvement in intrastate pipeline regulation.if a state certifies that it has adopted the minimum federal safety standards and is enforcing those standards,the state assumes exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over most intrastate pipelines within its borders.see id.a b.a state that has done so may choose to impose additional or more stringent requirements on intrastate pipelines so long as they continue to meet the minimum federal safety standards established by the agency.id.c.
unlike similar statutes that require more active federal intervention,such as the clean air act,the cooperative federalism scheme established by the pipeline safety act contains only two short subsections describing the secretary authority to monitor state safety programs and reject a certification.they are contained at the end of,which lays out the process for states assuming jurisdiction over intrastate pipelines 
e monitoring.the secretary may monitor a safety program established under this section to ensure that the program complies with the certification.a state authority shall cooperate with the secretary under this subsection.
f rejections of certification.if after receiving a certification the secretary decides the state authority is not enforcing satisfactorily compliance with applicable safety standards prescribed under this chapter,the secretary may reject the certification,assert united states government jurisdiction,or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement.the secretary shall give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking final action under this subsection.when notice is given,the burden of proof is on the authority to demonstrate that it is enforcing satisfactorily compliance with the prescribed standards.
the pipeline safety act also provides for federal funding to states that assume jurisdiction under up to of the costs reasonably required to carry out the safety program.id.a.the secretary authority to provide funding is restricted to cases where the state ensures the secretary that it will provide the remaining costs of a safety program.id.b.
in addition,the agency may withhold any part of a payment when it decides that the authority is not carrying out satisfactorily a safety program.id.the agency determines the percentage up to the allowable ceiling of of funding it will provide to states by combining two equally weighted metrics a score assigned to that state annual progress report which must be submitted after certification and a score resulting from an annual program evaluation undertaken by the agency.b.these scores reflect an assessment of the state policies and procedures,its inspection practices and capacity,overall enforcement activity,and other indicia of program performance.id.c.
california has participated in this cooperative federalism scheme for decades.the cpuc has assumed responsibility for regulating and enforcing a pipeline safety program for intrastate pipelines and pipeline facilities pursuant to certification under the pipeline safety act.see cal.pub.b.in,the cpuc received funding from the agency as a result of the aggregate scoring system.
this litigation arose in response to the disastrous natural gas pipeline failure and resulting explosion in san bruno,a fatal explosion in in rancho cordova,and a accident in cupertino that caused significant property damage.pg e owned and operated all three pipelines involved in the incidents.the national transportation and safety board ntsb determined the probable cause of the san bruno explosion to be inadequate quality assurance and quality control in when the pipeline was relocated and an inadequate pipeline integrity management program.transp.safety,pacific gas and electric company natural gas transmission popeline rupture and fire,san bruno,california,at xii,available at.the ntsb report also cited regulatory provisions exempting the ruptured pipeline from pressure testing requirements,the cpuc failure to detect pg e inadequate safety program,and pg e flawed emergency response procedures and delay as contributory factors.id.ntsb chairman,joined by two other members,wrote a concurrence observing that pg e exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight and that regulators placed a blind trust in the companies that they were charged with overseeing to the detriment of public safety.id.at.
citing the substantial and unnecessary risk posed to its citizens lives and property by allegedly inadequate monitoring and regulation,san francisco sued the agency and the united states department of transportation.invoking the pipeline safety act citizen suit provision,san francisco sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the agency to comply with its duties under the pipeline safety act.
after holding that san francisco met constitutional standing requirements to bring a claim,the district court dismissed the suit with leave to amend because the claim was not cognizable under the pipeline safety act citizen suit provision.the court explained that while would authorize a suit against government entities to the extent they engage in activities regulated by the pipeline safety act such as constructing or operating pipelines it is not an appropriate vehicle for seeking mandamus relief regarding defendants performance of their regulatory obligations.
san francisco amended its complaint to include claims under the apa,arguing that the agency approval of the cpuc certification was arbitrary and capricious in violation of a and also constituted a failure to act under.the district court dismissed the amended complaint for failing to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.b and.b.the court reasoned that san francisco failure to act claim was in essence a challenge to the sufficiency of the agency action,not a genuine inaction claim.the court then characterized san francisco a claim as coextensive and dismissed it as well.

the district court properly concluded that the pipeline safety act citizen suit provision does not allow actions against the agency in its capacity as regulator.
when examining the scope of a private right of action under a federal statute,we employ the usual tools of statutory construction,looking first at the plain words of the statute,particularly to the provisions made therein for enforcement and relief.middlesex cnty.sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n.w hen deciding whether the language is plain,we must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.king.burwell.quoting fda brown williamson tobacco.in addition,we examine the legislative history,the statutory structure,and other traditional aids of statutory interpretation in order to ascertain congressional intent.middlesex,at.as part of statutory analysis,w e also look to similar provisions within the statute as a whole and the language of related or similar statutes to aid in interpretation.united states lkav,cir.
the pipeline safety act,by its plain language,allows only a very limited private right of action.it permits injunctive citizen suits against the united states or other entities for a violation of this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter.a.in other words,private citizen suits are authorized for substantive statutory or regulatory violations.by its terms,the provision does not authorize a action to compel the agency to perform regulatory duties.
the statutory structure supports the conclusion.indeed,mandamus actions are authorized as part of the pipeline safety act whistleblower protection provisions.c.the inclusion of such a remedy in another portion of the statute indicates that congress was aware of the remedy and how to create it.the fact that congress chose not to include a remedy in its citizen suit provision is significant.w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,alteration in original.
the pipeline safety act legislative history buttresses the conclusion that congress did not intend to create a citizen suit mandamus remedy,emphasizing that the citizen suit provision would not supplant the secretary efforts for enforcement and compliance,but was designed to assist the department in its enforcement and compliance activities,at.san francisco points to a floor statement by a single legislator tangentially suggesting the possibility of actions to enforce federal regulations.see cong.rec.statement of brown.however,as the agency points out,there were no similar statements from other lawmakers or any further discussion of the possibility of actions,which suggests that the cited statement was merely a single outlying statement that must not be dispositive.see dynamics land,cline,see also chrysler brown,the remarks of a single legislator,even the sponsor,are not controlling in analyzing legislative history.
examination of the statutory language of similar statutes also bolsters the conclusion that the pipeline safety act does not authorize mandamus actions against the agency.of significance here is the statutory language of citizen suit provisions in similar statutes enacted during the same time period as the pipeline safety act.those statutes tend to include two separate citizen suit provisions one that provides for suits alleging a violation of a statute substantive provisions,and one that authorizes suits against the agency head for failing to perform a nondiscretionary duty.see,g b c endangered species act a clean air act.the latter type of provision,which specifically provides for mandamus relief,is conspicuously absent from the pipeline safety act.
the supreme court has interpreted a very similar citizen suit provision in the endangered species act esa as not authorizing suits against an agency alleging improper implementation of a statute.in bennett spear,the court held that the term violation does not include the secretary failure to perform his duties as administrator of the esa.the district court in this case relied heavily on bennett in holding that the pipeline safety act citizen suit provision,like the provision at stake in bennett,only provides for suits against the government in its capacity as a regulated party.
san francisco attempts to distinguish bennett by pointing out that,unlike under the esa,the federal government is not subject to the pipeline safety act substantive requirements.see a,a.furthermore,it argues,bennett reflects the court need to harmonize two citizen suit provisions.see at explaining that allowing suits under g a for any violation of the esa would render g c a nullity.
however,bennett itself approached the question by looking to the statute as a whole.at.doing so here,the arguments in support of the district court application of bennett to the pipeline safety act outweigh those against it.all three reasons cited by the bennett court support the district court conclusion 
first,san francisco argument that the provision authorizing mandamus relief in the pipeline safety act whistleblower protection section,c,need not be harmonized with the citizen suit provision,id.a,is not persuasive.while the proximity of the two citizen suit provisions in the esa may have reinforced the need to read them in complementary fashion,the mere fact that the mandamus provision in the pipeline safety act is eight sections removed from the general citizen suit provision does not mean that they need not be read together as part of a comprehensive statutory scheme.the inclusion of c indicates that congress was well aware of its ability to specifically authorize mandamus suits against the secretary.
second,the use of violation in a also supports the district court conclusion.elsewhere in the pipeline safety act,violation consistently and exclusively refers to substantive violations by regulated parties.like the esa,the pipeline safety act provides for substantial civil and criminal penalties for such violations.see,a providing for civil penalties up to per violation of the pipeline safety act id.a providing for criminal liability for knowing and willful violations of the pipeline safety act a authorizing substantial civil penalties for violations of the esa id.b creating criminal liability for violations of the esa id.e authorizing warrantless arrests for violations of the esa.as in the context of the esa,a violation of the pipeline safety act is most unlikely to refer to failure by the secretary or other federal officers and employees to perform their duties in administering the pipeline safety act.see bennett,at.san francisco argues that while the esa penalty provisions apply to any violation,the pipeline safety act penalty provisions specify violations that could only be committed by a regulated party,and thus there is no risk of the implausible result of the secretary being arrested for failure to perform her statutory duties.however,there is no reason to believe that congress used violation to mean a much broader set of actions in a than it did in those other provisions.
third,san francisco permissive reading of a would abrogate the apa final agency action requirement to the same degree that the plaintiffs interpretation of the esa would have in bennett.see at.any procedural default,even one that had not yet resulted in a final disposition of the matter
