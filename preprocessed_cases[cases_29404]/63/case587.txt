in this case we construe the meaning of certain notice provisions of a commonly used oil and gas operating agreement.working interest owner elmagene dorsett sued valence operating company in a dispute arising from a joint operating agreement.the trial court granted partial summary judgment against dorsett on her breach of contract claims,finding that dorsett failed to consent to participate in the wells at issue,and that a contractual penalty for that failure was enforceable against her.the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor of dorsett,holding that valence breached contract provisions that required valence to give notice to dorsett before commencing drilling operations.the determinative issue before us is whether the agreement requires a notice period to expire before the operator can commence work on the proposed operations.because the penalty is enforceable and because we find nothing in the agreement prohibiting valence from commencing work on the proposed operations before the expiration of the notice period,we reverse the court of appeals and render judgment in favor of valence.
