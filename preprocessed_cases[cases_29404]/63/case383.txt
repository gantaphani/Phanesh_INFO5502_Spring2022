on rehearing en banc 
the issue before the en banc court is straightforward does the statute of limitations provided by a govern mineral management service mms orders directing oil and gas lessees to pay additional royalties on production procured prior to september,we hold it does.
background 
in december,the mms issued an order directing oxy usa,oxy to pay additional royalties of,plus interest,for oil production from federal onshore and offshore leases in california for the period january oxy brought suit seeking,inter alia,a declaration the government claims were under a.the district court granted oxy summary judgment based on statements from phillips petroleum lujan,cir phillips iii,indicating that a does,indeed,bar belated mms orders the government appealed.a divided panel of this court reversed,holding the remarks in phillips iii concerning the applicability of a are dicta,and a is inapplicable because the mms orders oxy challenges are not actions under that provision.oxy usa,babbitt,cir.
we granted petition for rehearing in consolidated appeals,including shell oil babbitt.as a result of settlement,we subsequently dismissed the shell oil cases by order dated march.by that same order,we agreed to treat the briefs filed in the shell oil cases as amicus briefs in this,the remaining appeal,oxy usa babbitt,
a provides in pertinent part 
subject to the provisions of section of this title,and except as otherwise provided by congress,every action for money damages brought by the united states or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact,shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings required by contract or by law,whichever is later 
emphasis added.the government argues a limits the time within which the mms may commence a judicial action,a lawsuit to recover royalties,but not administrative collection proceedings and even if we determine the mms order to pay constitutes an action under a,it is not an action founded on contract,does not seek money damages,and is encompassed by the otherwise provided by congress exception 
reviewing this matter de novo we conclude the statutory language,together with a forthright statutory scheme and purpose,clearly instruct that the statute of limitation under a applies to the mms orders in this case.
every action 
we decipher what constitutes every action affected by a by considering the language and structure of the statute as a whole.see medlock ortho biotech,cir.citing dole united steelworkers of america,d,cert.denied,d.although we are instructed to strictly construe any statute of limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the government,see badaracco commissioner of internal revenue,d,we are not authorized to contort the language or structure of a statute of limitations in order to reach a result favorable to the government.
the phrase every action is patently broad,and is expressly limited in scope only by reference to the possibility of a specific exception otherwise provided by congress.a.congress subsequent reference to the filing of a complaint within six years can not fairly be read to limit this broad language to formalized judicial proceedings in light of the statute obvious purpose to level the playing field between the government and private litigants by forcing the government to promptly assert its claims and a reading of the entire text of,including subsections f and i,which evidence congress desire to deal with agency actions as well as judicial actions.
the express purpose of a was to establish a general statute of limitations on contract claims asserted by the government or a government agency.congress believed the imposition of a limitations period on government claims would compel government agencies to assert their claims promptly,thereby putting the government in a position more nearly equal to that of private litigants.see,at,reprinted in see also united states hanover ins,phillips iii,at the legislative history in support of a indicates congress was motivated in part by notions of fairness and equity in government dealings with private litigants,and further motivated to reduce the costs of record keeping and encourage prompt agency actions on claims.in the words of the federal circuit,
t he clear purpose of congress in passing section was to promote fairness to parties defending against stale government contract and tort claims notwithstanding whatever prejudice might accrue thereby to the government as a result of the negligence of its officers.
jobs for progress,united states,footnote omitted.an interpretation of permitting federal agencies to avoid the limitation period by utilizing administrative orders to collect monies owed under contract obviously would thwart this purpose.an interpretation of encompassing such administrative orders within the phrase every action obviously serves this purpose.see griffin oceanic contractors,d giving preference to a reasonable alternative interpretation consistent with legislative purpose over an interpretation that would produce absurd results.
the structure of as a whole further advocates a broad interpretation of the phrase every action.to elaborate,subsection f includes two narrowly drafted exceptions to the,permitting the government to defensively assert claims by way of offset or counter claim.f.section i,added in,expressly exempts administrative offsets from the limitations period set forth in a.i see also,at,reprinted in,explaining that i allows collection of delinquent debts owed the government by administrative offset beyond the statute of limitations.we agree with the federal circuit that these provisions demonstrate congress intended for a to encompass more than the filing of a complaint in court.see hanover ins,at administrative offset is not a judicial action.thus,congress has considered and dealt not only with judicial actions in section,but with agency actions as well.more important,if congress did not intend a to apply to administrative proceedings,then i arguably is superfluous.we must avoid,whenever possible,a statutory interpretation that would render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.freytag commissioner of internal revenue,d quotation marks and citation omitted.
in sum,the language,purpose and structure of manifest congress clear intent to impose a limitations period on administrative as well as judicial claims for unpaid royalties.congress gave no indication agencies are free to assert their claims at any time by means other than court actions,unencumbered by the limitation period.as judge brown so aptly noted in his dissent to the panel opinion,excluding administrative collection proceedings from the definition of action leads to irrational results and permits government agencies to evade the statute of limitations through procedural gimmickry.oxy usa,at.we are confident congress did not intend to be the means to this irrational end.the mms order to pay royalties is an action under a.
founded on contract 
we summarily reject the government argument that actions to collect royalties under federal oil and gas leases are not based on contract.we have that oil and gas leases are contracts.phillips iii,at citing reese exploration,williams natural gas,cir.the government itself has long recognized that the obligation of private entities to pay oil and gas royalties to the federal government derives from the execution of a valid federal lease.see appellant opening brief,statement of facts,at all federal and indian mineral leases provide for the payment of royalties.memorandum,time for commencing actions to collect royalties,rents,or other payments,from frederick ferguson,ass t solicitor,division of minerals,to chief,conservation division,geological survey at may,royalties are collected by the geological survey pursuant to leases in all cases,the rights of the government as lessor and the rights of the lessee are embodied in a lease.a lease is a contract,and failure of the lessee to pay rent or royalties when due gives the lessor an immediate right to sue for breach.the usual remedy for breach of contract is money damages.the fact that the secretary of the interior administers federal oil and gas leases through the mms,applying applicable royalty assessment valuation and collection regulations promulgated in accordance with the federal oil and gas royalty management act,et,and other mineral leasing statutes,simply does not change the contractual underpinnings of the relationship or the legal source of the royalty payment obligation mms seeks to enforce.moreover,the issue and facts in this case are easily distinguished from those addressed in the cases the government cites in support of its argument that the payment of royalties is founded primarily on statutes and regulations.see katz cisneros,answering threshold jurisdictional and sovereign immunity questions,the court concluded that owner suing to compel the department of housing and urban development to calculate housing assistance payments contract rent in accordance with federal housing regulations sought judicial interpretation of a federal regulation,not declaratory relief in the performance of a contract transohio sav.bank director,office of thrift supervision,characterizing savings and loan association suit challenging the office of thrift supervision minimum capital requirements as an action for injunctive and declaratory relief,not money damages,and recognizing t he answer to the sovereign immunity and jurisdiction questions depends not simply on whether a case involves contract issues,but on whether,despite the presence of a contract,plaintiffs claims stem from a statute or the constitution.accordingly,we hold the mms royalty collection action is founded on contract.
money damages 
according to the mms,quoting an unpublished decision from the fifth circuit,orders directing lessees to pay royalties seek monies due under a contract with the government.such contractual obligations can not be considered compensatory,and are therefore not barred by the limitations period of.apt.br.at quoting phillips petroleum johnson,wl,unpublished disposition phillips iv.we disagree with this narrow construction of the phrase money damages as used in 
we first note the apparent incongruity of the government argument the royalties they seek by way of an administrative are not founded on contract,and its use here of unpublished fifth circuit authority referring specifically to royalties as monies due under a contract and contractual obligations.phillips iv,wl at.in any event,however,the fifth circuit rationale,based on its reading of bowen massachusetts,d,is neither binding nor persuasive.
the supreme court in bowen concluded that the phrase relief other than money damages,as used to waive sovereign immunity under the administrative procedure act,encompassed suits for the enforcement of statutory mandates,notwithstanding that the mandate happens to be one for the payment of money.at determining that an action against the government seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from an order disallowing medicaid reimbursement was not an action for money damages under.this is not an action to enforce a statutory mandate.for the reasons stated above,it is an action on contract to enforce royalty payment obligations under a federal oil and gas lease.an award of damages is the common form of relief for breach of contract.allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,at ed memorandum,time for commencing actions to collect royalties,rents,or other payments,from frederick ferguson,ass t solicitor,division of minerals,to chief,conservation division,geological survey at may,a lease is a contract,and failure of the lessee to pay rent or royalties when due gives the lessor an immediate right to sue for breach.the usual remedy for breach of contract is money damages.moreover,the mms claims against oxy to collect royalties are substantively indistinguishable from other government claims to recover money owed under contracts governed by the limitations period in.see,united states sackett,cir action to recover on defaulted small business administration loans hanover,at custom duties owed under surety contract united states alvarado,cir claim for damages on a promissory note.we therefore hold the mms order at issue constitutes an action for money damages under.
except as otherwise provided 
having established that the mms efforts to collect royalties are,indeed,actions founded on contract for money damages,we shift our focus to whether,as the government suggests,such actions fall within the except otherwise provided by congress exception to by virtue of the mineral leasing statutes and the federal oil and gas royalty management act.the government argument on this point is difficult to distinguish from its argument that its administrative orders to pay royalties are based on statutes and regulations,not on contract.the government apparently believes that because congress has enacted specific statutes governing oil and gas royalty assessment and collection,it never intended the general,statute of limitations in to apply to mms orders.we disagree.
to the extent the federal oil and gas royalty management act provides a specific statute of limitations that expressly supersedes the general statute of limitations at,that limitations period seven years applies only to oil and gas production occurring after september.see notes to.furthermore,if congress believed the federal oil and gas royalty management act and its regulatory regime otherwise superseded,it would not have needed to amend that act to include a specific statute of limitations in.see infra note a,at,noting multiple conflicting statutes of limitation for suits to collect royalty payments and conflicting court decisions led to the enactment of the limitations period cong.rec.daily ed,statement of nickles noting that differing court applications of the limitations period applicable to royalty collections had created a climate of deep uncertainty in the payment of royalties.when congress included in the language except as otherwise provided by congress,it addressed the specific concern that not affect existing statutes of limitations,reprinted in.prior to the federal oil and gas royalty management act amendments,there was no existing statute of limitations pertaining specifically to mms royalty payment orders.the government attempt to seek refuge in the except as otherwise provided exception fails.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth,we conclude the mms demand that oxy usa,pay royalties going back to constitutes an action for money damages,founded on contract,and barred by a.we therefore affirm the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of oxy usa,and,in accordance with cir,vacate the panel decision,oxy usa,babbitt,cir.
because i conclude the orders issued by the minerals management service mms are not barred by a or the federal oil and gas royalty management act fogrma,et,i respectfully dissent.
as noted by the majority,a provides in relevant part 
subject to the provisions of section of this title,and except as otherwise provided by congress,every action for money damages brought by the united states or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact,shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings required by contract or by law,whichever is later.
our review of a is circumscribed by several principles of statutory construction.first and foremost,we must give effect to the plain language of the statute.see,mclaughlin richland shoe,d.second,s tatutes of limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the government,must receive a strict construction in favor of the government.badaracco comm r of internal revenue,d accord united states ward,cir interpreting a united states hess,cir interpreting b.a lthough we should not construe such a provision unduly restrictively,we must be careful not to interpret it in a manner that would extend the waiver beyond
