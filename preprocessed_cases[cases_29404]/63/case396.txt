although set against the complicated regulatory framework of federal energy law,at the end of the day,this petition for review of federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders requires only our straightforward application of the plain terms of a written contract.the question is whether ferc arbitrarily or capriciously read a contract to allow a pipeline to change its rates without first obtaining ferc approval.because the contract expressly excludes such a role for ferc,we deny the petition.
intervenor alliance pipeline operates an pipeline that transports natural gas from the north border to the chicago area.alliance pipeline,preliminary determination on issues,ferc,at hereinafter preliminary determination.before alliance began service on the pipeline,each shipper chose to negotiate the rate it would pay and committed that agreement to a written contract.any shipper could have chosen a different option,a recourse rate,based only on the pipeline cost of providing service and a profit margin.
that the shipper in this case,predecessor in interest to petitioner,iberdrola renewables,selected a negotiated rate is a critical fact that has bearing upon the central issue of this petition whether ferc must approve changes alliance made to the negotiated rate.in the exercise of its duty under section of the natural gas act nga to ensure that rates are just and reasonable,a,the commission automatically reviews proposed changes to recourse rates but reviews changes to negotiated rates only when the contract requires it see alternatives to traditional ratemaking for natural gas pipelines,ferc,at hereinafter policy statement.this approach reflects ferc assumption that sophisticated parties will bargain for rates that are just and reasonable.see id.at.so long as the pipeline adjusts the negotiated rate consistently with the terms of the written agreement,ferc will accept the rate change without reviewing the adjustment for reasonableness.see id.at.shippers choosing negotiated rates thus can agree to avoid ferc review under section and thereby remove themselves from any protection the commission may give customers under recourse rates.gulf transmission,ferc,at.in effect,the shippers can bargain away the protection of ferc prior approval of rate changes in exchange for what they see as more favorable rates.
of course,negotiated rate customers are not left without redress if they think the rate has become unjust over time.they can always challenge an established rate under section of the nga on the ground that the rate is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory,or preferential.a.a section review differs from a section review in two significant ways.first,section provides for ferc review of a rate only after it has taken effect.by contrast,ferc may only review a rate under section at the time it is filed.see sea robin pipeline ferc,discussing the salient differences between nga section and section.second,the pipeline bears the burden to show the proposed rate is reasonable in a section action,whereas the shipper bears the burden to show an established rate is not in a section case.thus,shippers seeking to involve ferc in the review of their rates have three options ex ante,they can elect a recourse rate,which ferc will automatically review at the time it is filed,or negotiate for ferc approval of rate changes in their contract ex post,they can pursue a section action after the negotiated rate has taken effect.
this petition requires the court to determine whether the negotiated contract between alliance and its shippers calls for ferc approval of a rate change,and the history of the contract bears upon our analysis.the earliest form of the agreement was executed while the pipeline application was pending for the certificate of public convenience and necessity that would allow it to operate.in this preliminary contract,called the precedent agreement,the parties agreed to a negotiated rate in lieu of a recourse rate.the agreement provided that c hanges in alliance operating costs will be reflected in its rates from time to time.open season precedent agreement,sched,at.no language in the precedent agreement called for ferc approval of changes to the negotiated rate.
even so,the proposed tariff alliance filed with its certificate application suggested that alliance would need ferc approval for any changes to the negotiated rate based on changes in its operating costs the negotiated rates are determined using actual operating and maintenance costs approved by the ferc from time to time.certificate application,pro forma sheet emphasis added.ferc directed alliance to remove that language from its tariff,explaining that such a provision belongs more appropriately in the parties transportation agreement,which they would sign after ferc issued alliance its certificate.preliminary determination,ferc at.thus,if the parties wished,they could provide for ferc review of negotiated rate changes in their contract.see id.otherwise,prior approval from ferc would not be forthcoming.after ferc awarded alliance its certificate,the parties executed the transportation agreement,replacing the precedent agreement.alliance and its shippers included no language in that contract providing for ferc review of negotiated rate changes.rather,the transportation agreement simply repeated the language previously agreed to changes in alliance operating costs will be reflected in its rates from time to time.transportation agreement,app.
since pipeline service began in,alliance has charged the negotiated rate,which it has periodically ferc prior reflect changes in its operating costs.from to,these annual increases averaged.each year the recourse rate was higher than the negotiated rate,until late when alliance sought to increase the negotiated rate by about.for the first time,the negotiated rate exceeded the recourse rate.and for the first time,ppm energy,iberdrola predecessor in interest,asked ferc to reject the filing on the grounds that alliance proposed rate increase failed to satisfy both the requirements under the negotiated rate agreements and ferc basic requirements for such filings.petitioner br.at.
ferc denied ppm request,concluding that the transportation agreement,as did the precedent agreement before it,allowed alliance to change the negotiated rates to keep pace with increases in operating costs without prior review from ferc.see alliance pipeline,ferc,at.the commission reminded ppm that ferc had specifically stated in its certificate order that it would not review the level of alliance negotiated rates nor the method by which they were calculated.id.ppm requested rehearing,arguing that despite what was put into the written agreement both parties understood that alliance could only change the rate if ferc first approved the new operating costs.see alliance pipeline,ferc,at hereinafter rehearing order.denying rehearing,ferc explained that negotiated rate customers are entitled to what they bargained for and no more.id.at.the transportation agreement did not entitle ppm to ferc review of the proposed rate increase before it took effect,though ppm could still challenge the rate under section.see id.
after succeeding to ppm rights under the transportation agreement,iberdrola filed a timely petition for review in this court,which we have jurisdiction to consider under b.see fuel gas supply ferc.
iberdrola argues that the parties intended that ferc would review alliance rate changes under section at the time they are filed.ferc and alliance argue that iberdrola predecessor in interest bargained away such review in the transportation agreement when it chose a negotiated rate over the recourse rate and made no provision for ferc review.absent such an agreement,ferc would only review the rate in a section challenge,which iberdrola has not made.in the orders on review,ferc found that the parties had agreed that ferc would not review alliance rate changes,and we must decide whether that interpretation was arbitrary or capricious under the administrative procedure act.see a old dominion,ferc.we begin by consider ing de novo whether the contract unambiguously addresses the matter at issu
