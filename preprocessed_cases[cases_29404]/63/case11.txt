a pipeline owner bangor gas company,llc bangor and a natural gas supplier energy services hqus entered into a contract for the transportation of hqus natural gas.the parties later became embroiled in a dispute and submitted their dispute to binding arbitration.after the arbitrators issued a decision largely favorable to hqus,bangor sought to vacate the decision in the district court,failed,and has now brought this appeal.
hqus,a wholly owned american subsidiary of the canadian utility hydro quebec,sells natural gas and electricity in the united states.bangor provides services related to the natural gas industry in maine.in,bangor entered into an agreement with hqus the agreement to build and operate a bangor pipeline,later named the bucksport pipeline,to deliver hqus natural gas from an international pipeline nine miles away called the maritimes pipeline,owned and operated by maritimes northeast pipeline,llc maritimes,to the bucksport energy facility an energy plant that served a paper mill.
the contract provided that hqus gas would be delivered over the bucksport pipeline for fifteen years for a fixed annual charge of,paid by hqus in monthly installments.however,bangor did not connect the origin end of the bucksport pipeline directly to the existing maritimes pipeline instead,bangor contracted to have maritimes build a foot lateral pipeline the lateral that connected the maritimes pipeline to the bucksport pipeline and agreed that bangor would pay maritimes for the lateral use pursuant to a tariff filed by maritimes with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.
bangor expert later explained that this was done for technical reasons relating to proximity to electric power lines.nonetheless,the lateral was not mentioned in the agreement,and the agreement language may suggest that the parties to it contemplated that the bucksport pipeline would directly connect to the maritimes pipeline.it was apparently not until,six years after the bucksport pipeline opened,that hqus learned of the lateral and that the bucksport pipeline did not connect directly to the maritimes pipeline.
during this period,hqus paid the agreed upon rate to bangor bangor in turn compensated maritimes for the use of the short lateral pipeline of whose existence hqus was ignorant.this harmonious state of affairs began to dissolve when bangor was itself acquired by a parent company which apparently concluded that bangor compensation of maritimes might be in violation of rules or policies of the ferc,the federal agency which now regulates much of the traffic in natural gas in the united states.
under a ferc edict known as the rule,a shipper of natural gas must hold title to the gas it is shipping.the rule is not a codified regulation but was announced by ferc in an adjudication of a specific dispute the aim of the rule is to prevent big natural gas distributors from buying up pipeline capacity that they do not need for shipment of their own gas and leveraging their market power by selling the capacity to third parties at excessive prices.
bangor concluded that,as the party who controlled the capacity of the lateral by virtue of its lease,it would be deemed under ferc nomenclature the shipper of gas traveling over the lateral.and,as hqus owned gas traveling through the lateral,bangor might be deemed in violation of the rule.bangor consulted with ferc with the result that,in,ferc found that bangor had violated the rule with respect to the lateral as well as another pipeline,and approved a consent agreement by which bangor paid a million fine.bangor gas,llc,ferc.
beginning in,bangor sought to comply with the rule by entering into capacity releases with hqus in which hqus would replace bangor as the party who held capacity rights in the lateral,and thus as the shipper on the lateral.in the earliest of these capacity releases hqus did not pay the costs of using the lateral but hqus began paying those costs in august after bangor threatened to place its capacity rights on the lateral up for competitive bidding.whether hqus should pay became one of the two main issues in the ensuing dispute between the two companies.
the other dispute involved the costs for heater fuel to heat the gas at two points at the connection between the lateral and the start of bucksport pipeline,and at the end of the bucksport pipeline as the gas enters the energy plant.the latter satisfied a contractual obligation of bangor to deliver the gas at or above.the agreement was silent on who was to pay for heating.bangor had been paying for the heater fuel since the inception of the agreement,but in bangor asserted that hqus should pay those costs.
the agreement provided that irreconcilable disputes would be submitted to binding arbitration,and bangor initiated arbitration on december.each party selected one arbitrator,and those two arbitrators chose a third arbitrator all three were experienced in the energy industry,and one was a former ferc commissioner.bangor sought to have hqus pay both the lateral costs and the heater fuel costs.hqus denied responsibility and counterclaimed for a reimbursement of payments it had made for the lateral since 
the arbitration panel reviewed briefs,written testimony and documents submitted by the parties,and held a hearing.on september,the panel issued a written award that was largely favorable to hqus,deciding that bangor was responsible for paying maritimes for use of the lateral.as to heater costs,the arbitrators placed the future cost burden for heating at the delivery end upon hqus but declined to order it to pay for past heating.
on the lateral costs issue,the arbitrators noted that the agreement contemplated that the bucksport pipeline would connect to the maritimes pipeline,which meant that the parties thought that hqus was purchasing for its original monthly payment transportation of gas all the way from the maritimes pipeline to the energy plant.the panel inferred from bangor internal documents that the contract rate in bangor bid to hqus already accounted for the cost of transporting gas on the feet that comprised the lateral and the cost of the junction point meter installed by maritimes.thus,forcing hqus to pay maritimes in addition to paying bangor would unjustly require hqus to pay twice for the transportation and meter.
the panel acknowledged that the rule posed difficulties but the panel adopted a solution bangor would continue to release its capacity on the lateral to hqus,and hqus would pay maritimes for use of the lateral,but bangor would reimburse hqus for the lateral costs in the form of a comparably reduced rate for use of the bucksport pipeline.in addition,the panel ordered bangor to reimburse hqus for costs that hqus under threat had already paid to maritimes.
on the heater fuel issue,the panel decided that hqus should pay for the fuel for the heater at the site of the energy plant,later making clear that bangor would pay for heating at the origin end.the panel stated that under standard industry practice,the customer ordinarily paid for the heater fuel required to meet a need and it viewed this to be the basis for the heating at the delivery point.
the panel decided to make the award as to the heater fuel prospective and not retroactive,citing a number of equitable factors that the issue is a close question that is not directly addressed in the agreement that bangor history of paying for the fuel led hqus to legitimately expect continued payment and that documenting and calculating past heater fuel costs would be difficult and contentious.hqus ultimately accepted this disposition of the heating cost issue bangor did not.
after the award,both sides sought clarification.pertinently,bangor expressed concern that the panel capacity release and reimbursement solution could still violate ferc regulations,and that bangor could end up paying further large penalties.bangor asked the panel to stay the award until it received a response to a letter bangor had sent to ferc staff seeking assurance against a ferc enforcement action.the panel denied the request,stating that it was not at all likely that ferc would find the arrangement illegal.however,the panel 
direct ed that hqus promptly provide to bangor written confirmation that it will return any reimbursement amounts it receives from bangor,and will repay any capacity release payment amounts it credits against payments otherwise due under the service agreement,to the extent necessary to comply with any finding by the ferc that the reimbursement and crediting arrangements are not consistent with ferc policy.
hqus subsequently provided bangor with the written commitment.
on november,ferc general counsel and director of the office of enforcement denied bangor request that ferc staff issue a no action letter promising that enforcement actions would not be brought against bangor for implementing the panel reimbursement remedy.instead,the staff expressed its view that t he panel remedy would violate the commission posting and bidding regulations,which state that a capacity release must be posted for competitive bidding,unless it is done at the maximum applicable rate under the pipeline tariff filed with ferc.c e,h.
although bangor release of capacity on the lateral to hqus in terms required hqus to pay the maximum rate,the ferc staff stated that the reduced bucksport pipeline charges accepted by bangor amounted to a discount on the lateral payments that triggered the competitive bidding requirements.the staff noted that this response only expresses staff position on enforcement action and does not express any legal conclusions on the questions presented,and that it is not binding on the commission.in a subsequent letter to hqus,the same ferc staff reiterated that its previous letter was not binding,stating that if hq energy or bangor wants a definitive answer from the commission,it may file for a declaratory order,as the commission speaks through its orders.
on november,bangor gas filed a motion with the district court under the federal arbitration act faa,to vacate in part and confirm in part the arbitration award.the request to vacate aimed at the panel imposition of lateral costs on bangor and at the panel refusal to require repayment by hqus of past heater costs incurred by bangor.bangor also argued that the ferc staff letter triggered hqus commitment to refund past lateral reimbursements to bangor.ultimately,the district court denied bangor motion and granted hqus motion to confirm the award.
we review the district court decision de novo,but our review of the arbitration award itself is extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential.bull hn info,hutson,cir quoting wheelabrator envirotech operating servs.laborers dist.council local,cir.the faa embodies a national policy favoring arbitration,buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d,and provides only a narrow set of statutory grounds for a federal court to vacate an award 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
in addition,this court in the past recognized a common law ground for vacating arbitration awards that are in manifest disregard of the law,mccarthy citigroup global mkts,cir quoting wonderland greyhound park,autotote,cir,while limiting this notion primarily to cases where the award conflicts with the plain language of the contract or where the arbitrator recognized the applicable law,but ignored it.gupta cisco,cir.
the doctrine has been thrown into doubt by hall street associates,mattel,d,where the supreme court h e ld that provide s the faa exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur.id.at.emphasis added.this has caused a circuit split with this court saying albeit in dicta that manifest disregard of the law is not a valid ground for vacating or modifying an arbitral award in cases brought under the federal arbitration act,ramos santiago united parcel,cir.
even if the doctrine were assumed to survive and were applied in this case,the award neither conflicts with the plain language of the agreement nor did the arbitrators recognize the applicable law but ignore it.the panel resolved what is at best an argument about how a contract of questionable meaning should be read and harmonized with a ferc doctrine on leasing capacity.under settled precedent,an faa award can not be overturned based on mere disagreement by the court with the panel on a debatable issue,advest,mccarthy,cir and in this instance the panel decision is in our view entirely reasonable.
the lateral issue.bangor argues that the panel decision to make bangor pay for the lateral costs was in manifest disregard of the law on two grounds that the panel ruling contravenes the clear language of the agreement by making bangor responsible for maritimes charges for the lateral use,and that the panel remedy results in a violation of ferc regulations and by extension,a principle of maine contract law that disfavors the enforcement of illegal contracts.both claims are that the panel ignored the law,but in two quite different ways.
the first claim,resting on interpretation of the agreement,is hopeless.the better reading of the agreement is that hqus ongoing monthly payments to bangor already compensate bangor for moving the gas from maritimes main line to hqus customer indeed,bangor seemingly calculated the monthly charge on that assumption.in commissioning the lateral,bangor chose to hand off part of its obligation to maritimes,and is now trying to make hqus shoulder the cost a second time over.nothing in the agreement mentions the lateral,let alone obliges hqus to pay separately for its use.
admittedly,the agreement requires bangor to start paying at the point of receipt,which is defined as the meter that is located at the origin end of the lateral but it was bangor own undisclosed choice to make the connection with maritimes and thus to locate the junction meter at a point feet away from where hqus reasonably expected it to be.the agreement,by contrast,contemplated a pipeline between the maritimes and northeast pipeline and the energy plant.bangor claim based on the agreement is plainly wrong.
more difficult is bangor argument that the panel remedy of capacity releases and reimbursements places bangor in violation of ferc requirements.there is,it should be stressed,no basis for claiming the agreement itself violated the ferc governing statute or its pertinent rules or regulations had bangor built its bucksport pipeline to run from maritimes main line as was contemplated,no lateral line would have been required.bangor difficulties with ferc ensued afterwards and from bangor unilateral action in commissioning the lateral.
but ferc rules and regulations are,so far as they are valid,in the nature of sovereign commands representing a public purpose and we will assume arguendo but with some confidence that an arbitration award would be vulnerable to the extent that it directed one or both of the parties clearly to violate a such a mandate.yet there is nothing about ferc actual intentions,ample reason to think a reasonable agency would stay its hand,and fair precautions adopted by the panel if ferc acts otherwise.
here,the panel considered ferc rules and regulations and structured its award in a way that it believe d would be fully consistent with ferc policy.in its initial decision,the panel sought to accommodate the rule by having bangor release its capacity to hqus,which would thereby become the shipper as well as the owner of the gas.thus,as a formal matter,hqus would become responsible to pay maritimes for the capacity,albeit compensated by a reduced charge on the bucksport pipeline,the monthly payment for which already covered the transportation of gas from maritimes main pipeline onward 
true enough,the ferc staff thereafter said that the release of capacity by bangor without competitive bidding could be
