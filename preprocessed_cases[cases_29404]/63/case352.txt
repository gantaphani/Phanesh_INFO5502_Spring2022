northern natural gas company northern is a natural gas company that operates an underground gas storage field known as the cunningham storage field in kansas.nash oil gas,nash owns and operates natural gas wells,some of which are located approximately four miles north of the cunningham storage field.based on northern belief that its storage gas has migrated to nash gas wells and nash is producing that gas,northern commenced this action,asserting claims of conversion and unjust enrichment and a statutory claim under.stat.ann.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nash on the claims,holding they were barred by the statute of limitations or,in the alternative,collateral estoppel.the court dismissed the statutory claim under.b.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
in,northern began injecting natural gas into a substratum known as the viola formation in the cunningham storage field.by,however,studies undertaken by northern indicated that the injected storage gas was migrating vertically from the viola formation to a deeper formation called the simpson formation.subsequent studies from to further indicated that the storage gas was migrating horizontally northward toward wells operated by nash.northern itself concedes in its complaint that a s a result of these studies,northern became concerned that gas had migrated through a geological pathway in the viola formation north of the storage facility towards wells operated by nash.
in january,northern was negotiating for the purchase of nash wells and mineral leases.as part of the negotiations,counsel for northern sent nash a letter requesting a variety of information concerning the wells.the letter also stated that northern would not pay nash based upon the ability of your wells to produce storage gas,but that northern may be willing to consider the value of your wells as observation wells as some sort of offset to the value of the storage gas previously produced.
counsel for nash replied with a letter stating that nash had specific reservations about producing the information regarding the nash wells to northern at that time.in the letter,counsel also asked about northern statement concerning nash alleged production of storage gas 
your letter also indicates that northern would not be interested in paying anything to nash oil gas based upon the ability of their wells to produce storage gas,but you might be willing to consider paying for the wells as observation wells.does,in fact,northern have credible information available to it to suggest that nash oil gas,wells are producing storage gas 
in response,counsel for northern stated in a february letter that samples taken from nash wells preliminarily indicated that the gas being produced by the wells resembled storage gas much more than native gas.
in march,counsel for northern sent another letter to nash.the letter explained that northern continued to investigate whether the gas produced by nash wells was storage gas,but that the investigation was ongoing and may not be complete until additional tests could be undertaken.the letter also requested that nash sign an agreement that purported to toll the statute of limitations for any claims the companies might have against each other.despite the threat of imminent litigation if nash did not agree to the tolling provision,nash declined to sign the proposed agreement.
the same year,northern hired michael begland,a petroleum engineer,to construct a model.reservoir simulation is used to predict the flow of gas through porous media.in,the model was finished,and based on its data as well as data from,northern concluded that several billion cubic feet of storage gas had migrated from the cunningham storage field and was being produced by nash.
on september,northern filed the complaint in this case.in it,northern alleges that gas has migrated northward from the cunningham storage facility and is being produced at the nash wells.northern brings claims for conversion and unjust enrichment and a statutory claim under.stat.ann.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nash on the claims based on the statute of limitations or,in the alternative,collateral estoppel based on the jury answers to special interrogatories in a similar action northern had previously litigated against another defendant.the district court dismissed the claim under pursuant to.b northern appeals as to all claims.

conversion and unjust enrichment 
in kansas,the statute of limitations for conversion is two years.stat.ann.a.under the discovery rule,a cause of action for conversion accrues when the fact of injury becomes reasonably ascertainable to the injured party.id.b see also dreiling davis,d,describing b as the discovery rule clark jewelers satterthwaite,d,a cause of action in tort for conversion or for the recovery of personal property accrues when substantial injury first appears or when it becomes reasonably ascertainable.
the statute of limitations for unjust enrichment is three years.stat.ann.lightcap mobil oil.although the parties assume in their briefing that the discovery rule similarly applies to a claim for unjust enrichment,they do not cite and this court has not located any authority to support this proposition.nevertheless,because northern claim for unjust enrichment is untimely even under the discovery rule,we need not decide the issue and assume for purposes of this appeal that both the claim for conversion and the claim for unjust enrichment accrued when northern injury became reasonably ascertainable.
the phrase reasonably ascertainable means that a plaintiff has the obligation to reasonably investigate available sources that contain the facts of the injury and its wrongful causation.kelley barnett,d,quotations omitted.moreover,reasonably ascertainable does not mean actual knowledge.davidson denning.in this case,the district court determined that based on the and correspondence between northern and nash,northern could reasonably ascertain at that time that nash was producing northern storage gas.we agree.at that point,northern suggested that nash was producing storage gas,stated that samples from nash wells supported northern position that the produced gas was storage gas,and urged nash to agree to toll the statute of limitations so that northern could continue its investigation.although northern may not have known to a certainty that the gas was storage gas,it is clear that such fact was capable of being known to northern at that time.thus,northern injury was reasonably ascertainable by at the latest,and the claims for conversion and unjust enrichment,which were filed in,are untimely.
northern contends that even if its injury was reasonably ascertainable by,its claims are not because nash acts the production of storage gas constitute a continuing tort entitling northern to recover damages for each act occurring during the two or period immediately preceding this lawsuit.in our judgment,the kansas supreme court would not recognize the exception to the statute of limitations for these claims.see stuart.interstate gas,cir when no decision of a state highest court has addressed an issue of that state law,the federal court confronted with that issue must predict how the state highest court would rule.quotations and alteration omitted.
it is true that kansas has recognized a form of the continuing tort or continuing wrong theory in nuisance cases based on flooding.the kansas supreme court has explained 
there are cases in which the original act is considered as a continuing act,and daily giving rise to a new cause of action.where one creates a nuisance,and permits it to remain,so long as it remains it is treated as
