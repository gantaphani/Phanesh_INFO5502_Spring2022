this case arises from a dispute regarding the validity of oil and gas leases entered into by the alabama and coushatta indian tribes of texas the tribe,comstock oil and gas company,and corporation collectively the oil companies.the tribal council members contend that the district court prematurely ruled on the existence and jurisdiction of the tribal court and thereby erroneously prevented the oil companies from exhausting their remedies in the tribal court.the tribal council members also argue that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the oil companies claims and that the court erred in ruling that the tribal council members were not entitled to sovereign immunity.the oil companies allege that the district court erred in concluding that the tribe was,however,entitled to sovereign immunity and by consequently dismissing their claims against the tribe.for the reasons assigned herein,we affirm the district court in part,reverse in part,and remand.
factual and procedural background 
the tribe is federally recognized under the alabama and coushatta indian tribes of texas restoration act.see.as such,it controls lands set aside and held in trust for it as a reservation.a,a.between and,the tribe signed nine oil and gas exploration leases with the oil companies granting the right to explore and produce hydrocarbons.two of the leases were negotiated and executed by the bureau of indian affairs bia pursuant to the indian mineral development act of.see.the state of texas executed the remaining seven leases before the effective date of the alabama and coushatta indian tribes of texas restoration act,and the bia approved them.
on october,the tribe and seven tribal council members filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas,lufkin division,against the oil companies.alleging that certain oil and gas leases were void because the secretary of the interior had not approved them,the tribe and the tribal council members sought to cancel the leases.in addition,they claimed that the leases were void for deficiencies in production and that the oil companies had misappropriated natural gas liquids extracted from tribal lands.they sought damages in excess of,but dismissed the federal action on december.
on that same date,the tribe filed suit in a tribal court that was formed after the tribe initially filed suit in federal court.again,the tribe sought to have the leases declared null and void because of deficiencies in execution or production.in the alternative,the tribe claimed that the leases were void because they had not been approved by the secretary of the interior pursuant to.
on february,naming the tribe and tribal council members as defendants,the oil companies filed a motion for a declaratory judgment that the tribal court is nonexistent and that the disputed leases are in full effect.in response,the defendants moved to dismiss on three grounds.first,they claimed that the oil companies declaratory judgment action sought to adjudicate the same facts as the tribal court action.second,they asserted that sovereign immunity deprived the court of personal jurisdiction over the tribe and the tribal council members in their official capacities.finally,the tribe and tribal council members contended that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the oil companies failed to exhaust their tribal remedies.
the district court made the following conclusions.neither the tribe nor congress waived the tribe sovereign immunity.thus,with respect to the tribe,the court dismissed the oil companies motion for declaratory judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction.however,the court failed to extend the tribe sovereign immunity to the individual tribal council members and accordingly denied the motion seeking to dismiss them for lack of personal jurisdiction.in addition,the court determined that the tribal court was improperly constituted,that the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies was,therefore,inapplicable,and that the exhaustion doctrine did not bar the court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.the tribal council members now appeal these findings,and the oil companies the district court conclusion that the tribe was entitled to sovereign immunity.
discussion 
sovereign immunitya.tribal council members 
this court reviews de novo whether an official is entitled to sovereign immunity.beck.state bd.of dental exam rs,cir see also baker,chaske,cir stating that immunity of tribal officials is subject to de novo review.
the district court relied on ttea ysleta del sur pueblo,cir,in ruling that the tribal council members were not entitled to sovereign immunity against the oil companies declaratory judgment suit.but the tribal council members assert that this reliance was misplaced and attempt to distinguish not only ttea but also puyallup tribe,department of game of state of washington,d,and santa clara pueblo martinez,d.they argue that in each of those cases,the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendant tribal officials from carrying out or enforcing allegedly unconstitutional or illegal acts or from overstepping their jurisdictional mandate.in the present dispute,the tribal council members contend that they were acting lawfully on behalf of the tribe and,thus,derivatively enjoy the tribe sovereign immunity 
the tribal council members have merely presented an encore argument before this court.upon initially addressing this argument,the district court aptly expressed the error of the tribal council members position.comstock,d,recent authority within the fifth circuit,binding on this court,indicates the defendants position is in error.citing ttea ysleta del sur pueblo,cir.we agree with the district court.
the tribal council members have incorrectly characterized the import and applicability of ttea to the case at bar.it is binding authority on this dispute.therefore,the sundry cases that the tribal council members cite from other circuits to buttress their immunity claim,based on their allegedly having been acting within the scope of their authority,are unpersuasive and irrelevant.the district court correctly concluded that the tribal council members were not entitled to tribal sovereign immunity because,in the fifth circuit,tribal officials are not immune from suits for declaratory and injunctive relief.ttea,at reasoning that the distinct but similar concept of tribal sovereign immunity should not extend further than the doctrine of sovereign immunity,which encompasses the proposition that state sovereign immunity does not preclude declaratory or injunctive relief against state officials.thus,the district court did not err in concluding that the tribal council members are not entitled to sovereign immunity against the oil companies declaratory judgment action.
jurisdiction 
citing swint chambers county commission,d,the oil companies contend that the district court interlocutory order holding that the tribe is immune from suit is inextricably intertwined with the tribal council members appellate issues because they involve the same law and facts.because the oil companies sought declaratory judgment against the tribe and the tribal council members,they assert that ttea is relevant to the resolution of both parties inquiries.the oil companies argue that this court should,therefore,exercise its pendent jurisdiction to review their challenging the tribe sovereign immunity.
the tribe counters that the analysis of its immunity as a sovereign entity is separate from any determination of whether the tribal council members are entitled to immunity based on having acted within the scope of their authority.it additionally asserts that this case does not present rare and unique circumstances sufficient to invoke this court pendent jurisdiction.see gros city of grand prairie,cir pendent appellate jurisdiction should be exercised only in rare and unique circumstances.finally,the tribe contends that the oil companies are not in the interest of judicial economy and that this court lacks jurisdiction over them because a grant of sovereign immunity is capable of being fully and effectively reviewed upon final judgme
