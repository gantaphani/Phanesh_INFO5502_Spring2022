for the second time,petitioner missouri public service commission seeks review of initial rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for natural gas transportation by the kansas pipeline company.on the last occasion,we rejected as arbitrary and capricious the reasons ferc gave for approving the challenged rates.on remand,the commission reaffirmed the same rates,albeit emphasizing different rationales.we once again find ferc reasoning arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we vacate its orders and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the lengthy and complex procedural history of this case is explained in detail in the ferc orders under review,and in our previous opinion,missouri public service commission ferc,hereinafter missouri i.we provide only a brief summary here.
the natural gas act nga grants ferc jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.b see also a c.section of the nga bars the transportation or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of ferc,except under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the commission.c a.the section further gives the commission the power to attach to the certificate such reasonable terms and conditions as the public convenience and necessity may require.id.e.under that authority,ferc employs a public interest standard to determine the initial rates that a pipeline may charge for newly certificated service.see atlantic refining public serv.comm n,d.those initial rates offer a temporary mechanism to protect the public interest until the regular rate setting provisions of of the nga,come into play.algonquin gas transmission federal power comm n,see atlantic refining,at.at.section requires rates to be just and reasonable,rather than merely in the public interest as required by.see atlantic refining,at.at.
in,ferc determined that three affiliated and interconnected natural gas pipelines of the kansas pipeline company system kpc or kansas pipeline constituted a single interstate pipeline system subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga.kansok,wl.the commission ordered kpc to file an application for certification to operate the pipeline system and transport gas in interstate commerce.in,ferc approved kpc existing contractual rates the motion rates as the pipeline initial rates for service under nga,pending completion of a rate case under nga to determine just and reasonable rates.see kansas pipeline,wl hereinafter order.the missouri public service commission missouri psc a missouri agency with jurisdiction to regulate rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the state of missouri sought rehearing.ferc denied the rehearing request,reaffirming its approval of the existing rates.see kansas pipeline,wl hereinafter rehearing order.
in missouri i,we reviewed the order and rehearing order.counsel for ferc defended the orders approval of the existing rates on five grounds,arguing that approval of the existing rates ended the dispute over whether the pipeline was properly subject to ferc interstate jurisdiction the existing rates had been negotiated among the parties the existing rates had been approved by kpc prior state regulator the existing rates preserved kpc financial integrity and prevented kpc bankruptcy and the existing rates were lower than the rates ferc would otherwise have approved on rehearing the rehearing rates.see missouri i,at.we found that the second and third rationales that the existing rates had been negotiated by the parties and had been approved by kpc prior regulator could not sustain ferc determination because ferc had not actually relied on those grounds in its orders.id.at citing sec chenery.we further held that,although ferc had mentioned the first and fourth rationales that approval of the rates would end the jurisdictional dispute and would preserve kpc financial integrity,it had done so only in a passing reference that was not sufficient to satisfy the commission obligation to carry out reasoned and principled decisionmaking.id.
that left only the fifth rationale,which we regarded as the commission primary reason for approving the existing rates the argument that those rates were lower than the rates that ferc would otherwise have approved had it granted a rehearing.id.at.we rejected that rationale as well,finding that the commission had not even attempted to defend its computation of the rates it would otherwise have approved a fact that made it impossible for us to accept the use of those rates as a benchmark for comparing the existing rates.id.ruling that ferc ha d not adequately explained how the rationales,alone or together,satisfy the public interest standard of section,we remanded to the agency for further proceedings.id.we noted,however,that with proper support,some of the rationales found wanting in missouri i might serve as justifications for rates in an appropriate case.id.
on remand,the commission reaffirmed the rates that it had initially approved in its order.see kansas pipeline,wl hereinafter remand order.in so doing,ferc abandoned the primary justification it had offered in missouri i and turned to an array of other rationales.remand order,at.missouri psc sought rehearing,which ferc denied in.see kansas pipeline,at,wl hereinafter rehearing order.the rehearing order clarified the commission reasoning,listing three supporting rationales.according to the commission,approval of the existing rates preserved kpc financial integrity,by ensuring compliance with a condition of a major loan agreement was fair to kpc shippers because those rates had been negotiated by the shippers and approved under the prior state regulatory regime and would resolve the jurisdictional issue,because kpc had agreed to drop its challenge to ferc jurisdiction if the existing rates were adopted.see rehearing order,at.
missouri psc filed a timely petition for review,and enbridge pipelines,the successor to kpc,intervened in support of ferc decision.in the meantime,ferc has completed proceedings for the pipeline,and the rates which are substantially lower than the rates that ferc approved under have gone into effect.our decision in this case,therefore,will have no prospective effect it will determine only whether kpc customers were overcharged and whether ferc should consider a refund for the rates assessed during the interim period.
we review ferc orders under the arbitrary or capricious standard of the administrative procedure act,a.missouri i,at to satisfy that standard,there must be a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made by the commission.id.internal quotation marks omitted.ferc must articulate the critical facts upon which it relies,and when it finds it necessary to make predictions or extrapolations from the record,it must fully explain the assumptions it relied on to resolve unknowns and the public policies behind those assumptions.id.quoting columbia gas transmission ferc.similarly,when the commission balances competing interests in arriving at its decision,it must explain on the record the policies which guide it.id.quoting columbia gas,at.finally,the commission factual findings are conclusive if,but only if,they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.nga b,b.
there is no dispute that the public interest standard of nga is less exacting than the just and reasonable requirement of.see atlantic refining,at.at.but both the supreme court and this circuit have made clear that the commission has a duty to use its power to protect consumers.see id.t he inordinate delay in the processing of proceedings requires a most careful scrutiny and responsible reaction to initial price proposals of producers under.consumer fed of am.federal power comm n,declaring that preservation of the statutory scheme depends on diligent enforcement of the certification requirement as a holding operation on initial rates.indeed,the commission usual practice in section certificate proceedings is to apply,to the extent practicable,the same ratemaking policies that it applies in section rate cases in determining just and reasonable rates on a cost of service basis.remand order,at see maritimes northeast pipeline,at,wl.
ferc correctly noted that public interest factors may justify the commission departure from its usual approach to setting rates.remand order,at citing ferc pennzoil prods,d.the mere invocation of a factor,however,does not alleviate a reviewing court of its duty to assure itself that the commission has given reasoned consideration to each of the pertinent factors.farmers union cent,ferc,citing pennzoil,at.at.on the contrary,deviations from the commission customary approach,like departures from any agency usual policy,must be found not to be unreasonable and to be consistent with the commission responsibility.id.in short,ferc must specify the nature of the relevant factor and offer a reasoned explanation of how the factor justifies the resulting rates.id.
missouri psc contends,and ferc does not dispute,that in this case the commission did depart from its customary practice of basing rates on principles.see petitioner br.at remand order,at.the commission argues that it did so,however,because kpc pipeline presented unique circumstances unlike the pipelines in typical cases,the kansas pipeline was neither a newly constructed pipeline,nor an existing company operating under a tariff.rehearing order,at.according to ferc,the three rationales set forth in its rehearing order respond to these unique circumstances and justify its decision to grandfather kpc existing rates rather than adhere to its usual ratemaking principles.id.at.
we consider the first two of ferc rationales below.because we find them insufficient to sustain ferc orders,we have no reason to consider the third that approval of the existing rates would resolve the dispute over ferc jurisdiction.the commission made clear that it would not have approved the existing rates simply to resolve the jurisdictional issue,rehearing order,at,and as a consequence we may not affirm the agency orders on that basis,see sec chenery.
in its i orders,ferc primary rationale for concluding that the existing rates were in the public interest was that they preserved kpc financial integrity by ensuring compliance with a condition of a major loan agreement.the loan in question was a million loan obtained by kpc affiliate,syenergy pipeline company the syenergy loan.see remand order,at.the loan agreement contained a covenant requiring kpc to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio dscr of to see id.at.according to ferc,the approved rates were necessary to ensure kpc sufficient revenues to maintain the dscr with a reasonable margin of safety.id.at.
for the two reasons discussed below,we conclude that this was an arbitrary and capricious rationale for approving kpc existing rates under nga.
the commission first addressed the syenergy loan in,when it was considering kpc initial request for interim rates under.at that time,ferc flatly rejected kpc argument that it should approve rates sufficient to cover the debt service on the loan.ferc conclusion was set forth in harshly worded language,which we quote at length because of its importance to the present case 
first,we can find no nexus between the value of the facilities and the size of the syenergy primary loan w e can find nothing in the record to account for how the million was actually used.further,the main purpose of the loan was to allow syenergy to purchase percent of the pipeline interests of kansas pipeline partnership,kansok,and riverside.since syenergy and the other three ultimately are owned by the same entity,it would appear that this transaction is not at.in essence,the company borrowed million to purchase itself,at a price which it set,with no apparent nexus between the value of the facilities and the amount of the loan.the argument put forth now is that the rate base should be raised artificially,and rates set accordingly,so that the applicant can make payments on the primary loan.absent a nexus between the loan amount and the value of the facilities,and given the lack of negotiations due to the affiliate nature of those involved,we are not persuaded by the argument that,because of the kansas corporation commission accounting order,we are required by law to ensure that the rates are sufficient to sustain the loan provisions.
order,at emphasis added footnote omitted.the commission refusal to rest its approval of kpc rates on the rationale that they were necessary to satisfy the syenergy loan which had no nexus to the value of the facilities used to provide service to the ratepayers was completely consistent with ferc usual approach to ratesetting 
but after missouri i rejected the rationale upon which ferc did rest its order,ferc reversed course and adopted the syenergy loan dscr provision as the primary basis for its remand order.no new facts prompted the commission change of heart.to the contrary,in its request for rehearing,missouri psc submitted a spreadsheet prepared by kpc that demonstrated not just the absence of a nexus between the loan proceeds and the jurisdictional facilities,but that more than million of the proceeds was used to pay stockholder and partnership distributions,and that over million was wholly unaccounted for.see joint req.for reh g,attach.a at.nor did the commission suggest that its reversal was due to a reevaluation of any previously considered facts.although ferc acknowledged its earlier concerns it concluded that r egardless of the issues surrounding the underlying loan obligation,the loan was a legally binding obligation containing a condition which,if not met,would cause certain default.id.at.
the first part of this explanation,that the loan was a legally binding obligation,can hardly be sufficient.the point of ferc ratemaking policy is that pipeline expenditures that do not benefit a pipeline customers whether or not the expenditures are legally binding normally should not be the basis of the rates those customers pay.otherwise,a pipeline could embark upon a perfectly legal and economically prudent diversification program into businesses,and bill the pipeline customers for the cost of those investments.or,as here,a pipeline could borrow money in order to make cash distributions to its partners,and recover the cost of those payments from shippers and consumers.
nor was it sufficient that the dscr condition,if not met,would cause certain default,because mere default without subsequent action by the lender could well have no consequence.acknowledging this point,ferc further elaborated by stating in that situation the lender could foreclose on kansas pipeline pipeline facilities,since the kansas commission had approved the lender placement of a lien on those assets.kansas pipeline,therefore,could be forced into bankruptcy and potentially out of business.id.at emphasis added.but the number of qualifiers in this theoretical chain of events renders it a weak rationale for the imposition of the existing rates.when ferc finds it necessary to make predictions or extrapolations from the record,it must fully explain the assumptions it relied on to resolve unknowns and the public policies behind those assumptions.missouri i,at quoting columbia gas,at.it has not done so here.
the first link in the chain,ferc concern that default could lead to foreclosure,was unaccompanied by any suggestion that foreclosure was likely.to the contrary,the commission recognize d just as it did in rejecting reliance on the syenergy loan in that,since long term interest rates were in the percent range when the april order approved kansas pipeline motion rates,the percent loan secured by kansas pipeline facilities would not necessarily be recalled by the holder simply because kansas pipeline dscr dipped below the loan dscr default provision.remand order,at see order,at.although this interest rate differential was a strong reason for concluding that violation of the dscr alone likely would not lead to foreclosure,ferc dismissed the point with the statement that there was no assurance that financial market conditions would not change.remand order,at.but the truism that market conditions may change in the future does not give the commission a license to ignore the present at least n
