in december the federal energy regulatory commission established a formula for changes in the ensuing years price caps for interstate oil pipelines.see order concluding initial review of the oil pipeline pricing index,ferc order or order.to drive the annual change in the caps,it chose the producer price index for finished goods minus one percent.petitioner association of oil pipe lines challenges this as arbitrary and capricious,saying that the ferc staff report justifying continuing adherence to the index used statistical methods that deviated from ferc previous methodology without apparent justification,and that it also failed to account for special factors potentially altering the pattern of future changes.we find ferc responses to the association criticisms as to the special therefore remand for further proceedings.
in prior orders ferc adopted a price cap regime for oil pipelines.see revisions to oil pipeline regulations pursuant to the energy policy act of,order,stats.regs.cch order revisions to oil pipeline regulations pursuant to energy policy act of,order,stats.regs.cch order see also association of oil pipe lines ferc,aopl i.after fixing as a baseline the pipeline rates that congress deemed just and reasonable in the energy policy act of,stat,epact,reprinted in note,ferc determined to use an indexing scheme to make annual adjustments.
the index initially picked was.ferc said that it was making this choice because,when compared to various alternatives,seemed to most closely track historical changes in actual pipeline costs.order at.but ferc choice of was not for all time.order at.to ensure continuing fit between the index and actual changes in industry costs,ferc assured commentators that it would reexamine the index every five years.order at.
in ferc embarked on the first such reexamination.in its notice of inquiry it cited a staff study purporting to show that the changes in the index have closely approximated the changes in the reported cost data for the oil pipeline industry during the period covered by the review.notice of inquiry,review of oil pipeline pricing index,at reporting staff study results.ferc invited comments.the association responded,claiming that the staff study deviated from past methodology and was otherwise flawed.comments of the association of oil pipe lines,review of oil pipeline pricing index,docket no,aopl comments.it argued that the ferc staff had improperly measured cost changes,had erroneously failed to remove statistical outliers,and had inexplicably altered its method for calculating capital costs.and it said that the staff had failed to account for factors that would likely cause future cost changes to diverge from the historical trend.in fact,it said,ppi was a more appropriate index than.
the commission rejected the association arguments and issued the order now under review.see.
measurement of cost changes.the association first contention is that ferc used an improper methodology in pursuing its stated intention to measure actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry.order at order at see also order at.many methods are available.one possibility is to calculate the percentage cost change per for each individual firm and combine them in a simple average.another is to combine the firm costs in an average weighted by volume,so that minor firms do not skew the result.another is to take the median of the distribution.we will refer to these methods respectively as the unweighted average,the average,and the median.as we shall see,there are other candidates as well.
orders substantially cited and relied on a study that reported the results of all three of the methods described above,as well as a composite figure that combined the three.see test.of alfred kahn,revisions to oil pipeline regulations pursuant to the energy policy act of,docket no,at tbl.kahn study.the orders do not unambiguously show which figure held a dominant position in ferc reasoning.the change in the composite for each of the three periods considered was fairly close to.of the three types of averages making up the composite,the unweighted average was closest to the composite and thus to the figure ultimately selected 
in any event,we need not determine ferc precise method in because the current order uses none of these previous methods.instead of calculating cost changes by individual firm and then averaging them by any of the methods used before,the ferc staff report used what we may call a average.for each year in the period it took total costs for the entire industry,and divided it by the total number of shipped,yielding an annual average industry cost per.this produced an annual change,and the study found these annual changes to be a bit lower on average than the annual change in.notice of inquiry.tbl.
we call this method a average because it effectively weights each pipeline costs by that pipeline volume.in contrast,a average weights each firm cost change by the firm market share in either the previous year or the current year.as was shown by the pipelines expert witness,professor alfred kahn interestingly,the expert relied on by the shippers in the round,a average can yield odd results.one curiosity,for example,is that such an average will include the costs of new entrants,even though,not having been in the market,they will have experienced no change in cost at all.
more generally,changes in market share among participants can give an arguably distorted impression of cost changes.professor kahn offered the following example suppose in year,pipeline a costs are per,and its volume is.pipeline b costs are per,and its volume is.in year,b volume remains the same,but a volume decreases to.in addition,from year to year,both pipelines experience an increase in cost by,their respective costs per increase from to for pipeline a and from to for pipeline b.under a average,the average cost change is plainly.under a average,however,the calculated change in cost is only see kahn,five year review of oil pipeline pricing index,docket no,at kahn study.one can,of course,produce a more extreme hypothetical by adjusting the numbers,creating a scenario where all pipelines experience a uniform increase in costs but the average shows a decline.
ferc does not deny these peculiarities.instead,it makes several collateral arguments in support of its approach,all of which are unpersuasive.first it responds that the association claims of underestimation are simply the consequence of competition and the move by customers from providers to providers.order at arguing that the association results are simply the natural working of the market forces at play,and does not show any distortion resulting from staff methodology.continuing,ferc argues that the association approach would raise the price ceiling and thereby enable more pipelines to become or remain profitable.id.
the problem with ferc competition theory is that even if it were sound as a general matter and ferc makes no effort to vindicate it,it presumes that all pipelines in the industry are close substitutes for each other.but by all indications in the record,they are not.farmers union central exchange,ferc,agreeing with the justice department that competition in the oil pipeline industry must be evaluated in terms of discrete regional markets.indeed,if there were close competition between the pipelines,the reason for rate pipeline market be missing.see id.at it is of course elementary that market failure and the control of monopoly power are central rationales for the imposition of rate regulation.citing stephen breyer,regulation and its reform.
moreover,professor kahn offered by that the oil pipeline industry is divided between relatively crude oil pipelines per in and relatively product pipelines carrying refined products per.see kahn reply,review of oil pipeline pricing index,docket no,at.indeed,both professor kahn and the expert for the shippers,professor frederic scherer,refer to crude and product pipelines as separate markets.id.discussing how demand for crude pipelines has declined,whereas it has risen for product pipelines scherer,review of oil pipeline pricing index,docket no,at
