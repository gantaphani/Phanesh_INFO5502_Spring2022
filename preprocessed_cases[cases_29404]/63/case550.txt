after a bench trial,the superior court ruled an operator breached its obligations under an oil and gas operating agreement.the operator appeals,claiming that the breach of contract claim was barred by the statute of limitations in subdivision of section of the code of civil procedure and that lay testimony essential to the calculation of the amount of damages was based on hearsay evidence and was inadmissible.the operator asserts the breach of contract cause of action accrued when it rejected in writing the nonoperator interpretation of how to calculate its net revenue interest under the contract.
in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that the monthly payments and deliveries made to the nonoperator for its net revenue interest in oil and gas production were divisible from one another and,therefore,the claims relating to monthly performance occurring within four years of the time of filing the complaint were timely.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we hold that substantial evidence supports the trial court findings as to the amount of damages resulting from the breach of contract.accordingly,the judgment will be affirmed.

definitions 
because the terminology used in oil and gas cases is inexact and can vary in meaning depending on context,we begin by setting forth some basic definitions relevant to this case.caution should be used in applying these definitions in contexts beyond that presented here.see lynch state bd.of equalization d.discussing inexactness of terminology in oil and gas context and recognizing terminology is not totally definitive of the rights involved.
a working interest owner is the owner of an equity interest,and that interest is distinct from a royalty interest or a net profit interest.mcarthur,judging made too easy the judicial exaggeration of exculpatory and clauses in the oilfield operator fiduciary cases smu,fn.
working interest means the exclusive right to enter the land to explore,drill,and produce oil and gas from the land and to take title to the oil and gas produced.usually this bundle of ownership rights is created by an oil and gas lease that carves out and transfers the bundle from a larger bundle of ownership rights held by the lessor.in some contexts,working interest is synonymous with operating interest and operating rights,but in this case we will use the terms operating interest and operating rights to mean the rights held by the operator pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement entered into by the owners of the working interest.a working interest,unlike a royalty interest,is burdened with the cost of development and operation of the property.williams meyers,oil and gas law manual of oil gas terms,summarized from definitions of working interest,operating interest,operating rights and mineral interest.
royalty interest means a property interest created in oil and gas its owner is entitled to a share of production,if,as and when there is production,free of the costs of production.williams meyers,oil and gas law,supra.this interest can be held by the lessor under an oil and gas lease or can be created by another type of instrument.ibid.
operator in its broadest sense means a person engaged in the business of drilling wells for oil and gas.williams meyers,oil and gas law,supra.for purposes of an operating agreement,the operator holds the right to explore,drill,and produce oil and gas from the specified tract of land to the extent provided in,and subject to the restrictions of,the operating agreement.this collection of rights shall be referred to as the operating rights for purposes of this decision.
operating agreement means an agreement between or among interested parties for the testing and development of a tract of land.typically one of the parties is designated as the operator and the agreement contains detailed provisions concerning the drilling of a test well,the drilling of any additional wells which may be required,the sharing of expenses,and accounting methods.the authority of the operator,and restrictions thereon,are spelled out in detail in the typical agreement.williams meyers,oil and gas law,supra.
nonoperating working interest means the working interest,or a part of the working interest,from which any operating rights have been separated by the terms of an operating agreement.williams meyers,oil and gas law,supra.
net revenue interest may mean a variety of things.see williams meyers,oil and gas law,supra,enumerating four definitions.generally,it means t hat percent of the production revenue allocated to the working interest after first deducting proceeds allocated to royalty and overriding interest.the oil gas resource center,definitions as of.

form agreements in oil and gas industry 
respondent armstrong petroleum corporation armstrong and appellant oil gas company expressed a portion of their contractual relationship using preprinted form agreements common in the oil and gas industry in the united states.background information on those forms is set forth below.
the operating agreement between armstrong and was set forth on the version of the american association of petroleum landmen aapl form model form operating agreement form issued in.form has been used widely in the oil and gas industry since the first version was prepared in it often is called a joint operating agreement or simply joa.reeves thompson,the development of the model form operating agreement an interpretative accounting,see hart,recent developments in oklahoma oil and gas law,fn,and article cited therein form used extensively in domestic ventures for the drilling of gas and oil.
form is entered into by the owners of the working interest to coordinate the testing and development of a tract of land by designating an operator and specifying each working interest owner rights and obligations throughout the development and production process.pierce,the law of disproportionate gas sales tulsa,fn.generally,the party designated as the operator has full control of all operations subject to the terms of the operating agreement,and the nonoperators are investors in the project with a relatively inactive role.see mcarthur,coming of age initiating the oilfield into performance disclosure smu.
to accomplish its purpose of defining the rights and responsibilities of the owners of the working interest in a tract of land,the form is divided into separate articles and addresses topics that include the interests of the parties in the oil and gas,and in costs and production article iii the designation,responsibilities,rights and duties of the operator article v drilling and development article vi expenditures and liabilities of the parties article vii and the acquisition,maintenance or transfer of interests article viii.in addition,article ii allows the parties to further define their relationship by attaching other documents to the operating agreement as exhibits and incorporating them by reference.the exhibits may include information about the land and oil and gas interests subject to the agreement exhibit a,an accounting procedure form exhibit c,and a gas balancing agreement exhibit e.these exhibits are discussed below.
exhibit c to form,the copas accounting procedure form 
the council of petroleum accountants societies copas,a national organization since,has issued a succession of accounting forms which serve as the primary source of oil and gas accounting standards in the industry.the accounting procedure forms issued by copas are intended to be used as an exhibit to form.mcarthur,a program for copas to strengthen oil and gas accounting protections smu,fn.hereafter copas oil and gas accounting.a copas accounting procedure form issued in was used by the parties here.
generally,the copas accounting procedure form focuses on accounting for the costs of a project and does not govern revenue practices.copas oil and gas accounting,supra,smu.at.for example,the copas form does not include a calculation or disclosure of the overall net revenue interest instead,revenue matters are addressed,with varying degrees of specificity,in form and its other exhibits.copas oil and gas accounting,supra,at,urging revision of the copas form to disclose net revenue interest.
when disputes arise concerning costs,article of the copas accounting procedure provides that the operator invoices shall conclusively be presumed to be true and correct unless challenged within months of the calendar year in which they are rendered.the practical impact of enforcing this clause is that investors must usually challenge disputed charges sooner than otherwise required under the statute of limitations applicable to contractual disputes.see,subd.limitation period see generally exxon resources,cir addressing the enforceability of the presumption in article under mississippi law.
exhibit a to form 
under article of the form,
exhibit a shall include the following information description of lands subject to this agreement,restrictions,if any,as to depths,formations,or substances,parties to agreement with addresses and telephone numbers for notice purposes,percentages or fractional interests of parties to this agreement,burdens on production.italics added.
sometimes,the provision concerning information about burdens on production receives only token compliance,t he operator lists the leases and the burden on each,but does not calculate the overall net revenue percentage of the total mineral will be divided up among the investors.copas oil and gas accounting,supra,smu.at.
exhibit e to form,the gas balancing agreement 
and armstrong chose to include a gas balancing agreement as exhibit e to their operating agreement.unlike form and the copas accounting procedure contained in exhibit c to the form,this gas balancing agreement was not prepared on a preprinted,copyrighted form.
among other things,the gas balancing agreement provides that e ach party has the right to take its share of gas produced from the area covered by th e operating a greement and to sell its share of gas for itself in the oil and gas industry,this provision is referred to as a take in kind provision and it is included in operating agreements to avoid the tax consequences of being classified as an association taxable as a corporation citation.harrell samson resources.when the parties do take in kind,it is not uncommon for imbalances to occur.a gas balancing agreement attempts to set forth a method or methods for resolving the imbalance.see moon,assigning gas balancing rights in the absence of a gas balancing agreement energy pierce,the law of disproportionate gas sales,supra,tulsa.
facts and proceedings 
and armstrong are two oil and gas companies involved in a dispute over the size of armstrong net revenue interest in gas wells located on land designated as the webb tract.that tract is composed of mineral rights under leases in three separate tracts located in contra costa county,california.armstrong received the right to participate in the webb tract as part of a global settlement of a previous dispute between armstrong and.
contractual provisions 
the specific rights and obligations of armstrong and concerning the webb tract were set forth in an operating agreement dated october,webb tract joa.the webb tract joa was prepared using the version of form.pursuant to article ii of the webb tract joa,other documents and agreements were attached as exhibits and incorporated into the webb tract joa.the exhibits included exhibit a,exhibit c,the copas form titled accounting procedure joint operations for projects,and exhibit e,a gas balancing agreement.
under the webb tract joa,the working interest in all wells on the webb tract is owned percent by armstrong and percent by,before and after payout,and is designated as the operator and armstrong as a nonoperator.under article of the webb tract joa,the operator shall conduct and direct and have full control of all operations on the contract area as permitted and required by,and within the limits of this agreement.
article of the webb tract joa,which defines the working interest of the parties and their interests in costs and production,states that the parties shall also own all production of oil and gas from the contract area subject,however,to the payment of royalties and other burdens on production as described hereafter.with respect to other burdens,article provides that r egardless of which party has contributed any oil and gas lease or oil and gas interest on which royalty or other burdens may be payable and except as otherwise expressly provided in this agreement,each party shall pay or deliver,or cause to be paid or delivered,all burdens on its share of the production from the contract area up to,but not in excess of,
pursuant to the terms of article of the webb tract joa,the information set forth in exhibit a was to include burdens on production.despite this requirement,exhibit a to the webb tract joa does not specify or state the amount of any royalty,overriding royalty or other interest that burdens the oil and gas production from webb tract.although exhibit a lists the eight leases included in the webb tract,intentionally left the actual amount of burdens undefined 
to keep track of the gas imbalances that may occur under the webb tract joa,article ii of the gas balancing agreement provides that the operator under said operating agreement will establish and maintain currently a gas account to show the gas imbalance which exists between all parties and will furnish each of these parties a monthly statement showing the total quantity of gas produced,the amount used in lease operations,vented or lost,and the monthly and cumulative over and under account of each party.under section vi of the gas balancing agreement,an underproduced party may demand from any overproduced party a monetary settlement of any imbalance as to gas production when certain events occur,such as any time such imbalance exceeds months in duration.the overproduced party is required to pay the settlement amount within days after receipt of written demand.
production from the webb tract 
the parties stipulated webb tract well was drilled in late and began producing on january,webb tract well was drilled in early and began producing in september,and webb tract achieved payout on september.based on these underlying facts,the parties further stipulated that the working interest participation in production from the webb tract should be calculated using the before payout percentages from january,until and including september,and the after payout percentages for all production after september.
the parties also stipulated to the gross production in millions of btu from the webb tract for each month from january through february,inclusive.
after webb tract well began producing,sent armstrong a division of interest letter that stated view of what figure should be used as armstrong net revenue interest.by letter dated march,armstrong expressed disagreement with the net revenue interest calculated by because the calculation included burdens on production in favor of and consulting geologist,keith drummond.
responded in a letter dated march,and indicated that,because of the percent maximum burden referenced in article of the webb tract joa,armstrong net revenue interest would be calculated using percent the parties exchanged further correspondence,but did not resolve the disagreement regarding armstrong net revenue interest.
the monthly operating statement for march issued to armstrong on behalf of calculated armstrong share of the oil and gas sales based on a net revenue interest of percent.the subsequent monthly operating statements also calculated armstrong share of sales or production using a net revenue interest of percent.after,armstrong took control of marketing its share of the production.
on may,armstrong filed a complaint against,alleging a cause of action for breach of contract and a cause of action for declaratory relief.answered the complaint with a general denial and the assertion of affirmative defenses which included the allegation that armstrong complaint was time barred by the statute of limitations set forth in section,subdivision.
a bench trial was held on may.the trial court filed an amended statement of decision on october.because the webb tract joa does not specifically identify the burdens on production and because has not challenged the findings of fact of the trial court,we quote at length the portion of the trial court statement of decision that identifies those burdens 
during the negotiations of the global agreement by the parties armstrong asked that explain the nature of ownership of,or rights to,the mineral interests lying within the webb tract area,to disclose any documentation of agreements,assignments,related to those mineral interests,and for a lease schedule showing what landowner and overriding royalties which armstrong petroleum would be expected to pay by virtue of participation in the webb tract area.
responded and provided a lease schedule which showed various landowner and overriding royalty interests.armstrong objected to the inclusion of overriding royalty interests in favor of and sent a revised lease schedule which deleted the overriding royalties in favor of and its geologist,keith drummond.
in response,asserted that keith drummond the originating geologist is not a employee h owever,as agreed,armstrong will not bear any employee overriding royalty interest.
the parties signed the global agreement on october,under which,armstrong received a right to participate for of working interest under the webb tract operating agreement webb tract joa,subject to certain burdens on production.article ii of the webb tract joa provides that the burdens on production are set forth in exhibit a which lists only the leases included in the webb tract.no additional burdens on production were set forth in the webb tract joa.
the parties stipulated that the combined total burdens on production created by the leases total before payout,and after payout.the parties also stipulated at trial that,exclusive of any overriding royalty interest claimed to exist in favor of either,or its consulting geologist,keith drummond,additional overriding royalties totaling had been recorded against the webb tract leases.in addition,the parties stipulated that keith drummond previously had acquired a overriding royalty from sierra energy,a prior owner of several of the leases.
excluding the overriding royalty interests assessed in favor of and the overriding royalty assigned to drummond by the total burdens on production applicable in the webb tract are before payout,and after payout.using these totals,armstrong net revenue interest equates to before payout and after payout.
based on its determination of armstrong net revenue interest,the trial court awarded armstrong breach of contract damages in the amount of as well as prejudgment interest.after judgment was entered,armstrong sought and was granted an award of for attorney fees under an attorney fees provision contained in the global settlement by which armstrong received its interest in the webb tract.
discussion 
application of the statute of limitations to a breach of the webb tract joa 
in california,four years is prescribed as the period for the commencement of a n action upon any contract,obligation or liability founded upon an instrument in writing,subd.the parties agree that this statute of limitations applies to the breach of the webb tract joa,but dispute whether there was a single,accrual or multiple accruals for statute of limitations purposes.
argues that the webb tract joa was breached on march,and therefore the limitation period expired two months before armstrong filed its complaint on may.
armstrong argues the monthly payments or deliveries concerning production were a series of severable contractual obligations where the duty to make each payment or delivery arose independently of the others.based on this characterization of obligations,armstrong argues the statute of limitations began to run on each severable obligation at the time each payment or delivery was due.as a result,armstrong contends,damages from each underpayment or underdelivery occurring within the limitations period may be recovered even though some breaches occurred more than four years before the action was filed.
the trial court found that t he agreements in this case concern the production of oil and gas,over time,from a given property.under the webb tract joa,statements setting forth the nature of all charges and credits related to any given month production are due no later than the end of the month following the month i n which such production occurred.because the volume of production,the price,and the expenses are not predetermined,it is not possible to know,in advance,what amount is due.the trial court determined the continuing obligation to pay for actual production was like an installment and commenced the statute of limitations at the time the installment actually was due.as a result,the trial court held armstrong action,filed on may,was timely as to any production occurring after april,because the statement for that production was due on may.
in light of the contentions of the parties and the ruling of the trial court,the primary issue concerning the statute of limitations is whether or not the monthly payment or delivery obligations of under the webb tract joa are divisible from one another.in other words,is this a case where there was only one wrong and one accrual date,or a new,distinct wrong each month with its own accrual date 
standard of review 
the construction of a contract,unless it turns on disputed facts,is a question of law.parsons bristol development cal d.as such,it is subject to independent review on appeal.twedt franklin th,d.similarly,where,as here,the underlying facts are not in dispute,the question when a statute of limitations begins to run is one of law,subject to independent review.see howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th,d.
accrual of the statute of limitations 
as a general rule,a cause of action accrues and a statute of limitations begins to run when a controversy is is,when all of the elements of a cause of action have occurred and a suit may be maintained.howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra,supra,cal th at,d.where there is a continuing wrong,however,with periodic new injury to the plaintiff,the courts have applied what justice werdegar has termed a theory of continuous accrual.id.at,d,see also utility audit,city of los angeles th,d continuing wrong wells fargo bank bank of america th,fn,d a new breach occurs each month.
thus,where performance of contractual obligations is severed into intervals,as in installment contracts,the courts have found that an action attacking the performance for any particular interval must be brought within the period of limitations after the particular performance was due.the situations in which this rule has been applied include not only installment contracts bank of america mclaughlin,d supp,but also such diverse contractual arrangements as leases with periodic rental payments tsemetzin coast federal savings loan th,d,and contracts calling for periodic,payments on an obligation with no fixed and final amount conway bughouse,d.
applied to contractual disputes,the rule is but an application of the doctrine of contractual severability.
where a contract is divisible and,thus,breaches of its severable parts give rise to separate causes of action,the statute of limitations will generally begin to run at the time of each breach in other words,each cause of action for breach of a divisible part may accrue at a different time for purposes of determining whether an action is timely under the applicable statute of limitations.williston on contracts ed,fns.omitted.
the context of is,for periodic breach is to be distinguished from that of a single breach or other wrong which has continuing impact.see,cutujian benedict hills estates th,d cutujian.it also is to be distinguished from the breach of an entire contract,though performance of that contract may involve the rendering of benefits to the plaintiff before the date for final performance lubin lubin d,see also brewer simpson cal d.
if the parties to its making intend an entire contract,not a severable one,the courts will not find it divisible despite periodic performance.jozovich central california berry growers d.generally,the parties intent is revealed by the nature and character of the agreement id.at,quoting gas amal.oil cal.intent can further be shown by the parties subsequent acts and conduct.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
here,the parties intent regarding divisibility of the monthly payment obligation is revealed by the provisions in their writing,as well as by their conduct,including their course of performance.see rest d contracts,course of performance given great weight.
c.the monthly performances are divisible 
express language of the agreements and the parties conduct 
the words used in an agreement are a primary source from which to glean the parties intent.morey vannucci th,d.
section i of exhibit c to the webb tract joa,the copas accounting procedure,states in pertinent part 
joint account shall mean the account showing the charges paid and credits received in the conduct of the joint operations and which are to be shared by the parties.operator shall bill on or before the last day of each month for their proportionate share of the joint account for the preceding month 
the express terms of section viii of the gas balancing agreement state 
the provisions of this gas balanc ing agreement shall be separately applicable and shall constitute a separate agreement as to each well and each reservoir to the end that production from one well or reservoir may not be utilized for the purpose of balancing underproduction from other wells or reservoirs.
the gas balancing agreement in addition provides for to establish and maintain a gas account to show the existing gas imbalance between the parties and to furnish a monthly statement showing the total quantity of gas produced,the amount used in lease operations,vented or lost,and the monthly and cumulative over and under account for each party.because paid or delivered on a monthly basis the amount it contended armstrong was due,no gas imbalance account was ever established or maintained.instead,monthly operating statements showing the amount of oil and gas from the webb tract that was sold,its sale price,the amount of revenue generated by each sale,and armstrong share of that revenue were provided.armstrong received a check for its share of the sales at the time the monthly operating statement was generated.
thus,in both their words and conduct,the parties established a periodic procedure for the performance of their respective obligations.
subject matter 
the subject matter of the webb tract joa and related exhibits is the production of gas and oil,over time,from the webb tract.the amount of money armstrong derives from its net revenue interest depends upon the production and sale of gas,and neither the quantity of production nor the revenue it will generate can be determined in advance.based on these undisputed facts,there is nothing inherent in the subject matter that would prevent the separation of payment or delivery obligation concerning production from a particular period from its obligation to armstrong concerning production from a subsequent or prior period.rather,the continuing nature of the production readily lends itself to division by the parties because gas produced during one time period is easily separated from gas produced during another time period.see williston on contracts,supra,character of subject matter as a factor in determining divisibility.
because the parties used a monthly accounting procedure,because the amount of periodic deliveries or payments could not be determined in advance,and because gas production is by its nature divisible,we conclude the objective manifestation of the parties intent is that performance of part of its obligations to armstrong by making a monthly payment or delivery is divisible from its obligations to make other monthly payments or otherwise satisfy armstrong net revenue interest.
in summary,incorrect interpretation of the formula for calculating armstrong net revenue interest was the wrong that continued over time.however,that wrong is not one of the four elements of a cause of action for breach of contract it simply explains why the breach of payment of the wrong amount of money to armstrong or delivery of the wrong amount of repeated each month.because the act of paying or delivering the wrong amount constituted the breach of contract and caused damage in the amount of the underpayment or underdelivery,we conclude that all of the elements of a cause of action relating to a breach of that monthly obligation did not occur,and thus a cause of action did not accrue,until made the incorrect payment or delivery for that month.tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th,d dispute over amount of square footage to include in formula for calculating periodic rental payment landlord allowed to recover with respect to payments due within four years of commencement of action.
arguments regarding divisibility are not convincing 
in presenting its arguments,has not approached the primary issue of divisibility as one of construction to be determined in accordance with the intention of the parties.see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.instead,has attacked the trial court determination with a variety of arguments.
first,argues that the global settlement agreement and the webb tract joa are not installment contracts.specifically,asserts it did not have a relationship with armstrong,and it did not have a duty to armstrong to make periodic cash payments or any cash payments for gas production.these arguments appear to be based on the unstated premise that only installment contracts contain obligations that are divisible from one another.this premise,however,is incorrect.see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,d,see also williston on contracts,supra,addressing the divisibility of particular types of contracts.accordingly,whether the monthly payments or deliveries made under the webb tract joa are labeled as installment obligations does not determine the question of divisibility.
based on dillon board of pension commrs.cal d,dillon,contends the present lawsuit is an action to determine the existence of armstrong right to receive a net revenue interest greater than percent,and the action to determine the existence of such a right necessarily precedes and is distinct from an action to recover any shortfall in the monthly payments which have fallen due.
in dillon,the plaintiff filed a claim with the pension board after her husband,who was a police officer,committed suicide.the board rejected the claim and the plaintiff did not file a petition for writ of mandate against the board within the applicable limitation period from the denial of her claim.because the right to the pension could only be established by bringing a claim before the pension board,and the plaintiff had not instituted an action to establish that right within the limitation period after denial of her claim,the court ruled her petition was time barred,even as to installments of the pension that would have been paid within the limitations period.dillon,supra,cal d at.
dillon is distinguishable from the present case because armstrong contractual rights were not conditioned upon completing a claims procedure.instead,armstrong right to receive a net revenue interest was established by the webb tract joa.howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra,supra,cal th at,d,periodic accrual despite opportunity for initial challenge.
also argues that its obligations regarding armstrong net revenue interest constitute a covenant running with the land,and that the statute of limitations for a covenant running with the land starts when the plaintiff makes a demand for performance.contends this case should be determined by the rule of law that the statute of limitations to enforce affirmative covenants running with the land,and,in particular,duties included in a declaration of cc r,commences when a demand for performance is made.cutujian,supra,th at,d.
