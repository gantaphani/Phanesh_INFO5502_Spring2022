appellant relators kennard and wright brought this qui tam action on behalf of the united states government against appellees comstock resources,et,comstock pursuant to the false claims act,fca.the allegations center around oil and gas leases between comstock and an indian tribe.the indian leases are subject to regulation by the secretary of the interior who acts as a fiduciary for the tribe.comstock pays royalties owed to the tribe to the mineral management service mms,an agency under the secretary.the mms is responsible for collecting royalties,ensuring the accuracy of those payments with audits,and remitting the royalty payments to the tribe.
relator wright owned royalty interests in a tract of land near the indian tribe reservation and had been receiving royalty payments for gas wells located on the property for over years.when the operator on wright property sold its lease interests to comstock,wright royalty payments dropped dramatically.based on this dramatic drop,wright speculated that comstock was underpaying him and others in the area,including the tribe.
wright contacted relator kennard with his information.relator kennard researched and investigated public records and discovered that the indian leases might have expired.based on the investigation and relators extensive oil and gas experience,they concluded that comstock was underpaying royalties to the tribe and also that comstock knew that it was underpaying the tribe.after consultation with attorneys,relators concluded that comstock had committed fraud and violated the fca.the attorneys,including sydow,began drafting a complaint.relators invited the tribe to join the suit as and the tribe declined.
on october,relators sent the required disclosure statement to the government to which a complaint was attached.on october,sydow filed suit acting as the tribe attorney instead of as relators attorney.the following day,relators filed this suit alleging essentially the same things as the sydow complaint.relators allege that sydow essentially stole their information in preparing the tribe complaint.
the fca imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government.a.violators are liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person.a.pursuant to,a private individual,known as a relator,may bring a civil action for a violation of for the person and for the united states government in the name of the government.b.the relator then receives a share of any government recovery.d.the relator qui tam complaint is filed under seal and served on the government with a written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information in the relator possession.b.the government may then either choose to intervene and take over litigation or decline to intervene,in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.b.
in the instant case,the district court dismissed relators fca qui tam complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to e a which provides 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
on appeal,we are asked to decide whether the district court erred in dismissing relators complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on grounds that the current action was barred because of a prior public disclosure and relators did not qualify as an original source.we review de novo the district court dismissal of relators fca qui tam action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.united states ex rel.ramseyer century healthcare,cir review of the district court dismissal under the fca jurisdictional bar is plenary because the jurisdictional question is necessarily intertwined with the merits.
application of the e jurisdictional bar requires a inquiry 
whether the alleged public disclosure contains allegations or transactions from one of the listed sources whether the alleged disclosure has been made public within the meaning of the false claims act whether the relator complaint is based upon this public disclosure and,if so,whether the relator qualifies as an original source.
united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir quoting united states ex rel.fine,cir.a court should address the first three public disclosure issues first.consideration of the fourth,original source issue is necessary only if the court answers the first three questions in the affirmative.id.therefore,we must first address whether the sydow complaint operated as a public disclosure which would operate to bar the current action unless relators are an original source.
relators argue strenuously that because sydow allegedly unethically used their information in drafting his complaint for the tribe that this court should not validate that fraud.however,we are constrained by the law as it is written.the jurisdictional bar in e does not contemplate an exception to public disclosure unless the person is an original source.the remedy for the alleged conversion of information in this case lies elsewhere.section e operates to satisfy the dual goals of avoidance of parasitism and encouragement of legitimate citizen enforcement actions.united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.consistent with these purposes,we believe the threshold based upon analysis is intended to be a quick trigger for the more exacting original source analysis.united states ex rel.precision koch,cir.once a public disclosure is made,even if by somewhat nefarious means,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.b.
in the instant case,the alleged public disclosure is the sydow complaint.civil hearings are specifically referenced in e a.section e lists a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or the news media as sources available for public disclosure.we have repeatedly held that prior civil actions are public disclosures under the fca.precision,at see also united states ex rel.king hillcrest health,cir hafter,at.additionally,every court of appeal to have addressed the question has held that any information disclosed through civil litigation and on file with the clerk office should be considered a public disclosure for purposes of section e a.ramseyer,at quoting united states northrop,cir internal quotations omitted.the filing of the sydow complaint commenced a civil action on behalf of the tribe against comstock.thus,the first of the threshold inquiries,whether the alleged public disclosure contains allegations or transactions from one of the listed sources,is satisfied.
we must next address whether the alleged disclosure has been made public within the meaning of the fca.relators argue that because the disclosure in this case was only made to a single government filing clerk who stamped the sydow complaint,no public disclosure occurred.this argument is unpersuasive.section e operates as a quick trigger.precision,at.once a complaint is filed,a civil action has commenced and public disclosure has occurred.there is no requirement that a certain number of people read or receive the information.relators rely on united states ex rel.holmes consumer ins.group,cir en banc,in which we held that the allegations must have been made known to the public through some affirmative act of disclosure.however,disclosure to a single filing clerk was enough in the instant case because the filing of the civil action in itself was the affirmative act of disclosure.it is not necessary that the filing clerk or any member of the public read the complaint.additionally,in holmes we specifically held that a public disclosure can occur to a single person.at.
relators argument that providing a complaint to the government in advance of filing immunizes a relator from the operation of the fca public disclosure bar is similarly misdirected.section e does not contain an exception for complying with the mandatory jurisdictional requirements of b additionally,disclosure to the government through b is not a public disclosure contemplated by e.as discussed above,e specifically lists the following sources as avenues for public disclosure a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or the news media.i n order to be publicly disclosed,the allegations or transactions upon which a qui tam suit is based must have been made known to the public through some affirmative act of disclosure.ramseyer,at emphasis added.this requirement clearly contemplates that the information be in the public domain in some capacity and the government is not the equivalent of the public domain.
the first two inquiries being answered in the affirmative,we then ask whether relators complaint is based upon the public disclosure.the test is whether substantial identity exists between the publicly disclosed allegations and the qui tam complaint,at cir quoting precision,at.relators have conceded that the complaints at issue are substantially similar.see aplt.br.at we find no merit in relators argument that because the sydow complaint was allegedly based solely and exclusively on relators information and complaint that it is impossible for relators complaint to be based upon the sydow complaint.based upon,in e a,means supported by,at quoting precision,at.whether relators qui tam complaint was already drafted when the sydow complaint was filed is irrelevant.a relator need not have learned of the basis for the qui tam action from the public disclosure for its action to be considered based upon that public disclosure if the allegations are substantially similar.united states ex rel.fine advanced sciences,cir court rejected argument that because relator discovery of alleged fraud occurred prior to public disclosure,complaint could not be based upon the public disclosure see also,at.therefore,the first three steps of the e jurisdictional bar are satisfied and the sydow complaint operated as a public disclosure 
since we hold that the sydow complaint was a public disclosure,we must now address the fourth relators were an original source.section e b defines original source as an individual that has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.see also united states ex rel.stone rockwell int l,cir.direct and independent knowledge is knowledge marked by the absence of an intervening agency and unmediated by anything but the relator own labor.hafter,at internal quotations and citations omitted.the burden is on the relator to show that he is an original source.stone,at.to meet this burden,a relator must provide more than an unsupported,conclusory allegation to show that he is an original source.id.quoting hafter,at.
comstock argues that relators were not an original source because relators did not possess substantive information about the particular fraud,they were not insiders of comstock or the tribe,and they relied on public records.thus,comstock asserts that relators merely conducted background research and relied on their own expertise to speculate that comstock had defrauded the government.we will address each contention in turn.
comstock first assertion,that relators did not possess information about the particular fraud,has no basis in tenth circuit precedent.knowledge of the actual fraudulent conduct is not necessary.see stone,at.a relator need only possess direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.id.quoting e b emphasis in original.a relator need not have in his possession knowledge of the actual fraudulent conduct itself knowledge underlying or supporting the fraud allegation is sufficient.id.quoting hafter,at.thus,the fact that relators did not have knowledge of the actual alleged fraudulent submissions to the government can not disqualify them as an original source.
comstock second contention,that relators were not insiders of either comstock or the tribe,is also without merit.our review of the relevant case law revealed no requirement that a relator be a corporate insider.additionally,we can think of no valid reason for creating such a restriction.
the third contention,that relators relied on public records,deserves more attention.we have not and will not adopt any rule disqualifying a relator as an original source when the relator examines public records.however,the degree and character of such reliance is necessarily deserving of our attention.a mere compilation of documents or reports already in the public domain will not allow a relator to qualify as an original source.however,a complete and thorough investigation of a fraud on the government will likely necessarily involve some review of contracts,documents,or other information in the public domain.it is the character of the relator discovery and investigation that controls this inquiry.
on one end of the spectrum,there are several cases that define an action based solely on the labor of others.in united states ex rel.findley employees club,the court of appeals for the federal circuit held that a relator ability to recognize the legal consequences of a publicly disclosed fraudulent transaction does not alter the fact that the material elements of the violation have already been publicly disclosed.the court further stated that i f a relator merely uses his or her unique expertise or training to conclude that the material elements already in the public domain constitute a false claim,then a qui tam action can not proceed.see also,at concluding plaintiff did not qualify as original source because his complaint merely tracked an audit report he neither observed nor discovered the purported fraud united states ex rel.fine sandia,cir public disclosure of material elements of fraud bars qui tam action even if disclosure itself does not allege wrongdoing because fca does not require allegations to have statutory basis united states ex rel.aflatooni kitsap physicians,cir relator who offered only speculation and conjecture that defendant committed alleged fraud did not qualify as original source.thus,when a relator qui tam action is based solely on material elements already in the public domain,that relator is not an original source.
similarly,in united states ex rel.kreindler kreindler united technologies,the second circuit held that an attorney who participated in the initial litigation on which his qui tam action was based was not an original source,cir.the court stated that t he fact that the relator conducted some collateral research and investigations,as would be customary in such litigation,does not establish direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.id.internal quotations omitted.the court further explained 
nor does the fact that the relator background knowledge enabled it to understand the significance of the information acquired make its knowledge independent of the publicly disclosed information.if that were enough to qualify the relator as an original source then a cryptographer who translated a ciphered document in a public court record would be an original source,an unlikely interpretation of the phrase.
id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
our case is easily distinguished from both findley and kreindler.unlike the relator in findley,relators in our case did not merely attach a legal label to a fraud already noticed in the public domain.while relator findley complaint merely echoe d publicly disclosed,allegedly fraud
