the plaintiffs in this antitrust action,midwest gas services,services and midwest gas storage,storage,appeal from the district court dismissal of their lawsuit.in granting separately filed motions to dismiss defendants indiana gas company,ig,indiana energy services,ies,and proliance energy,llc proliance,the district court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to properly show that they had standing to sue under the antitrust laws and had suffered injuries covered by the antitrust laws.for the reasons described below,we affirm the district court in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
indiana gas,a local natural gas utility,services counties in southern and central indiana.the natural gas industry is partially deregulated,with companies like indiana gas providing traditional public utility services for small customers within their service area.these utilities,called local distribution companies ldcs,are regulated by the relevant state authority in indiana,the state authority is the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc,which allows ldcs such as ig to unbundle their distribution charges.this allows large volume customers or transport eligible customers,including industrial and institutional buyers,to buy their gas and interstate transportation of that gas from the source to its destination on the open market.gas delivered through interstate pipelines for users is brought as far as the connection to ig distribution network.indiana gas,as an ldc,is required to transport the gas from that point to the end user,receiving a fee for this last piece of the transportation puzzle.this is compared to the traditional fee structure used by ldcs for their residential and other customers,who pay one bundled rate combining gas and all of the gas transport charges.
the right to transport natural gas within the interstate pipeline system from one point to another on a specific pipeline is capacity and may be freely bought and sold by the pipelines,ldcs,end users,or brokers.in addition,capacity can be partitioned using secondary delivery points.for example,a holder of capacity on a particular pipeline from point a to point z the two primary delivery points can sell their rights so that one party buys the point d segment,another acquires the point q segment,and a third purchases the point z segment,with points d,g,q,and s being secondary points where gas is put into or taken out of the pipeline.this means that instead of relying on one pipeline to transport gas from the wellhead to its final destination,a virtual pipeline can be constructed by piecing together capacity along different intersecting pipelines to its final destination.of course,most end users are not willing to take on these logistics,so companies like services and proliance act as brokers who put together supply and transport contracts for their customers see generally ferc order,regulation of natural gas transportation services,john decker,note,authorization of natural gas pipeline construction moving decisions from regulators to the marketplace.envtl.
an ldc is required to provide guaranteed service for its residential customers and those other customers who rely on the ldc for bundled gas and gas transport services.to guarantee that it will have enough capacity during times of peak demand such as the winter heating season,an ldc must purchase capacity in excess of its average needs.it could turn around and sell this excess capacity via contracts just like any other holder of capacity.ig,as an ldc,was required by the iurc to make its excess capacity available to the market on an basis,where it could be acquired by others intending to use or resell the capacity.
proliance was formed in as a joint venture between a sister company of ig,igc energy,and a subsidiary of a different ldc in indiana,central gas coke utility cg.proliance works with ig and cg to provide all of their gas supplies,purchasing sufficient capacity to serve both ig and cg requirements.in addition,proliance acts as a marketer of gas and gas transportation for end users,selling the surplus capacity it acquires as a result of servicing ig and cg needs back into the marketplace.because proliance does not provide any public utility functions,proliance is not subject to iurc regulations and,therefore,unlike ig and cg,is not required to sell off its surplus capacity to the general marketplace.from,before proliance was created,ig created a marketing affiliate,ies,which provided similar services in the same manner as proliance,but only for ig.
storage operates a gas storage field in clay county,indiana,and is the only independent gas storage field in ig service area.storage functions as a kind of gas warehouse,where customers can store gas in preparation for times,or as a kind of bridge,routing the gas from one pipeline connected into the storage field,through the field,and out a different pipeline.storage was authorized by ferc to operate the field in.the field was once connected to the terre haute gas company distribution system,which was in turn connected to texas gas transmission tgt interstate pipeline.ig purchased the terre haute facilities in.the field is also located close to the panhandle eastern pipeline interstate pipeline pepl,and a connection between the pepl pipeline and the storage field was completed in.
services,a marketing affiliate of storage,saw an opportunity in the storage field proximity to the tgt and pepl pipelines.the tgt pipeline transports gas to indiana from wells on the coast of the gulf of mexico,gas that costs more than the pepl gas from north texas and oklahoma.if storage could connect to the haute system,customers in ig distribution system who had previously purchased gas from the tgt pipeline could buy cheaper gas from the pepl pipeline,using the storage field as a shortcut which would eliminate the extra transportation fees that would otherwise make such a choice financially unattractive.also,services could market the storage field to customers for gas storage,allowing them to hedge against seasonal upswings in gas prices.the problem with this plan was that storage storage field was no longer connected to the terre haute ig system.though the necessary connections would only have to span thirty feet at one point and a mile at another,storage needed to negotiate with ig to establish the interconnect between the respective facilities.
after a series of failed negotiations with ig in an attempt to establish the interconnect,the plaintiffs filed a complaint in february alleging antitrust violations by ig and two state law claims.they then filed an amended complaint which named ies and proliance as additional defendants and added a claim of anticompetitive tying.ig moved for judgment on the pleadings,which the district court denied.on a motion for reconsideration,the district court granted ig motion regarding the tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim,but otherwise found that the plaintiffs had standing to assert their claims.proliance moved to dismiss the claims against it pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and the district court granted the motion,finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish both antitrust injury and antitrust standing.acting sua sponte,the district court reconsidered ig motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted the motion on the same grounds as proliance motion.ies then moved for judgment on the pleadings,and the district court granted ies motion on the same grounds.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court grant of a rule b motion to dismiss and a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo.see velasco.of human,cir.grants of either motion are proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can not prove any facts that would support his claim for relief.gun outdoor shows,city of south bend,cir gustafson jones,cir.in evaluating the motion,we accept all allegations in the complaint as true,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.forseth village of sussex,cir gustafson,at.
in its orders granting the defendants motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings,the district court found that the plaintiffs did not allege injuries sufficient to maintain antitrust claims.relying on the sixth circuit opinion in indeck energy,consumers energy,cir,the district court found that as competitor companies,the plaintiffs could only demonstrate an antitrust injury if their exclusion from the marketplace eliminated a superior competing product or alternatives.
here,the district court concluded,proliance competed with services.services revenues from transportation and gas sales were reduced,but it could not demonstrate that it had a superior or cheaper product.since it believed that services was a competitor and not a customer of the defendants,and since storage was neither a competitor nor consumer of the defendants,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that they had standing to bring an antitrust claim.the district court further explained that even if the plaintiffs could demonstrate that they were proper parties to bring an antitrust suit against the defendants,it considered dispositive the indiana supreme court finding that proliance formation was in the public interest and did not injure competition.see united states gypsum.gas.since,according to united states gypsum,proliance did not injure competition,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs could not establish that they had suffered an antitrust injury,making dismissal of their claims appropriate.
the district court reliance on indeck is misplaced because the plaintiffs here allege more and different allegations than those in that sixth circuit case.in indeck,the plaintiff energy supplier was rebuffed by consumers energy when consumers required additional energy to service its accounts.instead,consumers purchased power from one of its affiliates.indeck claimed that it lost business to a competitor that was affiliated with the customer,but not that a length transaction destroyed or damaged the competitive environment in power generation.indeck,at.here,the plaintiffs allege antitrust claims not only based on the affiliation between the defendants,like indeck,but also that certain business practices by and between the defendants injure competition.
the district court here,relying on the reasoning of indeck,found that neither plaintiff was able to show that it was a proper plaintiff to bring an antitrust claim.we keep in mind that to survive a motion to dismiss or judgment on the pleadings,a plaintiff need not include the particulars of his claim only a short and plain statement is needed.fed.civ.a see mcm partners,cir.this is also true for antitrust cases.though the short and plain statement of an antitrust claim must demonstrate antitrust injury and antitrust standing,antitrust plaintiffs need not plead to a heightened level of particularity.see leatherman tarrant cty.narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d austin coalition cmty.council sbc communications,cir hammes aamco transmissions,cir.while we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs do not have standing to assert certain antitrust claims,for the same reasons that the sixth circuit found in indeck,we also find that they have shown their ability to assert other claims.we address these allegations in turn.
conspiracy to restrain trade 
the plaintiffs conspiracy claim alleges that ig and pepl conspired to prevent storage from existing as a viable gas storage facility by refusing to allow it physical access to their facilities,which frustrated services contracts with customers in ig service area.the amended complaint describes communications between pepl and ig officials who apparently discussed ways to prevent storage from both establishing an interconnect with the ig distribution system and being designated a secondary receipt point for gas transported by pepl.the frustration of these efforts,according to services,prevented it from selling gas services to customers who would have used storage storage field and its interconnects with the ig distribution system and pepl pipeline.
for services to properly plead an antitrust suit under of the clayton act,it is required to show that it has antitrust standing,that its claimed injuries reflect the anticompetitive effect of either the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.brunswick pueblo,d see also alliedsignal,goodrich,cir.whether a plaintiff has antitrust standing depends on factors,including t he causal connection between the alleged violation and the harm to the plaintiff i mproper motive w hether the injury was of a type that congress sought to redress with the antitrust laws t he directness between the injury and the market restraint t he speculative nature of the damages t he risk of duplicate recoveries or complex damages apportionment.sanner bd.of trade of city of chicago,cir listing factors drawn from contractors of cal.cal.state council of carpenters,d.of these factors,we need only be concerned here with the directness between services claimed injury and the alleged market restraint.
services claimed injury did not stem directly from the purported conspiracy,but rather the alleged conspiracy effect on storage,whose position as a bridge between the tgt and pepl pipelines was necessary for services to create the arbitrage opportunities for its customers.services is not alleging that it was completely prevented from supplying its customers,but that it could not promote and take advantage of the opportunity that an connection would have provided.services injury,therefore,is derivative to that of storage,which is the party directly injured by the alleged conspiracy.since services can not demonstrate that it has suffered an antitrust injury directly resulting from the conspiracy,the district court properly dismissed services conspiracy claim.
the defendants argue that storage has pleaded itself out of a claim due to the amended complaint description of the relevant market as the market for transporting and selling gas to end users that are allowed by tariff to receive transported natural gas in the counties in north central,central and southern indiana in which indiana gas is an ldc.the defendants point out that because storage is not permitted under its ferc operating certificate to sell natural gas or gas transport to end users,it can not be a participant in the market which it claims is injured by the defendants actions.
while it is true that storage operating certificate only allows it to construct and operate the storage field,not to sell or market natural gas,ferc order issuing certificate,docket no,at april,storing natural gas is integral to its transportation.just as a pipeline that bridges two other pipelines is part of the transportation network that the appellants claim as their market,so is a storage field that is connected to different pipelines.ferc recognized this when it described transportation to include storage,exchange,backhaul,displacement,or other methods of transportation in its regulations concerning natural gas transportation.emphasis added.we therefore find that storage is a participant in the relevant market and for that reason is not barred from asserting its claims.
storage further alleges that ig,proliance,and pepl conspired to isolate storage by refusing it access to their transportation facilities,thereby preventing storage from being able to deliver gas to end users.because storage is directly affected by this alleged conspiracy,and services is not,storage is the proper plaintiff to bring this claim.to properly allege a conspiracy under of the sherman act,a plaintiff need only allege that the conspiracy unreasonably restrained competition in a relevant market.see mcm partners,at.since storage has described such a conspiracy and is a participant in the claimed market,we find that the district court erred when dismissing this claim.
proliance as an illegal combination 
the plaintiffs second claim alleges that the formation of proliance by indiana gas and central gas is a combination that acts as an unreasonable restraint of trade.proliance is a joint venture that combined ig and cg gas marketing and sales arms it does not transport gas itself,nor doe
