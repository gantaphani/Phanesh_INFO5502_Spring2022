robert daniel marcy challenges the district court dismissal of the qui tam action that he brought on behalf of the united states under the false claims act.we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
on december,robert marcy filed suit against newfield exploration gulf coast,newfield exploration company,rowan companies,and remington oil and gas corporation defendants.marcy alleges that,while employed on defendants midland offshore drilling unit,he was ordered by defendants to illegally dump oil,oil waste,solid waste,grease,paint,and other hazardous substances into the gulf of mexico at night.marcy contends that defendants actions violated the federal water pollution control act fwpca and the act to prevent pollution from ships apps,that defendants intentionally failed to report the discharge of oil or hazardous substances as required by those two enactments,and that defendants intentionally omitted a record of the discharges both from the oil record book in violation of as well as from the mineral management service activity reports,hereinafter referred to using their form number as the mms reports in violation of department of interior regulations.
marcy maintains that defendants fraudulently avoided civil fines and other penalties under several statutes,including the fwpca and the apps,the oil pollution act of opa,and the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla.marcy also alleges that these actions occurred in violation of the terms of the oil and gas lease granted to defendants by the united states pursuant to ocsla,which requires that defendants operate in compliance with ocsla,all other applicable statutes,and regulations or orders intended to protect persons,property,and the environment on the outer continental shelf.finally,marcy alleges that because defendants breached the lease but continued operations,they fraudulently retained oil and gas,oil and gas royalties,and profits owed to the united states.
marcy contends that the defendants conduct constitutes a violation of the false claims act.marcy refers us to these subsections of the act 
any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government or knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person.
a and a.after investigating marcy allegations,the united states filed notice of its election to decline intervention.
each defendant filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that marcy failed to state a claim under the false claims act and that he did not allege fraud with sufficient particularity under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motions to dismiss,concluding that marcy failed to state a claim under the act.the court declined to address the arguments regarding the particularity of the pleading.after motions for reconsideration and to amend the complaint were denied,marcy appealed.
discussion 
marcy asserts that his complaint adequately pled his cause of action.our review of this issue is de novo,accepting as true the factual allegations that are and construing them favorably towards the plaintiff.united states ex rel.willard humana health plan of texas,cir.those factual allegations must support a claim to relief that is plausible on its face and rises above mere speculation.in re katrina canal breaches litigation,cir.
because the two sections of the false claims act that marcy employs have different requirements,we examine each separately.
section a knowingly make false claim for payment.
the false claims act is the government primary litigation tool for recovering losses sustained as the result of fraud.avco united states dep of justice.under section a,the act creates liability for a ny person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.
a threshold issue is whether any claim was made for purposes of section a.the defendants,engaged in the physical extraction of natural resources belonging to the united states,did not request or demand money or property from the united states.they were taking property through their drilling operations as permitted by contract,their leases.defendants contend that because the allegedly inaccurate oil record logs and mms reports do not certify compliance with the lease,these documents could not serve as false certifications under the act.
in response,marcy argues that even though this is not a typical false claims act violation,the act nonetheless applies.marcy theory is that the mineral lease was a contract in which the lessee received permission to take government property subject to the lease terms.the purpose of the mms reports and the oil log book was allegedly in part to assure the government of a lessee compliance with lease terms.marcy contends that dumping of oil and trash necessarily violates the lease and must be documented in both of these records.because it was not,marcy argues that defendants falsely and impliedly certified that they were in compliance with the lease the benefit defendants received from this false certification was maintaining the right to take the property of the united states as provided by the lease.
we do not decide whether marcy has properly identified a claim for purposes of section a.resolving that issue would necessarily require us to determine whether implied certifications may be claims under the act.this court has previously deferred that question,and we do so again today.see willard,at united states ex rel.stebner stewart stephenson,cir unpublished.instead,we resolve this appeal based on the requirement of materiality for any claim made.a material claim is one that is required to be made in order to receive the relevant government benefit.united states southland management,cir en banc jones,concurring.
in a recent and similar precedent,the plaintiff filed a qui tam action against humana health plan for selectively choosing participants for humana hmo both in violation of humana contract with federal agencies to provide health care services to medicare beneficiaries as well as in violation of other federal regulations.willard,at.this court dismissed the claim,noting that the plaintiff had failed to allege facts that would show that the government conditioned its payment to humana on any implied certification of compliance id.at.
we have also concluded that when the government has conditioned payment of a claim upon a claimant certification of compliance with,for example,a statute or regulation,a claimant submits a false or fraudulent claim when he or she falsely certifies compliance with that statute or regulation.united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir.these false certifications of compliance create liability under the fca when certification is a prerequisite to obtaining a government benefit.id.
marcy contends that the willard materiality standard does not govern,arguing instead that we should apply the standard articulated by a panel of this court in united states southland management,cir,reh g en banc granted,cir.the initial southland opinion determined that a violation of the act occurred if the false certifications had a natural tendency to influence or were capable of influencing the decision of the governmental entity.southland,at.however,the southland panel opinion upon which marcy relies was automatically vacated when it was reheard en banc.see cir.southland,at jones,concurring grant of en banc rehearing vacated panel decision.accordingly,the southland panel opinion is not precedent.marcy did not find anything worth mentioning for today issues in the en banc,final opinion in the case.southland.
in essence,marcy alleges that defendants fraudulently maintained their right to take government property under the lease by failing to report their violations
