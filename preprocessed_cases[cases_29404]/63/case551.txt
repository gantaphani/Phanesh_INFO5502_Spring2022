facts and procedural history 
exxon owns and operates the santa ynez unit syu.it consists of acres of offshore oil and gas leaseholds in federal waters off the coast of santa barbara county.the syu includes production platforms,pipelines,and oil transmission and processing facilities.crude oil and natural gas are transmitted to exxon las flores canyon facility lfc,an onshore oil processing facility.there,crude oil is separated from the emulsion and sold to refineries.natural gas is also extracted from the emulsion to power a megawatt cogeneration facility which provides electricity to the syu onshore and offshore facilities.some of the natural gas is sold to pacific offshore pipeline company popco and processed elsewhere.popco is not owned by exxon.
during the nine years that it took to construct the lfc,oil prices dropped significantly.on march,the lien date for the tax year,the lfc was assessed as new construction in progress.the lfc was completed several months later and received its first crude oil in december.because of the drop in oil prices,exxon determined that it would not recover its original investment and would lose approximately billion over the lifetime of the syu project.
the assessor contended that the fair market value of the lfc was equal to its cost of construction.exxon claimed that the lfc was an integrated component part of the syu and that the lfc and syu should be appraised as a single unit.because the decline in oil prices affected the value of the syu,exxon claimed that the value of the lfc was less than its construction cost.in the alternative,exxon argued that if cost of construction was used to determine fair market value,more than million in deductions should be made for economic obsolescence based on the decline in oil prices and the cost of abandoning the lfc pursuant to the conditions in its county permit.
although exxon and the assessor agreed that the historical cost of the lfc was million,the assessor made no deductions for economic obsolescence.exxon paid the property taxes and filed an application with the board for reduction of tax assessments for the tax years.
after days of testimony,the board found that the assessor did not err in classifying the lfc as the appraisal unit or in using a cost approach to determine its value.the board found that state board of equalization rule sbe rule,tit,which proscribes the valuation methodology for oil and gas mineral reserves,did not apply because the lfc was an off site oil processing facility and had no oil or mineral reserves.
the board accepted exxon contention that declining oil prices affected the value of the property but devised its own method of quantifying economic obsolescence.the board found that the base year value of the lfc was approximately million,million more than the actual cost of construction.the increase in property taxes resulted in the levy of escape assessments and interest penalties.
on june,exxon filed suit praying for an tax refund and the recovery of in escape assessments plus interest first cause of action.the second and third causes of action alleged that exxon was not liable for interest accruing on additional taxes levied after the board increased the assessed value of the lfc,subd.c.by stipulation,the second and third causes of action were bifurcated and valuation was tried first.
the trial court ruled the correct unit of appraisal is both the and the components of the subject property.the syu and the lfc are one appraisal unit they are functionally and economically integrated neither can operate without the other.the trial court concluded that the board erred in not using the valuation methodology set forth in sbe rule,tit.reserving jurisdiction,the court remanded the matter back to the board to redetermine the value of the lfc for the lien dates in question.
appealable order 
exxon argues that the order is not appealable because the matter was remanded for further proceedings.a judgment will not be entered until the board redetermines value and the trial court reviews the board findings.

standard of review 
in reviewing the board valuation method we begin with the proposition that no property may escape taxation because of the difficulty of determining its full cash value.t he absence of an actual market for a particular type of property does not mean that it has no value or that it may escape from the constitutional mandate that all property shall be taxed in proportion to its value,a ssessors have developed three basic methods for determining full cash value the market data method citations the income method citations and the cost method citations.bret harte inn,city and county of san francisco cal d.s ince no one of these methods alone can be used to estimate the value of all property,the assessor,subject to requirements of fairness and uniformity,may exercise his discretion in using one or more of them.citations.de luz homes county of san diego,supra,cal d at.as we will explain,we concur with the trial court implied rulings that.the board methodology was not uniform with state board of equalization rules,and.the cost method is here unfair.
