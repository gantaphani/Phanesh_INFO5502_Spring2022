after it was determined that lightning oil company,anticipatorily repudiated its contract to sell natural gas to hess energy,see hess energy,lightning oil,cir,a jury trial was held to determine hess damages under the virginia uniform commercial code.after having been instructed by the district court that the measure of damages is usually the difference between the contract price and the market price,at the time and place of delivery,the jury returned a verdict in favor of hess for.
on appeal,lightning contends that the jury was improperly instructed and that damages should have been calculated using the market price as of the date hess learned that lightning would not perform rather than as of the date of delivery.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
under a master natural gas purchase agreement the master agreement dated november,lightning agreed to sell and statoil energy services,agreed to buy natural gas.the master agreement set forth the general terms of the parties contractual relationship,and subject to these terms,the parties entered into a series of specific natural gas purchase agreements,called confirmations.the confirmations detailed the purchase period,purchase price,purchase volume,delivery point,and other relevant terms.between november,and march,lightning and statoil entered into seven different confirmations under which lightning agreed to sell fixed quantities of natural gas to statoil on specified future dates at fixed prices.
in february,amerada hess corporation purchased the stock of statoil and changed statoil name to hess energy,hess.after the change in name,hess continued to purchase natural gas from lightning under the confirmations,and lightning continued to honor its obligations,at least for a period of time.
in june,lightning located a buyer willing to pay lightning a better price than hess had agreed to pay in its confirmations with lightning,and lightning entered into a contract with that buyer to sell the natural gas promised to hess.lightning then notified hess in july that it was terminating the master agreement,stating that statoil stock ownership change and name change to hess pursuant to the stock purchase agreement was an assignment of statoil contractual obligations in material breach of the provision of the master agreement.
hess commenced this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it had not breached the master agreement and demanding compensatory damages for lightning nonperformance.we concluded,in an earlier appeal,that even if lightning could prove that there was an assignment of contractual obligations in the case,any such assignment could not be a material breach of the master agreement and the confirmations entered into under that agreement.hess energy,at.we remanded the case to the district court for determination of hess energy damages under the confirmation contracts.id.
at the trial on damages,hess director of energy operations testified about hess method of doing business.he explained to the jury that hess business was to purchase natural gas from entities like lightning through agreements such as the confirmation contracts and,once it did so,to locate commercial customers to which it could sell the natural gas.hess business was not to profit on speculation that it could resell the purchased natural gas at higher prices based on favorable market swings,but rather to profit on attributable to its transportation and other services provided to the end user of the natural gas.because hess entered into gas purchase contracts often at prices fixed well in advance of the execution date,it exposed itself to the serious risk that the market price of natural gas on the purchase date would have fallen,leaving it in the position of having to pay a higher price for the natural gas than it could sell the gas for,even after its.to hedge against this market risk,at each time it agreed to purchase natural gas from a supplier at a fixed price for delivery on a specific date,it also entered into a nymex futures contract to sell the same quantity of natural gas on the same date for the same fixed price.according to ordinary commodities trading practice,on the settlement date of the futures contract,hess would not actually sell the natural gas to the other party to the futures contract but rather would simply pay any loss or receive any gain on the contract in a cash settlement.in making this arrangement,hess made itself indifferent to fluctuations in the price of natural gas because settlement of the futures contract offset any favorable or unfavorable swings in the market price of natural gas on the date of delivery,allowing hess to eliminate market risk and rest its profitability solely on its transportation and delivery services.indeed,the sole purpose of advance purchase of natural gas in the first instance was to lock in access to a supply of natural gas,which it could then promise to deliver to its customers.
focusing on the particular transactions in this case,hess director of energy operations testified that when lightning anticipatorily repudiated its agreements to supply natural gas to hess at specified prices,hess was left with naked futures contracts.by repudiating the master agreement and related confirmations,lightning extinguished the supply contract against which the nymex futures contract provided a hedge,exposing hess to the risk of having a futures sales contract that did not offset any corresponding supply contract to purchase natural gas for delivery at a future date.thus,when the price of natural gas rose after hess entered into both the confirmations with lightning and the offsetting futures contracts,hess was exposed,after lightning repudiation,to loss on the futures contracts because it would have to sell gas at a price without the benefit of its bargain with lightning,the ability to purchase the same quantity of natural gas at the price.facing losses on the open futures contracts,hess bought itself out of some of the futures contracts with closer settlement dates,fearing that the market for natural gas would continue to go up with the effect of increasing its losses on those contracts.as a result of having to buy itself out of these futures contracts,hess suffered damages.
hess expert witness,paul carpenter,who was a specialist in the valuation of natural gas,offered two methods for computing hess damages the lost opportunity method,which simply compare d the cost of gas that hess would have paid to lightning had lightning performed under the contract with the market value of the gas at the time that that gas would have been delivered to hess,where the difference between the values would be the measure of damages,and the costs method,which measured the impact on hess directly of the fact that lightning failed to deliver under the contract.carpenter testified that these two methods were really driving at the same thing and that he employed both methods to give more comfort as to what the range of damages was.the principal difference between the two methods was that the method accounted for the damages hess suffered by buying out its futures contracts,while the lost opportunity method assumed that hess did nothing to alter the hedges.
in calculating the differential under the lost opportunity method,carpenter determined that the market value of the contracts,calculated using the actual price at which natural gas traded on the relevant dates of delivery on the nymex,was.he stated that the nymex price was the best indicator of market price because the parties themselves referred to the nymex exchange when they established the contract themselves,so the parties recognize the nymex price as a valid reference price for gas and the nymex price is probably the most widely referenced and used natural gas price in north america and represents the best indicator of a commodity price for natural gas.because the contract price of the natural gas that hess had agreed to purchase from lightning under the confirmations was,the resulting damage to hess under the lost opportunity method was.carpenter calculated damages under the method as.
lightning offered no expert testimony and it did not offer a competing method of calculating the damages.it also did not suggest any damages figure to the jury.rather,its position at closing argument was that hess should have gone out at the time of lightning repudiation and replaced the confirmation contracts by entering into similar contracts with other suppliers at prices.lightning argued that hess sat idly by during a period of time when they knew the price of natural gas was going up,up,up,up,up,up and that hess could have in august of gone out and purchased the same amount of gas that we were supposed to supply them for that future period at a much lower price.lightning also argued that the nymex price was not the relevant market price because that price did not reflect the price at which a producer like lightning would sell to a marketer like hess.
after closing arguments,the district judge instructed the jury on the measure of damages as follows 
when a seller fails or refuses to deliver the goods,the measure of damages is usually the difference between the contract price and the market price,at the time and place of delivery,with interest,and the buyer for its own protection has the right under the circumstances to buy the goods in the open market,and charge the difference in price to the seller account.the remedy for a breach of contract is intended to put the injured party in the same position in which it would have been had the contract been performed.in your verdict,you may provide for interest on any principal sum awarded or any part thereof and fix a period at which the interest shall commence.
the jury returned a verdict of,with interest beginning on june.this amount was equal to carpenter calculation under the lost opportunity method.
from the district court judgment entered on the jury verdict,lightning filed this appeal.
for its principal argument on appeal,lightning contends that the district court erred in instructing the jury that the proper measure of damages under virginia law was the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time and place of delivery.lightning argues that under the virginia uniform commercial code,t he proper measure of damages in this case is the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time hess learned that lightning would not perform.emphasis added.
in arguing that the district court correctly instructed the jury under virginia law,hess argues that lightning interpretation of virginia code wrongly equates the term learned of the breach with the time at which the innocent party learned of the wrongdoer repudiation and renders meaningless other sections of the uniform commercial code including.e quating a contract breach with its mere repudiation is bad policy,hess argues,because it would require the innocent party to cover immediately or risk being uncompensated for losses caused by increased prices in the period following the repudiation.
it is undisputed in this case that the master agreement and the confirmations entered into under it were subject to the provisions of virginia uniform commercial code,et.the core dispute between the parties concerns when the market price of the undelivered natural gas should be measured for purposes of calculating damages and to what degree hess damages may be limited by an asserted duty to cover.while this case presents an archetypal anticipatory repudiation,see james white robert summers,uniform commercial code,at ed noting that the clearest case giving rise to an anticipatory repudiation is when one the contract invalid or at an the other of materially breaching the contract,and states that he no longer will do any business with the other party,measuring a buyer damages in such circumstances presents one of the most impenetrable interpretive problems in the entire uniform commercial code.id,at.
we begin the analysis by pointing out that the overarching principle given by the district court instruction to the jury the remedy for breach of contract is intended to put the injured party in the same position in which it would have been had the contract been performed conforms to the governing principle for damages under the virginia uniform commercial code.see stating that the code remedies shall be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed.
under the specific provisions for damages,the virginia uniform commercial code provides that when a seller repudiates a contract,the buyer is given several alternatives,none of which operates to penalize the buyer as a victim of the seller repudiation.see.code.one option provided by is for the buyer to resort to any remedy for breach or,even though the buyer has notified the repudiating seller that he would await the latter performance and has urged retraction.id.b.section,in turn,allows a buyer either to cover and have damages under the next section as to all the goods affected or to recover damages for nondelivery as provided in this title.in this case,hess chose not to cover,opting instead to recover damages for nondelivery under.
section provides 
t he measure of damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this title,but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller breach.
emphasis added.lightning would have us equate the time when the buyer learned of the breach with the time when the buyer learned of the repudiation and require calculating damages using the market price of the natural gas at the time hess learned that lightning would not perform.hess contends,on the other hand,that the time when it learned of the breach for purposes of did not occur until each time lightning failed to deliver natural gas as promised in its contract,rather than at the time lightning communicated its intent not to perform.
these diverse positions reduce to the core question of whether breach as used in when the buyer learned of the breach means repudiation,or whether breach refers to the date of actual performance when it could be determined that a breach this case,the date of delivery.
while might be susceptible to multiple interpretations,see white summers,supra,at articulating at least three possibilities,we conclude that the drafters of the uniform commercial code made a deliberate distinction between the terms repudiation and breach,and to blur these two words by equating them would render several related provisions of the uniform commercial code meaningless.this is best illustrated by reference to.in that provision,an aggrieved buyer can wait a commercially reasonable time after learning of the seller repudiation to allow the seller to change its mind and perform.a.if lightning interpretation of were the correct the damages should be calculated based on the market price on the date of the buyer would be deprived of his right under to await a reasonable time for seller possible performance.see white summers,supra,at i f the buyer damages are to be measured at the time the buyer learned of the repudiation,then it can not do what a seems to give it the right to do,namely await performance for a commercially reasonable time at least not without risking loss as a result of postrepudiation market shifts.
in another example,if the date of the seller repudiation is equated with the time when the buyer learns of the seller breach as used in,then would become meaningless.section provides 
if an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods,any damages based on market price or shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.
this section moves the date that the seller learned of the breach under to the date that the seller learned of the repudiation in circumstances where the case has come to trial before the performance date.to give meaning to,when the case does
