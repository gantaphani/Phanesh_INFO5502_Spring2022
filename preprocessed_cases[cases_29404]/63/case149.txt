lead plaintiffs counsel in this class action case persuaded the district court to divide up a million lump sum attorneys fee award among more than six dozen plaintiffs lawyers according to lead counsel proposed allocation.this might be permissible,except that the court was so persuaded in an ex parte hearing and apparently without benefit of supporting data.the court further accepted lead counsel proposed order sealing the individual awards preventing all counsel from communicating with anyone about the awards requiring releases from counsel who accepted payment and limiting its own scope of review of objections to the allocation.these and other facets of the court process are unauthorized and objectionable.pursuant to the appeal of attorneys who challenged their awards,we vacate the order approving the allocation and remand.
background 
during,shell oil norco,louisiana refinery allegedly produced contaminated gasoline that was purchased and used by thousands of motorists,damaging,inter alia,their fuel gauges.the consumers filed numerous lawsuits against shell,which were consolidated in a federal class action.before a settlement was reached,shell undertook a program to repair motorists broken fuel gauges.
in september,shell agreed to settle the class action by expanding its voluntary repair program,paying million to cover general damages for plaintiffs who filed repair claims,and setting aside million to pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees,costs,and expenses.after a final fairness hearing,the district court approved the settlement and the aggregate attorneys fee award.
when the court approved the attorneys fee award,which was unobjected to,it also appointed a fee committee to allocate the fee award among approximately law firms and plaintiffs attorneys who worked on the case.the committee consisted of counsel,john barrett and ben barnow,and three other plaintiffs attorneys,walter dumas,patrick geraghty,and richard arsenault appellees the court final approval order stated that any dispute concerning the fee allocation would be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction.
the fee committee then invited plaintiffs attorneys to submit statements a explaining their contributions to the common benefit of the class and b evaluating the contributions of other attorneys.it appears that the fee committee already possessed the attorneys time and expense statements because counsel had requested these statements around august,presumably to help calculate the aggregate attorneys fee award for the class action settlement.the record on appeal,however,does not include the time and expense statements of any plaintiffs counsel except those of appellants frank silvestri,john massicot,peter derbes,stephen murray,stephen murray,appellants,and ronnie penton 
the fee committee presented its proposed fee allocation to the district court on january,at an ex parte status conference.none of the other plaintiffs attorneys,including appellants,were notified of the hearing,nor were they shown the allocation proposal or the proposed order approving the committee allocation of fees and costs 
also unbeknownst to the other attorneys,the proposed order went far beyond the allocation of fees.the order a placed under seal the document prepared by the fee committee listing each attorney fee award exhibit a b prohibited each plaintiffs attorney from disclosing to anyone,including his clients and other attorneys,the amount of his award under penalty of sanctions to be imposed by the court c required fees,costs,and expenses to be distributed immediately d mandated that fee award checks bear a full and final release and e established the district court process for dealing with any objections to fee awards 
the transcript of the ex parte hearing and the court fee allocation order suggest that the fee committee provided the court with documentation to support its recommendation.for example,the district court stated during the ex parte hearing that it had received each individual attorney responses.the court also indicated that the fee committee had given the court material in connection with the hearing.further,the order states the court was provided with the documentation submitted as well as a report from the fee committee.contrary to these vague statements,the record on appeal includes no responses from any attorneys other than appellants,and it lacks any material,documentation,or report from the fee committee other than exhibit a and the proposed order.
at the ex parte hearing,the district court asked the fee committee why it wanted the court to seal the fee allocation list.barrett responded that keeping the individual fee awards confidential would prevent lawyers from fighting over awards that they could not compare.he asserted that during the past ten to fifteen years other judges have go ne with this confidentiality dynamic.barrett specifically cited another federal district court in louisiana that had recently placed under seal the fee allocation list associated with its order awarding individual attorneys fees 
the district court also asked the fee committee about the process it used to make its fee allocation recommendations.arsenault and barrett responded that the fee committee considered,among other things,the benefits of the attorneys work to the class as a whole and their hourly billing rates.barrett highlighted two firms whose recommended fee allocations were lower than their requests.he asserted that these firms really did do anything for the common benefit and caused us trouble and caused the plaintiffs almost killing the settlement.barrett was referring to the appellants,silvestri and derbes,who almost killed the settlement by sending a letter to their clients about the proposed settlement that caused of them to.barrett did not point out that this situation had been resolved by sending a curative notice to these clients,and most of them ultimately chose not to of the settlement.
pertinent to the murray appellants,barrett said nothing explicit but left the district court with the impression that all plaintiffs firms other than silvestri and derbes had received compensation based on the hours and hourly billing rates they submitted to the fee committee and a multiplier.barrett implication was inaccurate,however.the murray firm received a fee check for,inclusive of costs,a sum representing far less than the fee the firm claims based on its hours,billing rates,and a multiplier of.
the hearing with the fee committee lasted only twenty minutes.at the end of the hearing,the court sealed the hearing transcript.later on the same day,the district court without proposed order embodying both the proposed attorneys fees and the procedural limitations on challenges.the order awarded almost half of the million fee to the five members of the fee committee and their law firms.appellants were awarded less than they had requested.soon thereafter,appellants requested the district court to reconsider its order and unseal exhibit a,the fee allocation list.
the court held an in camera hearing on these motions at which appellants and members of the fee committee presented oral arguments on march.at the hearing,the court stated that it considered all of the factors set forth in johnson georgia highway express,cir with regard to each attorney when it approved the fee allocation.the court later sealed the docket minute entry for the hearing and the hearing transcript it also entered a sealed order allowing the parties to file supplemental memoranda and requiring the fee committee and the appellants to meet and report back to the court.
on april,the court entered a sealed order denying the motions to reconsider and refusing to unseal exhibit appellants silvestri,massicot,derbes,murray,and murray,and caroll farmer,a class member,filed a notice of appeal the district court subsequently entered orders unsealing exhibit a and various other documents.this court granted appellants motion to instruct the district court to supplement the record on appeal with all documents and submissions reviewed by the district court prior to making its fee allocation order 
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court attorneys fee awards for abuse of discretion.strong bellsouth,cir.to constitute an abuse of discretion,the district court decision must be either premised on an erroneous application of the law,or on an assessment of the evidence that is clearly erroneous.grigson creative artists agency,cir.we must determine whether the record clearly indicates that the district court has utilized the johnson framework as the basis of its analysis,has not proceeded in a summary fashion,and has arrived at an amount that can be said to be just compensation.forbush penney,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
our review here is limited to one issue the procedures the district court used to allocate the million attorneys fee award among plaintiffs counsel.because we must vacate and remand,we do not address whether the individual awards to the appellants were fair and reasonable.
iii.discussion 
appellants contend that the court abused its discretion because it used flawed procedures to award individual attorneys fees and to review objections to those fees.we agree.for all practical purposes the fee committee controlled the allocation of attorneys fees in this case.in this circuit,a district court can in its discretion appoint a committee of plaintiffs counsel to recommend how to divide up an aggregate fee award.longden sunderman,cir.but the appointment of a committee does not relieve a district court of its responsibility to closely scrutinize the attorneys fee allocation,especially when the attorneys recommending the allocation have a financial interest in the resulting awards.here,the district court abdicated its responsibility to ensure that the individual awards recommended by the fee committee were fair and reasonable.the court used flawed fee allocation procedures that are inconsistent with class action principles and basic judicial standards of transparency and fairness.the following discussion explains the court deviation from established class action principles,the federal rules of civil procedure,and fifth circuit caselaw.
class action principles 
in a class action settlement,the district court has an independent duty under federal rule of civil procedure to the class and the public to ensure that attorneys fees are reasonable and divided up fairly among plaintiffs counsel.see,strong,at to fully discharge its duty to review and approve class action settlement agreements,a district court must assess the reasonableness of the attorneys fees.manual for complex litigation ed.the court must distribute the fee award among the various plaintiffs attorneys,which may include class counsel,lead and liaison counsel,and individual plaintiff counsel.the court duty to review attorneys fees is no less compelling in common fund cases like this case,where a separate fund to pay attorneys fees is created as part of the class action settlement.see strong,at.
the district court close scrutiny of fee awards serves to protect the nonparty members of the class from unjust or unfair settlements affecting their rights as well as to minimize conflicts that may arise between the attorney and the class,between the named plaintiffs and the absentees,and between various subclasses.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.the court review also guards against the public perception that attorneys exploit the class action device to obtain large fees at the expense of the class.id.citing in re gm trucks,at emphasizing that the court oversight function serves to deflect the potential public misunderstandings that they may cultivate in regard to the interests of class counsel internal quotations and citations omitted foster,aff,cir explaining that the court has the obligation in any rule class action to protect the class action device from misuse because the most commonly feared abuse is the possibility that rule encourages strike suits promoted by attorneys who simply are seeking fat fees internal quotations and citations omitted.
to fulfill its duty,the district court must not cursorily approve the attorneys fee provision of a class settlement or delegate that duty to the parties.strong,at.although exacting judicial review of fee applications may be burdensome,it is necessary to discharge the court obligation to award fees that are reasonable and consistent with governing law.manual for complex litigation ed.this circuit requires district courts to use the lodestar method to assess attorneys fees in class action suits.strong,at.the district court must first determine the reasonable number of hours expended on the litigation and the reasonable hourly rate for the participating attorney.id.the lodestar is then computed by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate.id.the district court may adjust the lodestar upward or downward after a review of the twelve factors set forth in johnson.forbush,at.after the court calculates the lodestar,it must scrutinize a fee award under the johnson factors and not merely ratify a compact.piambino bailey,cir holding that by summarily approving attorneys fees presented in an unopposed settlement agreement,the district court abdicated its responsibility to assess the reasonableness of the attorneys fees proposed under a settlement of a class action,and its approval of the settlement must be reversed on this ground alone.
when a district court awards attorneys fees it must explain how each of the johnson factors affects its award.see longden,at.its johnson analysis need not be meticulously detailed to survive appellate review.forbush,at.if the district court has articulated and clearly applied the correct criteria,we will not require the trial court findings to be so excruciatingly explicit in this area of minutiae that decisions of fee awards consume more paper than did the cases from which they arose.louisiana power light kellstrom,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.nonetheless,the district court findings and reasons must be complete enough to assume a review which can determine whether the court has used proper factual criteria in exercising its discretion to fix just compensation.brantley surles,cir.
in this case,although no objection had been filed,the district court independently assessed the reasonableness of the million attorneys fee award and considered the johnson factors when it approved the class action settlement.unfortunately,it failed to fulfill its further duty to monitor legal fees by its perfunctory approval of the allocation determined by the fee committee.the record indicates that the court received the fee committee proposed fee allocation and order around at the ex parte hearing on january.during the ensuing twenty minutes,the court questioned members of the fee committee about the allocation and order.no sworn testimony was taken,no depositions were offered,and no affidavits were filed attesting to the accuracy or fairness of the proposed fee allocation.further,because the hearing was ex parte,other plaintiffs attorneys,including appellants,were not present to confirm or challenge the fee committee statements about their contributions to the case.after the hearing ended,the court spent at most one afternoon considering the fee committee proposed allocation and order before approving them the record speaks for itself.instead of closely scrutinizing the fee committee allocation,the court the committee recommendation.
the court made matters worse when it sealed the exhibit listing the individual fees and the record entries pertaining to fees and placed a gag order on the plaintiffs attorneys.these actions not only kept the public in the dark about each plaintiffs attorney award but also prevented counsel from communicating with each other and with their own clients on the subject.the lack of transparency about the individual fee awards supports a perception that many of these attorneys were more interested in accommodating themselves than the people they represent 
two major errors pervade the court process.first,despite the court statements at the ex parte hearing that it considered the johnson factors,the record offers little substantiation that the court actually reviewed the individual fee awards.the district court set forth no factual findings and reasons to support its awards of individual attorneys fees.the court order merely recites without application the twelve johnson factors and a laundry list of other relevant considerations moreover,the record is bereft of factual information essential to the conduct of a johnson analysis as well as appellate review.the record lacks the attorneys time and expense statements letters,comments,hourly billing rates,and other materials allegedly submitted by the fee committee to the district court on or before the ex parte hearing on january.see manual for complex litigation ed.in advance of any hearing,counsel should submit time and expense records,to the extent not previously submitted with the motion and in manageable and comprehensible form.nor does the record contain a breakdown of the hours and rates claimed by each attorney or their respective lodestars.in other words,the record strongly suggests that at the time of the ex parte hearing the court possessed no documents,other than the fee committee proposed fee allocation,upon which it could base factual findings for awards of individual attorneys fees.
this circuit,as will be discussed infra,does not forbid a district court to rely on fee allocation proposals submitted by attorneys.the proposals must,however,be factually supportable and consistent with the johnson factors.because the factual basis of the court fee allocation remains unknown,this court can not approve it.
second,a district court has the discretion to seal a record,but we think that this discretion should be used with care and exercised only where the justifications for doing so appear considerably stronger than those presented by the fee committee.in re equal employment opportunity commission,cir.the only justification posited for sealing the record here is to discourage internecine fee sharing disputes among the plaintiffs lawyers.this is a weak and unconvincing reason for dispensing with the public nature of our judicial proceedings.sealing the record protects no legitimate privacy interest that would overcome the public right to be informed.
on a broad public level,fee disputes,like other litigation with millions at stake,ought to be litigated openly.attorneys fees,after all,are not state secrets that will jeopardize national security if they are released to the public.as the third circuit has noted,p ublic confidence in our judicial system can not long be maintained where important judicial decisions are made behind closed doors and then announced in conclusive terms to the public,with the record supporting the court decision sealed from public view.united states cianfrani,cir.from the perspective of class welfare,publicizing the process leading to attorneys fee allocation may discourage favoritism and unsavory dealings among attorneys even as it enables the court better to conduct oversight of the fees.if the attorneys are inclined to squabble over the generous fee award,they are well positioned to each other relative contribution to the litigation.
federal rules of civil procedure 
the fee allocation procedures used by the district court also failed to comply with the federal rules of civil procedure.first,the court order awarding attorneys fees violated rule a,which imposes a automatic stay on the enforcement of judgments.see.a.contrary to this rule,the order required that the fee awards be distributed immediately.this is not a trivial deviation.indeed,it appears designed to forestall fee disputes by creating an incentive for the attorneys to take their money and run as soon as they signed the release of claims.more significant,immediate payments erect a serious obstacle to fees,should the court later alter its award.the court,as its order acknowledges,would be placed in the difficult position of collecting pro rata sums from dozens of attorneys.immediate payment essentially discouraged the court from trying to unscramble an unfair or erroneous initial allocation.
second,the court violated rule h,which permits but does not require a district court to hold a hearing on a motion for attorneys fees in a class action.see.h.if a court chooses to hold a hearing,the hearing format itself ha s to be fair.in other words,when a judge constructs a process for setting fees,the process must contain at least the procedural minima of due process notice and an opportunity to be heard.in re nineteen appeals arising out of san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir reversing fee award in consolidated case in which lawyers from steering committee were permitted to testify,examine witnesses,and offer oral argument at evidentiary hearing,but other lawyers representing individual clients were not see also in re fine paper antitrust,cir stating that the hearing on a fee application in an equitable fund case requires compliance with those procedural rules which assure fair notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard.equally plainly,the requirement of an evidentiary hearing demands the application in that hearing of the federal rules of evidence alan hirsch diane sheehey,fed.judicial,awarding attorneys fees and managing fee litigation ed.if a hearing is held,the court should ensure that all attorneys staking a claim to fees are given a reasonable opportunity to be heard.
while holding a hearing may be discretionary,the decision to convene an ex parte hearing was plainly unauthorized.committee members were entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.the court commented to the fee committee that the ex parte hearing might raise due process concerns among absent attorneys.its fears were fully justified because the fee committee exploited its opportunity to explain the proposed allocation at the ex parte hearing without challenge and without proof of barrett statements denigrating appellants contributions for the common benefit.nor were barrett and barnow,the counsel,called upon to explain the coincidence that under the johnson factors they were entitled to identical fees.
nonetheless,appellees contend that appellants agreed to a fee allocation process involving ex parte hearings because they did not object to the court appointment of a fee committee.we disagree.ex parte proceedings are an exception to the rule in our judicial system and contrary to its adversarial nature.see,mckinney paskett,the petitioner in this civil proceeding seeks unilateral in camera secrecy.this clearly flies in conflict with the rules of civil procedure which allow ex parte hearings only in emergency matters.attorneys can not simply agree to hold secret hearings before the court.moreover,the attorneys in this case made no agreement that ex parte hearings would be part of the fee allocation process.the court order appointing the fee committee included no such provision,and there is no basis to infer an agreement.
appellees also contend that the court procedures for hearing or reconsidering objections to fee awards provided appellants an adequate opportunity to be heard.they did not.because the court sealed the fee allocation list and placed a gag order on plaintiffs attorneys,appellants could not compare their awards to those of other attorneys they were not furnished with the hours and rates that other attorneys submitted or informed of the fee committee process,yet such information was essential to enable them to challenge how the fee committee valued their work.see in re vitamins antitrust,d,lead counsel responsible for fee allocation must apply a universally fair standard of allocation to all participants,including itself.one can not even compare apples to oranges without knowing what the oranges are.
the district court was similarly handicapped in its review of appellants objections to their fee awards.the order approving the fee committee allocation limited the court review of a fee award to its specific circumstances and the relationship between the award and the attorney contributions to the common benefit of the class the court should not have so limited itself and should have been able to compare the contributions of all plaintiffs attorneys in order to determine if the fee allocation was equitable.after all,a llocation means proportion how does the share one counsel is taking compare to the shares others are getting in re vitamins antitrust,d at.because appellants were deprived of information necessary to contest their fee awards,and the court review did not allow comparison between appellants and other attorneys awards,the procedures for reviewing appellant objections were inherently flawed 
in re copley pharmaceutical,d,aff,cir hereinafter copley,a case cited by appellees,illuminates the deficiencies in the court procedures.copley was a class action in which the district court appointed a fee committee to recommend the allocation of a fee award.after a contested hearing at which the court approved the fee committee proposal,several attorneys objected to their awards in response to the objections the court held a de novo hearing,received motions,and reviewed time and expense statements and other materials.the court did not limit its review to the fee awards and contributions of the objectors.instead,it reviewed the entire fee allocation and all attorneys contributions because its order approving the fee allocation had been brief,the court wrote a detailed decision explaining its review of the fee allocation and why it concluded the allocation was correct.the court decision applied the johnson factors.it also set forth findings and reasons explaining its allocations to lead counsel,who ran the fee committee and received the largest awards,and the objectors.the methodology followed by the copley court is a helpful model for other district courts.
attorneys fee awards in the fifth circuit 
appellees defend the court unorthodox procedures by relying on longden,supra,in which this court sustained a district court reliance on the fee allocation proposed by a committee of plaintiffs lawyers.longden is clearly distinguishable and of narrower applicability than appellees suggest.in longden,this court held that a district court acted within its discretion when it awarded a fee award and then let plaintiffs counsel,except for one objecting attorney,allocate the award by agreement among themselves.at.the court determined the objector individual fee award because she objected to aggregate fee award petition to the court.her award was taken out of the award for all attorneys.to calculate the objector individual fee award and determine the fee award,the court reviewed the time and expense records of all plaintiffs counsel,applying the johnson factors and making findings sufficiently based on record evidence.id.longden highlights the district court duty to scrutinize the allocation of a fee award when an attorney objects to his fee award recommendations.it does not stand for the proposition that courts can delegate their duty to allocate a fee award to a committee of interested attorneys who have reached no agreement among themselves and then approve the allocation after a perfunctory review.
appellees cite several district court cases from this circuit in which courts followed the procedure approved in longden awarding a attorneys fee and allowing counsel to divide up the award by agreement.see,turner murphy oil usa,d,that fee allocation procedure,however,is significantly different from the procedures used here.it is one thing for all attorneys to come to an agreement about dividing up fees,and quite another for five attorneys to declare how an award will cover themselves and other attorneys with no meaningful judicial supervision or review.
appellees also cite a number of cases,largely from other circuits,in which courts have appointed committees of attorneys to propose a fee allocation to the court for its consideration.see,copley,d at.we do not dispute the utility of initial delegation,which is not required but is within the district court discretion.there is no indication,however,that the district courts in other cases dispensed with traditional judicial standards of transparency,impartiality,procedural fairness,and ultimate judicial oversight as the court in this case did.even in re eunice train derailment,the case mentioned by the fee committee at the ex parte hearing to justify placing the fee allocation list under seal,shows that other courts are not doing what appellees convinced the court to do here.
like the court in this case,the court in in re eunice train derailment appointed a fee committee to recommend an allocation,placed its fee allocation list under seal,and prohibited plaintiffs attorneys from disclosing their fee awards.but,unlike this case,the court required attorneys to submit their contemporaneous time records to a special master.the court order limited the gag order to sixty days finally,the court ordered fee distribution to occur only after attorneys were told their fee awards and after the deadlines for objection or appeal had expired.here,in contrast,there was no disinterested court officer,such as a special master,working with the fee committee to review attorneys time and expense statements the fee record was placed under seal indefinitely and attorneys were also barred indefinitely from disclosing their awards and fees were ordered to be paid immediately,before any challenges could be filed.
appellees contend that the functional value of appointing a committee of attorneys to propose a fee allocation in complex litigation is significant,and the danger of abuse is small,when judged in light of the guiding effect of judicial supervision.it is likely that lead counsel may be in a better position than the court to evaluate the contributions of all counsel seeking recovery of fees.but our precedents do not permit courts simply to defer to a fee allocation proposed by a select committee of attorneys,in no small part,because counsel have inherent conflicts.in re diet drugs products liab,cir ambro,concurring.as judge ambro noted,they make recommendations on their own fees and thus have a financial interest in the outcome.how much deference is due the fox who recommends how to divvy up the chickens id.
here,members of the fee committee had a direct conflict of interest they were suggesting to the district court how to proceed on matters near and a limited fund among themselves and other firms.such a direct conflict of interest strongly suggests that affording substantial deference is inappropriate.id.at.although the proposed allocation may ultimately be fair,careful attention must be paid to the procedures by which the allocation is set.if a district court chooses to rely on the recommendations of a committee of interested attorneys,it then becomes necessary to scrutinize more closely those recommendations.id.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court order awarding individual attorneys fees and its order denying appellants motion for reconsideration.on remand,the district court shall determine,on an adequate factual record and by application of the johnson factors,the adequacy of the fee committee recommended allocation and the fee requests of any attorneys who choose to object.in particular,the court shall compare,as needed,counsels respective contributions for the common benefit.no sealing or ex parte communications will be permitted.the final award shall be sufficiently supported with written reasons to facilitate judicial review.
the order of the district court is thus vacated and remanded with instructions.
i concur in the judgment,and i agree generally with this description of the procedure required for the fee allocation.the procedure was not followed appellants were given no opportunity to study and dispute the allocation,the district court has not explained the allocations,and we have no record to permit our review.
it does appear to me that class counsel performed excellent work to obtain in excess of million for the class.those attorneys who contributed to that recovery are entitled to receive fees based on the quantity and quality of effort expended for that purpose.and other lawyers for members of the class are also entitled to receive compensation for their efforts to serve that purpose.the allocation may be initiated by those attorneys who actual
