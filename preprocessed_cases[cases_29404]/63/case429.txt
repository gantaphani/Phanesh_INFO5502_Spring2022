this case represents the first time in more than twenty years that the federal mine safety and health review commission has overturned a decision by the secretary of labor to cite the of a mine,as well as its independent contractor,for safety violations committed by the contractor.this court has long recognized the secretary discretionary authority to cite the,the independent contractor,or both for contractor violations.because the mine act provides no meaningful standards against which to judge the secretary decisions regarding which party to cite,the commission is generally without authority to review such decisions.we therefore grant the secretary petition for review and vacate the commission ruling.
the mine act requires the secretary of labor,acting through the mine safety and health administration msha,to promulgate mandatory safety and health standards for the mining industry and to conduct regular mine inspections,a.if a msha inspector discovers conditions that violate safety or health standards,of the act directs the secretary to issue a citation or an order to the mine operator.a.the act defines an operator as any owner,lessee,or other person who operates,controls,or supervises a mine or any independent contractor performing services or construction at such mine.d emphasis added.the entities listed before the italicized or are also known as.
the federal mine safety and health review commission fmsrhc is an independent agency charged with adjudicating disputes under the mine act,including disputes over whether safety standards have been violated.see.the commission appoints administrative law judges aljs to conduct proceedings to hear such disputes.see d.any person aggrieved by a decision of an alj may request discretionary review by the commission,see d a i,and any person aggrieved by an order of the commission may obtain review in this court,see a.
twentymile owns and operates the foidel creek mine,an underground coal mine in routt county,colorado.in its capacity as,twentymile often uses independent contractors to undertake various projects at the mine.on august,twentymile hired precision excavating,an independent contractor,to perform work on a refuse pile.
on august,msha inspector michael havrilla conducted an inspection of the surface areas of the foidel creek mine.during the course of his inspection,havrilla observed that the equipment used by precision employees violated six safety standards.among the violations were a leaking diesel fuel tank on a pan scraper,and a opening on a service truck air compressor that permitted contact with the drive belts and pulley.when havrilla discussed the violations with a precision employee,he learned that twentymile had not examined the contractor equipment prior to its use at the mine.see secretary of labor twentymile,hereinafter alj decision.fearing that precision violations might augur an increase in contractor violations,havrilla decided that issuing citations to both precision and twentymile was the best way to guarantee mine safety.see id.at.
precision,the independent contractor,did not contest the citations and paid the penalty assessed against it by msha.twentymile,however,contested the citations and the attendant penalty.in a hearing before an alj,twentymile stipulated that the conditions described in the citations constituted violations of the mine act,but argued that it was improper for the secretary to cite it for violations committed by precision.see id.at.
on july,the alj ruled in the secretary favor.citing commission precedent,the alj held that,in instances of multiple operators,the secretary has wide enforcement discretion and may,in general,proceed against an,his contractor,or both.alj decision,at quoting secretary of labor mingo logan coal.the alj found no abuse of discretion with respect to the secretary decision to cite twentymile as well as precision.see id.at.although he recognized the nonbinding nature of enforcement guidelines issued by the secretary to identify when to charge an,the alj found that the citations easily fit within the guidelines.id.at see id.at referring to enforcement policy and guidelines for independent contractors,app.a to independent contractors,july,hereinafter enforcement guidelines in particular,the alj found that twentymile failure to inspect the equipment or ensure that the contractor inspected the equipment was an omission that contributed to the violations,and that twentymile exercised sufficient control over the scraper and service truck to warrant a citation.alj decision,at.the alj also credited the msha inspector statement that he was concerned that safety hazards on contractors equipment were not being adequately addressed because the cited conditions were rather obvious,and that by issuing citations to twentymile,the safety violations would get more immediate attention than if he only cited the contractor.id.at.
twentymile appealed the alj decision to the commission.see secretary of labor twentymile coal,hereinafter commission decision.the company asserted that,under the mine act,an is liable only for its own violations,and that the secretary was therefore without authority to cite it for the violations of its independent contractor.see id.at.the secretary responded that court and commission precedents were directly to the contrary.see id.she further argued that her decision to cite twentymile for precision violations was not reviewable by the commission because there was no meaningful standard against which to review her exercise of charging discretion.see id.at.in the event that the commission deemed her enforcement decision reviewable,the secretary argued in the alternative that the citation was not an abuse of discretion.see id.at.
the commission reversed the alj decision and vacated the citations issued to twentymile.see commission decision,at.its opinion began by agreeing with the secretary and the alj view that the secretary generally may proceed against an,an independent contractor,or both,for violations by the independent contractor.id.at.nonetheless,the commission rejected the secretary contention that her exercise of enforcement discretion was unreviewable.see id.at.and a majority of the commission concluded that the secretary had abused her discretion by citing twentymile.see id.at.according to the majority,the secretary decision to cite the was an abuse of discretion because it was not made for reasons consistent with the purpose and policies of the mine act.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.this was so,the commission said,because t he record show ed that the independent contractor was in the best position to prevent the violations in question,id.at twentymile did not have a significant,continuing involvement in the work specifically being performed at the refuse pile,id.at twentymile did not contribute to the violations directly or through a significant omission,id.at and none of the criteria listed in the secretary enforcement guidelines was satisfied at a significant threshold level,id.at 
the secretary of labor now petitions this court for review of the commission decision to vacate the citations filed against twentymile.she contends that the commission erred in holding that her decision to cite twentymile for violations committed by precision was reviewable should we hold otherwise,the secretary contends that her decision was not an abuse of discretion.twentymile disputes both contentions,and it further challenges what it describes as the premise of the secretary nonreviewability argument that she has authority to cite an for safety violations committed by its independent contractor.because the secretary authority is indeed the premise of her argument,we consider that issue first and then proceed to examine the issue of reviewability.
we can make relatively short work of the question of the secretary authority to cite for violations committed by their contractors because it is a question that this circuit has already answered.indeed,twentymile concedes that decisions from this court grant the secretary the discretion to cite both the and the independent contractor for the violation of the independent contractor.respondents br.although twentymile urges us to rule to the contrary,such a disposition is plainly beyond the power of a panel of this court.see,ranger cellular fcc.
this circuit seminal opinion regarding the authority of the secretary is brock cathedral bluffs shale oil,scalia.there,the court observed the mine act declares that the operators of the nation mines have primary responsibility for preventing the existence of unsafe and unhealthful conditions,e,and throughout the act the entity charged with compliance is referred to simply as the operator.id.at citing a,a,a i.to determine the meaning of the term operator,the court reviewed the legislative history of the mine act,first noting that the federal coal mine health and safety act of mine act operator as any owner,lessee or other person who operates,controls,or supervises a coal mine.id.quoting d.the court next pointed out that,in bituminous coal operators ass secretary of interior bcoa,cir,the fourth circuit interpreted that definition of operator to include independent contractors performing services at the mine,and held that the secretary had the power to cite the independent contractor,the operator,or both for independent contractor violations.at.the court then noted that,when congress enacted the mine act,it amended the definition of operator by adding inter alia the italicized phrase 
o perator means any owner,lessee,or other person who operates,controls,or supervises a coal or other mine or any independent contractor performing services or construction at such mine.
d emphasis added see cathedral bluffs,at.finally,cathedral bluffs explained the senate report accompanying the bill that became the mine act stated that the purpose of this amendment was to give statutory expression to the doctrine of bcoa.at citing,at,cong.
two years after cathedral bluffs,in international union,united mine workers of america fmshrc umwa,we observed that all of the courts that have had occasion to address the question have held that multiple operators are jointly liable under the act,o r,put differently,the owner of a mine is liable without regard to its own fault for violations committed or dangers created by its independent contractor,citing cyprus indus.minerals fmshrc,cir harman mining fmshrc,cir bcoa,at.we found this holding to be in accord with both the legislative history as reviewed in cathedral bluffs and the statutory language as explained in bcoa 
without exemption or exclusion,makes the operator of a coal mine in which a violation occurs subject to a civil penalty th is section,when read with the definition of operator,impose s liability on the owner or lessee of a mine regardless of who violated the act 
id.at quoting bcoa,at we therefore agree d with those other courts,holding that the mine act assesses liability without regard to the individual operator fault.id.at.moreover,s ince liability under the mine act is without regard to fault,we declared that the argument that only an operator directly responsible for the violation can be liable must be rejected.id.at.and for the same reason,we must reject twentymile contention that it can not be liable for the safety violations committed by precision.
having concluded that the secretary of labor has authority to cite an for safety violations committed by its contractor,we next consider whether twentymile may contest the secretary discretionary decision to do so.because the reviewability of the secretary charging decision is a legal question,we decide the issue de novo.see secretary of labor keystone coal mining.
although there is a strong presumption that agency action is reviewable,see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d abbott labs.gardner,d,the administrative procedure act apa codifies the traditional exception that agency action is not reviewable when it is committed to agency discretion by law.a see heckler chaney,d.in overton park,the supreme court declared that this exception to the presumption of reviewability applies in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.as the court subsequently explained in heckler chaney,review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.at.in such circumstances,the courts have no legal norms pursuant to which to evaluate the challenged action,and thus no concrete limitations to impose on the agency exercise of discretion.drake faa.
in determining whether a matter has been committed solely to agency discretion,we consider both the nature of the administrative action at issue and the language and structure of the statute that supplies the applicable legal standards for reviewing that action.drake,at.both the supreme court and this court have held that certain categories of administrative decisions are unreviewable.see,lincoln vigil,d chaney,at.drake,at.in chaney,for example,the court held that agency decisions not to institute enforcement proceedings are presumptively unreviewable.see at.contrary to twentymile view,however,refusals to act are not the only kinds of administrative determinations that evade review 
indeed,with respect to criminal charging decisions,the supreme court has made clear that the government decision as to whom to prosecute is generally unreviewable.wayte united states,d.s o long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute,the decision whether or not to prosecute,and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury,generally rests entirely in his discretion.id.quoting bordenkircher hayes,d see united states armstrong,d same in re sealed case,in the ordinary case,the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,at the very core of the executive function,has long been held presumptively unreviewable.the court explained the considerations behind this view in wayte 
this broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly to judicial review.such factors as the strength of the case,the prosecution general deterrence value,the government enforcement priorities,and the case relationship to the government overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.
at.these considerations apply as well to the administrative charging decisions of the secretary of labor.and we have previously found the traditional nonreviewability of prosecutorial charging decisions applicable to administrative cases.see drake,at holding that the faa action in this case was analogous to an exercise of prosecutorial discretion,and noting that when prosecutorial discretion is at issue,the matter is presumptively committed to agency discretion by law beverly health rehab,feinstein,holding that the nlrb general counsel decision to issue an unfair labor practice complaint is unreviewable because,inter alia,review would invade the realm of prosecutorial discretion.
of course,if the mine act provided a meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion,the situation would be different.chaney,d.if the act provided such a standard,whether this case involves a presumption of nonreviewability under chaney or,instead,a presumption of reviewability under overton park,would not be dispositive.drake,at.that is because chaney presumption against judicial review may be rebutted where the relevant statute supplies meaningful standards to cabin the agency otherwise plenary discretion,while overton park presumption of reviewability is lost where it does not.id.at see lincoln,at.chaney,at.
but the mine act does not provide a meaningful standard.under the act,the secretary charging discretion is as uncabined as that of a united states attorney under the criminal code.section a simply provides that i f,upon inspection or investigation,the secretary or his authorized representative believes that an operator of a coal or other mine subject to this chapter has violated this chapter,he shall,with reasonable promptness,issue a cit
