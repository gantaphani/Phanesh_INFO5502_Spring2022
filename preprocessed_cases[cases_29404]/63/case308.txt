thomas mcdonald,marian mcdonald and alex mcdonald appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of sun oil company,sunoco,and cordero mining company collectively,sun.the mcdonalds sued sun for,among other things,negligence,contribution,breach of contract and fraud.each of these claims arose out of an alleged oral warranty that certain crushed rock at the horse heaven mine property horse heaven,a disused mercury mine,was free of mercury.the district court held that oregon statute of repose barred the mcdonalds negligence claim,that their claim for contribution failed to comply with an administrative requirement,that their breach of contract claim failed because of the merger doctrine and the parol evidence rule,and that their fraud claim failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for trial.
background 
in,ray whiting and harry hoy developed the horse heaven mine and operated it until.from to,the mine was owned and intermittently operated by sun.sun permanently ceased mining operations at horse heaven in.in,among over acres of property in jefferson county,oregon,sun conveyed horse heaven to thomas and marian mcdonald via a bargain and sale deed.in the deed conveying the property to the mcdonalds,sun reserved all of the oil,gas,and other mineral rights in the property to itself,but specifically excluded rights to surface materials which are used for or construction purposes,such as calcine except such quantities as are reasonably used or useful in the enjoyment of sun reserved rights.er.at the time of this purchase,the horse heaven property contained a large pile or piles of calcine tailings.
calcine is a waste product resulting from the processing of mercury ore into mercury.mercury sulfide ore is mined,crushed,and heated in a furnace or retort to separate mercury from the ore.after the heating process is complete,the crushed rock,now called calcine,is stockpiled.at horse heaven,the calcine tailings were deposited in a pile or piles on the surface of the property surrounding the mine.some mercury still remains in the calcine at horse heaven.however,the parties dispute the amount and potential harmfulness of the remaining mercury.
prior to the sale of the property,thomas mcdonald met with ray whiting and sun wally freeman at the mine to discuss the potential sale.in his deposition,mcdonald testified that while they were standing on the calcine pile prior to the sale,freeman told him that because the retort process extracted mercury and other heavy metals from the ore,there was no mercury in the calcine.during that same conversation,mcdonald told freeman that he intended to use the calcine for road construction or to sell it commercially as decorative rock.
in,the mcdonalds sold all the jefferson county property except for the forty acres comprising the former horse heaven mine.in,the mcdonalds transferred these forty acres to ray whiting and his wife.whiting later conveyed his interest in the property to his daughter and grandson.the deed to whiting reserved to mcdonalds the rights to the calcine tailings until.on several occasions,mcdonald brought some of the calcine to his personal residence and placed it on his driveway and parking lot.
in,the oregon department of environmental quality deq requested information regarding possible contamination at horse heaven,and in determined that the mcdonalds handling of the calcine tailings had created an environmental release.the mcdonalds were then ordered to refrain from removing or disturbing the calcine piles at horse heaven without deq approval.the mcdonalds allege that they did not learn that the calcine was potentially contaminated until.
on august,the mcdonalds sued sun in oregon state court.on november,sun removed the case to the united states district court for the district of oregon.on march,the district court granted summary judgment against the mcdonalds on all their claims.this appeal followed.the mcdonalds appeal only the district court rulings granting summary judgment to sun on their negligence,contribution,contract,and fraud claims.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.valley surgical supply,johnson johnson,cir citing lopez smith,cir en banc.a factual dispute is genuine only if a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the nonmoving party.a mere scintilla of evidence supporting a nonmovant position is insufficient to withstand summary judgment.in re ahaza,cir quoting galen county of,cir.
iii.discussion 
negligence 
the district court granted sun motion for summary judgment on the mcdonalds negligence claim,holding that the claim is barred by oregon statute of repose for negligent injury to person or property.the mcdonalds argue that the court below erred in applying the oregon statute because section of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla of,grafts a discovery rule onto state statutes of limitations we agree.the district court held that cercla does not apply because is a statute of repose,not a statute of limitations.however,the term statute of limitations in cercla is ambiguous and the legislative history of the section indicates that its meaning includes statutes of repose like.
statutes of limitations and repose are distinct legal concepts with distinct effects.a statute of limitations requires a lawsuit to be filed within a specified period of time after a legal right has been violated on the other hand,statutes of repose are designed to bar actions after a specified period of time has run from the occurrence of some event other than the injury which gave rise to the claim.raithaus of america,utah.statutes of limitations 
preclude the plaintiff from proceeding,the right moral or legal goes on,but the plaintiff simply can not go to court in order to enforce it a statute of repose,however,has a more substantive effect because it can bar a suit even before the cause of action could have accrued,or,for that matter,retroactively after the cause of action has accrued.in proper circumstances,it can be said to destroy the right itself.it is not concerned with the plaintiff diligence it is concerned with the defendant peace.
underwood cotton,hyundai,cir internal citations omitted referring to the distinctions between the two types of statute as arcane.
the difference is manifest in oregon statutory scheme.for example,not at issue in this case,is a statute of limitations,providing that a n action for any injury to the person or rights of another,not arising on contract shall be commenced within two years under this statute,it is evident that injury must be experienced before the time limit starts to run because an action can not be commenced until after the injury element of the prima facie case is satisfied.however,the statute of repose at issue here,states that i n no event shall any action for negligent injury to person or property of another be commenced more than years from the date of the act or omission complained of.this statute does not require injury before it operates.therefore,if applies to the nearly thirty year old negligence claim in this case,and does not operate to impose a discovery rule upon it,that claim is barred.
plain meaning ambiguity 
the first step in construing the meaning of a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain meaning.the preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.thus,our inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.bedroc,llc united states,d internal citations omitted.it should not be presum ed that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed.id.at.section contains five uses of the term statute of limitations,but no use of statute of repose.sun argues that statute of limitations has a plain meaning which excludes statutes of repose from its ambit.therefore,according to sun,it would be improper for a court to graft the words and repose onto the already clear language of.t he proper inquiry focuses on the ordinary meaning of the provision at the time congress enacted it,and thus the appropriate question is whether statute of limitations was ambiguous when was passed.bedroc,at.citing amoco prod.ute tribe,d see also perrin united states,d a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.in addition,it is the plain meaning or ambiguity of cercla,not the state statute involved,that this inquiry is concerned with 
the term statute of limitations was ambiguous regarding whether it included statutes of repose when was enacted in.at that time,although some cases recognized the differences between statutes of limitation and repose,a number of cases confused the terms or used them interchangeably in the legal context,ambiguity is defined as a n uncertainty of meaning or intention.black law dictionary ed.here,considerable uncertainty about the distinction existed in because of this ambiguity it is evident that the term statute of limitations had no plain meaning with respect to whether it included statutes of repose when was adopted it will therefore be necessary for the court to examine the statute legislative history in order to determine congress intent at the time of its adoption.
burlington northern 
the district court based its decision that the plain language of does not extend to statutes of repose on burlington santa fe poole chem,cir.burlington northern involved two large above ground storage tanks in slanton,texas,that were sold by skinner tank company skinner to poole chemical company poole,an agricultural blender,on october.id.at.on january,one of the tanks ruptured,releasing several hundred thousand gallons of chemicals onto poole property and an adjacent railroad.id.on april,poole sued skinner,alleging that the tank skinner sold to it was defective.id.section of the texas civil practice and remedies code establishes a statute of repose for products liability cases.id.because suit was filed more than fifteen years after the sale of the tanks,if texas statute of repose applied,poole would not prevail.the district court granted skinner motion for summary judgment on several grounds,and the fifth circuit affirmed,stating in pertinent part that the plain language of cercla does not extend to statutes of repose.id.at.although the court noted that courts considering the applicability of have not always clearly distinguished a statute of repose from a statute of limitations,id.at,it failed to address the question of whether the term was ambiguous when it was adopted and instead held itself bound by the plain language,absent express congressional intent to the contrary.id.at.it then failed to find express congressional intent.id.
we believe the district court reliance on burlington northern is misplaced.after a review of the legislative history,the court in burlington northern stated that congress intended for to preempt a state statute of limitations that deprives a plaintiff who suffers a disease caused by the release of a hazardous substance of his cause of action,but not to preempt a state statute of repose like texas.id.however,that court pointed out that the case before it does not involve the delayed discovery for which was intended to address.the case does not implicate a disease or involve a situation where the time for filing a claim expired before the plaintiff learned that a hazardous substance caused his injury.id.at.this case does.unlike the chemical spill in burlington northern,which was discovered before the expiration of time under the statute of repose,in this case the mcdonalds did not discover the mercury in the calcine until after the statute had run.because the discovery in burlington northern occurred prior to the expiration of time under the statute of repose,policies against destroying a plaintiff claims before they could be asserted underlying were not in issue.however,they are in issue in this case.moreover,the burlington northern court failed to analyze the meaning of statute of limitations at the time was adopted.therefore,the district court was mistaken in relying on that case when it held that.was not preempted by.
legislative history 
having determined that the term statute of limitations was ambiguous at the time cercla was adopted with respect to whether the term includes statutes of repose,the court next task is to review the legislative history of the section in order to determine congress intent.two significant items of legislative history referencing this issue appear in the record.the first is a committee print filed under section e of cercla which 
recommends that all states that have not already done so,clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause.the recommendation is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of repose which,in a number of states have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring plaintiff claim before he knows that he has one.
superfund section e study group,injuries and damages from hazardous and improvement of legal remedies comm.print the e report.the second is from the house conference report,conf,at,reprinted in,the conference report,which immediately preceded enactment of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of,stat,which adopted.the conference report,referring to cercla,states that this section addresses the problem identified in the e study.id.the conference report also states that 
state statutes of limitation define the time in which an injured party may bring a lawsuit seeking compensation for his injuries against the party alleged to be responsible for those injuries in the case of a disease,such as cancer,a party may be barred from bringing his lawsuit if the statute of limitations begins to run at the time of the first than from the time when the party discovers that his injury was caused by the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant concerned.
id.taken together,the reports show that congress primary concern in enacting was to adopt the discovery rule in situations where a plaintiff may lose a cause of action before becoming aware of the type of circumstance involved in this case.this predicament can be caused by either statutes of limitation or statutes of repose,and is probably most likely to occur where statutes of repose operate.thus,given the ambiguity of the term statute of limitations at the time of the adoption of,taken alongside the only evidence of congressional intent,it is evident that the term statute of limitations in was intended by congress to include statutes of repose.
sun argues that because the e report differentiated between statutes of limitation and statutes of repose that congress,by only using the former term,evidenced intent to exclude the latter.however,this approach ignores the conference report,which states that the statute addresses the problem identified in the e study.e report,at.the problem of plaintiffs losing their cause of action before they know they have it could not have been addressed unless statutes of repose were addressed.
sun cites the e report for the proposition that statutes of repose are excluded because the question is when the statute begins to time when the action accrues sun asserts that use of the word accrues in the report,a word which typically applies to discovery of injury in statutes of limitations cases,is evidence that congress intended to exclude statutes of repose from the definition of statutes of limitation.however,the cases sun cites do not support this proposition.for example,in freier westinghouse,cir,the court stated that it is indisputedly clear that congress intended,in the cases to which applies,that the federally required commencement date preempt state law accrua
