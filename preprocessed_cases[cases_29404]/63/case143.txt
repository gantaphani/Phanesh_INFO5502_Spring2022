the united states of america appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of tidewater and its related entities.the issue in this tax case is whether tidewater,which owns and operates a fleet of vessels serving the energy industry,is entitled to certain fsc tax benefits under the internal revenue code.the resolution of this issue depends on whether the time charter of tidewater vessels to energy industry customers should be considered a lease or a service agreement.we agree with the district court that the time charters should be considered more like a lease or sublease than a service agreement and affirm the district court judgment.
facts and prior proceedings 
tidewater and its subsidiaries tidewater own and operate vessels serving the offshore energy industry in foreign and domestic waters.for the years in question,tidewater structured its vessel operations as a transaction.it first bareboat chartered a vessel to a tidewater operating company.the operating company then time chartered that vessel to the customer,usually an oil company the time charter under the time charter,the tidewater operating company yielded significant control over the vessel to the customer and also provided a crew to operate the vessel.
the operating company allocated the income received under the time charter between the leasing component and the service component of the time charter.the time charter was silent as to any such allocation tidewater entered into hundreds of these time charters,five of which are in the record.tidewater foreign sales corporation tidewater fsc acted as a commission agent for these transactions and tidewater paid tidewater fsc a commission on the amount allocated to the leasing component of the time charter.
the provisions of the relating to foreign sales corporations fsc allow qualified taxpayers to deduct commissions paid to a fsc.the income derived from these commissions is then taxable to the fsc at a favorable rate.to qualify for these tax benefits,the fsc must derive the commissions from income generated by the sale or lease of export property.based on its conclusion that the time chartered vessels qualified as export property,tidewater deducted the commissions paid to tidewater fsc on its tax returns,and tidewater fsc claimed the favorable rate on the commissions on its returns.
the irs contended that the vessels were not export property under the fsc provisions,and that therefore the favorable tax treatment was inapplicable.for this reason,the irs disallowed tidewater commission deductions for.tidewater paid the calculated deficiencies and filed this suit.tidewater fsc filed protective refund claims and joined in this suit.it argued in the alternative,that if tidewater was not allowed to deduct the commissions paid to tidewater fsc,tidewater fsc was not required to include those commissions in its taxable income.
the parties filed for summary judgment.tidewater argued that the time charter has attributes of both a service contract and a lease,and that the lease aspects of the contract are sufficient to allow the vessels to be classified as export property.the government argued that the time charter is a service contract.the district court agreed with tidewater and granted its summary judgment motion.the district court reasoned that the fsc provisions contemplated hybrid contracts,and that having both elements of a lease and a service contract did not prevent the time charter from being characterized as a lease.it concluded that the vessels met the definition of export property,and that tidewater deductions were proper.the united states now appeals.
ii.analysis 
statute and regulation 
the central issue in this appeal is whether the vessels tidewater time chartered to its customers qualify as export property.we turn first to the relevant provision of the and the relevant treasury regulation that control our analysis.the fsc provisions define export property as follows 
a export property.for purposes of this subpart 
in general.the term export property means property 
a manufactured,produced,grown,or extracted in the united states by a person other than a fsc,
b held primarily for sale,lease,or rental in the ordinary course of trade or business,by,or to,a fsc,for direct use,consumption,or disposition outside the united states,and 
c not more than of the fair market value of which is attributable to articles imported into the united states.
a.in this case,the parties agree that the vessels meet the requirements of a a and a c.only a b is in question,as the definition of export property goes on to state 
excluded property.the term export property shall not include 
a property leased or rented by a fsc or through a commission fsc for use by any member of a controlled group of corporations of which such fsc is a member 
id.the tidewater entities that own the vessel and operate the vessel are members of a controlled group of corporations with tidewater fsc.therefore this provision excludes the tidewater vessels as export property.
however,a gloss in the treasury regulations on this statutory exclusion provides tidewater with a basis for an argument that these vessels are indeed export property 
property leased to a member of controlled group i in general.property leased to a person whether or not the fsc which is a member of the same controlled group as the lessor constitutes export property for any period of time only if during the period 
a the property is held for sublease or is subleased,by the person to a third person for the ultimate use of the third person.
b the third person is not a member of the controlled group and 
c the property is used predominantly outside the united states by the third person.
temp.reg.a t f.the bareboat charter of the vessel from the vessel owner to the tidewater operating company amounts to a lease,so if the time charter to the customer is a sublease,tidewater is entitled to the deduction.therefore,the question narrows to whether the time charter to the customer is a sublease.

criteria to use in determining status of vessels 
in determining whether the vessels qualify as export property,we look to the governing statute,and the regulation interpreting the statute.on its face,the governing regulation allows tidewater and tidewater fsc the benefit of the fsc deduction if the property is held for sublease or is subleased,by the person to a third person for the ultimate use of the third person.temp.reg.a t f a.the statute,a b,requires that the property be held primarily for lease in order to qualify as export property.while the language of the treasury regulation does not contain the word primarily,the regulation can not change the terms of the statute.see nalle comm r,cir i f a regulation obviously altered the scope of the relevant statute,the commissioner should have known that such a regulation was invalid.citing comm r acker,d parenthetical omitted.the definition of export property carried forward in the regulations implicitly retains the word primarily.therefore,our analysis will focus on whether the vessels were held by the tidewater operating company primarily for sublease to a third party.
although the relationship of the parties in this case is controlled by the contracts between the parties,we begin with a consideration of the generally accepted definitions of the terms in play.as a general matter,the term lease means a transfer of the right to possession and use of goods for a term in return for consideration.williston on contracts ed.a service contract is defined simply as a contract to perform a service black law dictionary ed.a time charter is defined generally as a charter for a specified period,rather than for a specific task or voyage a charter under which the shipowner continues to manage and control the vessel,but the charterer designates the ports of call and the cargo carried.id.at.as opposed to a voyage charter,which is for one voyage from point a to point b,a time charter is an arrangement of some permanency.grant gilmore charles black,the law of admiralty,at ed.
while these general definitions are a logical starting point,the terms of the time charter itself controls the critical question as to whether the time charter is more like a lease or a service agreement.under the tidewater time charter,the customer can direct the vessel to undertake any voyage permitted by the terms of the agreement.the time charter covers a named vessel with specified capabilities,and while tidewater has the right to provide a substitute vessel at any time,the customer must give its reasonable consent if the substitute vessel is not acceptable,the customer can refuse to accept it.the full capacity of the vessel is placed at the customer disposal for use as it sees fit,and the customer can require special towing or anchor handling equipment or modify the vessel.in sum,the customer is given the full use of the vessel and the right to direct the vessel in all respects when and where the vessel should go,the cargo it should carry,the passengers to be transported,and in other ways as set forth in the time charter.
the government argues that the provisions of e provide the proper framework for determining if the time charter is more like a lease or a service contract.section is entitled definitions,and e provides criteria for determining when a contract should be treated as a lease.based on legislative history,tidewater argues that e does not apply to the fsc provisions and that it only applies to investment tax credit issues.tidewater argument is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.which states that the provisions apply for purposes of chapter.when the plain language of a statute is unambiguous,there is no need to resort to legislative history for aid in its interpretation.see peavy,cir.here,the prefatory language of clearly requires its application to all parts of chapter,which includes the fsc provisions.section e reads 
e treatment of certain contracts for providing services.for purposes of chapter 
in general.a contract which purports to be a service contract shall be treated as a lease of property if such contract is properly treated as a lease of property,taking into account all relevant factors,including whether or not 
a the service recipient is in physical possession of the property,
b the service recipient controls the property,
c the service recipient has a significant economic or possessory interest in the property,
d the service provider does not bear any risk of substantially diminished receipts or substantially increased expenditures if there is nonperformance under the contract,
e the service provider does not use the property concurrently to provide significant services to entities unrelated to the service recipient,and 
f the total contract price does not substantially exceed the rental value of the property for the contract period.
other arrangements.an arrangement including a partnership or other entity which is not described in paragraph shall be treated as a lease if such arrangement is properly treated as a lease,taking into account all relevant factors including factors similar to those set forth in paragraph.
e.although the time charter in this case does not purport to be a service contract,the factors set forth in e are relevant because e requires the same analysis for other contractual arrangements that may be properly treated as a lease,such as the time charter.both e and e state that the factors are not exclusive and that all relevant factors must be considered.
before applying these individual factors to the time charter and considering any other relevant factors,we observe that e establishes a balancing test.this requires us to consider all pertinent information and determine whether,on balance,the time charter is more like a lease or a service contract.section e gives no guidance as to the weight to be given to these factors that determination is left to the court discretion.
application of e 
was the customer in physical possession of the vessel 
under the time charter,tidewater delivered the vessel to the customer at a specified port within a certain time period at the end of the charter period,the vessel was redelivered to tidewater free of cargo and with clean tanks at a specified port while tidewater provided a crew that manned the vessel at all times the vessel and crew were under the general direction and control of the customer.the government argues that the tidewater crew operated the vessel and therefore it remained in tidewater possession.while the crew had physical possession of the vessel,the customer had significant control over the vessel and the crew,particularly as to when and where the vessel traveled.this control was sufficient to give the customer constructive possession of the vessel.although tidewater crew was in physical possession of the vessel,this fact is relatively unimportant in light of the customer constructive control of the vessel.
did the customer control the vessel 
during the charter periods,the vessel and its crew were at the beck and call of the customer.the customer directed the movement of the vessel,cargo,and passengers.so long as these directives were safe and within the vessel capabilities,the master and crew were required to fulfill them the customer could,at its own discretion,lay up the vessel at a safe port for all or any portion of the charter period or terminate the time charter at any time the customer also had the right to sublet,assign,or loan the vessel to other entities so long as they were not competitors of tidewater furthermore,the customer had the right to make structural alterations to the vessel and to install additional equipment as it saw fit while the rights to sublet and alter the vessel were both subject to tidewater prior consent,such consent was not to be unreasonably withheld.
thus under the time charter,the customer had control of the vessel in the most important sense of the word.while the crew retained control over the details of routine operation and maintenance of the vessel,this type of control is far less important than the type of control exercised by the customer.therefore,this factor weighs in favor of the time charter being a lease.
did the customer have a significant economic or possessory interest in the vessel 
under the time charter,tidewater was responsible for costs of the vessel maintenance,insurance,and all costs associated with the crew tidewater bore the risk of loss if anything happened to the vessel.the customer only risk of loss was limited to its and any special towing or anchor handling equipment it required on the vessel the customer did share in some of the benefits of any reduction in operating costs,as the customer paid many of the day to day operating costs of the vessel,such as fuel and dock fees while the customer shared in these limited savings,the primary economic and possessory interest in the vessel remained with tidewater.this factor weighs against the time charter being a lease.
did tidewater bear the risk of substantially diminished receipts if there was nonperformance under the time charter 
the time charter required the customer to pay hire for the vessel per day or pro rata for part thereof from the time that the vessel is delivered to the charterers until the expiration or earlier termination of the charter party.part ii,clause a,time charter.the payment of hire was suspended for any period the vessel was unable to function as a result of any deficiency of crew or of the owners stores,strike of master,officers and crew,breakdown of machinery,damage to hull or other accidents to the vessel.part ii,clause a,time charter.if the vessel could not perform due to the customer actions,such as damage caused by transporting dangerous or hazardous cargo or caused by directing the
