sam east,sam appeals from an order granting star fuel marts,llc star motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin and restrain sam from selling motor fuel below cost as defined by the oklahoma unfair sales act.stat.tit,ousa.on appeal,sam argues that the district court abused its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction because the ousa does not prohibit discounts given by private wholesale clubs to their members sam sales to its members were not made with the intent and purpose of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor sam sales to its members did not substantially lessen competition or tend to deceive any purchaser or prospective purchaser and the district court improperly applied the standard for entry of a preliminary injunction.our jurisdiction arises under a.we affirm.
background 
plaintiff star fuel marts operates gas stations in the oklahoma city area under the shell brand.defendant sam east,operates three sam club stores in the oklahoma city area that include retail gasoline memorial road,macarthur,and in midwest city.
sam requires its customers to purchase memberships in exchange for the privilege of shopping at the stores.these annual memberships cost between and,and entitle the member to purchase any item for sale in its stores,including gasoline.
the midwest and macarthur sam club locations sell gasoline only to sam club members.at the memorial store,both members and the general retail public may purchase gasoline,and the member price is five cents per gallon lower than the price for nonmembers.ninety percent of the gas sold at the memorial store is to members.sam sells only unleaded and premium gasoline.
the district court found that sam gasoline operations were integral to the operations of the store facilities where the gasoline facilities are located.the sam manager manual states 
gas is a great benefit to the club 
gas increases membership.our members recognize the value and convenience gas adds to the club.gas drives both new membership and increases renewal rates.
gas increases frequency of shopping and total purchases by our members.in addition to gas sales,the members buying gas also shop in the club more frequently and purchase more.
gas increases total box sales and profits in the club.sales and profits at the gas station go to division,which rolls into total box results for the club.
the manual also states that o ur members understand gas prices.they will recognize the outstanding value we offer.id.additionally,the sam gas station is a highly visible extension of the club.it is right out on the parking lot so our members see it every time they visit the club and every time they drive by.our members impression of the entire club is highly influenced by how well the gas station is managed.id.
the district court found,based on sam internal accounting documents,that at the sam club stores,particularly the memorial store,the member price for unleaded gasoline was often below actual cost wholesale price plus taxes and delivery charges sam monthly gross profit total sales minus cost of goods sold on the gas sold at the store was often negative or extremely low the gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales was low and the net operating losses of the gas outlets were high.star fuel marts,llc murphy oil usa,no.civ,wl,at.for instance,in the eight months ending july,gasoline operations at the three stores lost nearly id.at.
notably,from december,to july,not including revenue from membership fees,there were days on which the member price for the unleaded gasoline at the memorial store was below sam actual cost,id.at days where it was below statutory cost if using sam internally reported actual operating costs,id.at and days where it was below statutory cost if using the statute six percent markup,id.
the district court also found that sam gasoline facilities at its three oklahoma city area stores are high volume operations.id.at.for example,at the memorial store,sam monthly volume of gasoline sold is several times the typical volume for a retail gasoline station in oklahoma city.id.
plaintiff star typically prices its product toward the high end of the gasoline pricing spectrum in the oklahoma city market.id.customers have said to star personnel that,because of the pricing difference,they are going to buy their gasoline at sam rather than star stations.id.thus,the district court concluded that star has lost volume to sam.id.
discussion 
section of the oklahoma unfair sales act ousa states 
it is hereby declared that any advertising,offer to sell,or sale of any merchandise,either by retailers or wholesalers,at less than cost as defined in this act with the intent and purpose of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor or otherwise injuring a competitor,impair and prevent fair competition,injure public welfare,are unfair competition and contrary to public policy and the policy of this act,where the result of such advertising,offer or sale is to tend to deceive any purchaser or prospective purchaser,or to substantially lessen competition,or to unreasonably restrain trade,or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.
stat.tit.the statute further provides 
evidence of advertisement,offering to sell,or sale of merchandise by any retailer or wholesaler at less than cost to him,shall be prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors and to destroy or substantially lessen competition.
finally,the statute defines cost to the retailer as the lower of invoice cost or the replacement cost plus freight charges,cartage to the retail outlet,taxes,and a six percent markup absent proof of a lesser cost.id.a.
thus,when a covered entity sells below cost,as defined,coupled with the intent and purpose contemplated,and achieves one of the prohibited results envisioned,a violation occurs.
the granting of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.dominion video satellite,echostar satellite,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it commits an error of law or is clearly erroneous in its preliminary factual findings.id.a preliminary injunction will be set aside if the district court applied the wrong legal standard in deciding to grant a motion for a preliminary injunction.
application of the ousa to private wholesale clubs 
sam argues that the ousa does not prohibit discounts given by private wholesale clubs to their members.without citing much law in support of their arguments,sam appears to make three claims.
first,sam claims that the ousa does not apply to private clubs that do not sell merchandise to the general public.according to sam,to require that sam be held liable under the ousa would potentially expose to challenge such common practices as discounted sales of food and merchandise by other private clubs,by stores and cafeterias operated by companies for the benefit of their employees,and by other sales operations not open to the general public.aplt.br.at.
sam ignores the fact that it is plainly included in the ousa definition of a retailer.the statute defines a retailer as every person,partnership,corporation or association engaged in the business of making sales at retail within this state.stat.tit,g.sales at retail include any transfer for a valuable consideration made in the ordinary course of trade or in the usual prosecution of the seller business of title to tangible personal property to the purchaser for consumption or use other than resale or further processing or manufacturing.id.e.as for the common practices cited by sam,we do not find them sufficiently analogous to express an opinion on their legitimacy in the context of this case.suffice it to say that sam is a retailer notwithstanding that its customers must purchase annual memberships.
second,sam argues that it makes its profit not only on the sale of merchandise but also on the sale of memberships.aplt.br.at.according to sam,t he sale of memberships is a business in which ordinary retailers such as star do not compete.id.to the extent that this is a claim that the membership fees add to the purchase price of sam retail gasoline,thereby making the sales price above the statutory cost,the district court addressed this in its extensive findings of fact.the district court found that no rational allocation of membership fees is sufficient,as a mathematical proposition,to keep sam from having repeatedly sold gasoline below statutory cost.star fuel,wl,at.moreover,sam sale of memberships is plainly incidental to its merchandising of products,including gasoline.
finally,sam argues that b ecause sam club gives member discounts only to those who have paid cash in advance,they are in essence discounts for cash like the discounts given in the form of trading stamps in safeway stores,oklahoma retail grocers ass n,aff,d.aplt.br.at.this characterization is not supported factually or legally.
in safeway,the oklahoma supreme court held that giving trading stamps with merchandise sold at the statutory minimum are more like a discount for cash than a form of price cutting.at.the court noted that a cash discount was a reward for prompt payment,and that it was a trade practice long established,and is authoritatively recognized as being not a deduction from the purchase price.id.at.the court explained that the difference between trading stamps and cash discounts,on the one hand,and price reductions,on the other,was that the stamps are given uniformly and without regard to the type of goods sold or the purchaser of the same.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.similarly,in affirming the oklahoma supreme court,the united states supreme court contrasted the giving of trading stamps permissible with selective price cutting impermissible 
trading stamps are given to cash customers across the board,namely,the number of stamps varies directly with the total cost of goods purchased.safeway,however,was selective.this difference is vital in the context of this act.one of the chief aims of state laws prohibiting sales below cost was to put an end to selling.the selling of selected goods at a loss in order to lure customers into the store is deemed not only a destructive means of competition it also plays on the gullibility of customers by leading them to expect what generally is not true,namely,that a store which offers such an amazing bargain is full of other such bargains.
safeway stores.retail grocers ass n,d emphasis added.unlike trading stamps and cash discounts,sam price cuts apply only to one specific.this kind of selective price reduction creates a loss leader,which,regardless of the wisdom of the legislation,is exactly what the ousa was intended to prohibit.see glenn smith oil sheets,purpose of ousa is to prevent loss leader selling and ensure the viability of small merchants.
illegal intent 
sam argues that the district court wrongfully decided that its sales to its members were made with the intent and purpose of inducing the purchase of other merchandise,unfairly diverting trade from a competitor,or otherwise injuring a competitor.the district court decision that there was such intent and purpose is a question of fact that we review for clear error.ben hur coal wells,cir.
under the ousa,e vidence of advertisement,offering to sell,or sale of merchandise by any retailer or wholesaler at less than cost to him,shall be prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors.stat.tit,c.thus,this evidence may be rebutted by proof of lack of injurious intent.glenn smith,at.
sam argues that the district court ignor ed substantial evidence that sam had no such intent,and therefore wrongfully found that the prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors was not rebutted.aplt.br.at citing i.at ii.at.however,the affidavit and testimony of richard ezell,the operations manager for sam fuel division,stating that sam intent is at all times to meet competition and price within the confines of the oklahoma unfair sales act,ii.at ezell aff.see also i.at ezell test,is simply not enough to rebut this presumption.see lind mckinley,presumptions indulged by reason of a statutory prima facie rule of evidence may be overcome by evidence of facts clearly proven emphasis added,overruled on other grounds by gardner jones,see also johns edwards,to overcome prima facie evidence,a very clear preponderance of the evidence is required internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
moreover,the district court also found that sam practice of pricing gasoline below cost was done with the intent and purpose of inducing the purchase of other merchandise.star fuel,wl,at.the court based this finding on sam internal management manual,which,as discussed above,indicated that gasoline increases frequency of shopping and total purchases by our members,that it drives both new membership and increases renewal rates,and increases total box sales and profits in the club.ii.at.
sam addresses this finding of the district court for the first time in its reply brief.generally,arguments raised for the first time on appeal in an appellant reply brief are waived.ici explosives,usa,cir.for the sake of completeness,however,we address sam two arguments on this point.first,sam argues that memberships are not merchandise.aplt.reply br.at.even if this were true,it does not affect the fact that sam own internal documents cite gasoline as a way of increas ing frequency of shopping and total purchases by their members.ii.at.the district court finding is not clearly erroneous.second,sam argues that inducing the purchase of other merchandise is only a prohibited intent if the prices of the other merchandise are inflated.aplt.reply br.at.this is simply contrary to the plain wording of the statute,which does not have such a requirement.
finally,the district court also found that sam gasoline was priced with the intent of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor.star fuel,wl,at.sam argues that the district court based this finding only on sam desire to project a low price image and to best its competitors.however,the district court based its finding on an exhaustive list of factual findings,including the fact that sam gasoline operations were operating with losses for such a sustained period of time,and that sam can easily get a general idea of what a competitor cost would be.id.at.these findings are not clearly erroneous.
illegal result 
sam argues that the district court wrongly decided that sam sales of gasoline to its members substantially lessened competition or tended to deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers.
substantial lessening of competition 
in asserting that the district court wrongly decided that sam sales of gasoline to its members substantially lessened competition,sam claims that the evidence was insufficient to show a substantial lessening of competition and the ousa language does not provide for a statutory boost in showing a substantial lessening of competition,but even if it did,the presumption was sufficiently rebutted.
evidence of substantial lessening of competition 
in support of its argument on the lack of evidence on the lessening of competition,sam cites to testimony by alan wilkerson,star chief operating officer,who apparently said that the oklahoma city gasoline market was competitive before sam entered it,and that since sam entry,it is even more so.aplt.br.at citing i.at.sam also points to testimony from its expert witness,joseph jadlow,who also claims that the oklahoma city gasoline market has not been made less competitive by sam pricing.id.at citing i.at.
the district court findings,however,established that sam gasoline sales are by any standard,high volume operations.star fuel,wl,at.at the memorial store,sam monthly volume of gasoline sold is the typical volume for a retail gasoline station in oklahoma city.the court also concluded that such volume was due to sam pricing.id.this substantial increase in sam market share and the corresponding decrease in its competitors market share,coupled with the fact that the sales achieved by sam were achieved through pricing,provide support for the district court finding that sam sale of gasoline resulted in a substantial lessening of competition 
contrary to sam contention,the injuries star claims to have suffered are not those that result from an increase in competition.in brunswick pueblo,d,the supreme court held that a plaintiff can not complain of competitive injuries unless those injuries were of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.thus,in order to determine whether sam pricing practices substantially lessened competition,the ousa must be viewed in light of its dual purposes,to prevent loss leader selling and to protect small businesses from large competitors capable of driving them out of business by sales.oil total petroleum.
sam pricing allows it to sell its gasoline below cost,and there is nothing its competitors can do consistent with the ousa to allow them to compete with it.see glenn smith,at a sale can not be made below cost to meet the price of a competitor who is selling at a price below that competitor cost.safeway stores.retail grocers ass n,t he appropriate remedy of a competitor below cost pricing was not by retaliation.this gives sam an unfair advantage,and is exactly what the ousa was designed to prevent.
sam also argues that loss of sales by a single competitor does not establish that competition has been substantially lessened.however,the evidence goes further than showing injury only to star.the district court findings indicate that because of the volume of sam gasoline sales and its pricing,competition was lessened in oklahoma city in the much of area surrounding sam club stores.see star fuel,wl,at.moreover,when increased sales are achieved through pricing,an analysis into whether there has been a substantial lessening of competition under the ousa and similar unfair pricing statutes necessarily entails an examination of individual competitors in the aggregate.see,cargill,monfort of,d pricing below cost is a practice that harms both competitors and competition home oil sam east,d,a showing by even one of the defendant competitors of injury is sufficient to prove that defendant sale of gasoline injure d competition.star serv.petroleum state ex rel.galanos,so d,i njury to competition necessarily includes injury to competitors.
statutory boost 
sam also argues that,contrary to the district court holding,the ousa language does not provide for a statutory boost in showing a substantial lessening of competition.the ousa states that e vidence of advertisement,offering to sell,or sale of merchandise by any retailer or wholesaler at less than cost to him,shall be prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors and to destroy or substantially lessen competition.stat.tit,c.according to sam,because the statute does not expressly use the word result,the statutory boost provides prima facie evidence only of the intent to destroy or substantially lessen competition,not its result.
such a construction would render meaningless the specific reference to substantially lessen competition in the statute.to substantially lessen competition is one of the results that is prohibited by the ousa,not one of the prohibited intents.moreover,as noted by the district court,because the statute prescribes that sales shall be prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors and to destroy or substantially lessen competition.stat.tit,c emphasis added using the conjunctive and instead of the disjunctive or it is more likely that the oklahoma legislature intended to establish prima facie evidence both of the intent to injure competitors and of the result of destroying or substantially lessening competition.star fuel,wl,at.reinforcing this conclusion is the legislature repetition of the to infinitive before destroy or substantially lessen competition,which would have been unnecessary if meant to refer to another intent.
more importantly,despite sam use of various canons of statutory construction to decipher the statute,the supreme court of oklahoma decision in diehl magic empire grocers ass n,indicates its stance on the issue.in diehl,the defendant grocer was advertising items below cost.after quoting c,the court found only one significant the defendant through advertising circulars offered for sale certain items below the required markup.id.at.the court then concluded that the acts of defendant servants in advertising the foregoing items for sale at the unlawfully reduced prices indicated,absent any showing to the contrary on his part,were in violation of the statute.id.at emphasis added.the emphasized language indicates that once it is shown that a retailer is selling items below its cost,the burden shifts to the retailer to show it did not violate the ousa.
apparently recognizing the existence of the presumption of substantially lessened competition,sam argues that the presumption was successfully rebutted.prima facie evidence is such evidence as in the judgment of law is sufficient to establish a fact,and if not rebutted,remains sufficient to establish that fact.glenn smith,at.as noted above,statutory prima facie rules of evidence in oklahoma may be rebutted only by clearly proven facts.
sam offers little more evidence to rebut this presumption than the above referenced testimony of star chief operating officer and joseph jadlow.the district court found that this was insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing star fuel,wl,at.moreover,as discussed above,star presented substantial evidence tending to show that sam pricing of gasoline unfairly increased its market share while decreasing the market share of its competitors.the existence of this evidence precludes a determination that the district court finding was clearly erroneous.
although the district court was not required to do so after having found the prima facie showing of lessening of competition unrebutted,it nevertheless found that sam pricing of gasoline tended to deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers.star position was that there tended to be deception because its customers,not knowing that sam was pricing below cost,thought star was gouging them.i.at.the court,however,found it inherent in the below cost sale of one commodity among hundreds or thousands sold at the same establishment that there is the implication that the pricing of the item which is sold below cost is indicative of pricing generally at the same establishment.star fuel,wl,at.in light of our disposition of this issue,we need not decide which type of deception is contemplated by the ousa.
it appears from our review of the materials presented that the district court made its finding of customer deception without any evidence having been presented in support of this finding.whether the pricing policy of sam tended to deceive is a factual matter which must be proved as any other fact.however,because it is not necessary to the analysis herein,we do not reach this issue and express no opinion thereon.
preliminary injunction 
before a preliminary injunction may be entered pursuant to,the moving party must establish that 
the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues the threatened injury outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party the injunction,if issued,would not be adverse to the public interest and there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.
heideman salt lake city,cir quoting resolution trust cruce,cir.w hile the standard to be applied by the district court in deciding whether a party is entitled to a preliminary injunction is stringent,the standard of appellate review is simply whether the issuance of the injunction,in light of the applicable standard,constituted an abuse of discretion.doran salem inn,d.
we have held that w hen the evidence shows that the defendants are engaged in,or about to be engaged in,the act or practices prohibited by a statute which provides for injunctive relief to prevent such violations,irreparable harm to the plaintiffs need not be shown.kikumura hurley,cir quoting atchison,topeka santa fe ry.lennen,cir see also burlington bair,cir i t is not the role of the courts to balance the equities between the parties where congress has already balanced the equities and has determined that,as a matter of public policy,an injunction should issue where the defendant is engaged in any activity which the statute prohibits.the district court properly concluded that this rule applies in the present case because the ousa itself provides for injunctive relief.see.stat.tit,a.
nevertheless,the district court properly found that star would suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction were not issued.specifically,the court found that sam below cost sales of gasoline have had an inherently difficult to measure effect both on plaintiff sales volume and on the good will plaintiff enjoys with the consuming public.star fuel,wl,at.
sam does not address in its brief the district court finding on the effect of sam pricing on star goodwill.in light of this effect on star,this case is distinguishable from college craft perry,civ,wl,at,cited by sam,where the plaintiff failed to present clear evidence that perry has disparaged their name,has invaded their clientele,has raided their employee roster,or has otherwise deprecated their good will.
as for the court finding that sam pricing negatively affected star sales volume,sam argues that any effect is mere speculation.aplt.br.at.however,this argument ignores the district court extensive findings that g iven the volumes of gasoline sold by sam and the proximity of sam stations to plaintiff stations in central oklahoma,there is no room for doubt that plaintiff has been injured by sam sales.star fuel,wl,at.moreover,the court expressly found that such loss of sales was to an extent which is difficult to quantify.id.at.this finding further distinguishes the case from perry,where the p laintiffs d id not suggest any inability to calculate their losses.wl,at.
the other preliminary injunction factors are also met.first,the threatened injury to star outweighs whatever damage the preliminary injunction may cause sam.in light of the district court finding that sam was pricing its gasoline below cost,the preliminary injunction only requires sam to comply with the ousa.any loss of good will sam may suffer from having to charge the same amount as everyone else is outweighed by the loss star would suffer if sam were allowed to continue selling below its cost.
second,the preliminary injunction is not adverse to the public interest.sam argues that unrestrained price competition is in the public interest because it leads to lower prices for consumers.aplt.br.at.however,considering the dual purposes of the ousa to prevent loss leader selling and to protect small businesses,this preliminary injunction furthers those goals and is therefore not adverse to the public interest.
finally,star has established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.the tenth circuit has adopted the second circuit liberal definition of probability of success.heideman,at.accordingly,where the moving party has established that the three harm factors tip decidedly in its favor,the probability of success requirement is relaxed.id.in such cases,t he movant need only show questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful,as to make them a fair ground for litigation.id.internal quotations marks omitted.in light of the totality of evidence,the district court found that star had made a strong factual showing,and that sam factual defenses were wanting.star fuel,wl,at.
the dissent contends that star has not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits because it can not establish that sam pricing substantially lessened competition.the dissent erroneously attempts to align the ousa with federal antitrust law,and overlooks the ousa statutory presumption that pricing results in substantial lessening of competition.stat.tit,c.
the dissent also discounts the considerable evidence supporting a substantial lessening of competition.sam memorial road station sells several times the volume of gasoline of typical stations in oklahoma city.this high volume of sales corresponds to a loss of sales by star and the other stations in the area.importantly,the ousa prohibits star and the other gas stations from meeting sam price.glenn smith oil sheets,see also.stat.tit,allowing below cost sales only to meet competitors sales at or above cost safeway stores.retail grocers ass n.thus,price competition on sam terms is not only lessened,it is impossible and illegal.
more importantly,the dissent fails to recognize that the ousa is simply not a state version of a federal antitrust is in a completely different section of the oklahoma code from the oklahoma antitrust reform therefore importation of federal antitrust standards is inappropriate.the reason oklahoma antitrust law is interpreted in accordance with federal standards is that the state statute explicitly requires it.stat.tit.despite any similarity in language between the ousa and federal law,neither the oklahoma legislature nor the oklahoma courts have ever suggested superimposing the act rationale to cases involving sales.see safeway,at.no reported ousa case has ever required that a plaintiff establish that a seller has a dangerous probability of recouping its investment in prices and for good reason.
the policy behind the ousa and the cases interpreting it directly refute the dissent position.the oklahoma supreme court has recognized that the ousa was enacted to insure the viability of individual small merchants who can not afford to sell below cost.glenn smith,at.regardless of whether the lower gasoline prices ultimately benefit consumers,the legislature made a clear decision to protect merchants like star against larger competitors like sam.the strict adherence to this policy is evidenced in glenn smith,which contained no discussion of any marketwide effect of the defendant pricing practices other than the trial court comments that plaintiff is financially damaged by his competitor selling gas eight cents cheaper,within a few blocks under similar sales circumstances.id.at.imposing a requirement that a plaintiff establish that a seller will actually be able to recoup its loss by exercising monopoly power and charging higher than competitive prices for a sustained period,see brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d,would defeat the purposes of the ousa.small competitors are not required to go out of business with their market share going to the seller before the ousa can be enforced.
given the statutory presumption coupled with the evidence discussed above,the district court conclusion that sam evidence did not rebut the prima facie case is not clearly erroneous.the district court could readily find that the statements of jadlow and wilkerson that competition was not lessened fail to provide the very clear preponderance of the evidence necessary to overcome star prima facie case.johns edwards.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.
i fear that the primary effect of today decision will be to injure consumers in the oklahoma city area in both the short and long term.this is opposite of the result intended by the oklahoma legislature.in order to conclude that a preliminary injunction was entered properly below,i must be persuaded that star demonstrated a substantial likelihood that it would satisfy the requirements of the oklahoma unfair sales act ousa.ousa requires star to establish sales,with the intent of inducing the purchase of other merchandise,unfairly diverting trade from a competitor,or otherwise injuring a competitor,and a resulting deception,lessening of competition,restraint of trade,or tendency to create a monopoly.stat.tit.because star fails to establish any element of the third section of the ousa,the requirements for a preliminary injunction have not been met.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion to the contrary.
specifically,the third section of the ousa prohibits sales where the result of such sale tends to deceive any purchaser or prospective purchaser,or to substantially lessen competition,or to unreasonably restrain trade,or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.id.applying this language,the district court found that sam sales of gasoline to its members substantially lessened competition and t
