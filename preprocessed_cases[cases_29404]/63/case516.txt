ferguson controls,division of dover resources,ferguson and delaware capital formation,delaware capital appeal various aspects of a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of texas following a bench trial concerning,inter alia,allegations of infringement of four patents and multiple versions of accused infringing devices.ferguson controls,div.of dover,mega,llc,judgment.mega systems,llc mega and james bartley bartley,president and majority owner of mega,other aspects of the same judgment.
in particular,ferguson and delaware capital appeal the district court construction of certain claim limitations of patent the patent,owned by delaware capital and licensed to ferguson the district court determination that a certain version of a product made and sold by of the apc not infringe the patent the district court conclusion that bartley was not personally liable for inducing mega to infringe the patent and patent the patent,also owned by delaware capital and licensed to ferguson the district court denial of ferguson motion to amend the claims to assert willful infringement and the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to consider whether patent the patent,assigned to mega,had been improperly revived at the patent and trademark office pto after it lapsed for failure to timely pay maintenance fees.
mega and bartley the district court construction of certain claim limitations of the patent the district court determination of damages to be awarded to ferguson for infringement of the patent the district court conclusion that ferguson did not infringe the patent and the district court ruling barring the submission of evidence of prior art due to lack of notice under.
because the district court erroneously construed certain claim limitations of the patent,we reverse the district court claim construction,vacate the determination that version of mega apc device did not infringe,and remand the issue for further findings consistent with the claim construction set forth in this opinion.we affirm the district court conclusion that bartley did not induce infringement based on the correct legal standard applied by the court to the facts in evidence.we reverse the district court denial of ferguson motion to amend the complaint to include an assertion of willful infringement and remand for further proceedings on that issue.we affirm the district court refusal to consider whether mega engaged in inequitable conduct when it successfully revived the patent.further,we affirm the district court construction of the claims of the patent however,because we believe the district court abused its discretion in determining the amount of the damage award for infringement of the patent,we vacate that award and remand the issue of damages for determination consistent with this opinion.finally,we affirm both the district court determination that ferguson did not infringe the patent and the district court evidentiary ruling under.
background 
overview of the technology 
the patents in this case concern control systems and related methods used in the production of petroleum products from a well.while some wells are capable of producing or outpouring liquid petroleum products under naturally induced reservoir pressures,it is more common for wells to require an artificial lift mechanism to be productive.patent,ll.one such artificial lift system repetitively causes pressure to build by first closing in the well while it is subject to the inflow of liquids.id.at ll.after the proper combination of pressure and liquid develops,the well is opened to a gathering system to collect the liquid produced and expelled by the pressure built up when the well was closed.the cycle is then repeated successively.this cyclical shutting in and opening of the well is known as intermitting.id.at ll.the gathering system typically includes a separator,one or more sales lines,and a tank or reservoir for collecting the liquids issuing from the well during the open intervals.id.at ll.
many artificial lift well installations also typically employ a plunger method to aid production.using the plunger method,a piston,or plunger,is installed within the tubing string of the well and travels the entire length of the tubing string during each cycle of the shutting in and opening of the well.the presence of the plunger improves the production and delivery of the liquid from the well to the gathering system.id.at ll.
the timing of intermitting and operation of the plunger mechanism are critical for the success of the well operation.prior to the inventions involved in this case,control over these timing issues generally had been relegated to crude,devices,requiring hand winding and frequent technician intervention.id.at,ll.all of the are directed to improvements over these earlier control systems.
figure of the patent,shown below,is illustrative of the technology at issue and shows a well installation for plunger lift production according to the method of the invention.id.at,ll.
well installation includes a casing,extending from the surface into a formation.wellhead supports a tubing string having an open lower end in the vicinity of the lower region of casing.a plunger is disposed in tubing string.provides fluid communication between tubing string and conduit,which extends to a separator.a motor valve provides control over conduit.valve is controlled to open and close conduit by a controller.the pressure in the sales line is monitored by a sales line gauge.when the gas pressure in the sales gathering system is too high,and a set threshold is reached or exceeded,a high line contact is generated as an electrical signal and conveyed to controller.a conduit extends from and is controlled by a second motor valve tank valve or tank control valve.tank valve is also controlled between on and off states by controller.opening tank valve opens tubing string to the low pressure of a tank or reservoir.a plunger detector located above plunger catcher provides a magnetic on arrival signal to controller.id.at.
delaware capital and ferguson patent 
the patent issued on october,and is directed to a controller that improves upon a controller subject to an earlier patent,patent the patent also owned by delaware capital and licensed to ferguson.the patent discloses an electronic well controller system,providing control over wells and simplified control adjustment procedures.see patent,ll.the patent improves upon the system described in the patent by allowing greater flexibility of operation and accommodation for a wide range of parameters,as well as other features,such as the ability to withstand a variety of severe environments and to run on conventional batteries.id.at.
ferguson asserts that mega apc controller infringes claims,and of the patent.representative claim recites,in relevant part and with the disputed term underlined 
a controller for use in conjunction with the control of well installations of a variety wherein a control valve regulating the flow of fluid hydrocarbon is selectively actuated between an on state and an off state in response to corresponding control inputs thereto,comprising 
valve means responsive to said actuation signals to derive said control inputs.
the valve assembly,in operation,shifts between an on state,where fluid is produced from a well,and an off state,where the well is shut in.id.at.the on state is defined by a window of time bounded by the time when the valve means is opened and extending until the time when the valve means is closed.id.
delaware capital and ferguson patent 
the patent issued on september,and is directed toward a method for use in controllers,such as that described in the patent.patent,ll.the method includes continuous monitoring and adjustment of well performance by evaluating plunger speed.id.at,ll.the method allows the duration of the time and afterflow cycle time to be changed to optimize performance,by achieving a consistent plunger speed.id.at ll.to achieve plunger control,a well technician will select a consistent interval.within that interval,windows are then set to reflect fast,good,and slow speeds for the plunger to arrive at the wellhead.the method will make no change to operating times if the plunger continues to surface within the good window.however,if the plunger surfaces within the fast window,the time will be decreased and the afterflow cycle time will be increased.conversely,if the plunger arrives within the slow window,the method will increase the interval and decrease the afterflow time.id.at ll.
ferguson asserts that the mega systems apc controller infringes claims and of the patent.independent claim is representative and recites,with the relevant terms underlined

the term values in these claims was construed by the district court to mean more than one value and also to require that the more than one value must be different,so as to define a window of time,or time interval.ferguson controls,div.of dover,mega,llc,slip op.at,markman report.the district court,however,did not explicitly construe either normal plunger performance or predetermined plunger performance.
ferguson asserted that mega apc device infringed both the and patents.the apc controller is used in the production of petroleum products using plunger lift and intermitting technologies.ferguson controls,div.of dover,mega,llc,para,special master report.to use the apc controller,a user selects a target time,tt,for example,based on well depth,paras.the device then automatically adds one minute to the entered target time to derive time tt.id.the window of the on state is then bounded by the values tt and tt.id.
mega patent 
the patent,owned by mega,is also directed to electronic controller systems and related methods for use in oil and gas wells.in particular,the controller of the patent detects the arrival of a cycling plunger at the wellhead and monitors the time required for the plunger to make each round trip.patent,ll.in one embodiment,the system decreases the interval by a preselected value each time the plunger arrives prior to the expiration of the,and the interval is increased each time the plunger fails to arrive prior to the expiration of the.id.at,ll.further,the interval is increased by a second preselected value,greater than the first preselected value,in response to expiration of the prior to the plunger arrival on two successive cycles of intermitting.id.at ll.

given the number of issues on appeal,the specific standards of review for the individual issues are not set out in this section,but are included individually in the separate sections discussing each issue.
plunger performance claim construction 
ferguson first argues that the district court erroneously interpreted the claim terms normal plunger performance and predetermined plunger performance.ferguson contends that the trial court erred in implicitly giving the term predetermined plunger performance the same definition as normal plunger performance.ferguson also disagrees with the district court conclusion that infringement can not lie because the tt time calculated by the apc algorithm does not bear any relationship to normal plunger performance.mega,on the other hand,argues that the district court properly construed the plunger performance claim terms and appropriately determined that version of the apc does not infringe.we agree with both of ferguson arguments.
the district court did not explicitly construe the terms in question normal plunger performance and predetermined plunger performance but has conflated claim construction and infringement issues in its analysis.in analyzing the claim limitation assigning first values which represent normal plunger performance,the district court noted that special master williams did construe values to require at least two different values,defining a window of time or a time interval.see special master report at para.markman report at.the district court then turned to an example in the specification and determined that normal plunger performance should be equated with a good window of plunger arrival.special master report at para.from there,the district court examined the accused device,and determined that the apc operator entered only a single target time,tt,from which the system generated a second tt time.id.at para.the district court concluded that the window,bounded by the time entered by the operator,tt,and the generated value,tt,does not per se represent normal plunger performance.id.at para.emphasis in original.although the district court then found that an operator might select a good window,it still determined that there was no infringement,because it concluded that the tt value does not bear any relationship to normal plunger performance.id.
the determination of infringement is a process.first,the court construes the claims at issue to correctly determine their scope.second,it compares the properly construed claims to the accused device.cybor fas,en banc.claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo.id.a determination of infringement,whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents,is a question of fact.insituform,cat contracting.
we begin our claim construction analysis with the words of the claim.see vitronics conceptronic.in construing claims,the analytical focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves,for it is that language that the patentee chose to use to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the patentee regards as his invention.interactive gift express,compuserve.in the absence of an express intent to impart a novel meaning to the claim terms,the words take on the full breadth of the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art.see,teleflex,ficosa am.the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term may be determined by reviewing a variety of sources.some of these sources include the claims themselves,see process control hydreclaim,dictionaries and treatises,texas digital systems,telegenix,and the written description,the drawings,and the prosecution history,see,demarini sports,worth.
words often have different meanings to different people and in different contexts,accounting for the multiple ordinary meanings found in dictionaries.dictionary definitions,while reflective of the ordinary meanings of words,do not always associate those meanings with context or reflect the customary usage of words by those skilled in a particular art.the words used in the claims must be considered in context and are examined through the viewing glass of a person skilled in the art.tegal,at.it is the use of the words in the context of the written description and customarily by those skilled in the relevant art that accurately reflects both the ordinary and the customary meaning of the terms in the claims of a patent.as set forth in 
in construing claim terms,the general meanings gleaned from reference sources,such as dictionaries,must always be compared against the use of the terms in context,and the intrinsic record must always be consulted to identify which of the different possible dictionary meanings is most consistent with the use of the words by the inventor.where there are several common meanings for a claim term,the patent disclosure serves to point away from the improper meanings and toward the proper meanings.
llc intuitive surgical,quoting renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,see also.digital,at.the written description must also be examined in every case,because it is relevant to determine if the presumption of ordinary and customary meaning is rebutted.see renishaw,at.once the court has construed the claim limitations,the second step in the analysis is to compare the properly construed claims to the accused device.cybor,at.
as noted,the claim limitations at issue are normal plunger performance and predetermined plunger performance.the parties do not dispute the meaning of the terms plunger performance,so the initial focus of our analysis is on the terms normal and predetermined within the context of each of the claim limitations in question.starting with the claim limitation normal plunger performance,we consider first the ordinary and customary meaning of the word normal.the first listed dictionary meaning of the word normal is according to,constituting,or not deviating from an established norm,rule,or principle conformed to a type,standard,or regular pattern not abnormal.webster third new international dictionary webster.applying this definition to the expression normal plunger performance in context informs that the claim limitation refers to performance of the plunger according to a rule or conforming to a standard or regular pattern of operation that is not abnormal.see,at while certain terms may be at the center of the claim construction debate,the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be considered in determining the ordinary and customary meaning of those terms.thus,the ordinary meaning of normal plunger performance based on the dictionary definition is performance that is standard or regular and not in need of correction.
the written description is consistent with and supports this construction in the context of this invention.specifically,the patent describes the operation of the plunger in terms of its arrival time following each cycle.patent,ll.if the plunger arrives or surfaces at times that are considered appropriate in terms of effective well production,no change or correction is made.id.at ll.operation during those times is described as operation customarily considered by those skilled in this art to be within a good window.id.at ll.if,however,the plunger arrives outside of the good window,adjustments are made to the system to alter the plunger speed and return it to the desired good window of operation.id.at ll.the district court thus concluded from the written description that normal plunger performance as used in the claims refers to the described good window of plunger arrival,or performance customarily considered by those skilled in the art not in need of correction.we agree.
the district court recognized that normal plunger performance was performance during a good window of operation,as defined by the upper and lower values assigned to trigger correction of plunger arrival time.while there is nothing in the language of the claims,the written description,or the prosecution history to specify that the upper and lower values be separately settable,the district court implicitly read such a capability as being required for there to be infringement.because the upper limit of the apc window is fixed to be one minute greater than the lower limit and can not independently be set to any other value,the district court incorrectly concluded that the window bounded by tt and tt does not per se represent normal plunger performance.special master report at para.emphasis in original.the district court conclusion was in error both because it was influenced by the structure and function of the alleged infringing device,see sri int l matsushita of,en banc stating that claims may not be construed with reference to the accused device,and because it read into the claim a limitation of independent adjustability of the upper and lower values not specified or required by the claim language,as properly construed.simply stated,the ordinary and customary meaning reflected in the context of the written description of the claim expression normal plunger performance is simply plunger performance not in need of correction.performance not in need of correction is defined by arrival times within the values set by the upper and lower limits,regardless of whether those limits are independently input by an operator or are separated by a fixed,preset time period automatically calculated once one of the limits is input by an operator.
as to the term predetermined plunger performance,again the initial focus is on the word predetermined.the ordinary meaning of predetermine is to determine beforehand.webster,supra,at.this is the meaning consistent with that found by special master williams in construing the separate phrase predetermined time increment,markman report at,and we conclude that it is also the meaning that should apply to the phrase predetermined plunger performance.
the written description is consistent with this construction,noting that an operator may set a window for operation beforehand.patent,ll.we disagree with the district court implicit conclusion that predetermined plunger performance necessarily has the same construction as normal plunger performance.predetermined in this context simply means determined beforehand,and may include performance that is normal or subject to correction.the coincidence of a particular predetermined window with a good window is irrelevant.there is no requirement,either in the claim itself or in the written description,that the values selected beforehand in the limitation predetermined plunger performance must represent the good window,as with normal plunger performance.there is also nothing in the claim language,written description,or prosecution history to require that the upper and lower values that define the window of predetermined plunger performance be set independently of each other.the values must just be determined beforehand.
apc infringement 
with these constructions in mind,we now review the district court determination of by the apc device.the district court held that version of the apc device could not infringe the patent because the tt value determined by the apc device does not bear any relationship to normal plunger performance.special master report at para.as noted above,the correct construction of the term normal plunger performance is performance of the plunger that does not require correction,or arrival of the plunger within the good window.
in version of the apc,the operator enters a target time tt and the system generates a window bounded by tt and tt.if the plunger arrives within that window,no correction is performed.the district court made much of the testimony given by bartley that a well operator would select a good window of one minute only for a specific depth of well,particularly a foot well.id.for this reason,the district court concluded that the tt value does not bear any relationship to normal plunger performance,thus foreclosing a finding of infringement.id.
the district court conclusion is erroneous for two reasons.first,the fact that the tt limit is tied to the tt limit makes it no less a value that,together with limit tt,set the bounds of plunger performance not needing correction,normal plunger performance.second,the fact that testimony was given that a window would be chosen only for wells of feet gives an unwarranted connotation to the term normal.the plunger performance that a well operator may desire for a well of a particular depth is a matter of subjective choice the claim language is unconcerned with that choice.as construed by this court,the term normal means not requiring correction.therefore,it does not matter when or why bartley would choose to use a window.if a window of one minute is chosen,for whatever reason,and correction is made whenever the plunger does not arrive in that window,then that window is,by definition,normal plunger performance.
we conclude that the district court correctly construed the claim term normal plunger performance to mean plunger performance not requiring correction,the good window of plunger performance,but incorrectly ascribed the same meaning to predetermined plunger performance.we also conclude that the district court erroneously required the two values defining the window of normal plunger performance and the two values defining the window of predetermined plunger performance to be independently settable,and further erroneously determined that,since a window would only be chosen given certain well parameters,the value tt bore no relationship to normal plunger performance.for these reasons,the district court clearly erred in determining that a finding of infringement by the apc device was barred.therefore,we vacate the district court determination of as to the asserted claims of the patent and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the above analysis.
bartley personal liability 
ferguson next argues that the district court erred,as a matter of law,in determining that bartley was not personally liable for inducing mega to infringe the and patents.in particular,ferguson argues that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard for determining personal liability.mega argues that the standard that the district court applied was indeed appropriate and that the conclusion that bartley is not liable for inducing infringement is correct.we agree with mega.
w hoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.b.the district court noted that to be found liable under b,a patentee must show that the individual charged with inducement took actions that actually induced infringement and that such individual knew or should have known that such actions would induce direct infringement,citing micro chemical great plains chemical.special master report at para.the district court then concluded that the evidence proffered by ferguson did not show that bartley knew or should have known his actions would induce infringement,regardless of how actively bartley was involved with the development marketing of the apc device.id.at para.
ferguson argues that the district court should have applied a less stringent test for inducement liability,requiring that the officer be aware only of his activities,not necessarily aware that his activities amounted to infringement.in support of this less stringent test,ferguson cites a number of district court cases that are not binding on this court.not only are the cases cited by ferguson not binding on this court,they are contradicted by our precedent.see,micro,at officers of an allegedly infringing corporation can be held personally liable for actively inducing infringement under b only if they knew or should have known their actions would induce actual infringements.quoting manville sales,at.ferguson position is untenable based on manville sales,which makes clear that it must be established that the defendant possessed specific intent to encourage another infringement and not merely that the defendant had knowledge of the acts alleged to constitute infringement.at.
because the district court applied the correct test for determining liability for inducing infringement,and because ferguson submitted no evidence to show that bartley knew or should have known his actions would induce infringement,we affirm the district court determination that bartley was not personally liable for inducing mega to infringe the patent.
pleading willful infringement 
ferguson next argues that the district court erroneously denied ferguson the right to pursue its claims of willful infringement.specifically,ferguson asserts that the district court was wrong in not permitting the plaintiffs to amend the complaint to include an allegation of willful infringement.our review of the denial of a motion to amend a complaint is determined by the regional circuit standard which,in the fifth circuit,is abuse of discretion.norman apache,cir avatar exploration,chevron,cir.
in its initial complaint,ferguson averred that mega infringement of the ferguson was willful.mega counterclaimed with allegations of inequitable conduct by ferguson in the prosecution of the ferguson patents and with assertions of willful infringement by ferguson of the mega patent.the district court reviewed the pleadings and concluded that the willfulness and inequitable conduct allegations did not meet the standards of federal rules of civil procedure b,requiring that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.the district court then struck all claims and defenses of willfulness and inequitable conduct alleged by both parties.b see also ferguson controls div.of dover,mega,llc,slip op.at,order striking affirmative defenses.ferguson subsequently filed a motion to amend its complaint,setting forth the facts surrounding the allegations of willfulness in more detail.the district court,however,denied entry of the amended complaint,stating t he action alleged by ferguson to be evidence of willful infringement by mega counsel fails to hit the mark.ferguson controls div.of dover,mega,llc,slip op.at,order denying entry of second amended complaint.
we disagree.willfulness does not equate to fraud,and thus,the pleading requirement for willful infringement does not rise to the stringent standard required by rule b.see,vulcan eng g fata aluminium,stating that willful infringement is a deliberate disregard of another patent rights,perrigo,separately enumerating willful infringement and fraud.b in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.because ferguson willful infringement allegation should not have been stricken in the first instance under rule b as a matter of law,we find the refusal to allow an amended complaint to reintroduce willful infringement to be an abuse of discretion.the district court dismissal of ferguson willful infringement allegation is reversed and the district court is instructed on remand to give ferguson an opportunity to amend its complaint to plead willfulness by mega with respect to the patent.our action on remand should not be construed as an opinion on the merits of ferguson willful infringement allegation,which we expressly decline to address.
revival of lapsed patent 
ferguson finally argues that the district court committed legal error in declining to consider ferguson claim that mega engaged in inequitable conduct when it successfully revived the patent after it lapsed for failure to pay maintenance fees.maintenance fees are required to be paid at years,years,and years,each with a six month grace period,after the grant of a patent to keep the patent in force.b.the pto has the authority to accept payment of maintenance fees up to months following the six month grace period if the delay is shown to the satisfaction of the director to have been unintentional.id.c.
the patent issued on may,the year maintenance fee thus coming due on november,or within the following six month grace period.see b special master report at para.the maintenance fee was not timely paid,and the patent lapsed accordingly.special master report at para.on august,a petition to revive the patent was filed,in which it was asserted that the delayed payment of the maintenance fee was unintentional.id.at para.the pto granted the petition on or around september,but noted i t is not apparent whether the person signing the statement of unintentional delay was in a position to have firsthand or direct knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the delay at issue.id.the pto further stated that n evertheless,such statement is being treated as having been made as the result of a reasonable inquiry into the facts and circumstances of such delay,and requiring that i n the event that such an inquiry has not been made,petitioner must make such an inquiry.id.
in the district court,ferguson did not allege inequitable conduct,but merely asserted that the revival of the patent was improper.id.at para.in particular,ferguson argued that the petitioner did not have firsthand knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the late payment,and further,that no inquiry was made.id.at paras.ferguson also asserted that the late payment was not unintentional.id.at para.
the district court noted that ferguson had not pled inequitable conduct,id.at para,and concluded that it had no authority to take action based on the allegedly improper revival of the patent.id.at para.the district court determination that it had no authority to take action in this case is essentially a conclusion that ferguson has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.see.b.this court reviews the dismissal of a claim under rule b,a matter of procedure,by applying the law of the regional circuit.packing,ibp.the fifth circuit reviews such a dismissal de novo.see vander zee reno,cir eason holt,cir.
ferguson argues that the district court should have entertained the improper revival claim by inferring inequitable conduct.however,in contrast to the willfulness claim discussed above,inequitable conduct,while a broader concept than fraud,must be pled with particularity.despite the dicta provided by the district court that such a conclusion of inequitable conduct would be relatively easy based on the present record,special master report at para,we decline to infer facts to support a claim that must be pled with particularity.
we affirm the district court decision declining to address the alleged inequitable conduct issue because it was not properly raised.
valve means claim construction 
on,mega first argues that the district court erred in construing the valve means claim limitation in independent claims,and of ferguson patent.although the parties did not submit this limitation to special master williams for construction,the district court determined that this limitation was a limitation,governed by,paragraph,based on the construction of a similar term in the patent.special master report at paras.the district court then identified the structure for performing the claimed functions of being responsive to said actuation signals and deriv ing said control inputs,as the valve shown in figure of the patent.id.at paras.the valve identified by the district court is descr
