following an extensive audit of arco operations,doe instituted a section public enforcement action against arco.in that action,doe alleged that arco had violated the price and allocation regulations and overcharged its customers about million.see,atl.richfield,doe,proposed consent order with atl.richfield.on june,doe and arco entered into a consent order under which arco remitted just over million to doe.of that amount,doe placed approximately million into a consent fund to provide refunds to purchasers of arco refined products.sinclair seeks a refund from that fund in this case.
