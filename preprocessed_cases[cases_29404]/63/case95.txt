virginia uranium,coles hill,llc,bowen minerals,llc,and virginia energy resources,collectively virginia uranium appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.because we agree with the district court that federal law does not preempt state regulation of conventional uranium mining,we affirm.
the federal atomic energy act aea or act regulates several aspects of nuclear power generation in the united states,including source material such as uranium,z.the nuclear regulatory commission nrc enforces the provisions of the act.id.
uranium is the predominant source of fuel for nuclear power plants and fissile material for nuclear warheads.uranium ore can be recovered from a deposit either through in situ leaching or by conventional mining such as an or underground mine 
once removed from the ground,uranium ore is milled into a refined product called yellowcake.yellowcake can be used to make nuclear fuel,but the remaining unused material known as tailings is radioactive and must be stored securely.
in the early,a uranium deposit was discovered in pittsylvania county,virginia on land owned by coles hill,llc and bowen minerals,llc.containing million pounds of uranium ore,the coles hill deposit was then and remains the largest known uranium deposit in the united states.
the virginia general assembly reacted to this discovery by calling for the state coal and energy commission to evaluate the environmental effects and any possible detriments to the health,safety,and welfare of virginia citizens which may result from uranium exploration,mining or milling.acts.before the commission completed its report,however,the general assembly imposed a moratorium or ban on uranium mining until a program for permitting uranium mining is established by statute.code ann.
the commission ultimately reported to the governor and general assembly in that the state could lift the moratorium on uranium development if it followed essential specific recommendations of the task force and enacted laws to tightly regulate the industry.the recommendations included limiting public exposure to radiation,issuing mill and tailings licenses in cooperation with the nrc,and regulating hazardous waste.the benefits of uranium mining in virginia,the commission found,outweighed the costs to.despite the commission recommendation,the general assembly did not move to lift the moratorium.
in january,virginia state senators john watkins and richard saslaw sponsored a bill to create a licensing scheme for the issuance of uranium mining permits.the bill was never voted on,and was later withdrawn.to date,no such program has been established,and the ban remains in effect.
stymied in its efforts to mine the coles hill deposit,virginia uranium brought suit in the united states district court for the western district of virginia,asking the court to declare the ban preempted by federal law and issue an injunction compelling the commonwealth to grant uranium mining permits.
the defendant commonwealth of virginia officials collectively the commonwealth moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint,and virginia uranium moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the commonwealth motion and dismissed the complaint.the court found that federal law specifically the atomic energy act does not regulate nonfederal uranium deposits or their conventional mining.virginia uranium,mcauliffe,supp.finding that the act does not commit conventional uranium mining to the nrc authority,the district court distinguished the instant case from supreme court precedent requiring states to have a rationale to regulate activities within the nrc purview.the district court further held that virginia ban does not obstruct the realization of congress purposes and objectives behind the act because congress evinced no purpose or objective that nonfederal uranium deposits be conventionally mined.id.at.
this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court conclusion that the atomic energy act does not preempt virginia ban on uranium mining.epps jp morgan chase bank,cir.state laws may be preempted by federal law under the supremacy clause,which provides that t his constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.

virginia uranium offers three reasons why the atomic energy act preempts virginia ban on uranium mining.first,it urges that conventional uranium mining is an activity under section k of the act and that the commonwealth therefore may not regulate it out of concern for radiological safety.second,it contends that even if uranium mining is not a regulated activity under the act,milling and tailings storage are regulated activities,and because the virginia legislature intended to and does regulate those activities,the ban is therefore preempted.finally,virginia uranium says that the ban is preempted because it an obstacle to the full implementation of the act objectives.we address these arguments in turn.
we begin with virginia uranium claim that conventional uranium mining is an activity under section k of the atomic energy act,which in turn means that states ca regulate such mining for the purpose of protecting against radiation hazards.section of the act,entitled cooperation with states,outlines the respective responsibilities of the states and the nuclear regulatory commission with respect to the regulation of byproduct,source,and special nuclear materials.a.subsection k reserves to the states the right to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.id.k.
in pacific gas,the supreme court interpreted this provision as establishing the bounds of the act preemptive reach.specifically,the court instructed that the test of is whether the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.pacific gas,at internal citations omitted.if a state purports to regulate an activity that is also regulated by the act,a court must determine whether there is a rationale for the state rule.id.if there is not,then the state law is preempted.
the court in pacific gas addressed california regulations imposing conditions on the construction of new nuclear power plants in the state.utilities seeking to construct nuclear plants in california had to obtain permission from the state energy resources and conservation commission.id.at.but the commission would only grant a permit to build if it determined that there was adequate capacity for storage of spent fuel rods and that the utility would provide continuous,full core reserve storage capacity.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in passing these regulations,the california legislature denied that they were designed to provide protection against radiation hazards but instead were adopted because uncertainties in the nuclear fuel cycle made nuclear power an uneconomical and uncertain source of energy.id.at.
the california regulations,the court held,fell squarely within the prohibited field.id.at after considering arguments for why the regulations might have been enacted for safety as opposed to economic reasons,the court opted against attempting to ascertain california true motive and instead accept ed california avowed economic purpose.id.at.because the regulations had a rationale,the atomic energy act did not preempt them.id.
here,the commonwealth concedes that it lacks a rationale for banning uranium mining but says that section k does not apply to the ban because conventional uranium mining is an activity regulated by the nrc.to test this contention,we assess whether the term activities within section k of the act encompasses all activities states may regulate or merely,as the commonwealth contends,activities regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission.appellees br.at.
the supreme court addressed this precise question in pacific gas and sided with the limited reading of section k pressed by the commonwealth here.as we noted earlier,there,the court explained that the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,but the bounds of that field are measured by looking to whether the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.pacific gas,at internal citations omitted see also id.at s ection was not intended to cutback on state authority outside the nrc jurisdiction.section k therefore prohibits states from regulating,for safety reasons,activities that are in any way regulated by the federal government under the atomic energy act.we agree with the district court that conventional uranium mining is not such an activity.
the act explicitly grants the nrc authority to regulate uranium mining on federal lands,but it says nothing about the commission power to regulate conventional uranium mining elsewhere.section of the act requires individuals to obtain an nrc license to transfer,deliver,or receive possession of any source material after removal from its place of deposit in nature.emphasis added.importantly,the nrc reads this provision as precluding commission jurisdiction over uranium mining.in re.hydro resources.similarly,the nrc justifies regulating in situ mining by describing the method as processing uranium,over which the commission has authority.id.
when congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we defer to a federal agency reasonable interpretation of a congressional act that the agency is charged with administering.labor relations bd.bluefield hosp,cir.citing chevron,natural res.def.council.the atomic energy act grants the nrc authority to enforce and promulgate rules under the act.federal law is silent on conventional uranium mining outside of federal lands,and the nrc reads this gap in the act language to mean that the commission lacks the power to regulate it.
this interpretation is reasonable in the context of the act.congress explicitly gave the nrc power to regulate conventional uranium mining on federal lands and to govern what happens to source material after its removal from its place of deposit in nature.id,emphasis added.we think it logical to assume that,by expressly granting the nrc some authority over source material,congress did not intend to implicitly grant broader authority.see barnhart peabody coal,explaining that the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius may apply where it is fair to suppose that congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.
additionally,the power to regulate mining including uranium mining has traditionally been reserved to the states.see in re hydro resources,at.we assume that is where it remains unless congress evinces a clear and manifest purpose to supersede the historic police powers of the states.wyeth levine,quoting medtronic,lohr.nothing in the aea indicates that congress meant for the nrc to displace the states in regulating conventional uranium mining the act is silent on the matter.
indeed,accepting virginia uranium more expansive reading of section k preemptive reach would mean that entities could mine free of government oversight.the states could not regulate and,on the nrc reasonable view of the act,it too would be a passive spectator.that can not be the law.rather,because conventional uranium mining outside of federal lands is beyond the regulatory ambit of the nuclear regulatory commission,it is not an activity under section k of the act.as a result,the district court was correct to hold that virginia ban on conventional uranium mining is not preempted.
virginia uranium next contends that,even if conventional uranium mining is not an activity under section k of the act,milling and tailings storage are such activities.because the ban,according to virginia uranium,impermissibly attempts to regulate and has the effect of prohibiting those activities for nuclear safety reasons,it is preempted.
we agree that uranium milling and tailings storage are activities under section k because they are regulated by the nrc,and states may therefore not regulate them except for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.see,see also supra part.but the plain language of the commonwealth ban does not mention uranium milling or tailings storage.code ann.p ermit applications for uranium mining shall not be accepted by any agency of the commonwealth.
in the face of this telling omission,virginia uranium argues that no one would want to undertake the pointless expense of constructing a mill and complex in virginia and transporting uranium ore into the commonwealth.reply br.at.given this economic reality,virginia uranium urges us to look past the statute plain meaning to decipher whether the legislature was motivated to pass the ban by a desire to regulate uranium milling or tailings storage.we decline the invitation.
in pacific gas,the court warned against the unsatisfactory venture of inquiry into legislative motive.at citing united states.the court reasoned that,when dealing with provisions such as section k that allow states to enact laws for some purposes but not others,it is pointless for courts to invalidate statutes that may then be reenacted with a different motive.id.rather,it should be up to congress to determine whether a state has misused the authority left in its hands.id.and even if motive inquiry were useful,the court noted that legislative intent is often impossible to discern because w hat motivates one legislator to vote for a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.id.
there are some areas of law such as actions arising under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment where a legislature improper motive itself is cause for courts to find a law unconstitutional.in those cases,we may conduct a pretext analysis to ascertain a legislature true motive.see,united states windsor,striking down an act of congress because it was motived by an improper animus north carolina state conference of naacp mccrory,cir.a law is invalid under the equal protection clause if a discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor or if the legislature enact ed a law because of,and not in spite of,its discriminatory effect.internal citations omitted.we do so in those contexts because a more searching scrutiny of legislative intent is needed in order to avoid the circumventi on of a federally protected right.gomillion lightfoot.
but this is not such a case.because virginia uranium does not allege that the virginia legislature acted with discriminatory intent,we adhere to the edict that courts will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive,and we decline to examine why the commonwealth chose to ban uranium mining,which it was plainly allowed to do,at.
virginia uranium urges us to follow the paths forged by our sister circuits in skull valley band of goshute indians nielson,cir,and entergy nuclear vermont yankee,llc shumlin,cir.while the courts there did strike down state laws as preempted under the aea,the cases are distinguishable.
in skull valley,plaintiffs challenged a host of utah laws that,while facially within the state police powers,surgically targeted the transportation and storage of spent nuclear fuel.at.spent nuclear fuel storage,the tenth circuit found,is an activity regulated by the nrc.id.at.moreover,unlike virginia ban on mining,all but two of the challenged utah laws specifically mentioned this activity.id.at.
one subset of changes to utah laws purported to focus solely on transportation by designating certain local roads near the site of a proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility as statewide public safety interest highways and turning control over them to the state.id.at.but even this change in the law was packaged with two other transportation regulations targeting spent nuclear fuel directly.the first called for state resolution of disputes arising out of the request to construct a railroad crossing made by an entity engaged in spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation,and the second required the consent of the governor and the state legislature before the department of transportation could grant a right of way to a company engaged in the transportation or storage of spent nuclear fuel.id.
not surprisingly,the tenth circuit felt no need to engage in the sort of pretext analysis that virginia uranium presses here to hold that utah was purporting to govern an activity.indeed,the commonwealth moratorium on uranium mining an activity not regulated by the nrc pales in comparison to utah comprehensive scheme intended to keep spent nuclear fuel out of the state by any means.
the second circuit decision in entergy,on the other hand,is a straightforward application of pacific gas.vermont law required the explicit approval of the general assembly in order to operate a nuclear energy plant within the state.entergy,at.the second circuit sought to determine the vermont legislature intent only after holding that the challenged law regulated an activity the operation of nuclear power plants within the meaning of section k of the atomic energy act.id.at.applying pacific gas,it was then the court duty to determine whether the state was impermissibl y motiv ated by nuclear safety concerns.id.at.
the second circuit held that the vermont legislature was improperly motivated by concerns relating to radiological safety in enacting the challenged law,and therefore,the statute was preempted on its face by the atomic energy act.id.at.in contrast,the commonwealth mining ban does not purport to regulate an activity within the act reach,and thus we need proceed no further.
finally,virginia uranium contends that the commonwealth ban on conventional mining is preempted as an obstacle to the full implementation of the objectives of the atomic energy act.we will find state laws preempted as in conflict with federal law if the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hines davidowitz.but we do not easily find preemption rather we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not superseded by federal law unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.wyeth,at quoting medtronic,at.
determining whether a state law stands as an obstacle to federal law is a process.first,we determine congress significant objective s in passing the federal law.williamson mazda motor of america.we then turn to whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant federal regulatory objective.id.internal citations omitted.
here,the parties do not dispute the atomic energy act stated purpose of promoting the safe development and use of atomic energy.see also pacific gas,at there is little doubt that a primary purpose of the act was,and continues to be,the promotion of nuclear power.virginia uranium claims that the commonwealth has created an obstacle to that congressional purpose by banning uranium mining outright.it asks us to imagine what would become of congress desire to encourage the development and use of uranium if all states enacted similar legislation.appellants br.at.
in fact,this hypothetical nationwide web of mining bans would have little effect.why for starters,over ninety percent of the uranium used by the country industry is imported,so state bans on domestic production would have negligible effect.moreover,as of,eighteen domestic uranium recovery facilities those that either use in situ leaching or are located on federal lands are licensed by the nrc and thus beyond the reach of any state bans.finally,if push comes to shove,the atomic energy act allows the federal government to forcibly expand the production of domestic source material the nrc may purchase,condemn,or otherwise acquire real property containing deposits of source material.in sum,congress purposes and objectives in passing the act are not materially affected by the commonwealth ban on conventional uranium mining.the district court properly dismissed this case.
for the reasons given,we affirm the district court judgment.
at issue in this case is virginia right to ban the mining of uranium because of radiological safety concerns regarding uranium milling and tailings management.while virginia apprehension is certainly understandable,in my view congress has taken away a state ability to limit mining for this particular reason.
under the federal atomic energy act of the act or the aea,see et,as amended,the federal government assumed responsibility for establishing a regime to make the development of nuclear energy safe enough that the powerful forces of the private sector could be unleashed to develop that energy to the maximum extent possible.the supreme court in pacific gas held that congress intended that the federal government would exclusively occupy the field of radiological safety concerns regarding the activities the act regulates and,indeed,that this exclusivity is central to the act objectives.if virginia sought to limit the occurrence of activities based on its own radiological safety concerns and virginia has not disputed that it did that action represents a clear encroachment into the preempted field.
virginia foray into this prohibited field would also thwart the act objectives.the aea allows states to assume limited aspects of the authority of the nuclear regulatory commission nrc,but only if the nrc has approved the state regulatory program,and virginia has not obtained any authority to regulate uranium mining or tailings management.by refusing to respect the regulatory regime the nrc established regarding these activities,and by instead unilaterally attempting,based on its own safety concerns,to prevent the occurrence of these very activities that congress was attempting to support,virginia has frustrated congress objectives.
for both of these reasons,i believe that the district court erred in dismissing this action,and i respectfully dissent from the majority contrary disposition.
the stakes in this case are significant.uranium is the predominant fuel source for nuclear power plants,which,in,produced approximately of our country electricity.see energy information administration frequently asked questions,last visited,saved as ecf opinion attachment.in,approximately of the uranium used in those plants was imported.see energy information administration nuclear uranium uranium marketing annual report,last visited,saved as ecf opinion attachment.uranium is also the fissile material used for nuclear warheads.
the coles hill uranium deposit is the largest natural deposit of uranium in the united states and one of the largest in the world.the deposit,discovered in the early,includes approximately million pounds of uranium ore,worth between and billion.coles hill,llc,and bowen minerals,llc,own the land above the deposit.although they retain a royalty interest,they lease the mineral estate to virginia uranium,which is owned by virginia energy resources.
in light of the coles hill deposit geological properties,the uranium there would likely need to be extracted by conventional mining once mined,the uranium would need to be milled into usable form.typically,this occurs at the mining site.a mill grinds the ore into sand,which in turn is run through an acidic or alkaline solution to separate the uranium from the waste,or tailings.the uranium is then concentrated and dried into yellowcake,the final product that is commercially sold and shipped for enrichment.because the tailings continue to have most of their naturally occurring radioactivity,they would need to be stored securely in order to prevent any radioactive materials from escaping into the environment.
the federal government first authorized civilian application of atomic power with the atomic energy act of the act.see pacific gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm pacific gas.under the act,the federal government possessed a monopoly on nuclear technology.see english general.
in,the aea replaced the act and marked the beginning of private development of nuclear power.the aea stemmed from congress belief that the national interest would be served if the government encouraged the private sector to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes under a program of federal regulation and licensing.id.at.indeed,the act itself states that its goal is to encourage widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public.d emphasis added.to this end,the act was designed to insure that nuclear technology would be safe enough for such widespread development and use.pacific gas,at.
under the aea,congress gave the atomic energy commission aec now the nrc exclusive authority to license the transfer,delivery,receipt,acquisition,possession,and use of all nuclear materials.english,at.the act specifically provides that anyone wishing to transfer or receive in interstate commerce,manufacture,produce,transfer,acquire,own,possess,import,or export any radioactive byproduct material a term now defined to include the tailings or wastes produced by the extraction or concentration of uranium is required to obtain a license from the nrc a,e see b.pursuant to these statutes,the nrc has promulgated detailed regulations designed to ensure the radiological safety of uranium milling and tailings management see pt,app.
in,congress amended the act to allow states to assume limited aspects of the nrc regulatory authority if certain conditions are satisfied.see english,at.specifically,the nrc may enter into agreements with the governor of any state in order to regulate the materials covered by the agreement for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.b.however,the nrc may enter into such an agreement only after ensuring that the state program is compatible with the otherwise applicable federal regulations and is adequate to protect the public health and safety with respect to the materials covered by the agreement.d.
in,virginia entered into a limited agreement with the nrc,under which virginia would assume the authority to regulate the radiological hazards of source material which includes uranium and uranium ore and most byproduct material.fed.reg.however,the agreement explicitly excluded uranium tailings.see e.thus,the nrc retained exclusive authority to regulate the radiological dangers pertaining to uranium milling and tailings management.
in,soon after the discovery of the coles hill deposit,the virginia legislature imposed an emergency moratorium on uranium mining and subsequently extended the emergency moratorium into an indefinite ban.see.code although the ban nominally addresses uranium mining,in actuality,it was concerns of the radiological safety of uranium milling and tailings management that motivated the legislature to act the legislature banned uranium mining only as a means to prevent milling and tailings management from occurring in virginia.
the legislature considered lifting the ban between and but ultimately decided against doing so.
virginia uranium,coles hill,llc,bowen materials,llc,and virginia energy resources,collectively,virginia uranium filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against several governmental defendants collectively,the commonwealth.virginia uranium alleges that the aea preempts virginia ban under two theories.first,it claims that,by enacting the aea,congress intended that the federal government would exclusively occupy the field of radiological safety concerns regarding the activities the aea regulates.virginia uranium claims that the mining ban is grounded primarily in virginia radiological safety concerns regarding two such activities the milling of the uranium that would be mined in virginia if mining were permitted,and the storage of the tailings that would result.in light of this purpose of protecting against the radiological dangers associated with these two activities,virginia uranium maintains that virginia ban encroaches upon the very field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.
second,virginia uranium contends that the mining ban does not respect the balance congress struck regarding the objectives of promoting uranium development and ensuring health,safety,and environmental protection.virginia uranium maintains that the act contemplates that uranium development will not be barred on the basis of concerns regarding the radiological dangers of regulated activities,so long as the federal regulations applying to those activities are satisfied.virginia uranium alleges that virginia uranium mining ban effectively operates as a ban on storing uranium tailings even though virginia does not have the federal government permission to regulate that activity.thus,virginia uranium claims that the ban is preempted as an obstacle to the full implementation of the act objectives 
virginia uranium seeks a declaration that the aea preempts.code.it also requests an injunction forbidding the commonwealth from adhering to and requiring it to process permit applications for uranium mining.the commonwealth moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.see fed.civ.b.the commonwealth did not then and does not now dispute virginia uranium allegation that is actually grounded in the legislature radiological safety concerns regarding uranium milling and uranium tailings management nor has it ever disputed that uranium milling and tailings management are activities that the act regulates.nevertheless,it argued that because does not directly prevent those activities but only directly bans uranium mining albeit as a means of preventing the activities the ban is not preempted.
virginia uranium opposed the commonwealth motion to dismiss and filed a for summary judgment,attaching hundreds of pages of materials that virginia uranium maintained demonstrated,as a matter of law,that virginia ban on mining was a pretext for its true goal of preventing uranium milling and tailings management.
the district court granted the commonwealth motion,ruling that the ban is not preempted even assuming that the virginia legislature actual purpose was to protect against the radiological dangers associated with uranium milling and tailings management.see virginia uranium,mcauliffe,supp.the district court reasoned that because the aea does not regulate conventional mining of uranium ore on nonfederal lands,virginia was free to ban uranium ore mining as a means of preventing uranium milling and tailings management,in order to avoid the radiological dangers associated with those activities.see id.at.thus,the court concluded that the ban did not encroach upon the field reserved exclusively for the federal government.see id.
for similar reasons,the court also concluded that the ban was not preempted under the doctrine of conflict preemption because it did not frustrate the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress regarding the promotion of nuclear power.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in this regard,the court reasoned primarily that the act evinced no purpose or objective that nonfederal uranium deposits should be conventionally mined.id.and the court suggested that the federal government was free to condemn the property if it wished to have the uranium therein conventionally mined.see id.at the court also determined that virginia did not circumvent the requirements congress put in place for states to assume regulation of uranium milling and tailings management because virginia statute did not purport to regulate those activities.see id.at.
having decided to dismiss the action,the court denied as moot virginia uranium summary judgment motion.see id.at.
virginia uranium argues that the district court erred in dismissing its action.i agree.

the supreme court in pacific gas established the legal analysis that governs this appeal,and i believe it is important to review the court reasoning in some detail.in pacific gas,the court considered whether the aea preempted a california statute imposing a moratorium on nuclear plant construction in california until a state commission found that adequate facilities and means of disposal of spent nuclear fuel were available.see pacific gas,at.the plaintiffs the utilities maintained that the moratorium was enacted based on the california legislature safety concerns regarding the radiological dangers of operating nuclear reactors in the absence of any strategy for the storage of spent nuclear fuel.see id.at.they advanced three arguments that the moratorium was preempted first,because the moratorium was grounded in nuclear safety concerns it fell within an exclusively federal field second,the moratorium and the judgments underlying it conflicted with the decisions that congress and the nrc had made regarding nuclear waste disposal and third,the moratorium frustrate d the federal goal of developing nuclear technology as a source of energy.id.at.
the court began its preemption analysis by observing that the act did not expressly require the states to construct or authorize nuclear power plants or prohibit the states from deciding,as an absolute or conditional matter,not to permit the construction of any further reactors.id.at.the court therefore turned to the question of field preemption and,specifically,the scope of the aea preempted field as it would relate to a state ban on construction of nuclear powerplants.the court noted that the utilities had maintained that congress had intended to preserve the federal government as the sole regulator of all matters nuclear.id.the court did not view the exclusive federal field as being quite that broad,however.rather,the court observed that congress had intended roles for both the federal government and the states 
congress intended that the federal government should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant,but that the states would retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need,reliability,cost and other related state concerns.
the court then turned its focus to the challenged california statute.the court noted initially that the statute does not seek to regulate the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant,which would have been clearly impermissible given that the act specifically regulates the manner in which nuclear plants must be constructed and operated.id.at see id.noting the nrc exclusive authority over plant construction and operation.on the other hand,the court rejected the argument of the defendants collectively,california that although safety regulation of nuclear plants by states is forbidden,a state may completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns are satisfied by the federal government.id.the court reasoned that it is not the case that s tate safety regulation is preempted only when it conflicts with federal law.rather,the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states.id.emphasis added see also k nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of any state or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.
in light of the court conclusions regarding the scope of the preempted field,the court reasoned that a state moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns would fall squarely within it.pacific gas,at.the court added that a statute based on such concerns would also be preempted for the two other reasons the utilities advanced.first,a state judgment that nuclear power is not safe enough to be further developed would conflict directly with the countervailing judgment of the nrc,that nuclear construction may proceed notwithstanding extant uncertainties as to waste disposal.id.citation omitted.and second,a state prohibition on nuclear construction for safety reasons would be preempted because it would be in the teeth of the act objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use.id.
even though the text of the moratorium itself did not demonstrate that the statute was preempted,given the court conclusion that a prohibition on the construction of nuclear powerplants would be preempted if grounded in nuclear safety concerns,the court decided that it wa s necessary to determine whether there was a rationale for the statute.id.
turning to that question,the court noted that california has maintained that its moratorium was aimed at economic problems,not radiation hazards.id.and the court discussed legislative history supporting california claim.see id.at.the supreme court observed that the ninth circuit,relying on this legislative history,had determined that the california legislature was indeed motivated by economic considerations rather than safety concerns.see id.at.and,the court noted that its general practice is to place considerable confidence in the interpretations of state law reached by the federal courts of appeals.id.citing mills rogers,and bishop wood.
the court then proceeded to discuss four considerations that the utilities and amici had identified as indicia that the ninth circuit determination was incorrect and that the california legislature had actually been motivated by safety concerns.see id.at.although the court downplayed the persuasiveness of each of the four,it nonetheless acknowledged that they were subject to varying interpretation.id.at.nevertheless,in addition to the inconclusiveness of these indicia,the court identified two other reasons why it would accept the ninth circuit determination regarding the california legislature motivation rather than becom ing embroiled itself in the inquiry.id.the court noted first that inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture considering that individual legislators do not necessarily all have the same motivation for voting to enact particular legislation.id.and the court noted as well that the ninth circuit inquiry into whether california was motivated by safety concerns would be particularly pointless considering that congress specifically allowed the states to decide against constructing new nuclear powerplants for economic reasons.see id.the court observed that states inclined not to allow new nuclear powerplants could easily disallow plants on that basis and that congress would be free to revoke this authority if it decided that states were abusing it by offering perpetual economic considerations as the reason for restrictions that are actually grounded in safety concerns.see id.the court therefore accepted the ninth circuit determination and california representation that the state legislature had been motivated primarily by economic considerations rather than safety concerns.see id.consequently,the court held that the statute lies outside the occupied field of nuclear safety regulation.id.
the court then turned to the utilities other two preemption arguments.the court concluded that there was no conflict between the california legislature judgment,for economic reasons,that nuclear plants should not be built because t he nrc imprimatur indicates only that it is safe to proceed with such plants,not that it is economically wise to do so.id.at.
regarding the argument that the moratorium frustrated the act purpose to develop the commercial use of nuclear power,id.at,the court acknowledged that the promotion of nuclear power was indeed a primary purpose of the act.id.at.however,the court also recognized that the act was not designed to promot e nuclear power at all costs.id.at.rather,the legal reality remains that congress left sufficient authority in the states to allow the development of nuclear power to be slowed or even stopped for economic reasons.id.at emphasis added.because the court had accepted the ninth circuit determination that california moratorium was in fact enacted for economic reasons rather than reasons of safety,the court concluded that the moratorium did not frustrate the act purposes and thus was not preempted for that reason either.see id.
the analysis in pacific gas demonstrates,both for reasons of field preemption and conflict preemption,that the district court erred in dismissing virginia uranium action.

i begin with field preemption.just as was true of california moratorium in pacific gas,see at,the substance of virginia law a ban on conventional uranium mining does not conflict with the act,which does not regulate conventional mining on lands.nevertheless,as pacific gas held,a statute purpose can itself bring the statute within the prohibited field.see pacific gas,at see also english,at noting that pacific gas defined part of the preempted field by reference to the purpose of the state law north carolina ex rel.cooper tva,cir.t he pacific gas court explained that when congress chose to give the nrc control over issues relating to nuclear safety,it completely occupied the field of nuclear safety regulations.oneok,at holding that whether the natural gas act nga preempts a particular state law turns on the target at which the state law aims rejecting the dissent contention that that the court should instead focus on what the state seeks to regulate,not why the state seeks to regulate it emphasis in original.thus,as in pacific gas,it is necessary to determine whether there is a rationale for the ban pacific gas,at.
unlike in pacific gas,wherein california claimed that the moratorium was actually grounded on a concern,the commonwealth makes no such claim here.rather,at this stage of the litigation,the commonwealth concedes the truth of virginia uranium allegation that the moratorium is grounded on the virginia legislature concerns regarding the radiological safety of uranium ore milling and tailings storage.the commonwealth also does not dispute that these two activities are regulated under the act see e,z,a,a.thus,under the reasoning of pacific gas,because the virginia statute was grounded in nuclear safety concerns,it falls squarely in the prohibited field,and is preempted for that reason pacific gas,at.
until today,each court of appeals addressing the issue since pacific gas has held that state statutes enacted to protect against the radiological dangers of activities the aea regulates are preempted regardless of whether the statutory text reveals that purpose and regardless of whether the statute expressly prohibits an activity the act regulates 
in skull valley band of goshute indians nielson,cir,for example,the tenth circuit considered whether the aea preempted several utah statutes.most relevant here were statutes that took control of the only road permitting access to the proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility.by designating it a state highway and then requiring the consent of the governor and the state legislature before any company engaged in the transportation or storage of spent nuclear fuel was allowed to drive on it the road provisions.id.at.as was true of the statute in pacific gas,and as is true of the virginia statute challenged in the present case,the road provisions did not directly prohibit any activities regulated by the act.in fact,the conduct the provisions directly addressed concerned transportation,a category traditionally subject to local control.nevertheless,the tenth circuit recognized that regardless of the nature of the activity the provisions directly addressed,the applicable preemption analysis requires consideration of the purpose of the allegedly preempted statute.id.at emphasis added.
as for what the actual purpose was,the court noted comments by the sponsoring legislator and the governor indicating that the provisions purpose was to protect utah citizens against the hazards of storage and transportation of nuclear waste by preventing those activities from occurring in utah.see id.observing that utah officials did not attempt to contest any of this evidence and that it was unlikely that they could,the court concluded that t he record establishes that the road provisions were enacted for reasons of radiological safety and are therefore preempted.id.
the court also conducted a similar analysis of provisions that prohibit ed counties from providing services,including fire protection,garbage disposal,water,electricity,and law enforcement,to spent nuclear fuel transportation and storage facilities within the county.id.at.the court rejected the argument that provisions affecting these types of services were not preempted because such services have been traditionally regulated by local governments.id.at.rather,the court concluded that despite the fact that the subjects that the law directly addressed were traditionally left to local governments to regulate,a state can not use its authority to regulate law enforcement and other similar matters as a means of regulating radiological hazards.id.at emphasis added.
the second circuit in entergy nuclear vermont yankee,llc shumlin,cir,engaged in a similar analysis,holding that the aea preempted a vermont law requiring that nuclear plants in vermont can be operated only with the legislature explicit approval.see id.at.as with the statutes in pacific gas and the present case,the substance of the restriction the vermont law imposed did not conflict with the aea.see pacific gas,at.nevertheless,the court recognized that a law enacted for th e purpose of protecting against radiological dangers would fall squarely within the prohibited field.entergy,at.consequently,the court reasoned that,as in pacific gas,it was necessary to determine whether there is a rationale for the statute.id.quoting pacific gas,at.
the text of the vermont law explicitly declared that the statute was not grounded in nuclear safety concerns.see id.at.nevertheless,the court noted that its inquiry into the legislature motivation does not end at the text of the statute.id.at.the court observed that,were the text determinative,legislatures could nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation by simply publishing a legislative committee report articulating some state interest or policy other than the frustration of the federal objective that would be tangentially furthered by the proposed state law.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also id.we decline vermont invitation to apply an analytic framework akin to rational basis review,which would preclude us from identifying the true purpose of a statute as required by pacific gas and would allow states to implement a moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns that falls squarely within the prohibited field.quoting pacific gas,at.the court therefore proceeded to review various indicia concerning the legislature motivation for enacting the statute.see id.at.in the end,the court of appeals agreed with the district court that radiological safety concerns were the primary purpose for the statute enactment,even if individual legislators may have acted for other reasons as well.id.at see id.at.the court thus concluded that the statute was preempted.see id.at.see also vermont yankee nuclear power entergy nuclear.yankee,llc,fed.cir.a state law related to nuclear power is preempted if it is motivated by safety concerns.united states manning,cir.the act preempts state law if the purpose of the state law is to regulate against radiation hazards.united states kentucky,cir.t he aea preempts any state attempt to regulate materials covered by the act for safety purposes.
i would apply the very same principles that animated the decisions in all of these cases and hold that virginia uranium has successfully alleged a claim under the doctrine of field preemption.
conflict preemption 
in addition to being preempted for falling within the prohibited field,the virginia statute is also preempted under the doctrine of conflict preemption because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hines,at.as the supreme court explained in pacific gas,t here is little doubt that a primary purpose of the act was,and continues to be,the promotion of nuclear power.at see also.more specifically,an objective of the act was to ensure that the development of nuclear energy would be sufficiently safe that the power of the private sector could be unleashed to develop nuclear energy to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public.d see english,at pacific gas,at.it is hard to imagine how virginia mining ban,grounded on safety concerns regarding the radiological dangers the federal government is charged with regulating,would not be found to frustrate those objectives.virginia,not trusting that the federal government has sufficiently protected against the radiological dangers of uranium milling and tailings management,has unilaterally sought to prevent the involvement of the very forces that the act was designed to unleash.such an attempt would be in the teeth of the act objective to insure that the development of nuclear source material is safe enough for widespread development and use and would be preempted for that reason as well pacific gas,see northern states power minnesota,cir.congress vested the aec with the authority to resolve the proper balance between desired industrial progress and adequate health and safety standards.were the states allowed to impose stricter standards,they might conceivably be so overprotective in the area of health and safety as to unnecessarily stultify the industrial development and use of atomic energy for the production of electric power,aff.
importantly,a state law is preempted for frustrating a federal statute objectives if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goal.international paper ouellette,see columbia venture,llc dewberry davis,llc,cir.although the district court suggested that the nrc could counter virginia efforts by condemning the property,see virginia uranium,supp.at,the availability of this option does not change the fact that virginia has interfered with congress chosen method of uranium development,under which private parties such as virginia uranium would be free to engage in the regulated activities themselves without having to involve the federal government.
virginia interference with congress intended methods becomes even more apparent when one considers the clear route congress set out for states that desire to assume the federal government regulatory authority.congress designed section of the act to further cooperation between the states and the commission with respect to control of radiation hazards and to establish procedures and criteria for the assumption by the states of certain of the commission regulatory responsibilities.a.for those reasons,the act authorizes states to enter into agreements with the nrc to regulate the materials covered by the agreement for the duration of such an agreement.b.critically,though,a state seeking to enter such an agreement must first persuade the federal regulators that the state proposed regulations are compatible with the commission program for the regulation of the materials covered by the agreement,and are adequate to protect the public health and safety with respect to those materials.d.it is undisputed here that virginia never obtained the authority to regulate uranium tailings.by attempting instead to eschew the system congress established,and by unilaterally regulating against the dangers of uranium tailings under the pretext of regulating uranium mining,virginia circumvented the act requirements and frustrated congress objectives.
indeed,the supreme court found preemption on analogous facts in gade national solid wastes management association.in that case,illinois attempted to enforce training standards for certain hazardous waste workers that were stricter than the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act of osha.see id.at.osha allowed states to regulate an occupational safety and health issue themselves only pursuant to a federally approved state plan that displaces the federal standards.id.at plurality opinion.by giving states the option of displacing federal regulation entirely but conditioning states rights to do so on federal approval,congress was able to promote occupational safety and health while at the same time avoiding duplicative,and possibly counterproductive,regulation.id.at plurality opinion.the court held that illinois attempt to supplement the federal regulations with its own standards without obtaining federal approval,see id.at,frustrated osha objectives because it interfere d with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to achieve its goals.id.at plurality opinion see id.at plurality opinion id.at kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment agreeing with the plurality determination of the scope of the preemptive field but disagreeing with the plurality on the question of whether the preemption was implied or express.see also international paper,at holding that clean water act preempted vermont nuisance suits to the extent that the suits sought to impose liability on a new york point source because such suits would allow vermont and other states to do indirectly what they could not do directly regulate the conduct of sources arizona,at holding that arizona statute that authoriz ed state officers to decide whether an alien should be detained for being removable violate d the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the federal government and thus create d an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of congress.
i would apply the principles espoused in pacific gas,gade,and these other cases and hold that virginia uranium has successfully alleged a claim under the doctrine of conflict preemption as well.
in sum,established supreme court law makes clear that the aea preempts state statutes enacted for the purpose of protecting against the radiological dangers of activities the aea regulates.because the commonwealth has conceded at this point in the litigation that its statute was enacted for just that purpose,the virginia statute clearly falls within that prohibited field.
moreover,the statute is also preempted because it frustrates the aea objectives.the act is designed to allow the federal government to establish rules to ensure that uranium can be developed safely so that the power of the private sector may be utilized to maximize our country ability to develop nuclear power.the act allows states to assume regulatory authority,but only to the extent that the nrc has agreed to that assumption based on its approval of the state regulatory program.by refusing to accept the federal government exclusive role in p
