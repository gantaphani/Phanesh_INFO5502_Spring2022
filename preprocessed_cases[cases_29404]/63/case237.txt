after bp products north america,bp determined that salik rao had secretly paid a bp manager to influence the award of operating agreements in rao favor,bp told rao it was terminating its franchise relationship with him at his two bp gas stations.rao maintains that bp failed to give him timely notice of early termination as required by the petroleum marketing practices act.we conclude that bp acquired knowledge of rao failure to comply with a franchise provision when rao stopped cooperating with bp investigation,so the notice was timely.rao had maintained all along that he had been the victim of extortion,and bp reasonably decided to continue investigating instead of immediately terminating the franchise.summary judgment was also proper on rao breach of contract claim because the franchise agreement allowed for early termination upon the commission of any fraudulent act.we further affirm the dismissal of rao claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and for fraud because the allegations in the complaint did not sufficiently state a claim on either count.as a result,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in accordance with a local rule,the district court justifiably deemed the factual assertions in bp rule a statement in support of its motion for summary judgment admitted because rao did not respond to the statement.see.b c all material facts set forth in the statement required of the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement of the opposing party.cracco vitran,cir raymond ameritech,cir.we recount the narrative that follows with that in mind.
salik rao began operating as a bp dealer in.the twelve or so bp gas stations he has operated include the two relevant in this case a station in morton grove,illinois and another in franklin park,illinois.rao began operating the morton grove station in and the franklin park station in.stephen yarr was a bp regional sales manager until he was fired in november.as the regional sales manager,yarr had significant control over the award of franchises and dealerships in chicago northern and western suburbs.
from to,rao paid yarr approximately in cash and gifts,including a computer,television,and other in an attempt to influence decisions regarding bp franchises.during that time,yarr allowed rao to purchase interests in two downtown chicago stations at a good price,and rao secretly gave yarr an interest in the stations.one was sold about eighteen months after rao purchased it for a profit of over million.
in,rao purchased a bp station in wilmette,illinois.although bp did not know it at the time,rao and paige thomason,a bp area representative,each put up half the purchase price for the station.as a bp employee,however,thomason was prohibited from owning an interest in any bp station.to get around this ban,rao agreed to form a corporation for the acquisition that fronted brad schumacher,thomason husband,as its corporate officer.after thomason stopped working for bp,rao agreed to sell his interest in the wilmette station to her.concerned that bp might exercise its right of first refusal,thomason and rao submitted a false letter of intent to bp that represented the station purchase price and value at when it was actually worth only.bp did not exercise its right of first refusal,and thomason bought rao interest in the station for.
rao also introduced his cousin,ateeq khan,to yarr while yarr was the bp regional sales manager.rao arranged for khan to meet yarr in connection with a bp station in lockport,illinois.khan admitted that he negotiated a payment of to yarr related to the sale of the lockport station before the fbi became involved in an investigation into money and gifts given to yarr.
although rao knew the money and gifts he was providing to yarr were improper,he did not say anything to anyone at bp until the summer of.that summer,rao told yarr boss that he was having problems with yarr.bp then had rao meet with its regional security advisor,ronald benhart.during a meeting in august,rao told benhart that he and other dealers had provided gifts and benefits to yarr over a long period of time,and that he had been extorted by yarr.in response to the allegation of extortion,benhart began an internal investigation that had yarr as its principal focus.benhart asked rao to provide any documentation or evidence he had to substantiate his allegations.benhart also contacted the fbi in august and asked for its cooperation in the investigation.on november,with rao cooperation,the fbi conducted a sting in which rao paid yarr.that month,benhart conducted multiple interviews with yarr,and yarr admitted that he had received money and gifts for facilitating transactions with dealers.bp fired yarr on november.
the termination of yarr employment did not end bp investigation.benhart continued to investigate after november,and he did so because rao was still maintaining that yarr had coerced him into providing benefits.on november,rao gave benhart a statement listing and explaining the gifts he gave to yarr.the statement repeated his assertion that he had been the victim of yarr extortion.therefore,benhart continued to seek any evidence of extortion.to that end,he also continued to contact rao in an attempt to set up meetings.rao stated that he would meet with benhart,although he did not do so after the fall of.benhart last spoke with rao in may or june of,and rao attorney told benhart in june that rao would no longer cooperate with bp investigation.
after benhart was told that rao would not cooperate any further,benhart informed bp management that no further information would be forthcoming from rao.bp management then made the decision to end its relationship with rao.on july,bp notified rao via letter that effective october,it was ending its franchise relationship with him because it concluded that he had engaged in bribery and fraud.it sent similar letters to other dealers who had been involved in comparable activities with yarr.at the time,rao was operating two bp stations under franchise agreements,one in morton grove with an agreement that expired in,and another in franklin park that expired in.bp subsequently extended the effective date of its terminations until december,then to february,and then to may,to allow rao more time to sell his interests in the morton grove and franklin park stations.
rao filed suit in federal court against bp,yarr,thomason,and schumacher alleging petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,rico,fraud,breach of contract,and extortion claims.after rao filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin bp from terminating his franchises,a magistrate judge conducted a evidentiary hearing.the magistrate judge recommended denying rao motion because rao was actively engaged in bribery and fraud and bp acted in good faith and was justified in terminating rao as a bp dealer.the district court agreed and denied the preliminary injunction motion.it later granted the defendants motion to dismiss rao rico,fraud,and breach of contract claims and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims.rao appeals.
ii.analysis 
notice timely under petroleum marketing practices act 
rao maintains that the notice bp gave that it was ending its relationship with him was not timely under the pmpa.we review the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue de novo.see breneisen motorola,cir.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c hobbs city of,cir.
the pmpa prohibits a franchisor from terminating a motor fuel franchise prior to the completion of its term unless the franchisor does so on the basis of a ground provided in the statute,and with the notice the statute requires.a jet,shell oil,cir.in doing so,the statute protects gas station franchisees from the arbitrary termination or nonrenewal of their franchises by large corporations,as well as from the threat of termination or nonrenewal.see marcoux shell oil prods.llc,cir citing,at,cong,dufresne auto service,shell oil,cir.the pmpa provides a civil cause of action for motor fuel franchisees terminated or not renewed in violation of its provisions.rawoof texor petroleum,cir.
although the pmpa generally prohibits the early termination of a franchise,there are exceptions.two of the exceptions are particularly relevant here.the pmpa allows early termination when there has been a failure by the franchisee to comply with any provision of the franchise,which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship a a.another ground for early termination is t he occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise is reasonable a c.the pmpa specifically lists fraud or criminal misconduct by the franchisee relevant to the operation of the marketing premises as an event falling within the latter provision.b c.
on appeal,rao does not contest that bp had the requisite cause to end its relationship with him.engaging in fraud against bp related to franchise award and purchase was relevant to the franchise relationship,and termination on that account was reasonable.see humboldt oil exxon,cir good faith belief of the franchisor that the franchisee is untrustworthy or engages in fraudulent practices undermines the entire franchise relationship.rao paid yarr six figures worth of cash and gifts to influence the award of gas stations to him,including the morton grove and franklin park stations at issue in this case.he made payments to yarr that allowed him to get a good price for two downtown service stations,and he secretly made yarr a partner in those stations.rao also secretly made thomason a partner in another station while she was a bp employee prohibited from having an interest in a bp station and used her husband as a straw owner.rao then sold his interest in it to her after she stopped working for the company.rao and thomason even submitted a false letter of intent that inflated the purchase price in a successful attempt to deter bp from exercising its right of first refusal.bp certainly had grounds under the statute to end its relationship with rao.
rather than arguing that bp basis for termination was insufficient,rao argument on appeal is that the notice he received was untimely under the pmpa.pursuant to the pmpa provisions applicable here,a franchisor must give notice of early termination within days of when it first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the failure to comply with a material franchise provision.b a i,b c i.this time limitation aims to prevent franchisors from basing termination upon old and long forgotten events while still giving the franchisor adequate time to evaluate the events or to work with the franchisee to correct the situation.brach amoco oil,cir.
bp informed rao on july,that it would be ending its relationship with him.rao argues that bp first acquired knowledge of his failure to comply with a franchise provision in november,well over days before bp notification.he therefore maintains that bp notice was untimely.bp,on the other hand,contends that it acted reasonably when it continued to investigate while rao was cooperating and maintaining he was a victim of extortion,and that it gave timely notice after rao stopped cooperating with the investigation and bp concluded he was not in fact an extortion victim.
we find the second circuit discussion in nassau boulevard shell service station,shell oil,cir,instructive.there,a shell franchisee argued that the pmpa clock should have started ticking when another shell station operator informed shell that the franchisee had used a credit card not belonging to him at another shell station.a few months later,shell learned that the franchisee had been arrested on suspicion of alleged credit card improprieties.shell conducted further investigation after learning of the arrest.it decided not to terminate the franchise upon a mere arrest since the franchisee had not been convicted of any crime,and shell conducted a series of conversations with the franchisee counsel.two months after the arrest,in a meeting with shell,the franchisee admitted he was embarrassed by the credit card incident and that he was undergoing therapy.within days of that meeting,shell gave notice of its intent to terminate the franchise.id.at.
although the franchisee argued that shell first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of his failure to abide by the terms of his franchise agreement when shell first learned of the allegations regarding misuse of a credit card,the second circuit held that shell did not acquire the knowledge contemplated by section of the pmpa until its meeting with the franchisee.id.at.it reasoned that starting the clock as soon as a franchisor hears an allegation of impropriety was inconsistent with congress intent when it passed the pmpa 
in passing the pmpa,congress intended to promote,if not mandate,this type of careful approach to termination by franchisors.the practice of such discretion,restraint,and prudence goes a long way toward prevention of arbitrary terminations based on idle rumor and baseless allegations.
id.the sixth circuit has also agreed with the second circuit reasoning,stating that the pmpa was not intended to induce the franchisor to terminate the franchise summarily upon the first suspicion of wrongdoing.geib amoco oil,cir see also desfosses wallace energy,cir.
we agree that the pmpa does not necessarily require a franchisor to give notice of termination upon the first hint that something might be amiss.that is especially true here.in november,when rao argues bp first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of his noncompliance,rao was still maintaining that yarr had extorted him.that month rao gave benhart a statement listing the gifts he gave to yarr,and rao statement very clearly expressed the view that he had been the victim of yarr extortion.during multiple interviews with yarr,however,yarr told bp that he received money and gifts that dealers voluntarily gave him in exchange for his assistance in facilitating transactions.
benhart therefore had two conflicting stories before him in november.rao said yarr had been extorting him,while yarr said rao paid the money willingly in exchange for favorable treatment.benhart made the reasonable decision to continue his investigation.he continued to contact rao to set up meetings,and rao said he would meet with benhart.rao had maintained all along that he was the victim of august when he met with benhart and said he had been extorted,in november when he argues the clock should have started to run,and even during the preliminary injunction hearing before the district court in this case.rao never admitted he had engaged in wrongdoing.in these circumstances,bp acted reasonably when it continued to investigate before it made the termination decision.
under rao rule,although the pmpa notice requirement is in place largely to protect franchisees,a franchisor would need to terminate the franchise upon the mere suspicion that its franchisee was not acting honorably.but a n interpretation of section which fosters termination based on rumor or suspicion surely does not afford the protection from arbitrary and discriminatory terminations that congress intended.nassau,at.of course,there could come a time when a franchisor purported investigation lasts an unreasonable amount of time.there is no indication here,however,that bp dragged its feet or acted unreasonably during its investigation,especially since rao had not admitted that he had engaged in bribery.rao told benhart in june that he would no longer cooperate with bp investigation.bp management concluded soon afterwards that rao had engaged in bribery and fraud,and it notified him on july,less than days later,of its intent to terminate the franchise relationship.we conclude that bp acquired the knowledge contemplated by sections b a and b c when rao said he would not cooperate with bp investigation any longer and that the notice bp gave was therefore timely.
in light of our decision,we need not address whether the pmpa applies to the morton grove station.rao maintains that it does,while bp argues that the type of
