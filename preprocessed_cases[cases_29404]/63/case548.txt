at issue is a rule adopted by the south coast air quality management district the district requiring the six oil refineries in its jurisdiction to reduce their emissions of ammonia and small particulate matter by december,or be subject to criminal,civil and administrative penalties and possible loss of their licenses to operate.the western states petroleum association wspa,representing the refineries,sought a writ of mandate from the superior court vacating the rule on the grounds the district lacked substantial evidence the refineries could achieve the new standards and that the new standards were cost effective.wspa also argued the rule should be vacated because the district had not adequately assessed the environmental impact,which would result from the refineries attempts to comply with the rule and had failed to maintain,produce and disclose pertinent records of the rule development.the superior court denied the writ and this timely appeal followed.
we conclude substantial evidence supports the district findings of feasibility and cost effectiveness.we also hold the district complied with the applicable ceqa requirements and substantial evidence supports the trial court finding the administrative record contains all relevant documents in the district possession.
facts and proceedings below 
a.the rule 
in november the district adopted rule giving the six refineries in its jurisdiction until december,to reduce the emissions of and ammonia from their fluid catalytic cracking units fccus.the refineries may request an extension to december,to synchronize the installation of control devices with their fccus operational cycles.the new standards provide emissions can not exceed grains per dry standard cubic foot and ammonia emissions can not exceed parts per million by volume ppmv.as an alternative to meeting the standard of the rule allows a refinery to emit up to of if it can find ways to make up the difference.the rule provides other escape clauses for refineries which are unable to meet the new standards,as discussed below 
b.the reason for the rule 
an fccu is a processing unit used in refining petroleum.the fccu takes heavy crude oil and cracks it into more usable hydrocarbons.these hydrocarbons can be further refined to make gasoline and other fuels.this cracking creates fine particulate matter referred to in the industry as the federal environmental protection agency epa has found the adverse health effects from elevated concentrations include lung damage,respiratory and disease and premature death.children,the elderly and people suffering from heart and lung diseases such as asthma are particularly at risk 
in order to try to trap before it can escape into the environment fccus are equipped with electrostatic precipitators esps.an esp electrically charges the particles which are then attracted to large collection plates which are oppositely charged.the particles are removed from the plates in one of two ways.a dry esp uses a mechanical hammering device,which dislodges the particles.a wet esp uses water to continuously wash down the plates.no esp is percent efficient in trapping so some particulate matter inevitably escapes into the environment.
in order to enhance an esp ability to trap refineries sometimes use ammonia as an agent to reduce the particles resistance to electrical charge.the problem with this technique is that it creates ammonia slip unreacted ammonia,which is emitted into the atmosphere where it reacts with other gases to produce fine chemical particulates such as ammonia sulfates,which can cause conjunctivitis,laryngitis and pulmonary edema especially in persons suffering from asthma.
the epa has established nationwide standards for emissions and has found the southern california basin to be serious ly out of conformity with those standards accordingly the epa has given california a deadline of december,to bring emissions into compliance with federal standards.failure to do so could ultimately subject the state to severe penalties such as the withholding of billions of dollars in federal highway funds 
although fccus are not the only source of emissions they are the single largest regulated stationary source of pollution in the southern california basin emitting approximately tons of into the atmosphere each year.thus it was inevitable the south coast district would seek to reduce these emissions as part of its strategy to bring the basin into conformity with federal standards.
development of rule 
the district staff first proposed a rule limiting in but other priorities intervened until when agency staff and refinery operators formed a task force to study fccu emissions and potential control strategies.the task force conducted source tests at the six refineries under the south coast district jurisdiction.summarizing the results of these tests the district staff noted the refinery with the newest esp technology got little actual pm reduction and still emits significant amounts of ammonia.in fact the tests showed as emissions were reduced ammonia emissions increased.the staff recommended any further development of the rule include limits on ammonia emissions.
further development of the rule was postponed until when the district staff formed a working group with representatives of the refineries and wspa to consider appropriate limits on and ammonia emissions.representatives of environmental organizations were also invited to participate.
after consultation with the members of the working group the south coast district staff proposed a rule calling for emission limits of for and ppmv for ammonia.the staff based these limits on the current emission level at refinery a,which had the newest esp among the six refineries 
wspa objected to the proposed rule on the ground refinery a had characteristics not found or reproducible at other refineries.moreover,wspa contended,even with its new equipment,refinery a had not been able to achieve a emission level on a consistent basis.an expert engaged by wspa concluded the lowest feasible emission rate of would be regardless of how little or how much ammonia the refinery used in its esp.the south coast district own expert disputed the conclusions of wspa expert.he concluded the proposed limits on and ammonia emissions were technologically feasible and sustainable.nevertheless this expert recommended increasing the limit to to account for space constraints at some of the refineries,which could affect their ability to install the equipment necessary to meet the proposed limit of.
prior to submitting the proposed rule to the district board for approval the staff prepared and publicly circulated an environmental assessment which acknowledged that even with mitigating measures the construction of the new or modified esps needed to comply with the proposed rule could cause significant impacts on air quality.despite this adverse environmental impact the staff recommended adoption of the proposed rule because its benefits outweighed its detriments.
at a public hearing the south coast district board heard presentations by its staff and representatives of wspa along with testimony from a refinery representative and members of the public.following the hearing the board voted to adopt the environmental assessment and the proposed rule.
wspa petition for writ of mandate 
wspa filed suit in the superior court of los angeles county challenging the legality of rule.the suit seeks a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section and injunctive and declaratory relief on the grounds the rule is arbitrary,capricious and an abuse of discretion,lacks adequate evidentiary support and was adopted without adherence to proper administrative procedures.in particular,the complaint alleges rule establishes emission limits for,which are neither feasible nor cost effective,and was adopted without proper adherence to the requirements of the california environmental quality act ceqa prior to a hearing on the writ petition wspa moved for an order requiring the district to correct the administrative record to include all documents created prior to addressing the feasibility and of proposed rule.
the trial court denied the motion to correct the record and denied the writ.wspa filed a timely appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
the parties agree the district adoption of rule was a action.as such the authority of the trial court is limited to determining whether the decision of the agency was arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or unlawfully or procedurally unfair.this limited judicial review is further constrained by the recognition that i n technical matters requiring the assistance of experts and the study of marshaled scientific data as reflected herein,courts will permit administrative agencies to work out their problems with as little judicial interference as possible.
we review the trial court decision de novo under the same standard 
ii.substantial evidence supports the district determination the limit on emissions in rule is achievable by the refineries.
the experts consulted by the district and wspa agreed that given the right circumstances a reduction of emissions to is achievable with existing technology the issues before the district board were what are the right circumstances and whether they exist or can they be created at the six affected refineries.
wspa own experts on esp design and operation testified the most important factors in trapping emissions are the size of the unit,the amount of heat inside the unit and the amount of redundancy built into the unit 
the district relied on a variety of evidence showing the affected refineries could design and build esps which were big enough,hot enough and had enough redundancy to achieve the and ammonia limits contained in rule we summarize below this evidence and the escape routes built into the rule.
refinery a 
the principal evidence supporting the rule consisted of test results from refinery a,one of the six affected refineries,which showed during the period to the refinery consistently met or bettered the rule requirements as to and ammonia emissions refinery a was retested in and again met both the and ammonia standards.
wspa contends refinery a achievements are not a fair indication the other refineries can meet the standards prescribed by rule.
because of the configuration of refinery a fccu its emissions were tested before they passed through a co boiler,which produces additional.the evidence showed,however,one of the other refineries also has its co boiler downstream of its esp.there is nothing in the district rules to prevent a refinery from placing its co boiler downstream or eliminating the co boiler altogether.
wspa also contends the other refineries do not have sufficient space available to duplicate the size of refinery a esp.wspa cites no evidence to back up this contention.a consultant hired by the district reached the opposite conclusion based on its site visits to each of the refineries.
wspa next contends refinery a lower emissions were not solely the result of installing a new esp in but were due in part to other changes in the refinery system which impacted fccu emissions.the record contains no evidence,however,to support wspa conclusion the other changes made at the same time the new esp was installed helped reduce the refinery a emissions even assuming such a correlation exists wspa produced no evidence the other refineries could not make the same changes refinery a made or that the cost of these changes would be prohibitive.
finally,wspa states refinery a operates a more efficient hot esp while other refineries configurations require that they use less efficient cold esps.italics added.again wspa cites no evidence in the record to support the quoted statement.what the record does show is that esp typically operate at a temperature of to degrees and that esp can be designed for all six refineries to operate at those temperatures.
as to redundancy,the south coast district consultant concluded esp could be designed and installed at the affected refineries to meet the requirements of rule with percent of their esps out of service.although wspa expert disputed this conclusion,it was up to the district board to decide which expert opinion to accept.
evaluations by esp manufacturers 
the south coast district staff consulted with several esp manufacturers in determining whether the proposed rule was feasible.while all the manufacturers hedged and qualified their responses,none stated the rule requirements could not be met.for example,mcgill airclean corporation stated its dry esps have shown they can achieve the outer level of d on fcc units and southern environmental corporation stated it could guarantee a emission standard of using a dry esp unit so long as there was enough room to install the unit and the esp could use some ammonia injection.
evaluation by esp consultant 
the six affected refineries were evaluated by james campbell,a consultant with many years experience in working with esps.after making site visits to each refinery campbell concluded a limit of was technically feasible with the use of dry esps and without any ammonia conditioning.campbell also concluded,however,three of the refineries would have difficulty meeting this standard on a consistent basis because of space limitations affecting redundancy.for this reason campbell recommended,and the board adopted,a higher emission limit of with ppmv of ammonia slip.
alternatives to complying with the rule emission standards 
the availability of three escape routes from the rule emission standards further convinces us the board acted reasonably in adopting the rule.
rule requires each refinery to comply with the and ammonia limits by december.refineries,however,may request an extension up to december,in order to synchronize the installation of control devices with their normal fccu turnaround times.
a refinery which finds it can not meet the emissions standard of is permitted to emit not to exceed so long as the difference is mitigated by alternative control measures 
finally,recognizing there were arguments against the rule feasibility by respectable industry sources,the district staff promised at the public hearing on the rule it would monitor the refineries progress in meeting the rule,report back to the board,and make adjustments in the rule if adjustments are necessary.
these alternatives appear to address wspa concerns other refineries may not be able to duplicate the emissions of refinery 
for the reasons discussed above we conclude the record contains substantial evidence the refineries will be able to comply with rule.
iii.the district properly determined the cost effectiveness of rule 
before the district can adopt a new regulation which will significantly affect emissions limitations the district must,to the extent data is available,perform an assessment of the socioeconomic impacts of the adoption of the rule or regulation.the socioeconomic impact of an emission limitation includes t he range of probable costs,including costs to industry,of the rule or regulation and t he availability and of alternatives to the rule or regulation,as determined pursuant to health and safety code section.in adopting a regulation the district must consider and make available to the public its findings related to the cost effectiveness of a control measure determined pursuant to health and safety code section as well as the basis for the findings and the considerations involved.furthermore,the district shall make reasonable efforts,to the extent feasible within existing budget constraints,to make specific reference to the direct costs expected to be incurred by regulated parties,including businesses and individuals.
the record shows the total cost of installing new esps at the five refineries that currently do not meet the standard will be in the range of million to million.based on these figures the district staff estimated the cost effectiveness of the rule to be between and per ton of and ammonia reduced.
wspa argues the district failed to properly evaluate the costs of the proposed rule because it ignored wspa data and used generic equipment cost indexes instead.the record refutes this claim.it shows the district consultant,sp environmental,visited each of the
