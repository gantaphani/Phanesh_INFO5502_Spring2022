background 
statutory and regulatory framework 
section b of the natural gas act the act,et,governs the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.b.however,in section b of the act congress prescribed not only the intended reach of the commission power,but also specified the areas into which this power was not to extend.federal power comm panhandle pipe line.emphasis added.section b expressly exempts from the commission jurisdiction the production or gathering of natural gas.b.thus,congress carefully divided,northwest central pipeline state.comm n,d,energy regulatory authority and did not envisage federal regulation of the entire field to the limit of constitutional power.rather it contemplated the exercise of federal power as specified in the act.panhandle eastern,at.at.
the natural gas act does not define either transportation,which falls within the commission jurisdiction,or gathering,which is exempt from ferc authority under the act.the supreme court has,however,held that e xceptions to the primary grant of jurisdiction in the section are to be strictly construed.interstate natural gas federal power comm n.construing b.thus,the supreme court has consistently held that production and gathering are terms narrowly confined to the physical acts of drawing the gas from the earth and preparing it for the first stages of distribution.northern natural gas state.comm n,d.the commission definition of gathering,taken as consistent with the supreme court pronouncements on the act,is the collecting of gas from various wells and bringing it by separate and several individual lines to a central point where it is delivered into a single line.barnes transp,see also conoco ferc,gathering is the process of taking natural gas from the wells and moving it to a collection point for further movement through a pipeline principal transmission system.citing northwest pipeline ferc,cir.
despite these attempts to clarify the natural gas act,this court has observed that t he line between jurisdictional transportation and nonjurisdictional gathering is not always clear.conoco,at.for many years the commission employed two principal tests to differentiate transportation from gathering.developed in the context,these tests were the test and the test.the test presumes that all facilities located between the wellhead and a processing plant are gathering lines,while facilities downstream of the processing plant are presumptively transportation facilities.see phillips petroleum,wl,rev on other grounds,wisconsin federal power comm n,aff,phillips petroleum wisconsin.for gas that requires no processing the test applied,under which lateral lines collecting gas from separate wells that then converge into a single larger line typically at the point where the gas is compressed for transportation by the pipeline,were classified as gathering facilities,barnes transp.since,the commission has subsumed these two tests into its primary function test to determine whether a facility is devoted to the collection of gas from to the further downstream movement of gas after it has been transportation.conoco,at citing farmland industries,at,wl amerada hess,at,wl.
the primary function test generally employs the following six physical criteria the length and diameters of the lines the extension of the facility beyond the central point in the field the geographic configuration of the facility the location of compressors and processing plants the location of wells along all or part of the line facility and the operating pressure of the lines.lomak petroleum,ferc.in addition,ferc considers the following criteria the purpose,location and operation of the facility the general business activity of the owner of the facility whether a jurisdictional determination,gathering versus transmission,is consistent with the objectives of the natural gas act and other legislation and the changing technical and geographic nature of exploration and production activities.id.no one factor is determinative in the primary function test,and not all factors apply in all situations.see williams field servs.group,ferc,conoco,at.the commission gives consideration to all of the facts and circumstances of the case rather than mechanically applying a facilities configuration standard.west.gathering,at,wl see also conoco,at.
when these physical factors were developed,most jurisdictional questions involved onshore facilities.as an increasing number of facilities have been constructed offshore on the outer continental shelf ocs,where the pattern of gathering and distribution differs,the applicability of the factors has been questioned.see,ep operating ferc,cir.specifically,it is often not feasible to process raw gas on open water.as a result,pipelines on the ocs typically do not gather gas at a local,centralized point within a field as they would onshore,to prepare it for traditional transportation.rather,on the ocs,relatively long lines are constructed to carry the raw gas from offshore platforms,where o nly the most rudimentary separation and dehydration operations are conducted,ep operating,at,to the shore or a point closer to shore,where it can be processed into pipeline quality gas.id.at.in ep operating,the fifth circuit discounted ferc ruling that the offshore platform where initial gas treatment took place constituted a central point in the field where the gathering function was complete,and reversed ferc decision that the long,diameter ocs pipeline downstream of that platform was a jurisdictional transportation facility.see id.at.following ep operating,ferc noted that because of recent advances in engineering and available technology,offshore drilling operations continue to move further offshore and further from existing interstate pipeline interconnections and therefore the commission would assess the continuing viability and relevance of the primary function test to current industry conditions.amerada hess,at.ferc then modified its primary function test to apply a sliding scale,allow ing for the use of gathering pipelines of increasing lengths and diameters in correlation to the distance from shore and the water depth of the offshore production area,id.at,and to consider the criteria described above.this modified primary function test was applied by ferc when sea robin petitioned in for a declaration that its facilities perform a gathering function,rather than transportation,thus entitling sea robin to exemption from the commission jurisdiction under section b of the act.
sea robin pipeline 
sea robin pipeline system is located entirely offshore in the gulf of mexico and approximately percent of its facilities lie in water depths of less than feet.it is one of numerous competing pipeline systems located in the gulf.the sea robin system is configured roughly in the form of an inverted y with two arteries stretching roughly southwest and southeast from a central point about fifty miles south of the louisiana coast.these two pipelines collect raw gas from offshore production platforms.sea robin vermilion compressor station stands at the intersection of these two pipelines.it compresses the gas from the platforms for travel north,up the inclined seabed,to the erath compressor station on the mainland.after collecting gas from four more platforms,the system terminates near erath,louisiana,where the gas is separated,dehydrated and processed.the erath compressor station then prepares the gas for delivery to downstream transmission pipelines at five nearby entry points.
the sea robin system consists of miles of pipelines with a capacity to transport billion cubic feet of gas per day and includes around horsepower hp of compression.the pipeline is in that it carries a raw stream of unpurified natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons taken directly from the gas wells.the total compression horsepower at the vermilion station hp and is hp at erath,louisiana.of the miles of pipes,miles are larger than twenty inches in diameter.the remaining miles of pipes,mostly running from individual platforms to the larger pipes,are between four and sixteen inches in diameter.
along the two arms of the inverted y,which extend out in the outer continental shelf,lateral lines with diameters ranging from to inches are connected to receipt points located on production platforms,or at subsea taps where sea robin facilities intersect with short lateral lines of producers or pipelines.through these upstream arms,sea robin moves the raw gas to the vermilion station at the fork of the y,a manned platform with two turbine compressor units of horsepower each.from there,the gas moves along the vermilion segment.that segment is the longest portion of the pipeline,consisting of miles of diameter pipeline running in a straight line from sea robin vermilion compressor station to onshore processing facilities.gas from four additional platforms is mingled with the gas traveling the vermilion segment.the four platforms along this section are within miles of the vermilion compressor station,which means that the last miles of the inch diameter pipeline are uninterrupted by lateral pipe segments.the gas and liquefiables delivered by sea robin meet the merchantable natural gas quality standards of downstream transmission pipelines.
ferc issued the original certificate for the sea robin system in,pursuant to section c of the natural gas act,c,authorizing the system to both sell and transport gas from the outer continental shelf.sea robin pipeline,wl.in later years the commission certificated extensions of the sea robin system farther out on the ocs.see sea robin pipeline,at.subsequently,sea robin became a pipeline,and its shippers today consist of producers and marketers that transport gas onshore for ultimate delivery to markets on connecting interstate pipelines.id.at.
prior proceedings 
in,the sea robin pipeline company petitioned ferc for a declaration that its facilities perform a gathering function,rather than transportation,and are thus not subject to the commission jurisdiction under section b of the natural gas act.see sea robin i,at.ferc denied sea robin petition,determining that its pipelines were engaged in jurisdictional transportation activities.see sea robin pipeline,wl,order denying reh g,wl.in reaching its conclusion,ferc emphasized the very large size of sea robin system.sea robin pipeline,at emphasis in original.according to the commission,the length and diameter of the system components,as well as its overall size,we re not outweighed by other elements of the primary function test.id.further,ferc repeatedly emphasized that the criteria in its test supported its conclusion that sea robin was a transporter,particularly sea robin prior certification as a jurisdictional pipeline and its ownership by an interstate pipeline.sea robin i,at.sea robin petitioned for review of ferc order in the court of appeals for the fifth circuit.the fifth circuit granted that petition for review,vacated the order,and remanded to the commission.sea robin i,at.
specifically,the fifth circuit questioned ferc reliance on the size of sea robin system as presumptively determinative,as well as the apparent abandonment,without reasoned consideration,of the sliding scale approach announced by the commission in amerada hess.see sea robin i,at.the fifth circuit concluded that ferc had reverted to its single factor,approaches that it had previously rejected as unworkable for offshore pipelines.id.citing northwest pipeline,at ep operating,at.the court also faulted the commission for the reliance it placed on considerations,such as sea robin ownership and shipper expectations.see at if the commission is to remain tethered to the statute,as it must,that inquiry must be based primarily on physical criteria and the realities of the field.the fifth circuit intend ed that criteria be put in its place as considerations secondary to the physical factors.id.at.finally,the fifth circuit found ferc regulatory gap argument,that a regulatory gap might arise if sea robin was held to be a gathering system,wanting need for regulation can not alone create authority to regulate.id.
in remanding to the commission,the fifth circuit acknowledged that sea robin system resists easy categorization because the logistics of offshore pipelines obscures differences between gathering gas from gulf platforms and transporting it to the mainland.sea robin i,at.it also observed that the pattern of gathering and distribution on shore differs from the pattern of transportation and gathering of gas from the middle of the gulf to the mainland,and suggested that ferc again consider the applicability of the primary function test to offshore pipeline systems and if necessary,reformulate this test.id.at.the court noted that on remand,sea robin may choose to respond to the commission invitation to offer portions of its system as predominantly involved in a gathering or a transportation function.id.at footnote omitted.in doing so,the court specifically admonished the commission that d iscomfort in drawing the jurisdictional line at points internal to an overall system may be soothed with the reminder that congress did not intend to extend ferc jurisdiction to all natural gas pipelines indeed it demands the drawing of jurisdictional lines,even when the end of gathering is not easily located.id.the court opined that the commission could consider,for example,a distinction between the field south of the vermilion compressor station and the pipelines leading north to erath,louisiana.id.
on remand,ferc accepted the fifth circuit invitation to reformulate its primary function test.sea robin pipeline,wl remand order.in reformulating its primary function test,the commission concluded that the factor is not necessarily determinative of where gathering ends when applied to offshore facilities.see id.at.further,ferc determined that it would assess the physical configuration of offshore pipeline systems to determine if there exists a central location where gas is aggregated for further transportation to shore.id.such a location would be the offshore analogue of the onshore criterion.id.in cases where a pipeline system is configured to deliver gas collected from upstream wells to a centralized location through several relatively small diameter lines for further delivery onshore through a single larger diameter pipeline,that centralized aggregation location is considered by ferc to be analogous to the factor and given weight in identifying the demarcation point between gathering and transportation on ocs pipeline systems.id.at.thus,the commission was willing to consider,as suggested by the fifth circuit,that the demarcation point between gathering and transmission on a system like sea robin could be determined to be at a point internal to an overall pipeline system.see sea robin pipeline,at rehearing order.
applying its reformulated primary function test,the commission concluded that sea robin pipeline facilities comprise two distinct components a jurisdictional transportation system from the vermilion station to erath,and a gathering system upstream of the vermilion station.see remand order,at.ferc found that the primary function of the line is to transport to shore natural gas that has been delivered from many areas through a configuration of relatively smaller diameter lines to a centralized point where gas is aggregated and compressed,namely the vermilion station.id.at.
in support of its decision to draw the jurisdictional line at the vermilion compressor station,the commission emphasized certain key aspects of the system overall physical configuration.specifically,ferc found that the geographical configuration of sea robin system downstream of the vermilion station,interconnecting with only two laterals delivering gas from only four wells along its length,and the line large diameter are indicative of transportation.see id.at.in contrast,the facilities upstream of the vermilion station interconnect with laterals connected to production platforms,and the lines are inches or less in diameter.see id.at.moreover,ferc found that the compression that occurs at vermilion is typical of compression found on large diameter transportation lines transporting high volumes of gas over relatively long distances,rather than field compression associated with production.id.at.according to ferc,the vermilion station thus represented a central aggregation location highly suggestive of the demarcation point between gathering and transportation.see id.at.the commission concluded that in the most fundamental meaning of the primary function test,the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the primary function of the line is to transport to shore natural gas that has been delivered from many areas through a configuration of relatively smaller diameter lines to a centralized point where the gas is aggregated and compressed,and these smaller lines upstream of vermilion are engaged in gathering.id.at.
on rehearing,the commission adhered to its position.see rehearing order,at.ferc reiterated that its reformulated primary function test included consideration of an additional analytical element applicable where ocs pipeline facilities exhibit a centralized aggregation point adjustment in the weight to be afforded the criterion on the ocs and a primary focus on physical factors.id.at.it addressed arguments from the petitioners that all of sea robin system was engaged in jurisdictional transportation,and arguments from sea robin that its system was engaged entirely in gathering specifically the rehearing order identifies physical factors considered in concluding that the facilities upstream of the vermilion station are engaged in gathering.see id.at.these physical factors are 
the mile length of the line 
the diameter of the line 
the configuration of the line 
the configuration of the sea robin system 
the existence of only four platforms along the length of the line as compared to the connections to production platforms upstream of the vermillion compressor station 
the abrupt change in physical attributes and configuration in the system occurring at the vermillion compressor station 
the concentration of compression at the vermillion compressor station 
the existence of a centralized aggregation location at the vermillion compressor station 
the to inch diameters of the lines upstream of the vermillion compressor station 
the existence of laterals feeding into the two upstream arms of the upstream of the vermillion compressor station 
the presence of production platforms connected to the system upstream of the vermillion compressor station 
the network configuration of sea robin facilities upstream of the vermillion compressor station and 
the onshore location of processing plants,which was not considered a determinative factor due to the geographic and technical characteristic of production and transportation offshore.
id.further,ferc rejected the argument that it had substituted the new centralized aggregation point criteria for its prior impermissible reliance on a test.rather,it explained,the is more appropriately viewed as a descriptive label for a set of a number of individual physical characteristics.id.just as the historical and factors are based on the existence of a confluence of individual elements,the new factor also is an example of an additional physical factor that can arise as the result of the combination of several individual physical components id.at.relying on the fifth circuit sea robin i decision,the commission rejected the suggestion that various production platforms,rather than the vermilion station,are centralized aggregation points.see id.
similarly,the commission relied on the fifth circuit decision to reject the suggestion that the reformulated primary function test would create an unlawful regulatory gap on the outer continental shelf.see id.at citing sea robin i,at.moreover,ferc claimed to have addressed such regulatory gap concerns in its separate decision to promulgate regulations under the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,et,to ensure that natural gas is transported in an open and nondiscriminatory manner.rehearing order,at citing.
ferc also addressed arguments that it had given inadequate attention to the impact of the jurisdictional determination on the settled expectations of customers and on new upstream deepwater systems.the commission found that the remanding court directions on this point were clear.the court ruled that while the practical effect of the determination of gathering is relevant,the primary consideration in formulating a jurisdictional test must be the physical characteristics that distinguish gathering from transmission.id.at citing sea robin i,at.thus,although ferc considered these factors,the primary focus,as required by the fifth circuit,had to be the physical factors,and those factors supported drawing the jurisdictional line at the vermilion station.see id.at.
finally,ferc considered and rejected arguments that a amendment to ocsla purportedly equated the scope of the gathering exemption in the natural gas act with the concept of feeder lines,see certificates issued to sea robin for the reclassified facilities must be subject to abandonment proceedings pursuant to section b of the natural gas act,b,see id.at and the fact that a jurisdictional upstream pipeline the garden banks pipeline delivers gas into the east leg of sea robin system upstream of the vermilion station prevents the commission from reclassifying the sea robin system as.see id.at.on this last issue,petitioners contended that ferc had violated its prior ruling in tarpon transmission,wl,which they read as precluding pipeline facilities that carry gas delivered by a jurisdictional transportation pipeline from being classified as gathering facilities.ferc noted that this issue was raised for the first time on rehearing however,the commission went on to hold that the petitioners reliance on tarpon was misplaced.see rehearing order,at.although the presence of upstream transportation facilities was one factor considered in tarpon,the real concern in that proceeding was that finding tarpon facilities to be engaged in gathering would have left shippers and producers unprotected from the exercise of monopoly power.see id.ferc concluded that such concerns were no longer relevant for facilities exempt from the natural gas act because of the commission new ocsla regulations.id.at.
exxonmobil and the producer coalition filed timely petitions for review challenging the remand order and the rehearing order in this court.
ii.analysis 
the challenged orders are subject to reversal if the ferc action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.in making this determination,t he court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment the court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d see motor vehicle manufacturers ass state farm mutual automobile insurance,d.to the extent that the petitioners are challenging ferc interpretation of section b of the natural gas act,b,we apply the approach of chevron natural resources defense council,d.when congress has spoken,we are bound by that pronouncement and that ends this court inquiry.chevron,at.at chevron step one.where the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.at footnote omitted chevron step two.
in reviewing the commission determinations,we are mindful that t he line between jurisdictional transportation and gathering is not always clear.conoco,at.the jurisdictional determination under section b of the act is a problem for which there is no easy answer.williams field,at.thus,it is not this court role to interpose its judgment.id.rather,we are mindful that in evaluating and balancing the several factors under the primary function test,the commission brings to bear its considerable expertise about the natural gas industry.conoco,at see also lomak,at williams field,at.accordingly,we will uphold the commission application of the test as long as it gives reasoned consideration to each of the pertinent factors and articulates factual conclusions that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.lomak,at quoting conoco,at see b the finding of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.the burden is on the petitioners to show that the commission choices are unreasonable and its chosen line of demarcation is not within a zone of reasonableness as distinct from the question of whether the line drawn by the commission is precisely right.hercules epa,quoting federal power comm conway,d.we can not say that the commission acted unreasonably either in interpreting the natural gas act or declining to exercise jurisdiction over portions of sea robin system.therefore petitioners have failed to carry their burden,and the petitions must be denied.
exxonmobil challenges ferc determination that the vermilion station is a reasonable point at which the commission may draw the line between gathering and jurisdictional transportation.it contends that the added compression at vermilion only serves to push and pull gas along an integrated transportation system.petitioner proposes that the individual production platforms mark the point at which gathering ends and transportation begins.however,petitioner differing interpretation of the physical factors present on the sea robin system does not provide us with a basis to upset the commission order.reasonable people may disagree as to where gathering ends and transportation begins.were we the federal energy regulatory commission,we might draw the line at erath.others might draw it at the production platforms themselves.but see ep operating,at.but after considering the inherent ambiguity in the statute and the fact that t he line between jurisdictional transportation and gathering is not always clear,conoco,at,as it is not clear here we simply can not conclude that the commission choice of the vermilion station as the dividing line was unreasonable,especially in light of the fifth circuit decision on remand.see sea robin i,at.we therefore hold that the commission choice,if not unassailable,is at least defensible,and survives the review of the administrative procedure act.
ferc relied on the smaller dimensions of the upstream lines in contrast to the line the laterals feeding into the two upstream arms the production platforms connected to the upstream facilities compared with only four downstream the network configuration of the upstream facilities and the need for added compression at the vermilion station to move gas to shore.see rehearing order,at.all of these physical factors show a meaningful distinction between the facilities upstream and downstream of vermilion and make it reasonable to define it as the central aggregation point.obedient to the fifth circuit suggestion,ferc examined sea robin system in parts,rather than as a whole,and reasonably concluded that different parts of the system required different jurisdictional treatment.moreover,as described by the commission,the central aggregation test is not a new,test,but rather is an amalgamation of physical factors,and in any event,is wholly consistent with past ferc precedent.it has long been the commission view,upheld by this court,among others,that when gas from separate wells is collected by several lines which converge at a single location in the producing field for delivery into a single line for transportation,the separate lateral lines behind the central point are classified as gathering facilities.accord barnes transp.that aptly describes the sea robin system.at vermilion gas from several lateral lines is brought together and propelled to shore.the dissent is critical of ferc determination because in its view,s urely a fork in the road can not be the demarcation line between unregulated and regulated transportation.dis.op.at.but why not can not two roads diverging or in this case,converging make all the difference indeed,has that not always been the thrust of the commission test in this case,the forks of the y gathered gas from production platforms at receipt points,whereas the straight segment received gas at only four such points the forks were pipes of smaller diameter than that of the straight segment and the forks required less compression to move the gas along.moreover,the line between gathering and transportation is inherently elusive,see,conoco,at,and ferc has wide discretion to determine where to draw administrative lines.fcc.it is for the commission,in the first instance,to determine the patterns of gathering and transportation in the offshore context.we are generally unwilling to review performed by the commission unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines drawn are patently unreasonable,having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.cassell fcc,quoting home box office,fcc.we conclude that petitioner has failed to carry its burden.
exxonmobil makes much of the supreme court language in northern natural gas state.comm of kansas,d,in which the court held that production and gathering are terms narrowly confined to the physical acts of drawing the gas from the earth and preparing it for the first stages of distribution.thus,petitioner essentially contends that given the length and size of the upstream portion of sea robin system,it can not possibly be involved in gathering,as described by the supreme court.however,the fifth circuit expressly rejected ferc per se reliance on length of a pipeline,holding that a pipeline was.ep operating,at.this same decision weighs against ferc treating the production platforms as central aggregation points as well.see id.rather,the fifth circuit required the commission to recognize that the pattern of gathering and distribution on shore differs from the pattern of transportation and gathering of gas from the middle of the gulf to the mainland.sea robin i,at see also amerada hess,at adopting the modified primary function test in response to ep operating,and in recognition of the changing technical and geographic nature of exploration and production.given these different physical realities,what might not seem narrowly confined in the context,may well be on the outer continental shelf.west gibson,d words in statutes can enlarge or contract their scope as other changes,in the law or in the world,require their application.oncale sundowner offshore,d statutory provisions often go beyond the principal evil congress was concerned with.given this backdrop,we can not conclude that ferc determination is unreasonable here.
moreover,we have previously recognized the limited reach of the supreme court holding in northern natural.in each case in which the supreme court has applied this narrow definition of production and gathering to uphold the commission jurisdiction,the regulated entity was engaged in a jurisdictional activity.conoco,at.thus,when a natural gas company provided bundled sales and interstate transportation from its own wells to consumers and distributors,the commission could properly include the company production and gathering costs in its rate base for the bundled service.id.we found that it was in the context of bundled jurisdictional and activities that the court defined gathering narrowly,as limited to activities preceding sales for resale.id.at citing phillips petroleum,at.at.but we now live in an unbundled world.see id.at observing that in order,ferc mandat ed the unbundling of gas sales and interstate transportation in order to give pipeline customers unimpeded access to the competitive wellhead market and to permit all gas sellers to compete on an equal basis.sea robin is no longer involved in the sales of gas from the is now strictly a transportation system.remand order,at.therefore the supreme court restrictive definition of gathering,while clearly relevant,must be considered in context.in the context of unbundled,pipeline systems,the physical acts of drawing the gas from the earth and preparing it for the first stages of distribution,northern natural gas,at.at,can not be as narrowly construed as.accord sea robin i,at ep operating,at amerada hess,at.
exxonmobil faults the commission for failing to give weight to the previously settled status of the classification of sea robin pipeline as engaged in jurisdictional transportation.however,as alluded to above,these petitions,like those in conoco,arise in the wake of major regulatory changes in the natural gas industry.conoco,at.whereas sea robin was once involved in sales and transportation,now it is strictly a pipeline.when interstate gas pipelines served the role of purchasing,gathering,transporting,and natural gas,bundled sales,the jurisdictional question may have been of less consequence.see,el paso natural gas,at,wl under a bundled sales regulatory environment,the function distinction was not as important as it is in a environment requiring unbundling consequently,many facilities that actually perform a gathering function originally were construed under natural gas act section certificates.cng transmission,at,wl.thus,the historical classification of sea robin system is of limited utility.moreover,the fifth circuit expressly instructed ferc in this case to relegate factors,such as the settled status of a pipeline,and the expectations of shippers to secondary status if the commission is to remain tethered to the statute,as it must,that inquiry must be based primarily on physical criteria and the realities of the field.sea robin i,at.the fifth circuit held that general business activity and prior certification are relevant,but they are only part of the mix.id.we agree.therefore,as ferc adequately considered factors,but properly relied primarily on physical factors,again,we can not find its decision to decline jurisdiction over a portion of sea robin system unreasonable.
similarly,we find exxonmobil argument that ferc jurisdictional ruling has created an utterly illogical situation,wherein gas is transported on a jurisdictional pipeline the garden banks pipeline into a gathering leg of sea robin pipeline,unavailing.petitioners rely on tarpon transmission,wl,and trunkline gas,wl,for the proposition that the presence of an interconnection with an upstream jurisdictional facility compels a finding that the downstream facility is likewise jurisdictional.first,reliance on these orders for such a proposition is inherently suspect as in both instances the classification of the upstream system was in dispute,and in both cases the upstream system was reclassified as.if anything,this suggests that it is the garden banks pipeline,rather than sea robin,that has been erroneously classified.to hold that the garden banks pipeline jurisdictional status compelled ferc to classify sea robin system as jurisdictional would create a classic example of circular reasoning.when garden banks requested a gathering classification,ferc ruled that it was jurisdictional because it was located proximate to jurisdictional lines.shell gas pipeline,at,wl emphasis added.thus,proximity to sea robin,among other pipelines,resulted in garden banks jurisdictional classification.to now hold that garden banks interconnection with sea robin requires the latter to also be jurisdictional,is for the tail to wag the dog.perhaps the present inconsistent treatment of the garden banks pipeline and the sea robin pipeline is positively absurd,as suggested by the dissent,dis.op.at,but that does not mean that the problem is necessarily with sea robin classification.ferc has been struggling with the reclassification of facilities in the wake of the unbundling of gas sales and interstate transportation in order.see conoco,at.as it is entirely appropriate for ferc to proceed on a basis,see sec chenery,then the reform may take one step at a time.williamson lee optical of oklahoma.we do not mean to how ferc might apply its reformulated primary function test to garden banks.we only conclude that the status of the garden banks pipeline does not render the commission reclassification of portions of sea robin system unreasonable.
we turn now to exxonmobil least persuasive ferc determination that portions of sea robin system are engaged in gathering results in a regulatory gap.we find this argument no more persuasive than did the fifth circuit.we emphatically agree that n eed for regulation can not alone create authority to regulate.sea robin i,at.rather it is statutory authorization alone that gives ferc the authority to regulate,and in the absence of such authority,ferc action is plainly contrary to law and can not stand.atlantic city ferc,quoting michigan epa.here congress clearly contemplates that the commission will not have jurisdiction under the natural gas act over the production or gathering of natural gas.b.the language could not be any plainer.we have repeatedly admonished federal agencies that jurisdiction may not be presumed based solely on the fact that there is not an express withholding of jurisdiction,atlantic city,at michigan,at american petroleum inst.epa,ethyl epa.where congress has gone so far as to expressly delineate the limits of agency jurisdiction,we can not fault the commission for taking a conservative view of its own authority.
finally,we can quickly dispense with exxonmobil argument that sea robin system was subject to abandonment proceedings under section b of the act,b.simply put,sea robin does not seek to abandon any facilities or services.rather,it merely seeks to be able to continue operating previously certificated facilities as gathering facilities,exempt from ferc jurisdiction under the natural gas act.this is not abandonment within the meaning of section b.conoco,at.in addition,section b only applies to jurisdictional facilities,and do es not expand the commission b jurisdiction.id.therefore it can not be used to bootstrap ferc jurisdiction here.
the producer coalition argues that the scope of the gathering exemption under section b of the natural gas act is defined by the concept of feeder lines in the outer continental shelf lands act,et.under ocsla,the commission is responsible for ensuring open and nondiscriminatory access to transportation of oil and gas for all shippers on the outer continental shelf.f a.ferc,however,may exempt from ocsla requirements any pipeline or class of pipelines which feeds into a facility where oil and gas are first collected or a facility where oil and gas are first separated,dehydrated,or otherwise processed.f.the producer coalition contends that the scope of exemption for feeder lines is coterminous with gathering facilities under the natural gas act.thus,in essence the producer coalition contends that ferc reformulated primary function test is unnecessary and that the commission has stumbled under chevron step one.
in support of its position,the producer coalition relies on bits and pieces of legislative history surrounding the amendments to ocsla.but snippets of legislative history do not a law make.accord aldridge williams,how.in re sealed case,the limits on the commission that authority derived from statutory provisions,not from loosely worded fragments extracted from congressional reports and speeches.petitioners offer no direct evidence of congressional intent to fill in the natural gas act definition of gathering sub silentio by reference to the feeder line concept.indeed,there is no definition of gathering in the ocsla,and it does not even use the term.rather the producer coalition relies on isolated excerpts from the floor discussion by congressman sieberling.while congressman sieberling may have spoken,congress has not.
morever,it would be anomalous to treat the feeder line provision of ocsla and the gathering exemption of the natural gas act as redundant.under the producer coalition interpretation,in enacting the ocsla amendments,congress would have replicated the provisions already contained in the natural gas act.compare f a a ocsla,with b,a natural gas act.likewise,there would have been no need to authorize the commission to exempt feeder lines from ferc jurisdiction if they were already exempt as gathering facilities.rather,a more plausible inference is that congress amended ocsla to make ocs facilities not covered by the natural gas act subject to similar nondiscriminatory requirements,with the exception of feeder lines.however,we do not decide whether it would be reasonable for ferc to equate the feeder line and gathering facilities exemptions.we simply hold that ferc interpretation of section b of the natural gas act is not unreasonable,and therefore chevron deference is applicable.
iii.conclusion 
ferc jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines demands the drawing of jurisdictional lines,even when the end of gathering is not easily located.sea robin i,at.although we might draw a different line,we can not say that the commission acted unreasonably in concluding that the vermilion station is the place where nonjurisdictional gathering ends and jurisdictional transportation begins.it is not our role to substitute our own judgment for that of the agency.given the instructions of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit on remand,we can not say that ferc has failed to give appropriate consideration to the primary physical factors and the secondary factors of its reformulated primary function test.therefore the petitions for review are denied.
so ordered.
the issue in this case focuses on the line between the transportation of natural gas and the gathering of natural gas.for many years,most of the sea robin pipeline company complex in the gulf of mexico has been designated as a transportation facility,and,thus,within the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission under the natural gas act nga.now,however,the commission has partially reversed that settled status,reclassifying a major segment of the sea robin pipeline as engaged in nonjurisdictional gathering.in my view,ferc decision is devoid of reasoned decision making.i therefore dissent from the court decision denying the petition for review.
sea robin operates a massive pipeline complex miles overall,almost all of which is located offshore on top of the outer continental shelf ocs in the gulf of mexico.this system is shaped like an inverted y,whose two arms sweep across the ocs to meet at a point approximately miles off the coast of louisiana.the vermillion compressor station sits at this point of convergence.there,much of the gas flowing from various production platforms that feed into the system comes together for shipment miles north to sea robin onshore processing plants near erath,louisiana.during the journey to erath,the aggregated gas is joined by additional gas from four platforms located closer to the shore.once the gas reaches shore,it is separated,dehydrated,and processed,then transported to the erath compressor station from whence it is pumped into interstate pipelines for downstream delivery.see appendix.
before the challenged reclassification of the sea robin system,once the gas was produced and gathered at the production platforms south upstream of vermillion,it was deemed to be in transportation,and thus within ferc jurisdiction.in,sea robin sought to undo this regulatory situation.the company asked ferc for an order declaring that its pipelines were gathering facilities exempt from the commission jurisdiction under the b of the nga.ferc refused,holding that the primary function of sea robin system was transportation.sea robin pipeline,cch,wl.rehearing was sought,but denied,sea robin pipeline,wl,leading sea robin to petition for review in the fifth circuit.the court granted the petition,remanding the case to ferc for further consideration.sea robin pipeline ferc,cir sea robin i.
sea robin i held that the commission decision to deny reclassification was arbitrary and capricious because the agency did not fairly apply the primary function test that it had adopted as the touchstone for its analysis.in farmland industries,wl,and subsequent decisions,ferc had identified six factors that were to guide the functional inquiry into whether a pipeline is a gatherer or a transporter 
the diameter and length of the facility 
the location of compressors and processing plants 
the extension of facility beyond the central point in the field 
the location of wells along the facility 
the geographical configuration of the field 
the operating pressure of the line 
see ep operating ferc,cir.
this test was developed for,and most readily applies to,pipeline facilities.in order to account for the differences between onshore and offshore facilities,ferc subsequently attempted to refine the above analysis.see amerada hess,wl.because technological advances had allowed drilling and gas production to take place further and further from land,gathering pipelines of increasing length and diameter were being used in places such as the ocs.this reality suggested to ferc that it adopt a sliding scale approach to the physical factors identified in farmland the deeper and further from shore a pipeline,the longer and wider it could be and still be deemed a gatherer.moreover,in order to ensure that such pipes were properly classified,the agency announced that it would consider certain factors when applying the primary function analysis.these include the purpose,location,and operation of the facility the general business activity of the facility and the overall objectives of the nga and natural gas policy act.id.at.
sea robin i held that the commission erred in selectively applying the farmland factors,on the nonphysical factors described in amerada hess,and failing to apply the sliding scale.first,the court held that the commission impermissibly reduced the primary function analysis to a litmus test that turned on the length and diameter of the overall system.at.that is,ferc classified sea robin system as one engaged in transportation simply because of the size of its pipes alone,deeming the other farmland factors inapplicable.in so doing,the commission abandoned,without reasoned consideration,its earlier recognition that the exigencies of moving offshore gas to land may require larger pipelines that should not necessarily be classified as transporters.id.
second,sea robin i criticized the agency for treating the factors as the equals of the physical factors in making the distinction.the fifth circuit reminded ferc that this distinction,as understood by congress,was primarily a tangible,operational one.as such,while criteria may be considered,they must remain a secondary part of the mix,not the starting point for the rest of the analysis.see id.at.because ferc seemed to have misunderstood these points,the court remanded the case,suggesting that the commission 
may reformulate its primary function test.it may choose to discontinue criteria not relevant to the physical,geographical,and operational characteristics of pipelines in the ocs.the record suggests other criteria,such as the quality of the gas in the pipelines and the depth of the water in the offshore production area,that may be relevant to the inquiry.
the court recognized that the agency might be able to justify drawing the jurisdictional line between gathering and transportation at a point internal to the sea robin system,but this suggestion was offered merely in passing dicta.nothing in the fifth circuit opinion in sea robin i in any way compelled ferc to draw the jurisdictional line at a point internal to sea robin overall system.nor did anything in the court opinion compel the commission to select the vermillion compressor station as the dividing point between gathering and jurisdictional transportation.ferc,however,apparently threw up its hands in dismay upon reviewing sea robin i obviously having no clue what to do to adh
