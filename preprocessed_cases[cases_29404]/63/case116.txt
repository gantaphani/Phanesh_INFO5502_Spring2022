although the parties submitted over pages of briefing,the issue on appeal is the same straightforward question of contract interpretation previously before the district court does the farmout require w t to bear a proportionate share of the costs of decommissioning an oil platform located on the federal offshore oil and gas lease designated main pass block block.because we agree with the district court that the unambiguous language of the agreement does not create any such obligation,we affirm.
w t predecessor in interest,the atlantic richfield company arco,and apache predecessor in interest,the texoma production company texoma,executed the farmout agreement on october.texoma then had thirty days to commence drilling a test well,which if successful,earned texoma an assignment of arco interest in the main pass block block lease subject to an overriding royalty interest.arco relatively small overriding royalty interest was free of any obligation to contribute to the costs of production.
the farmout agreement,however,included two election points for arco to convert its percent overriding royalty interest into a percent working interest.generally speaking,the first election point allowed arco to convert its royalty interest in the first well while the second election point allowed arco to convert its royalty interest in any subsequent wells.the first election point would occur after texoma recovered the proportionate costs of drilling,testing,completing,equipping,and operating the well,including that portion of the platform costs which shall be allocated to such well on the basis of the number of slots on the platform.the second election point would occur only if texoma proposed to drill a second well prior to recovering its production costs in the first well.if texoma proposed a second well,arco would have thirty days to convert its overriding royalty interest in the second well into a working interest and participate in the drilling of the second well.upon conversion under the second election point,arco would be responsible for the proportionate share of the platform costs allocated to the total number of wells to be drilled for production from said lease under the plan of exploration and development.arco exercised both options to convert its royalty interest to a working interest,and pursuant to the farmout agreement,the parties entered into a joint operating agreement joa governing the operations of the block lease.
no drilling platform was ever constructed on block.apache,however,operated the block platform,which served both the block lease and the adjacent block lease until hurricane ivan damaged the platform in,thereby ending its service life.because federal regulations require leaseholders to remove and decommission oil and gas platforms at the end of their service life,apache,as the platform operator,began the process of decommissioning the block platform.apache sought reimbursement for such costs from w t,contending that the farmout agreement requires w t,which owns a percent working interest in block,to pay a proportionate share of the decommissioning expenses.w t refused to pay.
accordingly,on november,apache filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana seeking a declaratory judgment that w t must bear its proportionate share of the total costs of decommissioning and abandoning the block platform,alleging that w t refusal to bear its proportionate share of the decommissioning costs constitutes a breach of the farmout agreement,and alleging,in the alternative,that w t has enjoyed the use of the block platform to its enrichment without cause at the expense of apache.w t counterclaimed,seeking indemnity under the farmout agreement.prior to completing discovery,apache sought summary judgment holding w t liable for its proportionate share of block platform costs,including decommissioning costs,and dismissal of w t counterclaim with prejudice.w t subsequently filed a for summary judgment seeking dismissal of apache complaint,indemnification,and attorneys fees.the district court concluded that 
the farmout agreement could have required arco to agree to pay a share of the decommissioning costs of the platform located on block but it did not.nowhere in either the farmout agreement or the subsequent joa is an obligation expressed to pay for the decommissioning of that platform.apache can not meet its burden of proving such an obligation exists because the unambiguous language of the agreements does not create one.
moreover,with respect to w t indemnity claim,the district court found that t here is nothing in the text to suggest that arco was attempting to shift the costs of a subsequent litigation between the parties to the agreement.accordingly,the district court denied apache summary judgment,granted w t summary judgment in part,and dismissed apache complaint and w t for indemnification and attorneys fees with prejudice.

a a.because both blocks and are adjacent to louisiana,the law of louisiana controls this court interpretation of the farmout agreement.
under louisiana law,interpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.ann.in ascertaining the common intent,words and phrases in a contract are to be construed using their plain,ordinary and generally prevailing meaning,unless the words have acquired a technical meaning,in which case the words must be ascribed their technical meaning.sims mulhearn funeral home,so d,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,w ords susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the object of the contract.ann,and e ach provision in a contract must be interpreted in light of the other provisions so that each is given the meaning suggested by the contract as a whole.ann.in addition,w hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences,no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties intent.ann.thus,u nder louisiana law,the interpretation of an unambiguous contract is an issue of law for the court.amoco prod.meridian res.exploration,cir citing.transmission amerada hess,cir.accordingly,this case turns primarily on whether the farmout agreement unambiguously requires w t to pay for its proportionate share of the costs of decommissioning the block platform.
both parties claim that the farmout agrement is unambiguous but reach opposite conclusions as to whether w t is obligated to pay its proportionate share of the block platform decommissioning costs.this discrepancy does not,by itself,indicate that the contract is ambiguous.see amoco prod,at holding that a contract provision is not ambiguous where only one of two competing interpretations is reasonable or merely because one party can create a dispute in hindsight citation omitted.in the context of contract interpretation,only when there is a choice of reasonable interpretations of the contract is there a material fact issue concerning the parties intent that would preclude summary judgment.id.at.
here,the farmout agreement is silent about decommissioning costs.nevertheless,apache contends that the term platform costs encompasses the costs of decommissioning the block platform.platform costs is used twice in section vii,which governs arco w t predecessor two election points for converting its overriding royalty interest into a working interest.the first use of the term is in the description of the first election point,which allows conversion of arco royalty interest in the first well 
the overriding royalty herein provided for shall be paid until such time as you have recovered out of the proceeds of production from the producing well after deducting the royalty,overriding royalty and taxes paid by you on production,as applicable to arco contributed interest,the proportionate costs of drilling,testing,completing,equipping and operating the well,including that portion of the platform costs which shall be allocated to such well on the basis of the number of slots on the platform.the operating costs to be recovered shall be determined in accordance with the accounting procedure attached hereto as exhibit a.at such time as you have recovered the costs therein provided for,arco shall have days,from the receipt of such notice of your recovery of said cost,within which to elect to convert its overriding royalty interest to a proportionate percent working interest in the initial well,equipment in and on same,production from such well,and that portion of said lands included in any units.
two paragraphs later,platform costs is used again in the description of the second election point,which allows conversion of arco royalty interest in the second and subsequent wells 
if prior to the payout of the first producing well,as hereinabove provided,you propose to drill the first development well provided for under the plan of exploration and development you shall so notify arco in writing should arco elect to participate in the drilling of such well it shall convert its overriding royalty to a percent working interest in said lease and shall join in the hereinbefore described joint operating agreement and shall be responsible for its proportionate share of platform costs allocated to the total number of wells to be drilled for production from said lease under the plan of exploration and development.however,arco election to participate as is set forth,shall not be deemed an election to convert its overriding royalty in the first producing well,which election,if so made,shall be as hereinbefore provided,at the time of payout of such first producing well.
both election points can only occur upon the completion of certain preconditions.for example,the second election point can occur only if texoma elects to drill a second well,the first development well.if texoma,for instance,had elected not to drill any development wells,this election point would never occur.similarly,the first election point can occur only when arco has recouped certain expenses,including platform costs,related to the initial producing well.given this precondition,the term platform costs must refer to the costs of constructing the well platform and not to future decommissioning expenses that the operator may incur at some unknown time in the future.
stated differently,if the term platform costs included the future expenses of decommissioning the block platform,w t election point to convert its royalty interest in the first well would not occur until after apache had decommissioned the well.that is,under apache construction,decommission costs would not be recoverable until after the platform had been decommissioned,and once the platform had been decommissioned,it would be impossible to recover such expenses out of the proceeds of a well that is no longer operational.this construction is nonsensical.it would be pointless for arco to convert its overriding royalty interest into a working interest following the decommissioning of the block platform.where there is no production,there are no royalties,regardless of the percentage.
granted,it would be possible for this election point never to occur.for example,if the first production well failed to produce in sufficient quantities,this election point would never occur because texoma would be unable to recoup its costs associated with this well.we will not,however,interpret a contract to render one of its provisions altogether meaningless.here,the object of the elections is to provide arco with two opportunities to convert its overriding royalty interest into a working interest,and words must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the object of the contract.ann.therefore,we find that the term platform costs,as used with reference to the first election point,refers only to the costs of constructing the platform 
under louisiana law,we interpret the second usage of the term platform costs in light of the preceding use.see.ann.here,the two usages occur in the same section of the contract section vii,in the same context election points,and mere paragraphs apart.moreover,there are no modifiers attached to the second usage of platform costs to indicate a different meaning.accordingly,we agree with the district court that i n both instances,the term platform costs is in reference to the costs of constructing a well,and that n either instance purports to control the management of expenses into the future.
furthermore,in that same section,the farmout agreement requires the parties to enter into a joint operating agreement joa providing provisions as may be necessary for the operation of the affected properties upon the exercise of either election.this is further evidence that the term platform costs includes only fixed,startup costs of constructing a well,not speculative operational expenses,which are outside the scope of costs contemplated by the provisions simply put,apache construction of the term platform costs that it includes all costs attributable to the platform from cradle to grave,construction to dismantlement is unsupported by the farmout agreement.
similarly,the joa is silent as to the block platform,and neither party contends otherwise.the block joa specifically defines the extent of the parties obligations for regulatory decommissioning and platform removal,including hypothetical future platforms on block,but does not even mention the block platform.accordingly,the joa does not require w t to pay to decommission the block platform.therefore,we find that neither the farmout agreement nor the joa requires w t to pay to decommission the block platform.
moreover,to the extent apache argues that w t owns an interest in the block platform such that the law requires payment for decommissioning costs,this argument fails as contrary to louisiana law.apache avers that w t acquired an interest in block from its predecessor,vastar,because the assignment from vastar to w t specifically included all of vastar working interest in the block platform.this phrase,however,does not necessarily mean that vastar actually owned rights in the block platform.rather,it means that vastar assigned whatever rights it happened to have in the block platform out of an abundance of caution.a party can not assign what it does not own.see town of homer united healthcare of,so d.cir an assignor can not assign any rights greater than that which he held.citations omitted.
in addition,the block platform,which was a drilling platform permanently affixed to the seabed,was an immovable under louisiana law,bruyninckx bratten,so d.cir,and ownership of an immovable can be conveyed only by a written act translative of title.see oak harbor prop.owners ass millennium grp.i,so d.cir.here,neither the
