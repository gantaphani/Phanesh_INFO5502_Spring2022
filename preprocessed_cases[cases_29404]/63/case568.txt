background 
in the state of tamaulipas recognized the claims of padre nicolas balli and his nephew,juan jose balli,to what is now known as padre island.when padre nicolas died,his interest passed by devise to his seven nieces and nephews,including juan jose.in,padre nicolas heirs partitioned the island,leaving juan jose with the northern of the island and the other heirs with the southern.on the same day,juan jose conveyed his interest to santiago morales.several months later,morales and juan jose signed a rescission agreement after morales became concerned about the clarity of juan jose title.despite the rescission agreement,however,morales later mortgaged part of the property and conveyed the remaining portion of the property to jose maria tovar.the rescission agreement,in large part,formed the basis for the ballis claims in this suit to an existing interest in padre island.in the,the other padre nicolas heirs conveyed their interests in the southern half of the island to nicolas grisanti.
the court of appeals opinion sets out in some detail the history of the ballis claims and the various suits over title to padre island.see.for purposes of our discussion,however,suffice it to say that by the early the ballis interests in the island under juan jose balli title had largely disappeared,either through conveyances or adverse judgments,and a federal court had resolved various title disputes by awarding possession of the island to a number of parties.see grisanti am.trust of.
in,lizzie havre filed a trespass to try title suit against three of the defendants who had been awarded possession in grisanti pat dunn,sam robertson,and callahan.dunn and the other defendants for title to and possession of all of padre island,except for the southernmost acres.the balli heirs were cited by publication,but did not appear.the district court ultimately granted title and possession of padre island,but for the southernmost acres,to sam robertson and callahan.two of the timely filed a bill of review,which remained pending until the late.
in,gilbert kerlin uncle,frederick gilbert,was contacted by several people who had discovered evidence of an agreement to rescind the sale between morales and juan jose balli.frederick gilbert formed a partnership with them to pursue a claim to juan jose interests in the island based upon the rescission agreement existence.gilbert put his nephew,a new york attorney,in charge of the venture,and kerlin traveled to brownsville to locate juan jose heirs and purchase their interests.kerlin contacted primitivo balli,the patriarch of the family,who agreed to assist him in securing all of juan jose interests from the various heirs.kerlin told the heirs that he was obtaining the deeds to clear title to padre island,and that each deed would reserve a of royalty in the grantor.the heirs allege kerlin also assured them they would receive some compensation if he received anything through the deeds.kerlin,as trustee,obtained eleven general warranty deeds from the heirs,each containing a reserved royalty interest.
at some point,kerlin and gilbert decided to pursue other claims to padre island independent of their agreement with the persons who had uncovered the morales rescission agreement,and they obtained a number of other titles that had been cut off by the havre dunn judgment.kerlin sought to vindicate all of those claims by obtaining a new trial and pursuing a in havre dunn.his attorney,seabury,filed the motion in the name of kerlin,the heirs of juan jose,and two other havre dunn defendants.the ballis were not informed of the pending,and seabury never communicated with them about it.
on february,kerlin,gilbert,and seabury met with the opposing parties to discuss settlement.during the meeting,seabury argued that the deeds from the balli grantors were valid and proposed that his group should receive forty percent of padre island.the case did not settle at that time,but in,seabury submitted a written settlement proposal under which the kerlin interests would receive acres.the proposal suggested that acres comprised acreage that was never divested out of juan jose balli on any theory of the case.the parties ultimately reached a settlement,and a hearing on the motion for new trial was set for november.kerlin,who was serving in the army at the time,obtained a pass to attend the hearing.at the hearing,a stipulation was filed under which kerlin was to receive the mineral interests in acres of padre island located in nueces county and fee simple title to acres of land in the southern division of the island.during the three days he was in texas,kerlin,individually and in his capacity as trustee,executed reconveyance deeds to the ballis.the ballis were never informed of the deeds,nor were the deeds ever recorded or delivered.kerlin also visited one of the ballis,but he did not mention the havre dunn settlement.
under the settlement stipulation,the parties were required to execute deeds to each party respective acreage.one of the parties to the settlement wrote to another that seabury had agreed not to give the ballis any recordable instrument that could cast a cloud on the parties title,and gilbert advised seabury that the ballis interest would die in kerlin.after the settlement stipulation was executed,seabury filed a motion to dismiss the ballis in havre dunn.
some thirteen years later,in,primitivo balli wrote two letters to kerlin requesting documents showing his interest in padre island.kerlin responded that he had received no title under the ballis deeds.he did not tell primitivo balli about the reconveyance deeds,or that havre dunn had been settled.the next year,kerlin wrote primitivo that he had been unable to establish that juan jose had not sold all of his interest in the island,and that his heirs consequently had no basis to claim any interest.another eight years passed and,in,kerlin sold the surface tract for more than million.he also conveyed all of his mineral interests in the island to pi,his wholly owned company.another of kerlin wholly owned companies,petitioner windward oil gas,acquired one of kerlin partner mineral interests in the island.
in,some years after primitivo balli inquiry and years after kerlin sold his interest,connie sauceda,a descendant of one of the balli grantors,contacted kerlin to inquire about the mineral interests reserved in the balli deeds.kerlin told her that the deeds were invalid,and that she would have the burden of proof in an expensive,lawsuit to prove otherwise.
eight years later,in february,some of the present balli parties sued kerlin,windward,and pi ultimately,more than other balli heirs joined in the action.the ballis alleged claims for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and conspiracy to commit fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.they sought damages,declaratory relief,the imposition of a constructive trust,and attorneys fees.kerlin raised several affirmative defenses,including that the ballis claims were time barred by the statute of limitations and laches.after a trial,the jury found that kerlin was estopped from contesting the validity of the deeds executed by the balli heirs that the deeds reserved a of a royalty interest in the ballis favor that kerlin and pi breached fiduciary duties they owed the ballis with respect to their reserved royalty interests that kerlin conspired with seabury to commit fraud and breach the fiduciary duty seabury owed the ballis in settling havre dunn and that kerlin acquired acres of land in his own name for the ballis benefit which he failed to share with them.
regarding kerlin limitations defense and the ballis claim that his absence from the state tolled the statute running,the jury found that kerlin had not been present in the state for either a two or period between the date of the havre dunn settlement and the date this suit was filed.in addition,the jury found that kerlin fraudulently concealed the facts and circumstances of the settlement and fraudulently concealed that he was receiving royalty payments that belonged to the ballis.finally,the jury found that kerlin was not physically present in the state when wrongdoing occurred that formed the basis of the ballis claims.
because some courts have held that limitations is not subject to statutory tolling unless a nonresident committed all or part of a contractual breach or tort here,the ballis moved to set aside the latter finding,contending that kerlin presence in the state when wrongdoing occurred was established as a matter of law.see,howard fiesta.show park,antonio,pet.denied wyatt lowrance,dist,writ denied.the trial court granted the ballis motion.based on the other jury findings,the trial court rendered judgment in the ballis favor for unpaid royalties,mineral lease rentals,and prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.the trial court imposed a constructive trust on an undivided mineral interest,but denied the ballis request for an equitable accounting.the court of appeals affirmed except for the trial court ruling denying an accounting,which it reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings at.we granted kerlin petition for review to consider the issues presented.we begin with the threshold issues regarding limitations and fraudulent concealment,as their resolution is potentially dispositive of the parties remaining claims.
ii.limitations 
statutes of limitation operate to prevent the litigation of stale claims they afford plaintiffs what the legislature deems a reasonable time to present their claims and protect defendants and the courts from having to deal with cases in which the search for truth may be seriously impaired by the loss of evidence,whether by death or disappearance of witnesses,fading memories,disappearance of documents or otherwise.the purpose of a statute of limitations is to establish a point of repose.
quoting murray san jacinto agency.kerlin contends the ballis breach of contract,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty claims are barred by the statute of limitations,and that the statute bars their conspiracy claims.the ballis maintain that the jury fraudulent concealment findings and the tolling statute preclude the application of limitations in this instance.we first consider whether kerlin fraudulent concealment of the ballis entitlement to royalty payments and the details of the havre dunn settlement prevented limitations from running.
fraudulent concealment 
the jury found that kerlin fraudulently concealed the fact that he was receiving royalty proceeds belonging to the ballis,and that he fraudulently concealed the facts,details,and circumstances of the havre dunn settlement.kerlin contends the jury findings must be disregarded because,as a matter of law,the ballis could have timely discovered the existence of their claims through the exercise of reasonable diligence.we agree.
a defendant fraudulent concealment of wrongdoing may toll the running of limitations.shah moss.fraudulent concealment will not,however,bar limitations when the plaintiff discovers the wrong or could have discovered it through the exercise of reasonable diligence.velsicol chem.winograd,nichols smith.in heci exploration neel,oil and gas royalty owners sued their lessee for failing to advise them of the lessee successful suit against an adjoining operator for damages to the common field.in evaluating the discovery rule applicability to the royalty owners claims,we noted that royalty owners are not entitled to make no inquiry for years on end,and then sue for contractual breaches that could have been discovered within the limitations period through the exercise of reasonable diligence.id.at.because several sources of information are available to royalty owners about potential damage to their mineral resources,including their lessees,railroad commission records,and visible operations on adjoining property,we held that reasonable diligence would likely reveal any harm,and the discovery rule did not apply.id.at.like fraudulent concealment,the discovery rule does not apply to claims that could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence.while the discovery rule differs from fraudulent concealment in that its applicability is determined on a categorical basis,heci is nevertheless instructive in this case.
after the havre dunn settlement,kerlin advised the ballis that their claims were worthless.havre dunn dismissal and kerlin receipt of more than acres in fee simple and mineral acres were matters of public record more than forty years before the ballis filed this lawsuit.the ballis were on notice that the warranty deeds their predecessors executed contained a royalty reservation,yet they never received any royalties.as a matter of law,the ballis could have discovered the existence of any claims before limitations expired through the exercise of reasonable diligence.consequently,unless statutory tolling applies,their claims are time barred.
statutory tolling 
kerlin argues that the trial court erred in setting aside the jury findings that he was not present in the state when any portion of the tortious acts occurred.alternatively,he contends the tolling statute violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution,art.i,cl,to the extent that it applies to the claims against him,by forcing him either to consent to general jurisdiction in texas or forego the benefits of statutes of limitation the ballis respond that no evidence supported the jury answers to the questions the trial court disregarded,and that the constitutional authority kerlin cites is inapposite.because we conclude that the tolling statute does not apply in these circumstances,we need not resolve either of those issues.
section of the texas civil practice and remedies code provides that t he absence from this state of a person against whom a cause of action may be maintained suspends the running of the applicable statute of limitations for the period of the person absence.civ.prac.thus,unless kerlin was somehow present in the state for more than four years since the havre dunn settlement,limitations has not run on the ballis claims against him 
a little more than forty years ago,in vaughn deitz,we considered the interplay between the tolling statute substantively equivalent precursor,former article,and article,now codified at section of the civil practice and remedies code,which permits substituted service on a nonresident involved in an automobile accident in this state by serving the chairman of the state highway commission.the narrow issue we decided was whether article applies in a case where substituted service of process is available under the provisions of article.id.at.we held that it did.id.
article provided that 
t he acceptance by a person who was a resident of this state at the time of the accrual of a cause of action but who subsequently removes therefrom of the rights,privileges and benefits extended by law to such persons of operating a motor vehicle within the state of texas shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the chairman of the state highway commission of this state to be his true and lawful attorney and agent upon whom may be served all lawful process in any civil action or proceeding hereafter instituted against said nonresident growing out of any accident,or collision in which said nonresident may be involved while operating a motor vehicle within this state,and said acceptance or operation shall be a signification of the agreement of said nonresident that any such process against him served upon said chairman of the state highway commission shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served personally.
act of may,ch.laws,codified at.civ.prac.article thus created a binding legal presumption that nonresidents,by driving on texas roadways,had appointed the chairman of the state highway commission their agent for service of process in lawsuits arising from motor vehicle accidents within the state.we concluded that article,section precursor,refer red to the absence of the defendant from or presence within the territorial limits of the state,and the availability of substituted service on the highway commission chairman was irrelevant to that inquiry.deitz,at.accordingly,limitations was tolled during the driver absence.id.
we did not consider the effect of the general longarm statute in deitz.just as article deemed the highway commission chairman the agent for service of process for nonresident motorists in suits stemming from accidents,the general longarm statute provides that the secretary of state is an agent for service of process on a nonresident who engages in business in this state in any proceeding that arises out of the business done in this state.civ.prac.b.but unlike article,in addition to providing for substituted service,the general longarm statute specifically addresses a nonresident defendant presence within the state territorial limits for purposes of personal jurisdiction specifically,the statute provides that a nonresident does business in this state if,among other acts,the nonresident contracts with a texas resident and either party is to perform in whole or in part here,or the nonresident commits a tort in whole or in part in this state.civ.prac.of course,the longarm statute only affords in personam jurisdiction if jurisdiction accords with federal limitations.moki mac river expeditions drugg,citing am.type culture collection,coleman,csr link,schlobohm schapiro.but if a nonresident is amenable to service of process under the longarm statute and has contacts with the state sufficient to afford personal jurisdiction,as was the case with kerlin,then we can discern no reason why a nonresident presence in this state would not be established for purposes of the tolling statute.
in this case,the jury found that kerlin was receiving royalty payments that rightfully belonged to the ballis from january,until february,and that he continued to deceive the ballis about the havre dunn settlement from its execution until the same date.thus,whether or not kerlin was constructively present in texas because he was subject to service of process via the secretary of state,he was present by doing business in this state as the statute defines that term.because kerlin was doing business here and was thus not absent from texas,the tolling statute does not apply and limitations bars the ballis claims.because the ballis claims are time barred,we need not address kerlin other arguments.
iii.conclusion 
the record conclusively establishes that the ballis could have discovered kerlin wrongful conduct through the exercise of reasonable diligence.in addition,the statute of limitations was not tolled because,under the general longarm statute,kerlin was present in the state.accordingly,the statute of limitations bars the ballis claims.we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for kerlin.
i concur in the court judgment.i understand the court reluctance to overrule one of our cases,but years ago justices pope,greenhill,and steakley were right that vaughn deitz was wrongly decided our absent from the state statute arose in,a long time before analysis did as almost every other state has decided,a person whose minimum contacts make them amenable to suit in a state can not fairly be said to be absent from the state.indeed,such a construction would face serious constitutional problems 
it is unclear why the court is afraid to say so.no one has argued that we should distinguish rather than overrule vaughn for a very good reason it is impossible.both the business statute here and the motorist statute in vaughn are part of the same chapter in the civil practices and remedies code,and both make nonresidents amenable to suit in texas.indeed,one can sue a nonresident motorist under either as a party to a collision or as one who has conducted business by commit ting a tort in whole or in part in this state.does the court mean to say today that limitations is tolled under this code section if the plaintiff serves the secretary of state but not if the plaintiff serves the transportation commission chairman 
but the court of appeals opinion also purports to say a lot about several other legal doctrines there are headnotes in the southwestern reporter,some of which we have not addressed in a very long time,and every one of which the court of appeals misapplied.if experienced judges can make such mistakes,others may follow and the jurisprudence of the state become disoriented i would straighten a few of these out.
the primary mistake made by the courts below was forgetting that the transaction on which this suit is based was a sale.the heirs of juan jose balli nephew of the roman catholic priest after whom padre island is named sold any interest they might have in that island in to gilbert kerlin in duly recorded quitclaim deeds retaining only a interest in any minerals 
know all men by these presents that the undersigned,each of the balli heirs,for and in consideration of the sum of cash in hand to us paid by gilbert kerlin,trustee and other valuable considerations,the receipt of all of which is hereby acknowledged and confessed,have granted,sold and conveyed and by these presents do grant,sell and convey,unto the said gilbert kerlin,trustee,all of our undivided interest in and to all that certain tract of land situated in the counties of cameron,willacy,kenedy,kleberg and nueces,in the state of texas,commonly known as padre island it being our intention to convey all the interest which we have in the hereinabove described premises,and each and every part thereof,by reason of our being the lawful heirs of the said juan jose balli,irrespective of the acreage or quantity thereof,save and except that there is specifically reserved to us a of the royalty of of any and all oil gas or other minerals in,on or under our pro rata interest in the above described premises.
keeping this simple fact in mind,all of the plaintiffs the years of litigation that have in a heap.
the heirs had nothing to sell 
juan jose balli sold his interests in padre island to santiago morales in.this court so held in in state balli balli heirs have never lived on padre island,never worked it,never paid taxes on it.their sole claim to balli and morales rescinded their rejected by this court in state balli 
but even assuming that holding was not binding on these heirs,any claim the heirs had to padre island was extinguished by a default judgment in in havre dunn.there,all balli heirs known and unknown the ancestors and privies of all current claimants were served by publication in a case regarding title to these parts of padre island.when none of the balli heirs appeared,all were defaulted.one claimant filed a motion for new trial within the period for setting aside a default served by publication but none of the balli heirs did.thus any interest the heirs held in padre island was extinguished in,ten years before they met gilbert kerlin.
estoppel by deed does not apply 
the courts below disregarded these facts based on an estoppel by deed that because kerlin bought quitclaim deeds from the heirs and used them in the hope of gaining something thereby,he was estopped to claim that they conveyed him nothing while we have not written much about estoppel by deed in a long time,the restatement third of property describes at least two reasons why estoppel by deed has nothing to do with this case 
under the doctrine of estoppel by deed,a purported transfer of land that the transferor does not own becomes enforceable and takes place automatically if the land is later acquired,but only if the deed represents to the grantee that title of a specified quality is being conveyed,which most warranty deeds but few quitclaim deeds do
