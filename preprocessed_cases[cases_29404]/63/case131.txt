factual and procedural history 
the commission is an independent federal regulatory agency that is charged with enforcing the provisions of the commodity exchange act.the commission filed a complaint for injunctive and other equitable relief in federal district court,alleging that six analyst and five traders employed by shell trading gas and power engaged in acts that violated the act.the defendants were in the business of buying and selling natural gas for profit on behalf of the west desk at coral in houston,texas.the traders on the west desk traded natural gas at several locations in the western part of the united states.denette johnson was the head of the west trading desk at coral.dizona,courtney moore,john tracy,and robert harp were all traders on the west trading desk at coral.kelly dyer was an analyst on the west trading desk.
the complaint alleged that from october through june,the defendants entered into transactions calling for the delivery of natural gas on behalf of coral.the transactions at issue are called physical trades of natural gas in interstate commerce.physical trades require the delivery of a specific amount of natural gas on agreed upon days during the following month.the price of a physical trade is either agreed upon at the time of the trade,a fixed price or set by a published index,called an index price.the defendants duties included reporting the price and volume data of their trades to reporting services that generated natural gas price indices,such as inside ferc gas market report iferc and natural gas intelligence ngi.these publications would solicit this data during bidweek,which was generally the last five business days of a month.the editors of these publications would receive the data from the traders and perform an analysis on the data.based upon their analysis,the editors would determine an index price.an index price is the editor opinion of a value that would represent a central value for natural gas during that bidweek period in that market.
the commission alleged that the defendants submitted price and volume data to iferc and ngi that was not based on actual trades.thus,the commission charged that the defendants knowingly delivered price and volume data to the reporting services that was knowingly false or inaccurate in violation of a.the commission further charged that the purpose of this false reporting was to attempt to manipulate the natural gas price indices in violation of a.five of the six defendants settled with the commission prior to trial,leaving dizona as the only remaining defendant.
at the jury trial,the commission put on evidence that,during bidweek of each month,the traders would send dyer their mark,which was each trader estimate as to what the index price would be the following month.after receiving the traders marks,dyer would send an email to the traders that had a chart with information about the delivery locations.for each delivery location,the trader mark estimated price was listed in the first column and the next two columns indicated whether a higher up or lower down index price would be good or bad for the west desk book.attached to this email was a spreadsheet for the traders to input their trade data for all baseload trades to be reported to iferc and ngi.this spreadsheet,which was a shared document on the west desk computer network,was circulated by email from trader to trader.after all the traders input their trade data,the spreadsheet was sent by facsimile to iferc and ngi.the editors of the publications would perform an analysis on the data reported by the traders and determine the index price.
the bulk of the commission evidence had been produced by coral pursuant to a subpoena and was admitted at trial through the commission investigator as a summary witness,mary kaminski,who summarized the voluminous exhibits.to show that dizona attempted to manipulate the market,kaminski compared the trading data dizona input into the monthly spreadsheets that were sent to the natural gas publications with the trade data listed in exhibit.exhibit was a spreadsheet that the commission asserted contained the actual trading data for the relevant time period.kaminski testified that her comparison of the data revealed that of the natural gas trades reported to the publications for dizona assigned trading locations were not actual coral trades.
the commission also called an expert,elud ronn,a finance professor at the university of texas and an expert in the field of energy finance.ronn was retained to determine whether there was a bias in the traders reporting procedure at the west desk and whether it was systematic in nature.ronn testified the west desk reported in a way that would positively affect coral earnings,as indicated by dyer good indicators,approximately percent of the time.in other words,the bias was in the direction suggested by dyer email message that indicated whether the up or down price movement would be good or bad.ronn found that the inaccurate data consistently skewed in coral favor showed bias.in addition,ronn testified that the volume of natural gas reported was higher than the volume actually traded.ronn determined that the excess trading volume reported was anywhere from to several hundred percent.on cross examination,ronn clarified that his report was for the west trading desk as a whole.the numbers that i reported this afternoon were specific to the locations of the defendant.the delivery locations ronn examined were the locations at which dizona traded.
additionally,the commission submitted two audiotapes of phone calls in which dizona was discussing trade data that he would report to the index compilers.on one audiotape,dizona spoke of reporting trade data to iferc,responding,i reporting the indexes.on another audiotape,dizona talked to carol taylor,a trader in canada,asking where she wants the price,and she responded low.dizona then laughed and asked if a dollar fifty would be great for you he further stated,let me test our book and if,if,if i can report it low for you i will.taylor responded,that would be great because we do have enough to even report this month unfortunately.to which dizona responded,you can make it up,ca you taylor said,we can,but we do feel right about that.dizona then said,oh,you crazy canadians.at one point,dizona said he would help her and be her immoral person,apparently by reporting a low trade.he also referred to houston,which was where he was located,as doing the dirty work for her.
dizona did not testify or call any fact witnesses.he did call professor joseph kalt,an economic consultant and expert in natural gas and oil.professor kalt testified that he looked for bias between what coral reported and the actual prices in the market.he testified that any difference between the west desk reporting and the index compiler average was less than a penny of the average in the market.his opinion was that the prices reported on the coral spreadsheet were all right in the range of everybody else in the market.
during the jury deliberations,it sent out a note to the court inquiring in question does knowingly delivered for transmission mean that he dizona provided information to be transmitted or that he made the actual transmittal in response,the court directed the jury to return to the pertinent part of the instructions.the jury subsequently found that dizona had not knowingly delivered a false report pursuant to question one.the jury did,however,find that dizona had attempted to manipulate the market price of natural gas on eight occasions.
both parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law.the district court granted dizona motion and set aside the jury verdict finding that he had attempted to manipulate the market price of natural gas in violation of a.the district court denied the commission motion.the commission now appeals.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
attempted manipulation 
the commission contends that the district court erred in granting dizona motion for judgment as a matter of law.this court reviews a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.price marathon cheese,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate after a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.in evaluating such a motion,the court must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party,and leaving credibility determinations,the weighing of evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts to the jury.price,at.although the court should review the record as a whole,it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe that is,the court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.reeves sanderson plumbing,d internal quotations omitted.
the commission argues that the district court erred in setting aside the jury verdict that dizona had attempted to manipulate the market price of a commodity in interstate commerce in violation of a.section a forbids a ny person to manipulate the market or attempt to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce.the jury found that,on eight occasions,dizona had attempted to manipulate the market price of natural gas in interstate commerce.
the district court set aside the verdict,finding,among other things,that the evidence did not prove that dizona committed an act that violated a instead,it stated that the evidence demonstrated that dizona was simply giving estimates to his superiors.the commission sharply disputes this characterization of the evidence.although the commission acknowledges that dizona provided dyer his estimates,which are his trader marks on prices,those estimates were not the basis for the charge of attempted manipulation.the commission asserts that the evidence shows that after dyer received the traders marks,she would respond by email with index directions good and bad.the charge is that,after receiving the index directions,dizona would report biased price and volume trade data with respect to his natural gas trades in accordance with dyer directions.the commission further asserts that this data was labeled and intended to be treated as actual trade as estimates.
the commission contends that there is a wealth of evidence to support the jury verdict.the commission asserts that dizona reported trades were almost always false and were consistently biased in favor of price changes that would profit his employer.the commission points to the audiotape of dizona volunteering to falsify trade data for carol taylor,a trader in canada.the commission relies on kaminski testimony that a comparison of the trading data contained in trial exhibit with data reported to the natural gas publications revealed that most of the reported data was false.the commission also relies on a forensic trail demonstrating dizona role in submitting the data and its proffer of dizona interrogatory admissions that he sent trading data to the index compilers.
in response,dizona counters that the district court did not err in granting his motion for judgment as a matter of law because there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict once the hearsay evidence has been excised.dizona contends that certain exhibits the commission submitted into evidence constitute hearsay and that this objection was preserved in district court.as dizona asserts,in deciding whether a judgment as a matter of law should have been awarded,we must first excise inadmissible evidence such evidence contributes nothing to a legally sufficient evidentiary basis.hodges mack trucks,cir quoting weisgram marley,d.thus,we must determine whether the evidence was properly admitted before the jury.we review a district court evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.united states dixon,cir.
it is undisputed that coral produced the evidence in question pursuant to a subpoena issued by the commission.exhibits numbered through included the emails from the analyst to the traders and the emails forwarding the attached spreadsheet with their reported trades and their marks.exhibit is an excel spreadsheet that coral produced in response to a subpoena for the record of coral trades during the relevant time period during a pretrial hearing,dizona objected to the admission of these exhibits,asserting that the commission had failed to demonstrate that the evidence met the business records exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence.dizona counsel objected as follows we contend they are not business records.they were not kept in the ordinary course of business.they were not kept by someone.they do meet any of the criteria of rule or.the district court responded i might agree with you,but i do think that the criteria for admission and that why i overruled it.although it is clear that the district court overruled the hearsay objection,the basis for admission is unclear subsequently,at trial,dizona objected to exhibit during the testimony of mary kaminski.dizona counsel again objected based on hearsay and relevance.during a conference at the bench,the court inquired regarding who compiled the document,and the commission attorney asserted that coral information technology department compiled exhibit.dizona attorney responded,countering no,it was not,your honor.the court then stated let just assume that that true.the commission attorney then stated that coral maintains a database of trades and that system is,i believe,the endure system.and in order to develop this excel spreadsheet,they downloaded information directly out of endure into this excel spreadsheet.the attorney assertions appear to attempt to lay the foundation for admission based upon the business records exception to the hearsay rule under rule.however,as dizona has argued,counsel assertions do not constitute evidence and thus can not lay the foundation for rule.
dizona asserts that because the commission did not call a coral employee with personal knowledge to establish the documents as business records under rule of the federal rules of evidence,the evidence was hearsay.with respect to rule,t he exception requires that either the custodian of the business records or other qualified witness lay a foundation before the records are admitted.united states brown,cir.however,t here is no requirement that the witness who lays the foundation be the author of the record or be able to personally attest to its accuracy.id.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.a qualified witness is one who can explain the record keeping system of the organization and vouch that the requirements of rule are met.id.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.rule provides,in pertinent part,that
