this appeal concerns municipal regulation of the siting,construction,and operation of a natural gas compressor station.we weigh jurisdictional and jurisprudential concerns before addressing the merits,which implicate federalism and the interplay between state and local authority under texas law.we affirm the judgment of the district court denying injunctive relief in part and granting relief in part.
texas midstream gas services llc tmgs is in the business of installing and operating natural gas pipeline facilities.it is known as a midstream gas gatherer.grand prairie,texas grand prairie or the city is a city.
in,tmgs announced plans to construct a natural gas pipeline and compressor station in grand prairie.compressor stations are needed to clean and compress natural gas after extraction in anticipation of interstate transport.tmgs acquired land for the station and easements for the pipeline.apparently concerned by the prospect of a compressor station within city limits,the grand prairie city council amended the city unified development code udc on july,to cover natural gas compressor stations.grand prairie,udc,section.section requires a specific use permit sup from the city to build and operate a natural gas compressor station the sup requirement.id.it requires,inter alia,that compressor stations comply with setback rules the setback requirement have an security fence the security fence requirement enclose equipment and sound attenuation structures within a building conform to certain aesthetic standards and pave means of vehicular access.id.section also prohibits compressor stations from emitting noise in excess of ambient levels.id.violations are punishable by civil penalties of up to per day.grand prairie,udc.
tmgs sued grand prairie and certain city officials for declaratory and injunctive relief.tmgs averred,inter alia,that section was preempted by the pipeline safety act psa,and that section impinged on tmgs eminent domain powers.tmgs requested a temporary injunction against enforcement of section during the pendency of this case,and a permanent injunction upon its conclusion after considering undisputed evidence,the district court granted in part and denied in part injunctive relief.the court held that the psa preempted part of the security fence requirement,but the remainder of section was lawful and severable.the court thus enjoined only the security fence requirement.
tmgs filed this interlocutory appeal.tmgs challenges the district court failure to enjoin the setback requirement because it infringes tmgs eminent domain rights and is preempted by the psa.tmgs says the preempted parts are not severable from the remainder of section,and therefore,section must be enjoined in toto.
after filing its notice of appeal,tmgs applied under protest for an sup.because the compressor station would be in an area zoned agricultural,a setback applied.tmgs asked for a setback from the south lot line.the city council granted the exception and issued the sup on july.the district court has stayed proceedings pending appeal.
we first note that we have statutory jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a,which confers jurisdiction in the courts of appeal over i nterlocutory orders of the district courts granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.grand prairie does not argue that statutory jurisdiction is absent,but rather,says we lack article iii constitutional jurisdiction because the issuance of an sup has rendered this appeal moot.grand prairie reasons that because the appeal seeks to enjoin section setback requirement,for which an exception was granted,a ruling on the validity of this part of section would be an advisory opinion.tmgs counters that the station has not been built and that tmgs could change the station design and location.moreover,tmgs still challenges grand prairie authority to enact section,and seeks to enjoin the measure altogether.
mootness is a jurisdictional matter which can be raised for the first time on appeal.see harris city of houston,cir.this requirement,the doctrine of standing set in a time frame,mandates that litigants retain a personal interest in a dispute at its inception and throughout the litigation.motient dondero,cir quoting arizonans for official english arizona,d.i f an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,the appeal must be dismissed.karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir quoting church of scientology united states,d.a claim is moot if the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.id.citation omitted.
this appeal is not moot.tmgs has argued from the inception of this action that grand prairie lacks authority to regulate the compressor station siting,construction,or operation.tmgs still seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of any part of section.if tmgs had only sought to compel issuance of an sup with a modified setback,it would arguably lack a cognizable legal interest in this appeal.see bayou liberty ass n,army corps of eng rs,cir when a party seeks an injunction to halt a construction project the case may become moot when a substantial portion of that project is completed.tmgs contends that grand prairie efforts to regulate setbacks and other matters are per se illegal.it makes no difference that tmgs has applied for an sup under protest or otherwise,or that an sup has issued.these events do not render illusory tmgs effort to kill section once and for all.the station has not been built,and tmgs could modify its plans in the absence of the setback requirement.moreover,via section,grand prairie asserts regulatory authority pursuant to its police powers.once the station is operational,tmgs will have to comply with myriad city ordinances,violation of which can subject tmgs to fines of per day.these are not trifling concerns.relief from section would palpably affect tmgs operations.see karaha bodas,at.consequently,it is not impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief.see motient,at.
before argument,grand prairie filed a brief pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure j to alert us to a new supreme court opinion.see alvarez smith,d.in alvarez,the court granted certiorari on whether illinois law provides a sufficiently speedy opportunity for an individual,whose car or cash police have seized without a warrant,to contest the lawfulness of the seizure.id.at.the plaintiffs were six individuals whose property had been seized.id.at.however,prior to the court addressing the merits,all plaintiffs either received their property or conceded that it was properly confiscated there was no longer any dispute about ownership or possession of the relevant property.id.at.in light of this,the appeal was an abstract dispute about the law,unlikely to affect these plaintiffs any more than it affects other illinois citizens.id.as such,it no longer implicated a constitutionally required case or controversy.id.at.grand prairie asserts that u nder alvarez,the injuries upon which tmgs based its complaint are in the past,and its claims for prospective injunctive relief are moot.not so.tmgs does not take issue with the city procedures or diligence in evaluating an sup application.tmgs contends that an sup requirement in general,and the setback requirement in particular,is repugnant to state and federal law.properly framed,tmgs does not allege a grievance,but instead a concrete,ongoing injury in having to shoulder the yoke of grand prairie regulatory burdens.the issuance of an sup does not change this critical fact.this appeal is not moot.
we address one more procedural wrinkle before weighing the merits.perhaps convinced that its mootness argument was a winner,grand prairie did not brief the merits of this case.at argument,counsel offered no explanation for this omission.in some instances,this would lead us to conclude that a party had forfeited its opportunity to prevail on the merits.see,fed.b requiring the appellee brief to contain,inter alia,argument for its contentions united states whitfield,cir.however,we retain discretion to consider matters not briefed,especially when they implicate substantial public interests.see united states miranda,cir.additionally,when the derelict party is the appellee,who may rely on a favorable ruling by the trial court,it makes sense to construe the rule of forfeiture more leniently.see shell offshore,director,office of worker comp.programs,cir laitram nec.we can also preserve judicial resources and avoid piecemeal litigation by addressing issues sooner rather than later.see shell offshore,at.
in this case,it makes sense to proceed to the merits of the dispute.there is a substantial public interest in resolving matters implicating federalism and state law questions.the district court thorough and opinion also gives us a more than adequate basis for reviewing the merits of grand prairie position.finally,there is little sense in declining to address the merits and remanding for further proceedings.tmgs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.the district court held that,aside from the security fence requirement,tmgs was unlikely to prevail on the merits.this holding,if affirmed,would foreclose most forms of relief tmgs could plausibly seek in the district court.were we to decline to review the district court conclusions at this time,we could confront a appeal down the road.we will exercise our discretion to proceed to the merits of this appeal.however,we emphasize that counsel amateurish tactical decision to address only grand prairie mootness argument is an egregious lapse in counsel duty to brief all pertinent issues.

tmgs first argues that the setback requirement is void under texas law.tmgs says its eminent domain power supersedes a setback requirement in a zoning ordinance,unless the objecting,the show that use of the eminent domain power is unreasonable or arbitrary.the district court rejected this position as contrary to texas law.we affirm.
texas law presumes that zoning ordinances are valid exercises of a city police powers.city of pharr tippitt.a challenger must prove that the ordinance is arbitrary or unreasonable in that it bears no substantial relationship to the health,safety,morals or general welfare of the community.id.at.tmgs does not argue that grand prairie setback requirement is facially invalid.rather,tmgs insists that,by virtue of its eminent domain power,it is immune from the setback requirement unless the city can show tmgs use of the land is unreasonable or arbitrary the issue boils down to whether grand prairie zoning power is subservient to tmgs eminent domain power,or.
several texas cases explore the interplay between local zoning regulations and eminent domain powers.in the abstract,neither power is unbridled 
eminent domain involves the deprivation of the right of the property owner to keep his property when it is needed for public use.zoning regulations,derived from the police powers,deprive the property owner of the use of his property contrary to standards promulgated for the health,safety and welfare of the public generally.both powers are inherent in state government and may be delegated for appropriate purposes.neither power is an unbridled one in short,there must not be an abuse of the power.
porter sw.pub.serv,writ ref citing lombardo city of dallas.the porter court asked whether on abstract principle a public utility power of eminent domain is superior to the zoning ordinance of a city.we hold that it is not id.at.in that case,homeowners sued southwestern public service company sps to remove a substation which violated an amarillo zoning ordinance.id.at.sps argued that,to the extent the ordinance conflicted with sps eminent domain power,it was unenforceable.the court of appeals disagreed,and held 
the right of eminent domain advanced here is one derived from a general grant and does not exempt sps from the zoning authority.the city,to which the state has specifically entrusted the police powers,has the power to inquire into the reasonableness of the manner by which eminent domain is to be exercised within its corporate limits.its planning ordinances are presumed to be valid until the contrary is shown,and one seeking an exception has the burden of proof.
id.at.similarly,in port arthur independent school district city of groves groves,the court held that a school district had to comply with local building codes,notwithstanding its mandate to establish and maintain public schools.in the absence of comprehensive statewide regulations for school buildings,a local authority can exercise its police power to promote the public welfare.id.at.
while cities have discretion in exercising police powers,cities may not bar outright the reasonable exercise of eminent domain powers.in austin independent school district city of sunset valley sunset valley,a city attempted to prohibit the location of school facilities within its boundaries.the court held that this unreasonably impinged upon the school district eminent domain power.id.at.this was in contrast to groves,which involved a more circumscribed exercise of police powers.see id.at the enforcement of health and safety regulations is not before the court in the instant case.what is before the court is a zoning ordinance of the city which wholly excludes the school facilities in issue.moreover,the sunset valley court emphasized that the school district could not act with impunity,namely,it could not build in a given spot if the city showed that the choice of location was unreasonable or arbitrary.id.at accord fort worth ry.ammons,writ ref holding that city zoning could not stop expansion of railroad siding absent showing that railroad abused eminent domain power,but recognizing that railroad had to comply with city building code gulf,ry.white,writ ref same 
when both zoning and eminent domain authority is vested in a city,the city may make reasonable exceptions to zoning ordinances.see city of lubbock austin lubbock.in lubbock,the city condemned a strip of the plaintiff land in order to improve an intersection,which deprived the lot of the setback.id.at.the plaintiff argued that the city was powerless to take such a measure.id.at.the court disagreed,holding that a city exercising its eminent domain power is not bound by its own zoning ordinance unless the objecting party can show that the condemnation is unreasonable or arbitrary.id.at.
we reject tmgs argument that its eminent domain power trumps the setback requirement of section.even an eminent domain entity like tmgs must comply with generally applicable zoning requirements.see groves,at porter,at.tmgs has not shown that texas intended to exempt it from zoning or setback requirements,or that texas regulations have supplanted grand prairie police powers in this field.see groves,at.therefore,tmgs only recourse is to show that grand prairie setback requirement is unreasonable or arbitrary.see tippitt,at.
tmgs has not attempted to demonstrate that the setback requirement fails to promote public health,safety,or welfare.instead,tmgs says under lubbock,its eminent domain power supersedes a setback requirement in a zoning ordinance.it is true that lubbock involved a setback which yielded to the exercise of eminent domain.however,in lubbock,the fact that the city superseded its setback was not legally determinative.both police power and eminent domain authority w
