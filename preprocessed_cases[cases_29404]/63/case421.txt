williams gas coast wgp and transcontinental gas pipe line transco petition for review of two federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission orders asserting jurisdiction over a natural gas pipeline off the coast of louisiana.see transcontinental gas pipe line,transco rehearing order transcontinental gas pipe line,transco jurisdictional order.under the natural gas act nga or the act,ferc has jurisdiction over pipelines that transport natural gas,but not over those that gather it.but the act does not define these terms,leaving ferc to create a test that will rationally and reliably distinguish between the two types of pipeline.ferc efforts to properly classify transco pipeline are emblematic of its struggle to complete this task.
in,ferc disclaimed jurisdiction over a mile,diameter pipeline in transco central louisiana system lying downstream of the pipeline facilities of jupiter energy jupiter.transcontinental gas pipe line,transco jurisdictional order,reh g denied in relevant part,transcontinental gas pipe line,transco rehearing order.this court upheld ferc orders as supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary and capricious.williams gas coast ferc,i.
in,in a separate proceeding initiated by jupiter,ferc determined that an jupiter pipeline feeding into the transco lateral serves a transportation function.jupiter energy,reh g denied,jupiter energy,jupiter rehearing order.the consequence of this ruling was that a jurisdictional pipeline jupiter flowed into a pipeline transco.on review,the fifth circuit vacated and remanded,holding that the commission decision was arbitrary and capricious because jupiter transportation pipeline sat upstream of a transco gathering pipeline.jupiter energy ferc,cir jupiter appeal.the fifth circuit noted that ferc jupiter orders produced an anomalous scenario,to wit a series of gathering pipelines upstream feed ing into a transportation pipeline jupiter line,in turn feed ing into a gathering pipeline the transco line.id.at.the court concluded that this can not be considered consistent.id.
in,before the fifth circuit jupiter appeal decision had been handed down,ferc issued an order requiring wgp and transco to show cause why the agency transco jurisdictional order should not be reversed as anomalous in light of the jupiter orders.transcontinental gas pipe line,show cause order.shortly after the fifth circuit vacated the jupiter orders,ferc reversed its prior determination and held that the transco lateral directly downstream of the jupiter facility serves a transportation function.transco jurisdictional order.
on june,ferc issued two decisions.first,in the case on remand from the fifth circuit,the commission affirmed its jurisdictional determination in the jupiter orders.jupiter energy.second,ferc denied the request for rehearing of its transco jurisdictional order,on the grounds that the disputed orders were issued on the basis of incomplete information,and no gas is collected along the length of transco downstream line.transco rehearing order.the jupiter orders are now pending review before the fifth circuit and the challenges to the commission transco jurisdictional order and transco rehearing order are at the heart of the petition for review in this case.
wgp and transco principal argument is that it was unlawful for ferc to reconsider its prior conclusion regarding transco pipeline segment lying downstream of the pipeline facilities of jupiter.petitioners argue,in particular,that t he commission lone finding and premise that the subject pipeline facility is not a gathering facility solely because,purportedly,no gas was collected along that pipeline is contrary to the facts of record.petitioners reply br.at.petitioners also contend that,because the commission previously decided these same facilities to be gathering in final,orders,the commission is barred from these same issues.id.
wgp and transco are right in their observation that t his is a classic case of an agency,both in its orders under review and its brief to this court,failing to demonstrate that it has engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.id.they are wrong,however,in suggesting that ferc was without authority to reconsider its transco jurisdictional order.indeed,petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument that it is within ferc authority to make jurisdictional determinations that rest on the premises that there is one point on any given route where gathering stops and transportation begins,and a transportation pipeline can not feed into a gathering pipeline.see recording of oral argument at.these two points were highlighted by the fifth circuit in the jupiter appeal decision.at.if these two principles apply,then ferc might be justified in finding that both the jupiter and transco lines are jurisdictional facilities.the problem here is that the agency rationale underlying the disputed transco jurisdictional order and transco rehearing order only hints at these principles.
in its briefs to this court,ferc argues that it revisited its transco jurisdictional order to eliminate a fundamental inconsistency in its case law.respondent br.at.the commission could have stated as much in its orders and justified the policy shift,for an agency is free to change course in a regulatory regime provided that it offers a reasoned explanation for so doing and is not otherwise constrained by statutory limitations.we are forced to vacate the orders,however,because in those decisions,ferc neither explained its action as consistent with precedent nor justified it as a reasoned and permissible shift in policy.although these orders ultimately may prove to be justified on the merits,they are presently wanting for lack of reasoned decisionmaking.
background 
the natural gas act grants ferc the power to regulate the transportation or transmission of natural gas in interstate commerce but not the production or gathering of natural gas.b.until fairly recently,companies sold gas under rates that encompassed both gathering and transportation services.lomak petroleum,ferc.however,in the wake of major regulatory changes in the natural gas industry,including the unbundling of gathering and transportation services,conoco ferc,companies primarily engaged in transporting gas no longer need to operate gathering facilities,lomak,at.as a result,many natural gas transporters have sought to separate their transportation and gathering facilities,through transfer otherwise known as spindown of the latter to gathering affiliates.see i,at.
because the nga does not define gathering and transportation,ferc is responsible for drawing the not always clear line between the two.see exxonmobil gas mktg.ferc,quoting conoco,at.gathering facilities are generally understood to be pipelines that collect gas from wells where gas originates and deliver it into pipelines which will transport it in interstate commerce.id.at conoco,at.however,since on any given route between the wells upstream and the final destination downstream,various pipeline segments may be owned by different companies,it is no mean feat for the agency to determine which segments serve a gathering function and which do not.faced with this reality and inundated with requests for jurisdictional clarification,see gas pipeline facilities servs.on the outer cont l shelf,at,ferc has had trouble finding its footing.see exxonmobil,at ferc has been struggling with the reclassification of facilities shell gas pipeline,at t he development of an appropriate methodology has been an ongoing task.
in farmland industries,ferc announced the primary function test,under which it considers six factors to determine the jurisdictional status of a pipeline the pipelines length and diameter the central point in the field the facility geographic configuration or pattern the location of compressors and processing plants,particularly where the pipelines are located behind,upstream of,the processing plant the location of wells along all or part of the facilities and the line s operating pressure.i,at.only six years later,however,the fifth circuit found fault with the test,because it ignored the geographical realities of offshore gas collection where pipelines serving a gathering function often need to be larger and longer and focused instead on purely physical criteria.ep operating ferc,cir.the primary function test was seen by the court as failing to classify facilities with marked similarities in operational characteristics the same way.id.at.
in response,ferc modified its primary function test to include a sliding scale which will allow the use of gathering pipelines of increasing lengths and diameters in correlation to the distance from shore and the water depth of the offshore production area.amerada hess,at.it also announced that it would consider nonphysical criteria such as the purpose,location and operation of the facility,the general business activity of the owner of the facility,and whether the jurisdictional determination is consistent with the objectives of the nga id.at see sea robin pipeline ferc,cir sea robin i.after several years,however,the fifth circuit concluded that ferc had once again failed to create a viable test.according to the court,ferc had reverted,committing exactly the same error criticized in ep operating it treated the physical size of the pipeline as presumptive.id.at.the court also found that the commission was relying too much on nonphysical factors,which,while relevant,are only part of the mix and should be treated as secondary to the physical factors.id.at.because,in the court view,ferc seemed unable to consistently resolve when gathering ceases and transportation commences,the fifth circuit invited ferc to reformulate its primary function test another time.id.
on remand,ferc revised the test.first,ferc concluded that the factor should be given less weight in the offshore context,because almost all offshore facilities are situated upstream of processing plants.sea robin pipeline,at sea robin ii,reh g denied,sea robin pipeline,sea robin ii rehearing order.ferc then replaced the central point in the field factor used in the onshore context with a centralized aggregation inquiry into whether there exists a central location where gas is aggregated for further transportation to shore.id.ferc stated that its revised test would enable it to consistently discern the point at which the collection or gathering of gas ends,and interstate transmission begins.id.at.
in its order denying rehearing of sea robin ii,ferc stated,t he commission does not agree that the fact of sea robin upstream interconnection with a jurisdictional facility,by itself,compels a finding that the east leg of sea robin system is jurisdictional.sea robin ii rehearing order,at.exxonmobil sought review before this court arguing,inter alia,that ferc jurisdictional ruling has created an utterly illogical situation,wherein gas is transported on a jurisdictional pipeline into a gathering leg of sea robin pipeline.exxonmobil,at internal quotation marks omitted.after canvassing ferc case law,we held that the presence of an interconnection with an upstream jurisdictional facility does not compel a finding that the downstream facility is likewise jurisdictional.id.based on the historical treatment of the lines in question,we explained that,i f anything,the jurisdictional line upstream of the sea robin facility ha d been erroneously classified.id.we accepted ferc argument that the inconsistent treatment of the upstream pipeline and the sea robin pipeline did not necessarily render the decision arbitrary and capricious and upheld the classification.id.at.
such was the state of ferc primary function test when transco asked ferc to authorize the spindown of its central louisiana system to wgp,and wgp in turn petitioned ferc for a declaratory order disclaiming jurisdiction over the facilities.after considering each factor of the revised primary function test,ferc found that a large central pipeline,the spine,serves a transportation function,while to offshore lateral lines connect at various locations into the spine and serve to collect gas from the surrounding production areas.transco jurisdictional order,at.ferc concluded that these lateral lines serve to gather gas from production located in their vicinity.id.ferc denied rehearing with respect to the laterals classification,see transco rehearing order,and we upheld the orders as supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary and capricious,see i.
before this court decision had issued in i,ferc conducted a separate jurisdictional status proceeding covering jupiter line upstream of and feeding into one of the transco laterals.jupiter energy.focusing heavily on the centralized aggregation point factor,ferc concluded that the jupiter pipeline performs a transportation function.id.at.jupiter sought rehearing,arguing that the presence of transco gathering lateral downstream of the jupiter pipeline foreclosed a finding that the facility engages in transportation.jupiter rehearing order.ferc concluded that its orders can not now be the basis for claiming that jupiter facilities should also be declared to be gathering.id.at.in a footnote,ferc reversed the position it had taken in its sea robin ii rehearing order and declared that t he presence of upstream transmission facilities determines the classification of downstream facilities,not the opposite.id.at.
seemingly uncomfortable with the muddle it had created a series of gathering pipelines feeding into a transportation pipeline jupiter line,in turn feed ing into a gathering pipeline the transco line,jupiter appeal,at issued an order requiring wgp and transco to show cause why the transco jurisdictional order should not be reversed as anomalous in light of the jupiter orders.show cause order,at.ferc also repeated the declaration contained in its jupiter footnote that upstream transportation facilities determine the classification of downstream facilities.id.
before ferc could address the show cause order,the fifth circuit vacated ferc jupiter orders.jupiter appeal.the fifth circuit highlighted that ferc sea robin ii decision endorsed the principle that there is one point on any given route where gathering stops and transportation begins.id.at.the fifth circuit therefore reasoned that,because ferc had already set the jurisdictional boundary downstream from one of jupiter pipelines,it was arbitrary for the commission now to set a jurisdictional dividing point further upstream.id.at.the court vacated the jupiter orders as anomalous and inconsistent.id.at.
just a week after the fifth circuit vacated the jupiter orders,ferc decided that wgp and transco had failed to show cause sufficient to prevent reclassification of the lateral.transco jurisdictional order.in the background section of its decision,ferc stated since it had not been aware that a transportation facility stood upstream of the lateral when it disclaimed jurisdiction over it in,its determination was made on the basis of incomplete information and t he presence of upstream transmission facilities determines the classification of downstream facilities,not the opposite.id.at.in the discussion section of its decision,ferc based its conclusion that transco lateral actually serves a transportation function on one fact unlike the gathering arms of the sea robin pipeline,n o gas is collected along the jupiter pipeline.id.at.
on june,ferc issued two decisions.first,ferc affirmed its jurisdictional determination in the jupiter orders.in so doing,ferc noted that,because transco pipeline was being reclassified from gathering to transportation,the inconsistency identified by the fifth circuit no longer exists.jupiter energy.second,ferc denied transco request for rehearing,offering two rationales in a decision the orders were issued on the basis of incomplete information and no gas is collected along the length of transco downstream line.transco rehearing order.ferc provided no other reasoning or factual support for its conclusion.wgp and transco now seek review in this court.
