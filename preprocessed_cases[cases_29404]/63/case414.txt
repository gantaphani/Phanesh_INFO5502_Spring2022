the petitioners,which are developing a proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the north slope of alaska to the contiguous united states,seek review of two regulations promulgated by the federal energy regulatory commission.according to the petitioners,the commission has asserted authority to condition a certificate of public convenience and necessity on the project sponsor willingness to allow the commission to increase the capacity or expandability of the project,and that assertion is invalid on its face because it contravenes the alaska natural gas pipeline act angpa,stat,and the natural gas act nga,ch,a,stat,a.according to the commission,it has broad authority to condition a certificate of public convenience and necessity upon the sponsor of a proposed pipeline making a design change,a term heretofore applied not to a change in capacity but to such matters as routing,cost allocations,and the design of initial service rates.
preliminarily,we agree with the parties that this controversy is ripe for review because the issues are purely legal and delaying a decision would inhibit investment in a project the construction of which the congress has made a priority.as to the merits,we note the commission has not interpreted,which provides that i n reviewing any application for an alaska natural gas pipeline project,the commission may require changes in project design necess ary to promote competition and offer a reasonable opportunity for access to the project,as authority to condition a certificate upon increasing the capacity of the proposed pipeline,and it may never do so.nor do we agree with the petitioners that,which provides that i n considering a proposed voluntary expansion the commission may require design changes to ensure that some portion of the expansion capacity be allocated to new shippers,may reasonably be read to assert authority in the commission to condition a certificate upon an increase in the capacity above that proposed by the sponsor of the pipeline.therefore,we conclude neither nor is facially invalid and accordingly deny the petitions for review.
background 
in,the congress enacted the alaska natural gas transportation act angta,in which it found there was a natural gas supply shortage and encouraged the expeditious construction of a pipeline to carry natural gas from alaska to the contiguous states of the united states.see,stat.when,years later,the hoped for pipeline still had not been constructed,the congress passed the angpa,which is meant to encourage construction by offering certain government loan guarantees.the angpa also requires that we expedite review of any final order of the commission made under the authority of that act,a,c,and that the commission expedite consideration of any application for a certificate,c.this case concerns regulations the commission promulgated to govern its issuance of an initial certificate to build and a subsequent certificate to expand an alaska pipeline.
under the angpa,the commission is required to promulgate regulations for the conduct of an open season designed to promote competition in the exploration,development,and production of alaska natural gas.e b.a potential alaska pipeline project sponsor must,during the open season,allow potential gas producers to bid for the right to ship a specified quantity of gas through the proposed pipeline.the sponsor then may seek a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the nga,which certificate the commission is to issue if it finds the sponsor able and willing to perform a service required by the present or future public convenience or necessity.nga c,e.the commission may attach such reasonable terms and conditions to the certificate as the public convenience and necessity may require.nga e.of particular relevance here,the commission may require a company to extend or improve or to establish physical connection of its transportation facilities with another facilities but may not compel the enlargement of transportation facilities for such purposes.nga a.
the petitioners,which lease from the state of alaska land with about to percent of that state proven natural gas reserves,intend jointly to apply for a certificate to build and operate an alaska pipeline.before doing so,however,the petitioners seek review of two regulations promulgated by the commission pursuant to angpa e,namely,and,that the petitioners read as asserting an authority they say the commission does not have,to condition the issuance of a certificate upon the project sponsor increasing the capacity of its proposed pipeline or of a later proposed expansion thereof.
ii.analysis 
before we reach the merits of this facial challenge to the validity of and,we consider whether the issue is ripe for judicial review.though the commission did not raise the issue,the question of ripeness goes to our subject matter jurisdiction,and thus we can raise the issue sua sponte at any time.duke city lumber butz.
to determine whether a controversy is ripe,we must consider both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.gardner,d.at oral argument the commission agreed with the petitioners that the issue whether the regulations are within the commission statutory authority is fit for judicial review.we agree as well,because the issue tendered is a purely legal one whether the statute was properly construed.see id.
with respect to the hardship to the parties,we agree with the petitioners that delaying resolution of the issue will tend to inhibit or delay investment in the alaska pipeline,contrary to the twice expressed intent of the congress.the petitioners would remain uncertain whether the commission may condition the certificate for which they plan to apply upon their building a pipeline with greater capacity than they will propose.if the petitioners nevertheless seek a certificate and the commission deems the capacity for their proposed pipeline too small,resolution then of the issue now before the court will delay the process of certification for at least an additional year.the delay and its attendant cost will be a hardship to the petitioners and,in the unusual circumstances of this case,will also be a cognizable hardship to the nation as a whole.
the congress has made unmistakably clear its intention to speed construction of an alaska pipeline,starting with its determination in that expeditious construction of a pipeline was in the national interest,angta,followed by its determination in to provide loan guarantees in order to get the project moving,angpa,its directive that the court expedite review of regulations issued pursuant to the angpa,a,c,and its requirement that the commission expedite consideration of an application for a certificate to build the pipeline,angpa c.accordingly,we conclude this matter is ripe for decision.
facial validity of the regulations 
the petitioners contend the two regulations exceed the commission authority under the nga and the angpa and are arbitrary and capricious in that,if the commission conditions a certificate upon the building of a pipeline with capacity greater than that proposed by the sponsor of the project,then the sponsor will bear the additional cost of building a larger pipeline in order to transport gas that has not been and may never be discovered.the petitioners,which as of april had already spent million on preliminary feasibility studies,anticipate it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to prepare an application for a certificate.they argue that uncertainty over the possibility of footing the bill now to provide capacity for those who might later wish to ship gas on the pipeline could make the project too risky for them or any potential sponsor to undertake,thus thwarting the purpose of the congress to encourage the construction of an alaska pipeline.
the commission,joined by the intervenors and the amicus,argue the commission has broad conditioning authority to support findings of public convenience and necessity per nga e,including authority to condition a certificate upon the sponsor making a design change.the commission furt
