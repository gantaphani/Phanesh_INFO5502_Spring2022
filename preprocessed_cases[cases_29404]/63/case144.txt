cgt is a texas corporation that transports propane gas on trucks from locations in arizona and texas to distribution facilities in mexico.cgt is headquartered in el paso,tx,and has additional operations in nogales,at the time of the events giving rise to this action,cgt employed nineteen truck drivers at its nogales facility and fourteen truck drivers at its el paso facility.cgt has one customer,universal gas oil,universal.the truck drivers transport propane gas purchased by universal to distribution facilities in mexico operated by transportadora silza silza,a mexican company.universal then sells the propane gas to pemex,a mexican public utility.
for several years leading up to this case,the cgt truck drivers complained about their wages and working conditions.at various times,drivers from nogales and drivers from el paso discussed their common complaints as well as possible ways to address them.the drivers also met with cgt officials on various occasions in the united states and in mexico to discuss their concerns.in the drivers views,cgt did not address their concerns.
in august,the nogales drivers took concerted action in an effort to force cgt to address their concerns.in,more than a dozen of the nogales drivers met at a restaurant to discuss their complaints against cgt.some of the nogales drivers had been in contact with the el paso drivers and reported that the el paso drivers might engage in a work stoppage.the nogales drivers discussed what to do if cgt asked them to take over the el paso drivers routes during the strike.at the conclusion of the meeting,the nogales drivers decided to contact union organizers for assistance.
the nogales drivers scheduled a meeting with union organizers from general teamsters excluding mailers,state of arizona,local union.before the meeting,cgt dispatcher gabriel velasco velasco asked nogales driver robert ryburn ryburn about the drivers meeting and their efforts to join the union.ryburn feigned ignorance.in nogales,while the drivers were considering whether to authorize the union,velasco further interrogated and threatened several of the drivers and created the impression of surveillance in an effort to dissuade them from authorizing the union.nevertheless,the nogales drivers met with representatives of the union on august,and,by the end of the day,the union had obtained fifteen signed authorization cards from the nineteen nogales drivers.
in september,the el paso drivers took concerted action in an effort to force cgt to address their concerns.specifically,the el paso drivers presented cgt with a written petition outlining their requests for improved wages and working conditions.on september,after cgt had failed to address their concerns,nine of the el paso drivers engaged in a work stoppage.the same drivers again refused to work on september.the el paso drivers demanded a meeting,which was held on september at the silza facility in juarez,mexico.during the meeting,cgt accounting manager joel meraz meraz rejected many of their requests,explained that some were being considered,and informed the drivers that cgt could not lose another day of transporting gas due to their work stoppage.cgt operations manager oscar gardea gardea went further,threatening the drivers with termination and other unspecified reprisals if they continued to complain about wages and working conditions.the drivers asked for time to discuss their options over lunch.
during lunch,an el paso driver telephoned nogales driver rogelio delgadillo delgadillo and explained the el paso drivers situation.delgadillo stated that the nogales drivers had contacted the union and advised the el paso drivers to do the same.the nogales drivers then returned to the silza facility and informed meraz that they would return to work and that they planned to contact the union.in response,meraz handed out voluntary resignation letters,which had been prepared for each of the striking drivers.the letters were written in english,even though many of the striking drivers spoke only spanish.the drivers informed meraz that they would decide how to respond collectively.after an driver translated the letters to his,they all refused to sign.
the following day,the truckers gathered in an el paso truck stop,radioed meraz,and informed him that they were ready to work.meraz responded that they had been fired on the previous day.the workers did not think they had been fired the previous day.ultimately,cgt fired all nine drivers who participated in the september and september work stoppages.shortly after the firing,at the silza facility in juarez,mexico,cgt business agent acosta acosta had two separate conversations,one with a fired driver and one with a driver who had not been fired because he was on vacation during the work stoppage.during these conversations,acosta indicated that the nine el paso drivers were fired because of their collective complaints about wages and working conditions.
notwithstanding the fact that the union had obtained authorization cards from fifteen of the nineteen nogales drivers,cgt circumvented the union and directly asked the nogales drivers to take over the striking el paso drivers routes during the work stoppage.velasco informed the drivers that,if they refused,they might be terminated.the nogales drivers refused.near the time of their refusal,delgadillo learned that the striking el paso drivers had been fired.he heard this from both velasco and from an el paso driver.
shortly after the el paso work stoppage,the nogales drivers went public with their union organizing efforts.on september,the union filed a petition seeking to represent the nogales drivers.cgt received a copy.thereafter,ryburn and delgadillo openly displayed and distributed union paraphernalia.on september,in nogales,gardea fired ryburn and delgadillo.following their termination,ryburn and delgadillo inquired about a job with one of cgt competitors,coastal transport coastal.the job would have required ryburn and delgadillo to go to cgt office regularly to pick up certain customs documents.gardea provided a negative employment reference for ryburn and delgadillo by informing coastal that cgt did not want ryburn or delgadillo at cgt office.coastal passed on this message to ryburn and delgadillo they never applied for the position.
the union election for the nogales drivers was held on october.during the period leading up to the election,meraz conducted several meetings with groups of nogales drivers during which he discouraged them from voting for the union and implied that they would receive a pay increase if the union lost the election.at the election,four votes were cast for the union,eight against,and three were challenged.the union lost.throughout the events which precipitated this action,cgt never recognized the union and consistently refused to bargain with it.
the union filed unfair labor practice charges.after a hearing,an alj held that cgt violated section a of the nlra when gardea threatened employees with unspecified reprisals meraz solicited employees to resign and threatened them with discharge acosta threatened employees with discharge velasco interrogated and threatened employees and created the impression of surveillance meraz implied that employees would receive a wage increase if the union lost the election cgt discharged the nine el paso drivers who had engaged in a work stoppage and mentioned contacting the union cgt discharged ryburn and delgadillo after they engaged in union and other protected concerted activity and cgt provided negative employment references about ryburn and delgadillo.the alj also held that cgt independently violated section a of the nlra by terminating the nine el paso drivers,ryburn,and delgadillo.finally,the alj held that cgt violated sections a and of the nlra by refusing to recognize and bargain with the union and engaging in.in light of the union original card majority and these unfair labor practices,the alj imposed a remedial bargaining order gissel order.the board affirmed the alj conclusions and the imposition of the gissel order

cgt challenges one component of the board order the imposition of a gissel order at cgt nogales facility cgt argument in this regard is threefold first,cgt contends that the board erred in aggregating the nlra violations at cgt nogales and el paso facilities and at silza juarez facility to justify the gissel order second,cgt contends that any nlra violation at the silza facility is outside the purview of the nlra because the nlra does not apply extraterritorially third,cgt argues that the facts do not support a gissel order and that the board failed to consider changed circumstances at the nogales facility in adopting the gissel order.because we find that the nlra violations at the nogales facility independently justify imposing the gissel order in nogales,we need not address cgt first and second arguments.see moncrief oil intern.oao gazprom,cir this court may affirm on any ground supported by the record even if it was not reached by the district court.citing united states dow chem,cir pub.citizen,bomer,cir.
a remedial bargaining order is precisely what its name suggests it is a remedy that requires an employer to bargain with a union as the exclusive representative of an employee unit,notwithstanding the fact that the unit may not have finally selected the union as its exclusive representative through an election a remedial bargaining order is designed to remedy past election damage and deter future misconduct.nlrb gissel packing,d.accordingly,the supreme court has long held that the board has the authority to issue a bargaining order where an employer has committed independent unfair labor practices which have made the holding of a fair election unlikely or which have in fact undermined the union majority gissel,at.see nlrb katz,d.the board has the same authority even where it is clear that the union,which once had possession of cards from a majority of employees,represents only a minority when the bargaining order is entered.gissel,at.see franks.nlrb.
the gissel decision thus established two categories of cases in which bargaining orders are justified.gissel,at.see chromalloy min.and minerals alaska,chromalloy american nlrb,cir nlrb gibson products of washington parish,cir.in a gissel category i case,the board may enter a remedial bargaining order,even if the union can not demonstrate that it was supported by a majority of the unit,to remedy outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices if the coercive effects can not be eliminated by the application of traditional remedies,with the result that a fair and reliable union election can not be had.gissel,at.citations omitted see chromalloy,at gibson,at.in a gissel category ii case,the board may enter a remedial bargaining order to remedy less pervasive unfair labor practices which nonetheless still have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election process but only if the union once had majority support.gissel,at.see chromalloy,at gibson,at.
the board found that this is a category ii case and entered a gissel order for the nogales facility.in reaching its decision,the board considered the cumulative effect of the nlra violations outlined in section i,infra cgt argues that the board erred in granting a gissel order based on the cumulative effect of these nlra violations because not all them occurred in occurred in nogales,others in el paso,and still others in juarez.cgt further contends the board lacked jurisdiction over the unfair labor practices committed in mexico.the board counters that aggregation was proper and that it had jurisdiction over the unfair labor practices committed in mexico we need not decide these disputes.
although our review of the record indicates that the cumulative effect of cgt unfair labor practices likely places this case squarely within category i,we are satisfied that the unfair labor practices committed in nogales alone justify a gissel order under the category ii analysis.see stevens,gulistan div.nlrb,cir w e think that the present proceedings constitute one of the exceptional category i cases marked by outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices in any event the bargaining order here was justified under category ii because the union did at one point demonstrate a card majority.citations omitted.accordingly,we limit our analysis to the unfair labor practices committed in nogales under the category ii framework.
the board may issue a remedial bargaining order in a category ii case under gissel if 
a the union had valid authorization cards from a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit b the employer unfair labor practices,although not outrageous and pervasive enough to justify a bargaining order in the absence of a card majority,were still serious and extensive c the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election or a fair rerun by the use of traditional remedies,though present,is slight and d employee sentiment can best be protected in the particular case by a bargaining order.
nlrb american cable,cir american cable i quoting gissel,at.the board made these findings.we address each in turn and hold that they are supported by substantial evidence.
the first requirement of american cable i is met.the board found that fifteen of the nineteen employees in the nogales facility signed union authorization cards before the failed union election.cgt does not contest this finding on appeal.nor does cgt contest the validity of the cards or the process by which the union obtained them.see bandag,nlrb,cir noting requirement that union have valid authorization cards from a majority of employees in the appropriate bargaining unit and finding that the first requirement of american cable i was met without a specific finding as to the validity of the cards emphasis added nlrb roney plaza apartments,cir we decline to enforce the gissel order,however,because of the union misrepresentation in securing a card majority.
the second requirement of american cable i is also met.in nogales alone,the board found that cgt interrogated and threatened employees,created the impression of surveillance,promised benefits if the union lost,terminated two employees ryburn and delgadillo who were leading the unionization effort,provided negative employment references for ryburn and delgadillo,refused to bargain with the union,and engaged in.we consistently have held such practices to be sufficiently severe and extensive to satisfy the category ii analysis.see chromalloy,at enforcing gissel order where employer refused to recall a employee for his usual seasonal employment,threatened to close the plant,and promised a benefit to one employee if he opposed the union bandag,at enforcing gissel order where employer interrogated employees,threatened to curtail plant expansion or close the plant,terminated an employee
