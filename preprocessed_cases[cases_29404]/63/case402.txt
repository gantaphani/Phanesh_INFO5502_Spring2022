williston basin interstate pipeline company challenges orders of the federal energy regulatory commission that modified its contract with a shipper,the northern states power company nsp,so that nsp would be able to resell transportation capacity for which it had no use.while we find that the commission was correct to decide the case under the just and reasonable standard of a of the natural gas act nga,a,we grant williston petition flaws in the commission reasoning render its orders arbitrary and capricious.
williston stores and transports natural gas throughout montana,north dakota,south dakota,and wyoming.nsp,a natural gas distributor,is one of williston customers and operates in north dakota and minnesota.williston and nsp entered into two contracts under which nsp would receive transportation services from williston along a pipeline called the mapleton extension,which williston had built under arrangement with nsp to carry gas to an nsp distribution system in eastern north dakota.one contract,the rate schedule contract,was filed as an individually certificated transportation service under part of the commission regulations,pt.the second contract was for open access service under williston rate schedule under part,pt.under part,firm shippers that do not use all of their capacity can release the unused portion and enjoy the revenue paid by the replacement shipper,either directly or as a credit to the pipeline charges.see id.a g.
at about the time that williston and nsp finalized the rate schedule contract,the commission initiated a rulemaking that would eventually yield order.see pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation and regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol.the order,so far as is relevant here,encouraged pipelines and their customers to convert transportation service under part to open access service under part.while the order offered pipelines inducements to convert,it imposed no mandate to do so.see united distribution ferc.
in the course of a rate proceeding filed by williston under nga,the commission found that part service under rate schedule,without capacity release rights,was no longer just and reasonable,and accordingly granted nsp request that the service be converted to part.williston basin interstate pipeline,ferc,order.williston filed for rehearing,arguing principally that nsp request could be granted only if it satisfied the stricter public interest standard rather than merely the just and reasonable standard the commission action was an unexplained departure from its longtime policy of making conversions to open access transportation voluntary and the commission ignored the financial impact on williston and its customers.the commission denied rehearing.williston basin interstate pipeline,ferc april,rehearing order.williston petitioned for review under nga b,b.
we review the commission orders under the arbitrary and capricious standard.a see also midwest iso transmission owners ferc.that standard requires that the commission examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle manufacturers ass state farm mutual auto.ins,d quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.the reasoning offered by the commission falls short.
the public interest standard.under the doctrine,where parties have negotiated a natural gas shipment contract that denies either party the right to change prices or charges unilaterally,the commission may abrogate or modify the contract only if the public interest so requires.texaco ferc,see also united gas pipe line mobile gas service.establishing the doctrine for natural gas pipelines fpc sierra pacific power.same for power transmission facilities.williston contends that the commission should have applied that standard.the commission responds that the contract has a memphis clause displacing.
the label memphis clause derives from the supreme court decision in united gas pipe line memphis light,gas water division,d,holding that a contract provision allowing a party to seek a rate adjustment under a suitable provision of the natural gas act for the utility,for the customer obviates the need to apply public interest criterion.the memphis court could see no tenable basis of distinction between the filing of a new rate under of the nga in the absence of a contract and a similar filing under an agreement which explicitly permits it.id.at.thus,a memphis clause simply entitles a party to file for changes under an applicable provision of the nga.see at.see also id.at.
here the contract,after providing that williston could apply to the commission to make changes under of the nga,made a parallel provision for nsp,saying that the agreement should not be construed as in any way affecting nsp rights to intervene,protest or otherwise participate in such proceedings or to seek to initiate proceedings under section of the natural gas act,other provisions thereof,or the ferc rules and regulations thereunder,or any other applicable statute s.williston basin interstate pipeline company ferc gas tariff,rate schedule,art.ix,ex.at,joint appendix.
williston argues that while the provision here empowers nsp to initiate proceedings under of the natural gas act,it fails to specify a controlling standard and thus leaves public interest standard in place.but always leaves parties free to seek change under its stringent standard.thus,as we said in the case of a contract similar to the one at issue here,which permitted filings with the commission but failed to specify a standard,specific acknowledgment of the possibility of future rate change is virtually meaningless unless it envisions a standard.papago tribal utility auth.ferc,see also rehearing order,ferc at noting that williston reading would render the clause useless surplusage.indeed,the clause at issue in memphis itself made no mention of the applicable standard,saying merely that gas was to be delivered under the seller rate schedule or any effective superseding rate schedules,on file with the federal power commission.at.italics omitted see also id.at.
williston next contends that the commission was required to apply the public interest test because the commission did not merely adjust the rate or a term of the service,it invalidated the contract and ordered williston to enter into a new and entirely different kind of contract and service with nsp.petitioner br.in support,williston relies on our decision in exxon mobil ferc,where we accepted as neither arbitrary or capricious the commission finding that,despite the presence of a memphis clause,it could not apply the just and reasonable standard to a pipeline proposal to shift certain shippers from interruptible to firm service,a shift that would have required them to pay a reservation charge.the commission explained that the pipeline plan would effectively have required the customer to take and pay for additional service for which the customer has not contracted.transco.gas pipe line,ferc at.we regarded the commission conclusion as within its discretion.exxon mobil,at.but whereas in exxon mobil the proposed change would have imposed the risk of pipeline underuse on customers not hitherto bearing that risk,here the shift ordered by ferc merely denies the adversely affected party the pipeline the opportunity or part of the opportunity to garner additional revenue from replacement shippers.although the commission may have walked a fine line,it is not one that we could call arbitrary or capricious.accordingly,we reject williston contention that the commission erred in relying on the just and reasonable standard of.
application of the just and reasonable standard.under just and reasonable standard the commission bears the burden of demonstrating that the current rate is unjust and unreasonable and that the replacement rate is just and reasonable.see municipal def.group ferc,consolidated edison ferc.the commission has somewhat mischaracterized the issue at a number of places in its orders and brief.in the rehearing order,for example,it said,what is unduly preferential and unreasonable is for williston to garner revenues from the sale of the capacity nsp has paid for.ferc at.in one sense,to be sure,williston has been garner ing revenues from the sale of the capacity nsp has paid for nsp indeed is paying for specified capacity,at rates calculated to cover williston costs.but nsp engaged the capacity under part,which allowed williston,not nsp,the right to resell unused capacity.thus the contract favors williston position,not nsp,contrary to the commission rhetoric.
second,the commission seems confused about the relationship between its authority and its obligation to explain its policy.it declared in the rehearing order that it is illogical for williston to argue that the commission has the authority to order the conversion,but that it must justify its exercise of that authority as a new policy.id.at see also respondent br.at.regardless of whether the commission policy is new a matter we take up below,a party is perfectly consistent in its reasoning when it recognizes the commission authority,yet demands that the commission articulate the policy well enough so that parties and courts can understand how it arrived at its result.that proposition is almost universally true,but is especially true here,where the commission leading statement of relevant policy,order,deliberately refrained from imposing the mandate that it has imposed here,and it is undisputed that this is the first instance in which the commission has imposed such a mandate.see rehearing order,ferc at acknowledging that the orders here are such a first.
in its request for rehearing,williston challenged the commission to state what it regarded as the appropriate conditions for moving from simply favoring shippers entitlement to capacity release rights to mandating such rights.the commission picked up the gauntlet 
quite simply,the appropriate conditions were the history of williston aggressive interpretation of rate schedule,reflected in its mispricing of the rates thereunder,the unique fact of its affiliation with its largest customer and the protection from transmission competition that the vestigial arrangement offered these entities,the impairment of market health resulting from this diminution of competition,and the rejection by the transporter of alternatives offered at hearing for transitioning to service from,which was the culmination of many years of rebuffing the shipper request to negotiate such a transition.since these elements in the aggregate evidenced obstruction of the commission policy favoring use of capacity by those who pay for it,the appropriate conditions were presented for the commission to act in furtherance of that goal.accordingly,rehearing on the issue of conversion of the service is denied.
points,and appear irrelevant.point seems to suggest that williston choice to litigate an adverse commission rate ruling somehow disentitles it to have its position here examined on the merits.we note that williston picked up a dissent in the litigation,williston basin interstate pipeline ferc,cir,which makes the commission use of this red herring all the more odd.point which is echoed in point seems,in effect,to blame williston for insisting on retaining the rights that the commission itself established under part and left in place in order.but a party resistance to an order can hardly constitute affirmative grounds for issuing the order an agency loose claim of lèse majesté is not a substitute for policy analysis.and point insofar as it goes beyond point repeats the commission oversimplifying remark that nsp has already paid for the capacity.true,but its contract gave williston the rights over unused capacity,and the commission formerly found that arrangement,and part arrangements generally,just and reasonable.
this leaves point,the fact that williston largest customer is its affiliate,and point,the enhancement to competition that would flow from shippers enjoying capacity release.we take the affiliation to be relevant because,even in a world of general open access,the affiliate would not compete with williston in the resale of unused pipeline capacity.at the margin,that presumably enhances the argument for shifting nsp to open access,as it means that the competitive capacity resale market is smaller than one would otherwise expect.but while we clearly see that a capacity resale market with an abundance of independent resellers would be more competitive than one dominated by the pipeline,this was surely just as true when the commission adopted its general policy of not forcing conversion.similarly,while the commission consistently viewed enhanced competition as a generic reason for a preference for capacity release since the policy adoption,it has never hitherto found a case that justified ordering a pipeline to convert at the request of a shipper.because the general policy preference has been a constant,the commission failure to identify the special characteristics applicable to williston,or to explicitly revise its policy,leaves a serious gap in its reasoning.
the commission decisions offered by williston fall somewhat short of showing a clear change in policy.we find it hard to discern much of a policy at all.williston calls our attention to passages in transcontinental gas pipe line,ferc,in which the commission rejected an effort of customers to convert certain service to part.id.at.but the case appears distinguishable in that the pipeline offered testimony indicating that the remedy would compromise the pipeline operation sic flexibility and its ability to perform service in the manner in which it performs such service today.id.at.if one thought that this established a general principle that the commission would mandate conversions to part in the absence of operational problems,one would be wrong.elsewhere in the decision,the commission rejected such a mandate,even while noting and not refuting the customers argument that the pipeline had failed to show operational problems.instead,it relied heavily on exactly the point that williston stressed in order the commission had rejected the idea of entitling part customers to receive capacity release rights.id.at.
williston cites marathon oil trailblazer pipeline,ferc,for a more general commission stated reluctance to override contracts even where is inapplicable and a party proposes action under 
absent a compelling reason,the commission does not believe it should the business and economic decisions between knowledgeable business entities when they enter into negotiated rate contracts.pipelines rely on their contracts and the integrity of the commission process in deciding whether to construct new facilities.as such,the commission is reluctant to upset the expectations of pipelines when they make investment decisions in reliance on the commitments by their customers and the commission approval.
id.at.in the rehearing order,the commission responded to the citation by saying that here the facts presented a compelling reason,ferc at,but the only reason yet revealed is the ubiquitous interest in enhancing competition.moreover,as williston notes without dispute from the commission,it built the mapleton extension in reliance on its contracts with nsp,reliance seemingly indistinguishable from the reliance the commission invoked in marathon for refusing to alter the contract.
in short,however one characterizes prior policy,we do not think the commission has yet articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,as required by state farm,at.
williston also argued that the order would be quite costly for williston and its customers.as to the customers,the commission said that until williston filed a new rate case there would be no effect on customers,see order,ferc at.this is typically true,of course,but is hardly a reason for refusing to anticipate looming developments.
as to the immediate impact on williston,the commission said that conversion to service would yield a gain of approximately to per year for nsp and a loss of only about for williston which it viewed as trivial.see rehearing order,ferc at.the commission nowhere atte
