defendants,who are lessors of a gas station,appeal from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york spatt,preliminarily enjoining them from ousting their tenant,plaintiff koylum,the operator of the station.the defendants contend that under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,et,the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over koylum suit,and,in the alternative,that the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction.
because we conclude that the pmpa provides jurisdiction over koylum suit and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction under the pmpa lenient standard,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
koylum has operated a gas station in ridge,new york,since may.the station was previously operated by koylum assignor,rbp enterprises,under two agreements the lease agreement,dated january,under which koylum assignor leased the premises from the predecessor in interest of defendant peksen realty peksen and the supply agreement,also dated january,fixing the terms under which koylum assignor would purchase its gasoline supplies from ocean petroleum,ocean.both agreements expire on december.the supply agreement permitted ocean to designate a substitute supplier.it also authorized koylum assignor to use the brand names and trademarks designated by ocean in connection with the sale of fuel.peksen and ocean are affiliated with one another both are closely held corporations owned by refik and mine peksen who are husband and wife.
a.the december rider to the supply agreement 
on december,ocean and koylum assignor agreed to an alteration of the supply agreement the rider.the rider required ocean to quote the next day prices for gasoline and permitted koylum assignor to purchase gasoline from any other open market supplier of gasoline if ocean quoted prices were above the prices specified by a formula.the rider required i that koylum assignor document its calculations justifying its exercise of the option to purchase from another supplier,and ii that the transport of fuel by any supplier from all terminals in the long island and metropolitan area to the station be made by national petroleum transporters at a specified rate.
in may,by assignment koylum became the lessee under the lease agreement.in august,in order to take advantage of the favorable price restriction formula and option to purchase gasoline from another supplier contained in the rider,koylum,with ocean consent,obtained the assignment of the supply agreement.
ocean,which has since been liquidated in bankruptcy,was an authorized distributor for coastal refinement corporation coastal and sold coastal brand products to koylum for resale at the station.it is undisputed that ocean was authorized by coastal to use the coastal mark,that ocean permitted koylum to use the coastal mark in connection with its operation of the station,and that the station was operated as a coastal gas station.no express mention was made of the coastal mark in any of the written agreements between koylum and ocean or peksen.
b.the october notice of termination 
the relationship between koylum and deteriorated.koylum asserts that ocean frequently failed to supply it with a price list for petroleum products as required by the rider koylum turned to other suppliers for fuel,including brand suppliers.in august,koylum sent a letter to remind ocean that it was required under the rider to send the next day gasoline prices.ocean responded by letter in september advising koylum that the rider required documentation supporting a claim for excessive pricing that would permit koylum to purchase gasoline from other suppliers.ocean also reminded koylum that all products delivered to the station were to be transported by national petroleum transporters at the rate indicated in the rider.ocean letter warned koylum that you have failed to adhere to these requirements and continuance of these actions will cause a default of your supply agreement as well as your lease agreement.
in july,ocean apparently encountered difficulty in obtaining supplies of gasoline from the coastal refinery and instead supplied koylum with fuel from other sources,including brand suppliers.koylum asserts that it purchased gasoline in september because ocean failed to send price lists on a daily basis or because the prices quoted by ocean were higher than the price restriction formula contained in the rider.koylum purchases resulted in attempt to terminate the agreements between the parties.
by letter dated october,peksen informed koylum that it would terminate the lease agreement as of midnight october.by a substantially similar letter also dated october,ocean notified koylum that it would terminate the supply agreement at the same time.the letters asserted that koylum violated the supply agreement and the lease agreement by,among other things,
purchasing unbranded gasoline from unauthorized suppliers and selling it under the coastal trademark and brand name 
causing gasoline from an unauthorized source to be mixed in the station underground tanks with gasoline supplied by ocean and 
using and occupying the station for the sale of gasoline not approved by ocean and peksen.
the notices also asserted that koylum purchases of unbranded gasoline for sale under the coastal brand name constituted trademark infringement,unfair competition under the lanham act,and false advertising and trademark dilution under new york law.
on october,peksen filed a petition in suffolk county district court to oust koylum from the premises as a holdover that remains on the premises after the expiration of the lease without any vested right to remain.see bay west realty christy,misc d,jur d real and related actions,at.koylum counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment allowing it to continue to occupy the premises.koylum secured a stay of the holdover action,which remained in place by stipulation of the parties.
ocean bankruptcy 
on october,coastal canceled ocean right to use its trademarks and terminated its agreement to sell petroleum products to ocean,effective february.ocean did not advise koylum of the cancellation.on november,ocean filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.
in january,ocean elected before the bankruptcy court to reject its executory supply agreement with koylum.on february,koylum filed a claim against ocean in bankruptcy court for rejection damages based on the rejection of the supply agreement.
at some time in january,koylum removed all coastal logos and marks at its station.koylum asserts that it did this on the advice of counsel in order to avoid further charges that it was violating coastal trademark.
ocean voluntarily converted its bankruptcy case to a chapter liquidation proceeding and ceased operating on june.
d.the january notice of termination and the sale of the premises to ridge realty.
by letter dated january,peksen again notified koylum that its lease was terminated on the ground that koylum sold gasoline purchased from another supplier.peksen then filed a new holdover petition,which was dismissed in march because of the stay entered in october.
on may,without giving koylum prior notice,peksen sold the station to ridge realty ridge.ridge promptly filed another petition to oust koylum as a holdover tenant,followed by a claim for unpaid rent reasserting the grounds advanced by peksen in its two previous holdover petitions against koylum.ridge holdover petition was dismissed in july,apparently on the theory that the subsequent nonpayment petition served to reinstate the lease.
ii.koylum initiation of this action and its motion for preliminary injunction 
in july,koylum filed this suit pursuant to the pmpa,which generally forbids a franchisor from terminating a franchise prior to its expiration date without justification.see,koylum contended that peksen had no cause to terminate the franchise,because the portions of the franchise agreement that peksen claimed koylum had violated concerning the purchase of gasoline from suppliers other than ocean had been superceded by the rider.therefore,koylum maintained,there were no proper grounds for termination,and peksen actions were unlawful.the complaint sought declaratory relief to that effect.it also asserted that the sale of the premises to ridge violated provisions of the pmpa requiring peksen to give koylum notice of the sale and a right of first refusal to purchase the premises.see b d iii requiring under certain circumstances that franchisor make a bona fide offer to sell the leased premises to franchisee or to grant franchisee a right of first refusal.koylum sought as ultimate relief to compel peksen to rescind the sale of the gas station to ridge and to grant koylum the right of first refusal to purchase the leased premises.simultaneously,koylum moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining ridge or peksen from pursuing holdover or proceedings in state court.see id.b.
a.the magistrate judge report and recommendation 
magistrate judge pohorelsky,to whom the district court referred the motion,recommended that the district court enter a preliminary injunction to bar the defendants from continuing proceedings in state court to oust koylum until the federal proceeding was finally determined.the magistrate judge recommended that koylum be permitted to continue in possession of the premises subject to the provisions of the january,lease agreement.
the magistrate judge found that,on the facts presented,the relationship among koylum,peksen,and ocean constituted a franchise relationship,bringing it within the scope of the federal jurisdiction established by the pmpa.he rejected ridge argument that the pmpa did not apply because the marks of a specific refiner were not identified in either agreement.the pmpa specifically permits contracts to be oral and it was undisputed that ocean orally authorized koylum to use coastal marks in connection with the sale of gasoline products.while recognizing that this was not dispositive,the magistrate judge noted that the parties expressly agreed in the supply agreement that their agreement constitutes a franchise relationship pursuant to the pmpa.
the magistrate judge recommended that the court exercise its discretion to grant preliminary injunctive relief.recognizing that the standard for injunctive relief under the pmpa is lenient,he analyzed the test for injunctive relief under the statute.see b.
as to the first prong of the showing that the franchise has been terminated,see id.b a i there was no dispute that peksen was seeking to terminate the relationship with koylum.as to the second there were sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make such questions a fair ground for magistrate judge concluded there were serious questions as to the propriety of the termination presenting a fair ground for litigation.see id.b a ii.he rejected peksen argument that koylum undisputed purchase and sale of unbranded gasoline was,without more,a proper basis for termination,because he found the rider ambiguous as to whether koylum was permitted in the circumstances to do so.in light of the ambiguities of the rider,and ocean delivery of unbranded gasoline to koylum for sale under the coastal mark,the magistrate judge found that it was not unreasonable for koylum to believe that it was authorized to purchase and sell unbranded gasoline.peksen argued before the magistrate judge that koylum failure to provide documentary justification for its purchases from other suppliers,and its failure to use national petroleum transporters to deliver gasoline independently justified termination.the magistrate judge nonetheless found serious questions as to the propriety of the termination,first because these purported grounds were arguably not breaches supporting termination and,in any event,peksen had not given notice of these grounds in any of the termination notices as required by the pmpa.
as to the third balance of hardships,see id.b b the magistrate judge found the hardship imposed on peksen and ridge by maintenance of the status quo to be less than the hardship that would fall on koylum if evicted.with respect to ridge,the magistrate judge found no significant hardship imposed on it resulting from continuation of koylum possession and use of the station until adjudication of the dispute,because i ridge was still entitled to receive rent from koylum under the existing lease and had offered no evidence to substantiate its ability to use the property more profitably,and ii ridge purchased the property with full knowledge of the dispute between koylum and peksen,and koylum eviction from its tenancy would,of course,end its ability to do business.
b.the district court grant of a preliminary injunction 
ridge and peksen filed objections to the report and recommendation,all of which were overruled by the district court.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety and entered a preliminary injunction against peksen and ridge.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
peksen and ridge contend that there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction under the pmpa because no franchise within the meaning of the pmpa has ever existed and no franchise existed at the time of koylum suit due to ocean bankruptcy and rejection of the supply agreement.
peksen and ridge also contend that,even if the pmpa does apply,the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.they advance three reasons the lenient standard for preliminary injunction under the pmpa does not apply because koylum is not seeking to compel continuation or renewal of a franchise relationship peksen and ridge have been prejudiced by koylum failure to seek injunctive relief upon receipt of the october,or the january,termination notices and because koylum acquiesced to the end of the franchise relationship by removing or covering over coastal signs on its premises and koylum conduct in selling gasoline amounted to a fraud on the public,so that there was not a serious question of the reasonableness of the termination.
we conclude that there is federal subject matter jurisdiction over koylum suit,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction.
subject matter jurisdiction under the pmpa.
was there a pmpa franchise 
relying on merlino getty petroleum,cir,the defendants contend these facts do not involve a franchise within the meaning of the pmpa.consequently,they argue,the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.in merlino,we affirmed the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the defendant distributor owned and controlled the trademark used in connection with the sale of fuel at the gas station operated by the plaintiff,a retailer.we concluded that the act does not reach the trademark arrangements of entities such as who control their own trademarks.id.at.because ocean was a distributor,not a refiner,and because the supply agreement gave ocean the right to designate any brand names and trademarks or none at all for fuel sold at the station,the defendants argue that subject matter jurisdiction under the pmpa is similarly lacking.
we disagree.the relationship created by the supply agreement falls under the statute definition of a franchise.the statute provides several definitions of franchise,including any contract 
between a distributor and a retailer,under which a refiner or distributor as the case may be authorizes or permits a retailer or distributor to use,in connection with the sale,consignment,or distribution of motor fuel,a trademark which is owned or controlled by such refiner or by a refiner which supplies motor fuel to the distributor which authorizes or permits such use.
a iv.we recognized in merlino that this provision included the case where a defendant distributor supplied petroleum products for resale under a trademark owned or controlled by a refiner.we stated the term franchise includes not only contracts where one of the parties is a refiner,but also contracts solely between distributors and retailers,if the distributor authorizes the retailer to sell motor fuel under a trademark which is owned or controlled by a refiner which supplies motor fuel to the distributor merlino,at quoting a.the alter
