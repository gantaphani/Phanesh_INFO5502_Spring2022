the united states district court for the western district of texas issued a preliminary injunction in favor of flow control corporation.after construing claims of patent the patent,the trial court determined that had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement action against velan.flow control velan,civil action no,slip op.at preliminary injunction order.because the district court erred in its construction of the term adjustable,this court vacates the preliminary injunction and remands.
as described in the patent,petroleum refineries recover valuable products from the heavy residual oil that is a byproduct of the refining process.patent,ll.that recovery process is known as delayed coking.id.delayed coking heats the liquid petroleum residue to very high temperatures and then feeds the heated residue into a coke drum.in the drum,cracking and polymerization converts the liquid residue into valuable distillates and solid coke.id.a typical coke drum might be feet high and feet in diameter with openings at the top and bottom.these openings have large,flanged metal plates known as heads.when the drum is full,the operators purge the byproducts and the drum.during,the operators manually remove the top and bottom heads to remove the solid coke.id.is both difficult and dangerous.coke drums are very hot and the heads can weigh four tons.during removal,heated residues and coke can spill out and injure nearby workers.id.
patent claims a system and a method that the coke drum without manually removing the heads.patent,ll.instead,the system of the patent includes a dual seated,linear motion,blind gate valve,a valve.id.the upper and lower seats have aligned circular openings that make a single hole at,for example,the bottom of the coke drum.the blind moves linearly,horizontally between the two seats to open and close the hole at the base of the coke drum.
figure of a related patent,patent the patent shows this type of valve attached to a coke drum.figure of the patent,also reproduced below,shows the internal details of the valve in these figures,the valve has a body and upper and lower seats,and.the upper and lower seats and are large metal rings whose openings line up to form a single hole.the upper seat is a dynamic,live loaded seat,while the lower seat is static.patent,ll.although not shown in figure,the blind,element in figure,moves laterally within element.when the blind moves to the left,it opens the hole between seats and.thus,when the circular opening in the blind lines up with the openings in the seats,the blind is open.
the patent describes the upper and lower seats,with reference to figure,as follows 
in the preferred embodiment,the static seat is a one piece seat that is securely fastened to valve and is preferably in contrast to the static seat,dynamic,live loaded seat is a moveable and adjustable seat that is energized from without the process stream via live seat adjustment mechanism.the function of the dynamic,live loaded seat is to provide point to point fine tuning of the system,and particularly the blind as it is sealed between upper and lower seats and.
patent,ll.thus,as the blind moves between the top and bottom seats,the dynamic,live loaded seat closest to the drum interior exerts force downward on the blind.the invention adjusts that force to allow linear movement of the blind between the seats while keeping a tight seal on the drum.see id.at,ll.in the preferred embodiment,the invention accomplishes this vital adjustment with an adjustment mechanism the circled element in the portion of figure.id.at,ll.the adjustment mechanism of the patent functions to facilitate operation of the system.see,id.at,ll.
on december,sued velan,claiming that a velan valve infringed the patent.on march,sought a preliminary injunction to prevent velan from launching a new valve at an upcoming industry conference,alleging infringement of claims,and of the patent.velan valves do not include adjustment mechanisms like those disclosed in the patent.instead,velan valves include upper dynamic,live loaded seats with internal biasing springs.these springs modulate the pressure on the seat to allow the blind to move.velan designed its seats to allow replacement of these biasing springs.to change the biasing force in velan dynamic,live loaded seats,an operator must replace these internal biasing springs.thus,velan system envisions removal of the valves from the coke drum.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.
claim of the patent recites 
a coke drum bottom system comprising 
at least one coke drum containing manufactured coke therein,said at least one coke drum having a flanged bottom orifice 
a valve removably coupled to said coke drum to facilitate the removal of said coke from said at least one coke drum by said at least one coke drum,said valve comprising 
a main body having an sic flanged orifice therein for removably coupling said valve to said flanged bottom orifice of said coke drum 
an upper and lower bonnet coupled to said main body 
an adjustable dynamic,live loaded seat coupled to said main body 
a static seat coupled to said main body in opposition to said dynamic,live loaded seat and 
a blind coupled to said main body and actuated by an actuator,said blind capable of moving in a manner within said valve between said dynamic,live loaded and static seats to control the opening and closing of said valve,said blind providing a seal between said dynamic,live loaded seat and said static seat,said coke drum is,thus preparing said coke drum for the removal of said coke,by actuating said blind from a closed,sealed position,to an open position thereby causing said coke that has accumulated on said blind and within said valve to be sheared from said blind.
patent,claim emphasis added.
according to the trial court,the term adjustable in claim means that the bias force on the live loaded seat can be changed in a manner that is not limited by any time,place,manner,or means of adjustment.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.based on that construction,the trial court concluded that had shown a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim,slip op.at.the trial court observed that velan can adjust the bias force by replacing the springs in its valve.id.after further considering irreparable harm,the balance of hardships,and the public interest,the district court granted motion for a preliminary injunction,slip op.at.velan appeals.
the grant of a preliminary injunction under is within the discretion of the district court.this court reviews a preliminary injunction decision for an abuse of discretion.gillette energizer holdings,citing novo nordisk of,genentech.the court determination can be overturned only on a showing that it abused its discretion,committed an error of law,or seriously misjudged the evidence.we care,int l,citing robertson,united steel deck.this court reviews claim construction without deference.collegenet,applyyourself,citing cybor fas,en banc markman westview instruments,aff,d.
the trial court claim construction followed a logical path.the court first set forth the ordinary meaning of adjustable capable of making a change to something or capable of being changed.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.the court then determined that a narrower construction of adjustable would be inconsistent with other claims in the patent,which recite an adjustment mechanism that allows adjustment while the device is in use or operation.id.at.in other words,the district court relied on claim differentiation during its claim construction.finally,the district court explained that any construction of the term adjustable that requires the presence of the adjustment mechanism disclosed in the patent would be an impermissible narrowing of that claim term to the structure of the preferred embodiment.
while logical,this chain of reasoning errs because it places too much emphasis on the ordinary meaning of adjustable without adequate grounding of that term within the context of the specification of the patent.moreover,to the extent this reasoning relies on claim differentiation,it misapplies that limited tool of claim constru
