background 
claims are rooted in the contamination of their property in iberia parish,allegedly caused by chevron predecessor texaco while it was engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas.and chevron were parties to an oil and gas lease relating to the property,which terminated,at the latest calculation,in august.four wells were established on the property,the claims in this case relate to well well,the only well that was productive for chevron the well was plugged and abandoned in october.
have used the property for sugar cane farming since the.at the time that they began farming,were concerned that crops would not grow on a small piece of their property.after bringing their concerns to chevron,entered into a release of claims associated with the well and any pit,tank battery,or other piece of equipment associated with the well the release,for consideration of approximately.it is undisputed that chevron activities on the property ended no later than.
filed this action in june in louisiana state court.sought to recover compensatory and punitive damages from chevron,estis well service,llc estis,and jack martin,martin collectively,defendants for contamination of their property located in iberia parish,louisiana.are citizens of louisiana,as are estis and martin.chevron is not.allege that they are lessors,assigns,successors in interest to certain oil,gas,and mineral leases with chevron.alleged that defendants conducted participated in various oil and gas exploration and production activities on land including their property,causing ongoing property damage and various forms of emotional distress.

discussion 
diversity jurisdiction 
a determination that a party is improperly joined and the denial of a motion for remand to state court are questions of law reviewed de novo.mcdonal abbott,cir.however,this court reviews a district court procedure for determining improper joinder only for abuse of discretion.guillory ppg,cir.
argue that the district court erred by piercing the pleadings and dismissing martin because neither party presented summary evidence related to whether they had any possibility of prevailing against martin,and chevron therefore did not meet its burden to show improper joinder chevron argues that martin was properly dismissed because,petition fails to state a claim against martin under louisiana law.chevron further points to the absence of allegations or evidence presented by to show how martin was connected to their property such that he faced any liability for the alleged contamination.
there are two bases on which the district court might determine that a plaintiff improperly joined a defendant to defeat subject matter jurisdiction actual fraud in the plaintiff pleading of jurisdictional facts,or inability to establish a cause of action.campbell stone,cir.under the second prong the test is whether the defendant has demonstrated that there is no possibility of recovery by the plaintiff against an defendant,which stated differently means that there is no reasonable basis for the district court to predict that the plaintiff might be able to recover against an defendant.smallwood.cent,cir en banc.this means that there must be a reasonable possibility of recovery,not merely a theoretical one.campbell,at quoting ross citifinancial,cir.the burden of persuasion on a party claiming improper joinder is a heavy one.id.
the district court concluded that failed to state a claim against martin,relying largely on canter koehring,so d,and ford elsbury,cir discussing liability of a under louisiana law and applying canter.in canter,the louisiana supreme court held that an employee could only be held personally liable for injuries to third persons where the employer owed a duty of care to the third person,breach of which caused the damage for which recovery is sought that duty was delegated by the employer to the defendant the defendant employee breached his duty through personal not technical or vicarious fault and the employee had a personal duty toward the injured third party,the breach of which specifically caused the third party damages.canter,so d at.further,with regard to the accused employee personal fault,personal liability can not be imposed upon the employee simply because of his general administrative responsibility for some function of employment.id.
the district court found suit distinguishable from ford.in ford,the plaintiffs sued a chemical plant and certain individual defendants,including the plant manager.at.the defendants removed,alleging the manager,among other defendants,was improperly joined.this court concluded the ford plaintiffs did have a reasonable possibility of recovery against the plant manager,where the facts showed that the plant manger knew of the leak that lead to the explosion.id.at.here,the district court concluded that,in contrast to ford,made only general and unsupported allegations that martin breached a personal duty owed to them without pleading facts establishing what that actionable,managerial duty might be.the district court concluded that the allegations in complaint and motion to remand were not enough to establish a canter duty.
argues that the district court abused its discretion by piercing the pleadings regarding martin and improperly shifted the evidentiary burden from chevron to.further asserts that its petition sufficiently alleges a claim against martin under the requirements of canter chevron argues that the district court conducted its analysis properly and that it correctly concluded that would not be able to recover against martin under louisiana law.we acknowledge that it is less than clear from the passage of the district court order denying remand whether the district court engaged in a rule b style analysis,a summary inquiry after piercing the pleadings,or both,in arriving at its conclusion that joinder of martin was improper however,we need not parse the order to determine which it is.
we agree with the district court that conclusory allegations do not establish a reasonable possibility of recovery against martin under canter,although on different reasoning.see united states ex rel.farmer city of houston,cir i t is an elementary proposition,and the supporting cases too numerous to cite,that this court may affirm the district court judgment on any grounds supported by the record.significantly,this court has held that canter liability to third persons for the negligence of corporate officers and employees may only be imposed for bodily injury claims.unimobil,spurney,cir see ford,at noting canter outlines circumstances where an employee could be held individually liable for injuries to third persons.because the only injury alleged in kling petition is economic and to its property and various forms of mental would not have a basis for recovery against martin under louisiana law as it has been interpreted in this circuit.see unimobil,at also hibernia cmty.dev,cmty.servs.group,d,applying bodily injury distinction announced in unimobil 
because had no reasonable possibility of recovery against martin,there was complete diversity between and chevron,and the court properly denied the motion to remand and retained diversity jurisdiction to hear the case see guillory,at.
ii.prescription 
because the district court had proper subject matter jurisdiction over suit,we turn to the issue of whether chevron was entitled to summary judgment.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard on appeal that is applicable in the district court.terrebonne parish sch.bd.mobil oil,cir.summary judgment may be granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate,all of the evidence and all of the factual inferences from the evidence are viewed in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.terrebonne parish,at.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the record,taken as a whole,could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.id.
ordinarily,the party pleading prescription bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff claims have prescribed.in re moses,so d.however,because more than a year has elapsed between the time of the tortious conduct and the filing of the tort suit,the burden shifts to to demonstrate prescription was suspended or interrupted.id.assert that either or both the doctrine of contra non valentem and the theory of continuing tort suspend or interrupt prescription in this case.
doctrine of contra non valentem 
first argue that the court erred in granting summary judgment based on prescription because material issues of fact are in dispute regarding the reasonableness of their delay in filing suit under the doctrine of contra non valentem.specifically,argue that there is a factual dispute about when they became fully aware of the extent and kind of contamination on their land,and thus of their right to sue.chevron responds that had knowledge for decades of alleged contamination of the property and its lack of productivity,could not rely on contra non valentem to avoid the running of prescription.chevron further argues that contra non valentem is inapplicable because of the testimonial and documentary evidence that knew since the that the soil surrounding the well would not sustain crop growth.
the doctrine of contra non valentem was created by the louisiana courts as an exception to the general rules of prescription.wimberly gatch,so d.damage is considered to have been sustained only when it has manifested itself with sufficient certainty to support accrual of a cause of action.the doctrine of contra non valentem prevents the running of liberative prescription where the cause of action is not known or reasonably knowable by the plaintiff.cole celotex,so d,see also eldredge martin marietta,cir.louisiana recognizes four situations where contra non valentem applies.causby perque floor covering,so d.the two at issue here are where the debtor has done some act effectually to prevent the creditor from availing himself of his cause of action and where the cause of action is not known or reasonably knowable by the plaintiff even though plaintiff ignorance is not induced by the defendant.id.
when prescription begins to run depends on the reasonableness of inaction.see cole,so d at see also terrebonne parish sch,at.as a judicial exception to the statutory rule of prescription,louisiana courts strictly construe contra non valentem and only extend its benefits up to the time that the plaintiff has actual or constructive knowledge of the tortious act.eldredge,at affirming summary judgment of prescription where plaintiff noticed damage to land from company actions,yet took no further legal steps to stop the tort until two decades later.allege that chevron misled them about the kind and extent of contamination when they raised the issue of soil damage in.they further allege that the damage was not reasonably knowable and unknown until within a year of filing the present suit.
we conclude that contra non valentem is inapplicable to suit.there is no evidence in the record showing that chevron was aware of increasing contamination from salt or otherwise after the release or acted to prevent from availing themselves of their cause of action in a timely manner.in addition to those contamination problems were aware of at the time of the release,walet also testified in deposition about his history of farming on the subject property and knowledge of low yields and crop problems over the years since the well was plugged.documents from a former representative mentioned chevron dumping salt water,oily,chemicals,on the property and concerns about the virtually zero productivity of the land.as early as the,had information sufficient to excite attention and prompt further inquiry,yet did not investigate or bring their claims until now.see eldredge,at.
continuing tort 
further argue that a continuing tort has suspended the running of prescription.specifically,argue that the pollution of their land,like dumping foreign materials onto the property of another without authority,constitutes a continuing trespass or nuisance.chevron responds that there is no continuing tort in this case because the alleged tortious conduct ceased by the when well operation ceased and the final release of the lease at issue was recorded.
when the tortious cause of injury is a continuing one,under louisiana law prescription does not begin to run until the conduct causing that damage ceases.bustamento tucker,so d.when the damaging conduct continues,prescription runs from the date of the last harmful act.south cent.bell.texaco,so d.knowledge of their claim is immaterial to the running of prescription in the case of continuing torts.scott am.tobacco,so d.
louisiana courts have recognized that in some instances the unlawful invasion of another property by hazardous waste falls in the category of continuing trespass.see south cent.bell,so d at holding prescription did not begin to run on tort claim by owner of underground gas tanks at filling station for damages sustained by underground telephone cables by gas leaking from the tanks until the leaking tanks were replaced.argue that chevron deposited such waste on their property in connection with its oil exploration,that chevron no longer had permission to keep waste on their property once the lease was terminated,and this continuing failure to clean up the waste is the continuing tort.see farms,ville platte,so d,t he trespass continues as long as the offending object remains on the premises,and the trespass is terminated only by the removal of the object wrongfully placed there.
however,a continuing tort is occasioned by unlawful acts,not the continuation of the ill effects of an original,wrongful act.crump sabine river,so d,continuing tort theory did not apply where property owner sued river authority claiming that canal dug on authority property by third parties diverted water from the bayou flowing over the owner property.f or there to be a continuing tort there must be a continuing duty owed to the plaintiff and a continuing breach of that duty by the defendant.crump,so d at.here,the well was plugged and abandoned on october.entered into the release with chevron after chevron restored the property to its original condition.because the release contained a window for claims,prescription began to run three years after the date of the release.
further,the breach of the duty to right a wrong and make the plaintiff whole simply can not be a continuing wrong which suspends the running of prescription,as that is the purpose of any lawsuit and the obligation of every tortfeasor.id.louisiana law distin
