the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma granted summary judgment of noninfringement to weatherford international,weatherford.frank casing crew rental tools,weatherford int l,no.may.the district court determined that weatherford stabmaster,a remotely controlled casing stabbing device mounted in a derrick,does not infringe frank casing crew rental tools,frank patent the patent.because the district court correctly decided that the means for selectively pivoting clause must necessarily include a lift plate located under the boom not present in the stabmaster,this court affirms.
the patent,entitled device for positioning and stabbing casing from a remote selectively variable location,claims a system for handling,positioning and stabbing sections of well casing suspended within a derrick during oil field operations.patent,ll.well casing lines a well bore to facilitate removal of oil or gas.during completion of a well,the derrick suspends sections of casing from a pulley,known as a crown block,and then lowers the section for connection to another casing section already in the well bore.id.at,ll.the test of engineering skill is to align and connect the sections properly.id.at,ll.because the sections of casing may be up to inches in diameter and weigh pounds per foot,manual alignment is difficult and poses a risk of injury.id.at,ll,ll,ll.the patent addresses these problems with a remotely controlled device for aligning the casing sections.
the patent stabbing apparatus is less bulky than prior art devices.thus,the system mounts the apparatus on the derrick without interfering with other operations.id.at.the patent teaches that the invention has at least three major interconnectable subassemblies which can be easily taken apart to facilitate transport,storage and operative mounting of the entire apparatus at a selected location in a drilling derrick and above the floor of the derrick.id.at,ll.additionally,the invention has an extendable boom which carries jaws at one end for engaging the casing,and which is hydraulically movable in an pivoting motion or in a motion,or both such motions simultaneously.id.at,ll.
the claimed stabbing apparatus thus raises and lowers the boom holding the casing section.the preferred embodiment for performing this function includes a hydraulic piston and cylinder subassembly,which is connected to the boom through a plate structure made up of a diagonal boom plate,a forwardly extending boom plate,and a lateral lift plate which are shown in figures and,reproduced below.id.at,ll.
when not in use,an operator may lift the stabbing apparatus up out of the way by activating the boom.frank asserted claims,and against weatherford,each of which involves pivoting the boom up and down but does not require yawing movement.
claim,for instance,states 
a system for making up a vertically extending string of interconnected casing sections comprising 
a derrick bracket subassembly detachably connected to a side of said derrick 
a boom and jaw subassembly detachably connected to said derrick bracket subassembly,and including 
means for selectively pivoting said boom about said horizontal axis to raise and lower the second end of said boom which carries said jaws,and to elevate said boom to a location where it extends in a generally vertical direction 
a remote control assembly detachably connected to said boom and jaw subassembly 
id.at,emphasis added.while none of the foregoing claims requires yawing,other claims of the patent do include such a limitation.id.at,ll.claim,ll.claim,ll.claim,ll.claim.
the parties presented the trial court two limitations for claim construction means for selectively pivoting said boom about said horizontal axis to raise and lower the second end of said boom which carries said jaws,and to elevate said boom to a location where it extends in a generally vertical direction and detachably.frank casing crew rental tools,weatherford int l,no,slip.op.at.july.the parties and the district court agreed that the means for selectively pivoting limitation is in format,governed by.the parties also agreed on the function of the limitation,namely selectively pivoting said boom about said horizontal axis to raise and lower the second end of said boom which carries said jaws,and to elevate said boom to a location where it extends in a generally vertical direction.patent,ll.the parties disputed,however,the structure corresponding to the claimed function disclosed in the specification.for frank,the corresponding structure is the piston and cylinder subassembly for weatherford,the structure includes the lift and boom plates disclosed in the preferred embodiment of the invention.the district court agreed with weatherford 
the means for selectively pivoting must necessarily include a lift plate located under the boom.the boom rests on the lift plate,and the boom is not connected to the lift plate.the boom moves across the lift plate.the boom is raised and lowered by a piston and cylinder that operate against the lift plate,and not directly against the boom.
frank casing crew,no,slip.op.at.july.frank disagrees,arguing the district court improperly imported structure unnecessary to perform the recited function of pivoting the boom about the horizontal axis.instead,as noted,frank asserts that the relevant corresponding structure is the piston and cylinder subassembly.
in reaching its interpretation,the district court also examined the prosecution history of the patent.id.the patent is a continuation of application ser,which issued as patent the patent.during prosecution of the patent,the examiner required the applicant to distinguish the invention from the casing handling device described in patent issued to swoboda,et swoboda.the swoboda device used a cylinder attached and under the boom for the lifting function.to distinguish the swoboda device,the applicant noted that its position compromises its use a lifting cylinder,located directly below the boom and directly connected thereto,that includes a yawing piston and cylinder subassembly which extends at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of the boom,and is attached at one end to a different part of the boom and jaw subassembly,and can cause the boom to cant or swing from,simply can not be used.may,amendment in response to march,pto action in application,at emphasis in original amendment.in other words,a lifting cylinder directly connected to and located below the boom can not be used with the patent.the applicant also argued that the spatial and positioning limitation in swoboda is overcome in the present invention by connecting the cylinder which lifts the boom not directly to the boom,but by connecting it indirectly to the boom through securement to the lifting plate.id.emphasis in original.
with respect to the claim term detachably,frank would give the word no special meaning,but read it to include no limitation involving the ease of detachability.conversely,weatherford argued detachably should be limited to parts that can be easily and quickly taken apart or disconnected.the district court ruled detachably means that the component or subassembly in question may be readily disconnected.frank casing crew,no,slip.op.at.july.
following the district court claim construction,frank filed a motion for summary judgment of infringement.weatherford filed a cross motion for summary judgment of.in granting summary judgment of no literal infringement,the district court found that no reasonable jury could find an insubstantial difference between the two raising and lowering mechanisms of claims,and,and of weatherford stabmaster.frank casing crew,no,slip.op.at.may.the court concluded the two mechanisms represent two distinct structural approaches to performing essentially the same function and e ach approach has its advantages and disadvantages.id.the district court also found no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents for the same reasons and no literal infringement under.finally,the district court expressly noted that the raising and lowering mechanism of the stabmaster was not based on technology.id.the district court also held that the prosecution h
