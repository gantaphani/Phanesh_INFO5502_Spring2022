defendant donald blankenship defendant,former chairman and chief executive officer of massey energy company massey,makes four arguments related to his conviction for conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws and regulations.after careful review,we conclude the district court committed no reversible error.accordingly,we affirm.
this case arises from a tragic accident on april,at the upper big branch coal mine in montcoal,west virginia,which caused the death of miners.massey owned and operated the upper big branch mine.
in the years leading up to the accident,the federal mine safety health administration the mine safety administration repeatedly cited massey for violations at the upper big branch mine of the mine safety health act of,et the mine safety act,and its implementing regulations in alone,the mine safety administration identified violations at the upper big branch mine.indeed,in the months preceding the april accident,the upper big branch mine received the serious safety citations of any mine in the united states.many of these violations related to improper ventilation and accumulation of combustible materials problems that were key contributing factors to the accident.defendant was aware of the violations at the upper big branch mine in the years leading up to the accident,receiving daily reports showing the numerous citations for safety violations at the mine.
not only did defendant receive daily reports of the safety violations,beginning in,but defendant also received warnings from a senior massey safety official about the serious risks posed by the violations at upper big branch.and the safety official informed defendant that t he attitude at many massey operations is if you can get the footage,we can pay the fines.evidence suggested that defendant had fostered this attitude by directing mine supervisors to focus on run ning coal rather than safety compliance and to forego construction of safety systems.defendant also told the massey employee in charge of the upper big branch mine that safety violations were the cost of doing business and that it was cheaper to break the safety laws and pay the fines than to spend what would be necessary to follow the safety laws.
notwithstanding the numerous citations and warnings,defendant had a policy to invariably press for more production even at mines that he knew were struggling to keep up with the safety laws.for example,defendant directed the supervisor of upper big branch to reopen a mine section to production even though it lacked a legal return airway.additionally,massey employees advised defendant that the lack of adequate staff was a key factor in the high number of safety violations at upper big branch.contrary to this advice,massey reduced staff at the upper big branch mine less than two months before the accident,a decision that defendant would have had to approve given his close supervision of mine operations and staffing.
on november,a federal grand jury indicted defendant for conspiring to willfully violate federal mine safety laws and regulations conspiring to defraud federal mine safety regulators making false statements to the securities exchange commission regarding massey safety compliance and engaging in securities fraud.the grand jury issued a superseding indictment the superseding indictment on march,which combined the conspiracy counts into a single,conspiracy charge and included additional factual allegations.following a trial,a jury convicted defendant of conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws and acquitted him of the remaining indicted offenses.the district court sentenced defendant to one year imprisonment and assessed a fine,both of which were the maximum permitted by law.defendant timely appealed.
on appeal,defendant argues that the district court erroneously concluded that the superseding indictment sufficiently alleged a violation of section d improperly denied defendant the opportunity to engage in examination of an alleged incorrectly instructed the jury regarding the meaning of willfully in d,which makes it a misdemeanor for a mine operator to willfully violate federal mine safety laws and regulations and incorrectly instructed the jury as to the government burden of proof.we address each argument in turn.
first,defendant argues that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss his indictment.when,as here,a defendant challenges the sufficiency of an indictment prior to verdict,we review the sufficiency of the indictment de novo,apply ing a heightened scrutiny to ensure that every essential element of an offense has been charged.united states perry,cir.quoting united states kingrea,cir.
to satisfy the fifth and sixth amendments,a n indictment must contain the elements of the offense charged,fairly inform a defendant of the charge,and enable the defendant to plead double jeopardy as a defense in a future prosecution for the same offense.id.under this standard,i t is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself,as long as those words of themselves fully,directly,and expressly,without any uncertainty or ambiguity,set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.id.quoting hamling united states.to the extent an indictment relies on a general description based on the statutory language,the indictment also should include a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense,coming under the general description.id.quoting hamling,at.
the jury convicted defendant of conspiring to violate d,which,in pertinent part,makes it unlawful for a ny operator to willfully violate a mandatory mine health or safety standard.the superseding indictment alleged that defendant was an operator of upper big branch,and in that capacity,conspired to routinely violate federal mandatory mine safety and health standards.accordingly,the indictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself,which is generally sufficient.perry,at.
notwithstanding that the superseding indictment tracked the language of the statute,defendant asserts the superseding indictment was insufficient because it did not cite the specific mine safety regulations that he allegedly conspired to violate.we disagree.
as detailed above,when an indictment uses a general description based on the statutory language,the indictment satisfies the constitution if it includes an accompanying statement of facts that apprises a defendant of the specific offense the government alleges the defendant committed.id.at.here,as the district court correctly noted,although the superseding indictment did not include citations to specific regulations,it included a factual background that identified numerous mine safety regulations that defendant allegedly conspired to violate,including mine ventilation regulations,examination requirements,regulations regarding support of roof and walls,and regulations governing accumulation of explosive coal dust.the superseding indictment also detailed how defendant conspired to violate these and other regulations.
defendant cites no authority holding that an indictment is insufficient for failing to include specific regulatory citations when the indictment describes at length which regulations the defendant violated and how he violated those regulations.and the two cases upon which defendant principally relies united states hooker and united states kingrea are readily distinguishable.
in hooker,this court found an indictment insufficient when it failed to include an essential statutory element of the offense that the conduct at issue affected interstate commerce,cir.by contrast,the superseding indictment tracked the statutory language verbatim.in kingrea,the indictment again omitted an essential statutory element of the crime,and this omission broaden ed the character of the crime beyond the scope of the crime as congress has defined it in the applicable statute.at.here,not only did the superseding indictment track the statutory language,it also did not broaden the scope of the offense.accordingly,the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the superseding indictment.
second,defendant argues that the district court violated his rights under the sixth amendment confrontation clause by denying him the opportunity to engage in of chris blanchard,the massey employee in charge of the upper big branch mine.the governing rule is that w here new evidence is opened up on redirect examination,the opposing party must be given the right of on the new matter,but the privilege of as to matters not covered on redirect examination lies within the trial court discretion.united states riggi,cir.quotation omitted see also united states fleschner,cir.i f a new subject is raised in redirect examination,the district court must allow the new matter to be subject to.
although there is no bright line rule delineating what constitutes new matter,testimony elicited on redirect does not amount to new matter if the testimony only expand s or elaborate s on the witness previous testimony.united states baker,cir.noting that the authorities are devoid of any analysis of what constitutes new matter,overruled in part on other grounds by united states nordby,cir.by contrast,redirect testimony raises new matter when it encompasses a subject outside of the scope of direct examination or when a witness offers materially different testimony regarding a subject first introduced on direct.see,id.at concluding redirect raised new matter when witness testified on redirect that flask could produce significantly more methamphetamine than the amount he had testified it could produce on direct united states jones,cir.holding redirect testimony that,for the first time,placed defendant at crime scene constituted new matter united states caudle,cir.concluding redirect raised new matter when witness first testified to substance of report on redirect,even though witness had testified as to preparation and dissemination of report on direct.
here,in reviewing whether the redirect examination raised new matter,the district court commendably received oral argument and,in concluding that redirect did not raise new matter,thoroughly reviewed the transcript of direct,cross,and redirect and explained how each issue raised on redirect did not constitute new matter.defendant principally argues that the district court improperly denied him the opportunity to blanchard regarding his testimony on redirect that he testified before the grand jury that defendant told blanchard that it was cheaper to break the safety laws and pay the fines than comply,and a number of safety citations first introduced on redirect to rebut blanchard testimony on that many citations did not reflect serious violations.
assuming arguendo that the district court erred,after completing its thorough review,in denying on those subjects,we conclude any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see baker,at reversal is not required if,assuming the damaging potential of were fully realized,we can say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.factors to consider in determining harmlessness include the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and the overall strength of the prosecution case.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,although blanchard was an important witness,all of the subjects on which defendant requested were either effectively dealt with on or cumulative of other evidence introduced at trial.for instance,on,blanchard testified unambiguously that he did not conspire with defendant to violate mine safety laws,and blanchard testified that the government threatened to prosecute him if he did not testify before the grand jury,during which he inculpated defendant.likewise,both defendant and the government introduced numerous safety citations at upper big branch,through blanchard and other witnesses.
furthermore,defendant of blanchard lasted nearly five days more time than direct and redirect examination combined and therefore defendant had an extensive opportunity to examine blanchard.the government also presented other evidence and testimony that would allow the jury to determine defendant prioritized coal production at the expense of safety compliance,including memoranda from defendant to massey employees and statements from defendant to blanchard.see,defendant telling blanchard to reopen mine section even though it lacked legal return airway defendant telling supervisors to run coal and not build overcasts,which are ventilation systems you need to run some coal.we worry about ventilation or other issues at an appropriate time.and the government presented other evidence establishing that the citations reflected serious safety violations.
most significantly,defendant could have recalled blanchard as a witness later in the trial.united states gibson,wl,at cir.july,table holding denial of recross harmless because defendant could recall witness united states ross,cir.same hale united states,cir.holding denial of recross did not violate confrontation clause when defendant had opportunity to recall witness.accordingly,the district court did not reversibly err in denying defendant an opportunity to engage in of blanchard.
next,defendant argues that the district court errantly instructed the jury regarding the meaning of willfully violating federal mine safety and health standards for purposes of d.this court reviews de novo whether the district court instructions to the jury were correct statements of law.gentry ptrs.club mgmt,cir.quotation omitted.in conducting such a review,we do not view a single instruction in isolation rather we consider whether taken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge,the instructions accurately and fairly state the controlling law.united states jefferson,cir.internal quotation omitted.
defendant takes issue with the following instructions regarding the meaning of willfully in section d 
a person with supervisory authority at or over a mine willfully fails to perform an act required by a mandatory safety or health standard if he knows that the act is not being performed and knowingly,purposefully,and voluntarily allows that omission to continue.
a person with supervisory authority at or over a mine also willfully violates a mandatory mine safety or health standard if he knowingly,purposefully,and voluntarily takes actions that he knows will cause a standard to be violated 
o r knowingly,purposefully,and voluntarily fails to take actions that are necessary to comply with the mandatory mine safety or health standard 
o r if he knowingly,purposefully,and voluntarily takes action or fails to do so with reckless disregard for whether that action or failure to act will cause a mandatory safety or health standard to be violated.
defendant first argues that the fourth instruction improperly allowed the jury to convict defendant for reckless conduct,rather than requiring the government to prove defendant knew his conduct would cause a violation of safety regulations and was unlawful.appellant br.at.in particular,defendant contends that the supreme court decisions in bryan united states,and safeco insurance of america burr,bar courts from defining willfully in criminal statutes in terms of reckless disregard.
in bryan,the supreme court reviewed whether the government introduced sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of willfully violating the federal gun control act,which,among other things,prohibits dealing in firearms without a license.at see also a d.the defendant argued that in order to prove that he willfully violated federal gun laws,the government had to introduce evidence that he was aware of the federal law that prohibits dealing in firearms without a federal license.at.the supreme court rejected the defendant argument,holding that,as a result of the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse,the government need not prove that the defendant knew of the statutory provision at issue to violate it.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that willfully is a word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.id.at internal quotation omitted.the court said that,a s a general matter,in the criminal context,willful means an act undertaken with a bad purpose,and a willful violation of a statute occurs when the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.id.at quoting ratzlaf united states.the court provided several additional examples of criminally willful conduct,including acting without justifiable excuse acting stubbornly,obstinately,perversely acting without ground for believing it is lawful and acting with careless disregard as to whether or not one has the right so to act.id.at.
safeco involved a civil action under section of the fair credit reporting act,which establishes a cause of action against entities that willfully fail to comply with the statute.at.the supreme court rejected the defendant argument that willfully limited liability to acts known to violate the act,not to reckless disregard of statutory duty.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court said that where willfulness is a statutory condition of civil liability,we have generally taken it to cover not only knowing violations of a standard,but reckless ones as well.id.the court further noted that,as explained in bryan,in the criminal context willfully often requires the government to prove a defendant to have a bad purpose or to have acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.id.at quoting bryan,at.
neither bryan nor safeco supports defendant position that reckless disregard can not amount to criminal willfulness.in particular,bryan and safeco emphasized that willful has multiple meanings and that the bad purpose language upon which defendant relies defines willful only as a general matter not in all circumstances.additionally,even if bryan and safeco had required a showing that a defendant acted with a bad purpose which they did not the supreme court long ago recognized in a decision relied on in bryan that reckless disregard can amount to acting with a bad purpose for purposes of criminal willfulness.screws united states,plurality op.and bryan upon which safeco entirely relied expressly recognized that conduct marked by careless disregard constitutes willfulness.at.accordingly,bryan and safeco did not overturn longstanding supreme court precedent holding that reckless disregard can amount to criminal willfulness.
we further point out that this court repeatedly has held,and safeco,that reckless disregard and plain indifference can constitute criminal willfulness.for example,in a decision addressing the meaning of willfully in the civil and criminal penalty provisions in federal gun control laws we concluded that a t its core willful describes conduct that results from an exercise of the will,distinguishing intentional,knowing,or voluntary action from that which is accidental or inadvertent.rsm,herbert,cir.accordingly,when determining the willfulness of conduct,we must determine whether the acts were committed in deliberate disregard of,or with plain indifference toward,either known legal obligations or the general unlawfulness of the actions.id.at emphasis added.we further held that this construction of willfully was in accordance with bryan construction of the term in the criminal context of a d.id.at emphasis added.
applying this standard to the conduct at issue,we held that the defendant repeated failure to comply with federal gun laws in the face of warnings by federal officials amounted to willfulness 
to be sure,a single,or even a few,inadvertent errors in failing to complete forms may not amount to willful failures,even when the legal requirement to complete the form was known.yet at some point,when such errors continue or even increase in the face of repeated warnings given by enforcement officials,accompanied by explanations of the severity of the failures,one may infer as a matter of law that the licensee simply does not care about the legal requirements.at that point,the failures show the licensee plain indifference and therefore become willful.
rsm,at emphasis retained.thus,we have held that not car ing about adherence to legal requirements amounts to criminal willfulness,which is what the fourth instruction stated here.notably,rsm description of the defendant willful conduct tracks the government theory of the case here defendant was repeatedly informed of safety violations at upper big branch,and notwithstanding that knowledge,defendant chose to prioritize production and pay fines rather than to take steps necessary to prevent the safety violations from continuing.
following rsm,which bryan but safeco,we held that safeco did not call into question rsm analysis of the meaning of willfully.am.arms int l herbert,cir.additionally,in american arms,we expressly equated plain indifference with reckless disregard for purposes of finding willfulness.id.at.
in interpreting a variety of criminal statutes,other circuits have reached the same conclusion and safeco,reckless disregard still can and does constitute criminal willfulness.see,united states trudeau,cir.concluding that because meaning of willful is influenced by its context,safeco did not bar defining willful in terms of reckless disregard united states anderson,cir.stating that recklessness is a valid theor y for establishing defendant willfully engaged in criminal copyright infringement united states george,cir.sotomayor,concluding,after lengthy survey of case law,that bryan did not displace earlier supreme court case law holding criminal willfullness requires only the minimum mens rea necessary to separate innocent from wrongful conduct and therefore interpreting willfully requirement in criminal passport fraud statute as proscribing false statements that are knowingly included in the passport application united states johnstone,cir.w illful ly in federal criminal civil rights statute,means either particular purpose or reckless disregard.united states rapone,cir.defining willful for purposes of criminal contempt as deliberate or reckless disregard of the obligations created by a court order united states kay,cir.concluding,that a defendant knowledge that he committed the act is sufficient to constitute criminal willfulness emphasis added.
in sum,contrary to defendant position,bryan and safeco did not prohibit the use of reckless disregard in defining willfully for purposes of criminal statutes.
having determined that reckless disregard can constitute criminal willfulness,we now must determine whether the district court properly concluded that reckless disregard amounts to willfulness for purposes of section d.in deciding this question,we do not write on a clean slate.in united states jones,cir,we affirmed a trial court instruction that a criminal defendant willfully violated a federal mine safety standard if he acted either in intentional disobedience of the safety standard or in reckless disregard of its requirements.id.at.this language conforms to the interpretations of willfulness provided by several of the circuits,we held.id.in reaching this conclusion,we relied on the sixth circuit decision in united states consolidation coal,cir.the only appellate decision interpreting the meaning of willfully in a criminal provision of a federal mine safety statute which held that an act or omission is willful if done knowingly and purposefully by a coal mine operator who,having a free will or choice,either intentionally disobeys the standard or recklessly disregards its requirements.id.at emphasis added jones,at.
defendant contends that we should disregard jones because,notwithstanding that the district court instructed the jury on the meaning of willfully,jones involved a prosecution under a provision in the mine safety act with a knowing,as opposed to willful,mens rea requirement.but we see no reason to depart from jones statement that,for purposes of the mine safety act criminal provision,willfulness encompasses reckless disregard nor does defendant provide us with any.
section d derives from a substantively identical provision in the federal coal mine health and safety act of the coal act,which the mine safety act replaced.at the time congress enacted the mine safety act,the sixth circuit had already interpreted willfully in the coal act in terms of reckless disregard.consol.coal,at.because w e assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,miles apex marine,we must presume that congress intended willfully in section d to have the same meaning as the judicial construction of the term in the coal act,see united states georgopoulous,cir.construing,willfulness element in labor union bribery statute as requiring only general intent because such a construction accorded with the judicial construction of willfulness in the statute from which the bribery provision derived.that congress enacted the mine safety act because it believed the penalties available under the coal act had proven insufficient to deter safety violations further evidences that congress did not intend for courts to construe willfully in the mine safety act more strictly than they had interpreted the term in the parallel provision in the coal act,as defendant invites us to do here.see,at,e nforcement sanctions under the coal act are insufficient to deal with chronic violators.
other congressional statements in the legislative history of the mine safety act further indicate that congress intended to bring conduct evidencing reckless disregard within the meaning of willfully.in particular,congress imposed enhanced penalties in the mine safety act because it found m ine operators still find it cheaper to pay minimal civil penalties than to make the capital investments necessary to adequately abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions,and there is still no means by which the government can bring habitual and chronic violators of the law into compliance,at.accordingly,congress saw criminal penalties as a mechanism to punish habitual and chronic violators that choose to pay fines rather than remedy safety violations.
as noted previously,we explained in rsm that an inference of plain indifference and therefore willfulness arises from evidence of continu ing or increas ing violations in the face of repeated warnings given by enforcement officials.at.put differently,a long history of repeated failures,warnings,and explanations of the significance of the failures,combined with knowledge of the legal obligations,readily amounts to willfulness.id.
other courts have reached the same conclusion.see,screws,at plurality op.holding that reckless disregard amounted to criminal willfulness and stating that contin uing or persist ing in action that violates established law constituted willfulness under that definition united states jeremiah,cir.a finding of willfulness was supported by defendant repeated failure to make restitution payments on time.rapone,at holding defendant failure to heed repeated warnings of noncompliance provided basis for factfinder to conclude defendant acted willfully united states garcia,cir.finding that defendant continued violation of particular provision in tax code in the face of repeated warnings from government officials constituted willfulness willingham sports,bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms explosives,cir.a defendant repeated violations after it has been informed of the regulations and warned of violations does show purposeful disregard or plain indifference.
that congress imposed enhanced penalties on mine operators in order to punish operators who chronic ally and habitual ly violate mine safety laws,rather than to devote resources to safety compliance,and that courts construe willfulness in terms of reckless disregard when a statute is intended to levy criminal penalties on defendants who persist in violating a federal law notwithstanding repeated warnings of the violations,further indicates congress intended to define willfully in section d in terms of reckless disregard.
finally,d parallels the criminal liability provision in the gun control act at issue in bryan and rsm,d.in particular,both section d and section d prohibit the willful violation of the substantive provisions of their respective statutes and the regulations promulgated thereunder.indeed,defendant acknowledges that t here is no textual basis for distinguishing the mine act identically constructed liability provision from the statutory liability provision in bryan.appellant br.at.additionally,the mine safety act and gun control act serve similar purposes by establishing complex federal regulatory regimes designed to protect public safety.in rsm,we held that plain indifference or reckless disregard amounts to criminal willfulness for purposes of section d.at.given the textual and functional similarity between section d and section d,we likewise interpret willfully in section d in terms of reckless disregard.
defendant and amici coal industry trade associations nonetheless maintain that,as a matter of policy,congress did not intend for reckless disregard to amount to willfulness,as that term is used in section d,for four reasons congress could not have intended to hold mine operators criminally liable for making budgeting and business decisions about how to allocate resources between production and safety compliance violations inexorably result from coal production and therefore violations should not give rise to criminal liability absent evidence a defendant committed such violations with specific intent to violate a particular mine safety statute or regulation defining willfully in terms of reckless disregard would allow juries to find mine operators criminally liable even when the operators did not want safety violations to occur and if reckless disregard amounts to willfulness,then operators will be deterred from engaging in detailed oversight over important aspects of safety and regulatory compliance.see appellant br.at amicus brief of illinois coal ass n,ohio coal ass and west virginia coal ass amicus br.at.we disagree.
first,the legislative history of the mine safety act contradicts defendant and amici argument that congress did not intend to punish mine operators for the type of budgeting and business decisions the government challenged here.in particular,congress repeatedly stated that the mine safety act enforcement provisions were designed to deter mine operators from choosing to prioritize production over safety compliance on grounds that it was cheaper to pay the penalties than to strive for a mine,at see also id.at expressing concern that m ine operators still find it cheaper to pay minimal civil penalties than to make the capital investments necessary to adequately abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions.to that end,congress said that operators should not balance the financial returns to increasing output against the costs of safety compliance.see id.at the committee strongly believes that compliance with strong health and safety standards must be a basic ground rule for increased production.emphasis added.
congress imposes penalties on corporate officers like defendant alongside enterprise penalties because it is often impossible to impose monetary penalties on corporations large enough to deter corporate misconduct.john coffee,no soul to damn no body to kick an unscandalized inquiry into the problem of corporate punishment,o ur ability to deter the corporation may be confounded by our inability to set an adequate punishment cost which does not exceed the corporation resources.and when the returns to violating a law exceed a potential corporate fine,discounted by the likelihood of the government imposing the fine,corporate officers who do not face personal liability will treat criminal penalties as a license fee for the conduct of an illegitimate business as the government evidence showed defendant did here.see united states park,quoting united states dotterweich.
by subjecting mine operators to personal liability,including incarceration,congress forced mine operators to internalize the costs associated with noncompliance with mine safety laws,even when such noncompliance would be from a business perspective.see timothy glynn,beyond unlimiting shareholder liability vicarious tort liability for corporate officers,vand,explaining that subjecting corporate officers to personal
