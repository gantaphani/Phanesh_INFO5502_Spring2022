one observer has estimated that percent of the wells drilled in the east texas oil field in the first half of the century were in a huge waste of money and natural resources as one means of reducing excessive drilling,the texas legislature provided for voluntary pooling in and compulsory pooling in 
since then,this court has never addressed how a pool of producing properties is affected if a lease in the pool expires.in this case,the courts below held that expiration of a lease removes those minerals from the pool and bars recovery of any costs incurred before termination.but the pooling agreement here did not depend on the continuation of underlying leases,nor was the equitable right of reimbursement for improvements necessarily extinguished by termination of the lease.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
jane sheppard,a cpa and retired family lawyer,owns of the minerals underlying a tract in upshur county,texas resources,leased her interest,and along with wagner brown,leased the other of the minerals from other owners.sheppard lease had a special addendum providing that if royalties were not paid within days after first gas sales,her lease would terminate the following month 
sheppard lease also authorized pooling with adjacent tracts.on september,resources,wagner brown,and mineral lessees on adjacent tracts signed a unit agreement pooling the sheppard tract and eight others to form the landers gas unit one month later,a gas well was successfully completed and began producing,and a second well was completed in september.both wells were physically located on the sheppard tract,but pursuant to the unit agreement proceeds and costs were split among all the tracts in proportion to acreage.
the original unit agreement designated resources as operator of the unit.in september,wagner brown took over that position,and discovered that sheppard had not been paid royalties within days of the first gas sales.wagner brown offered sheppard a new lease,but with two producing wells already on her property,she declined.the parties agree that sheppard lease terminated on march,and since then she has been an unleased,entitled to her share of proceeds from minerals sold less her share of the costs of production and marketing.
the dispute here concerns both the proceeds and the costs.regarding the proceeds,the question is whether the termination of sheppard lease also terminated her participation in the unit in which case she is entitled to of percent of production,as both wells are on her tract,or did not do so in which case she is entitled to of only percent of proportion her tract bears to total acreage in the unit regarding the costs,the question is whether sheppard should bear any costs incurred before her lease terminated,or any costs incurred after the lease terminated that relate to the unit but not her lease.
the trial court granted summary judgment for sheppard,finding that termination of the lease also terminated her participation in the unit,that she was not liable for any costs incurred before termination,and that she was liable for costs incurred after termination only if they pertained solely to her lease the court of appeals affirmed for the reasons stated below,we disagree.
ii.does termination of the lease also terminate the unit 
sheppard lease contained a standard industry pooling clause that provided 
lessee shall have the right but not the obligation to pool all or any part of the leased premises or interest therein with any other lands or interests production,drilling or reworking operations anywhere on a unit which includes all or any part of the leased premises shall be treated as if it were production,drilling or reworking operations on the leased premises,except that the production on which lessor royalty is calculated shall be that proportion of the total unit production which the net acreage covered by this lease and included in the unit bears to the total gross acreage in the unit in the absence of production in paying quantities from a unit,or upon permanent cessation thereof,lessee may terminate the unit by filing of record a written declaration describing the unit and stating the date of termination.pooling hereunder shall not constitute a of interests.
the designation of unit signed by the lessees of the various leases and lands included in the pool provided that they hereby pool and combine said leases and the lands into a single pooled unit or unitized area for the development of and production of gas and associated hydrocarbons 
we disagree with wagner brown that the portion of sheppard pooling clause regarding termination for lack of production resolves this case.that clause provides that the unit may terminate if production ceases,but there is nothing to show this was intended to be the exclusive means.the documents do not specify what happens to the unit when one lease terminates,so this case calls for interpretation rather than plain reading.
but we agree that a proper interpretation of these documents indicates the termination of sheppard lease did not terminate her participation in the unit.a lease is not necessarily required for pooling mineral owners can join a pool even if no lease exists here,both sheppard lease and the unit agreement pooled certain premises and lands,not just their leased interests.although sheppard lease expired,the lands themselves obviously did not.thus,while termination of sheppard lease changed who owned the mineral interests in the unit,it did not cause the unit to terminate because it was a pooling of lands,not just leases.
on precisely this basis,the second court of appeals held in ladd petroleum eagle oil gas that termination of a lease does not terminate a unit the lease in ladd allowed pooling with other lands as well as other leases,so the unit survived the termination of one lease because the continuing validity of any such pooling was not dependent upon a subsisting leasehold estate in the adjacent land.in this case as in ladd,lands as well as leases were pooled,so the tracts dedicated to the unit survived even if the related leases did not.
the court of appeals here distinguished ladd on the ground that it involved termination of an entire pool,while sheppard seeks only termination of her participation in it but there can not be one rule of contract interpretation for small mineral interests and a different rule for large ones.if sheppard original mineral interest had been rather than,the ruling she seeks would have cut off all production for the other members in the pool just as occurred in ladd.and if her original interest had been or more,her share would have curtailed their share,even though they had nothing to do with letting her lease terminate 
the court of appeals relied on texaco,lettermann,in which the seventh court of appeals held that the termination of two out of the three leases in a unit resulted in termination of the pool but the lease in lettermann only authorized pooling with the gas leasehold estate of adjacent lands thus,when those leasehold estates terminated,so did the pool.but that does not mean a unit formed by pooling lands must terminate on the same basis as one formed by pooling only leases.
the court of appeals also reasoned from the premise that the pooling agreement transferred only the operator interest,leaving sheppard possibility of reverter unimpinged.but her lease allowed pooling of all or any part of the leased premises or interest therein,and sheppard reverter was certainly an interest in the leased premises.when a unit is properly pooled,the owners of the minerals or reversionary interests in a separate tract within the unit surrender their right to receive their interest in all production from wells located on their own tract just as pooling impinges on a mineral owner royalty interest it also may impinge on an owner possibility of reverter.
the parties invite us to decide the question here based on general principles rather than the terms of the particular documents involved.wagner brown urges that termination of a lease should never terminate a pool,pointing out that pooling benefits mineral owners,operators,the state,and the environment by reducing the number of wells needed to maintain efficient production while protecting correlative rights sheppard urges adoption of a treatise view that pooling can extend no longer than the lease itself because a lessor grants only a power to pool the leasehold rights.
but oil and gas leases in general,and pooling clauses in particular,are a matter of contract just as owners and operators generally must agree to create a pool they should also be able to agree when one terminates.if the parties want pooling to expire or not upon termination of one lease,they should be free to say so 
the lease here allowed the sheppard tract rather than just the lease to be pooled for purposes of production,and that is what the unit designation did.as termination of the lease changed none of the lands committed to the unit,we hold that it did not terminate the unit.thus,while sheppard is entitled as a to of the proceeds due to the mineral owners of her tract,that does not entitle her to of the proceeds that must be shared with mineral owners of other tracts by the terms of the unit agreement.
iii.must sheppard pay a share of unit expenses 
based on the conclusion that the landers unit had terminated,the courts below denied wagner brown claim for leasehold,and overhead expenses to the extent they related to the unit rather than solely to sheppard tract because we have held the unit did not terminate,wagner brown properly accounted to sheppard for both production and expenses on a unit basis 
the record reflects that these expenses were for landman fees,lease bonuses,recording fees,and title opinion expenses,part or all of which related to tracts in the unit other than sheppard.additionally,overhead expenses including administration,supervision,office services,and warehousing were calculated pursuant to a standard accounting agreement relating to the unit.at trial,sheppard produced no evidence that any of these expenses were not reasonable and necessary to the contrary,she stipulated that many of them were.
on appeal,sheppard suggests no basis for barring these expenses except that they did not all relate to her tract.but the evidence at trial established that two wells could not have been drilled on her tract without the pool,at least not without getting an exception from railroad commission that would have curtailed production.from the perspective of other interest holders in the unit,expenses to maintain sheppard tract were clearly necessary as all the wells were located there the same kind of expenses to keep other tracts and leases in the unit were of similar value to sheppard,not just as a matter of equal treatment but because future wells might be located off her tract.
although wagner brown evidence was not contradicted,the trial court was not required to believe all of it.accordingly,we do not hold that wagner brown conclusively established that all its charges were reasonable and necessary.but some of them certainly were,so there is no evidence to support the trial court award of none of them.in these circumstances,we must reverse and remand for a reassessment of damages 
iv.must sheppard pay drilling costs 
sheppard concedes that once her lease expired,she must pay her share of expenses to produce and market gas thereafter but she argues,and the courts below agreed,that she did not have to pay any of the drilling or other costs incurred before the lease expired 
but the general rule regarding improvements is otherwise the principle is well established in equity that a person who in good faith makes improvements upon property owned by another is entitled to compensation therefor.thus,when a son lost a farm because his deed from his father was oral,we held he might still seek reimbursement for improvements he built to the extent they enhanced the farm value when a couple used community funds to build a home on realty owned separately by one spouse,we held the community estate had an equitable right of reimbursement for the improvements and when a paid to raise a lot in galveston above,we held he was entitled to reimbursement of his costs as we explained in the latter case,this rule arises in equity 
when two persons are cotenants in the ownership of land,and one of them incurs expense in the improvement of the property which is necessary and beneficial,it is equitable that the one incurring the expense shall have contribution from his cotenant in an amount which is in proportion to the undivided interest owned by such cotenant the law implies a contract between him and his cotenant,authorizing him to spend for him the money which was necessarily spent 
under texas law,only a naked trespasser can not recover for improvements that benefit another land 
as oil and gas wells are improvements to real property the same rule applies to them one who drills a well in good faith is entitled to reimbursement this rule applies even if an operator lease is not valid,so long as the operator believed in good faith that it was similarly,a who drills without another consent is entitled to reimbursement 
it has long been the rule in texas that a cotenant has the right to extract minerals from common property without first obtaining the consent of his cotenants however,he must account to them on the basis of the value of any minerals taken,less the necessary and reasonable costs of production and marketing 
thus,there is no question that under texas law wagner brown could have recovered a share of drilling costs from sheppard had she signed no lease at all.the question is whether the rule should be different because there was a valid lease that was mistakenly allowed to expire.it is of course true that equity does not favor those who sleep on their rights but it is hard to see why one who obtains a lease and then loses it by mistake is entitled to less equity than one who by mistake never had a valid lease in the first place.
it is true that resources breached sheppard lease,but a breaching party is not necessarily barred from reimbursement for improvements.for example,texas law permits recovery to builders upon substantial performance,even if they have breached their building contract as we have explained,this rule is based on the owner acceptance and retention of the benefits arising as a direct result of the contractor partial performance.
beyond these general principles,the parties assert that several cases establish rules in their favor,but we find none convincing.the closest are two opinions by the seventh court of appeals.in thoreson fox,the court found that a lease had expired for failure to commence production within days,but nevertheless allowed the operator to recover its drilling costs from amounts it owed for gas sales after quoting a pennsylvania supreme court case allowing reimbursement to an operator who mistakenly drilled on the wrong lease,the seventh court stated 
surely,if a trespasser,as in the pennsylvania case just cited,is entitled to recover for the cost of drilling and for machinery and appliances incident to the operation of the well,defendants here would be entitled to recover for the value of the improvements to the land itself,limited to the actual cost to the defendants 
less than three months later,the same court refused to allow reimbursement in steeple oil gas amend,in which a lease terminated for failure to pay royalties the court distinguished thoreson on two grounds the mineral owner in thoreson invoked equity by seeking an order barring removal of casing and equipment,and a jury found the thoreson operator had acted in good faith while in some jurisdictions reimbursement for a builder may depend on an equitable counterclaim by the owner that does not appear to have been the general rule in texas nor is it clear why the failure to pay royalties in steeple was not in good faith while the failure to commence timely production in thoreson was.in any event,both opinions were promptly reversed by this court on other grounds 
almost years ago,the commission of appeals held in broadway stone that a plaintiff who bought an unleased mineral interest after four producing wells had been drilled was cha
