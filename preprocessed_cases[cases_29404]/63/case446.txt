the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,includes a provision pursuant to which foreign states may waive their sovereign immunity from suit in the courts of the united states.see id.a.this case involves the applicability of that provision to a contract dispute involving gulf resources corporation gulf,a panamanian corporation with its primary place of business in beirut,lebanon,and gulf resources america,gulf america,a wholly owned subsidiary of gulf with its principal places of business in washington,and los angeles,and the republic of the congo congo.throughout this opinion,gulf and gulf america are referred to collectively as gulf or appellant.
the dispute here arises out of the sale and resale of oil royalties owed to congo by a subsidiary of an italian oil conglomerate extracting oil from congolese oil fields.at the heart of the dispute are several written agreements pursuant to which congo sold certain of the royalty oil owed to congo by the italian producer to gulf and gulf business partner.acting through its business partner,gulf agreed to sell the congolese royalty oil back to the italian producer at market prices.gulf paid congo in advance for the oil that it purchased.the italian company was to pay gulf as the oil was produced.when it had paid gulf for just over a quarter of the oil that gulf had purchased from congo,the italian producer,allegedly following instructions from congo,redirected to congo the payments due to gulf.thus,gulf complains that congo received payments owed to gulf from the italian producer.in essence,gulf alleges that congo received double payment for nearly three quarters of the royalty oil that congo sold to gulf congo was paid once in advance by gulf and then again by the italian producer.
gulf filed suit in district court alleging causes of action in contract and tort including conversion and interference with contract against congo.gulf sought damages and an accounting.congo moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b asserting sovereign immunity.gulf argued that the district court should exercise jurisdiction under fsia waiver provision,a,or under the second clause of the commercial activity exception,a.the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice,rejecting gulf several theories in support of its waiver argument,as well as its argument in support of a commercial activity exception.gulf resources am.republic of congo,d.
we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.we find that congo contractually waived sovereign immunity with respect to gulf claims in this case.having waived sovereign immunity,congo lost its immunity from jurisdiction pursuant to a.in light of this finding,we need not address gulf contention that congo also lost immunity under the commercial activity exception in fsia.

ii.analysis 
fsia sets forth a comprehensive framework for determining when a federal or state court may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign state.republic of argentina weltover,d.it authorizes a foreign plaintiff to sue a foreign sovereign in the courts of the united states,provided the substantive requirements of the act are satisfied id.at.at quoting verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d.and it grants federal district courts subject matter jurisdiction over in personam civil claims with respect to which the defendant foreign state is not entitled to immunity under.a.
a district court order granting a rule b motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity is reviewed de novo.price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,mckesson hboc,islamic republic of iran.in accordance with the restrictive view of sovereign immunity reflected in fsia,the defendant bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff allegations do not bring its case within a statutory exception to immunity.phoenix consulting,republic of angola,quoting transamerican somali democratic republic.if,as in this case,the defendant challenges only the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff jurisdictional allegations,then the court should take the plaintiff factual allegations as true and determine whether they bring the case within any of the exceptions to immunity invoked by the plaintiff.phoenix consulting,at.applying these standards,we hold that gulf allegations are sufficient to bring this case within the statutory exception to immunity under fsia a.
article j of the purchase agreement applies to gulf 
section a provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states in any case in which the foreign state has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication a.congo does not dispute that article j of the original purchase agreement contains an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.rather,congo principally contends that this waiver does not apply to gulf,because gulf was not a party to the original purchase agreement.see congo br.at.this argument fails.
it is true that gulf was not a signatory to the original purchase agreement.however,under the amendment,gulf reached an explicit agreement with congo for the purchase of royalty oil,the sale of which was clearly set within the framework of the original purchase agreement.in other words,pursuant to the amendment,gulf was incorporated into and made a beneficiary of and participant in the purchase agreement.this conclusion is inescapable on the record before us.
first,congo and occidental clearly anticipated the possible addition of new participants in the sale of the royalty oil and drafted the purchase agreement to allow for such additions.indeed,the purchase agreement explicitly states that occidental rights are transferrable.purchase agreement,at.the anticipated addition of participants was realized in the amendment when congo directed that occidental assign to gulf the right a to lift twenty five percent of the royalty oil under the purchase agreement and b to receive seventy five percent of the royalties paid in cash to occidental during the six months notice period for the election to take royalty oil in kind,as provided in article of this amendment.amendment,at.moreover,the terms of the amendment make it clear that the understandings reached therein were to be treated as part of the purchase agreement.thus,the amendment is entitled amendment to purchase agreement and it plainly states that the term agreement when used in the purchase agreement shall mean the purchase agreement as amended,modified and supplemented by this amendment id,at.finally,the amendment makes it clear that the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in article j of the purchase agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to the substitute oil,the fields from which the substitute oil is produced,and the contracts,conventions,and establishment agreements applicable to such fields.id,at,making all but two of the warranty provisions of the purchase agreement applicable,mutatis mutandis,to the substitute oil described in the amendment.
