in these consolidated appeals,qwest corporation asks us to determine whether it was obligated to seek state utility commission approval of a contract in which it agreed to provide mcimetro access transmission services,llc mcimetro,with access to a service known as qwest platform plus.the public utility commission of colorado and the public service commission of utah both independently determined that the telecommunications act of the act specifically,a required qwest and mcimetro to submit their agreement for approval,and the district courts in colorado and utah agreed.qwest challenges this conclusion,asserting that the filing obligation in arises only if an agreement contains network elements that qwest must make available to other carriers pursuant to.our jurisdiction to review the district courts final orders arises under,and we affirm.
background 
through a merger,qwest obtained west,a former subsidiary of at t which was divested pursuant to a consent decree between at t and the united states government.under current parlance,qwest is known as a bell operating company boc,meaning a former at t subsidiary and an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec,meaning a local telephone service provider that used to have a monopoly in a certain area in both colorado and utah.as such,the telecommunications act of requires qwest to share its network resources with other telecommunications carriers competitive local exchange carriers or clecs,that wish to enter qwest local markets.mcimetro is a clec in utah and colorado.
statutory framework the telecommunications act of 
for most of its history,local phone service was thought to be a natural monopoly.at t iowa utils,d.accordingly,states alone regulated the industry,seeking to ensure that each local monopolist provided adequate service at reasonable prices this regime began to change in,when at t agreed to divest itself of the local exchange carriers that it owned.see united states v.at t,aff sub nom.maryland united states,d.fourteen years later,congress enacted the telecommunications act of,which fundamentally changed telecommunications regulation by introducing competition in the local service market.sw.bell.apple,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in passing the legislation,congress hoped to obtain the benefits of competition for the american consumer while avoiding,as much as possible,the potential that established entities would use their existing market power to prey on market entrants.see thomas krattenmaker,the telecommunications act of.
therefore,incumbent lecs are subject to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.iowa utils,at.these duties essentially require the incumbents to interconnect with and to rent parts of their networks to new those parts of a local network that it is least economic for a new entrant to duplicate.james speta,antitrust and local competition under the telecommunications act,antitrust.at the same time,the act provides for targeted monitoring of these interconnections by state and federal regulators.see e.
in this case,three provisions of the act are at issue.the first is,other a duty on ilecs to interconnect with competitors.see a.the second is,which provides that an ilec faced with a request for interconnection may either negotiate an agreement with the requesting party or submit to arbitration by a state regulatory agency in either case,the resulting interconnection agreement must be submitted to the state regulatory agency for approval.id.a b,e.the third provision at issue is,which allows bocs to provide telephone service to their customers as long as they comply with certain conditions enumerated in the statute.id.a.the dispute in this case is whether the agreements between qwest and mcimetro are interconnection agreements that must be approved by state regulatory bodies pursuant to,whether they are simply agreements wherein qwest agrees to provide the services enumerated in,or whether they are both.
section the duties imposed on telecommunications carriers 
section of the act establishes a system of obligations imposed on separate,statutorily defined telecommunications entities.atlas.comm n,cir.under the first tier,all carriers have the duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.a.in the second tier,all local exchange carriers both ilecs and clecs have the duty to resell telecommunications services without unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations id.b.they are also obligated to provide number portability,dialing parity,access to rights of way,and reciprocal compensation.id.b.finally,the third tier contains the f oremost among these duties the ilec obligation to share its network with competitors.iowa utils,at.see c.
the statute establishes three methods of providing access to an ilec local network.see mci telecomm.bell,cir.first,a clec may build its own network and interconnect with the ilec network.id.internal quotation marks omitted second,a clec may lease individual elements of the existing network on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.id.at quoting c.finally,a clec may purchase at wholesale prices the entire package of services provided by the ilec and simply resell them to customers.see also c a.
each of these options benefits the clec because t he firm need not build that which the incumbent lec has already built the entrant may just plug into it,at prices deemed fair by the fcc.krattenmaker,supra,at.the requirement that ilecs share their networks is an integral part of the new regulatory scheme because w ithout it,a new carrier entry barriers would be insurmountable.speta,supra,at.
section the filing obligation 
section specifically describes how obligations are to be implemented iowa utils,at.breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part.first,it permits carriers to negotiate interconnection agreements on their own initiative 
upon receiving a request for interconnection services,or network elements pursuant to section of this title,an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier or carriers without regard to the standards set forth in subsections b and c of section of this title the agreement shall be submitted to the state commission under subsection e of this section.
a.this subsection allows the ilec to negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the new entrant to fulfill the duties imposed by b and c verizon,pub.serv.comm of,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,the without regard clause indicates that the parties may make agreements that go beyond or contradict the specific statutory requirements that an incumbent must follow.speta,supra,at.
after prescribing the procedure by which a clec may seek compulsory arbitration by the state commission,the statute requires that all interconnection reached by negotiation and those reached by submitted to the state agency for approval 
any interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the state commission.a state commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,with written findings as to any deficiencies.
e.the statute offers only two permissible grounds for rejecting a negotiated agreement the agreement discriminates against a telecommunications carrier,or the implementation of the agreement is inconsistent with the public interest.id.e.section e permits a party aggrieved by the action of a state commission to appeal the decision to the district court,which must then determine whether the agreement or statement submitted for approval meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
section the competitive checklist and interlata service 
section allows an ilec carrier to provide service interlata services in its local market if that market is sufficiently competitive.the ilec may only provide interlata services if a it has entered into one or more binding agreements that have been approved under section of this title specifying the terms and conditions under which the ilec is providing access and interconnection to its network facilities for the network facilities of one or more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone exchange service to residential and business subscribers or b no clec has requested access and interconnection.c a b.thus,the first condition visualizes a demonstration of a competitor in the local exchange market,while the second is a default to prevent an ilec from being penalized simply because no competitor wishes to enter its market.sbc commc ns.
if the ilec is operating in a competitive market and wishes to qualify under c a,it must meet the requirements of as well as the additional requirements of the competitive checklist in c b n ondiscriminatory access to the poles,ducts,conduits,and owned or controlled by the incumbent lec at just and reasonable rates unbundled local loop transmission unbundled local transport from the trunk side of a wireline local exchange carrier switch local switching unbundled from transport,local loop transmission,or other services and nondiscriminatory access to other network resources,and services.c b ii vii.most of these conditions relate to the interconnection obligations that other provisions of that act impose on each incumbent lec in short,the bocs ability to offer long distance services and to manufacture equipment is conditioned on their meeting their new open interconnection responsibilities.krattenmaker,supra,at.
ii.regulatory background the fcc interpretation of the act 
in,qwest petitioned the fcc for a declaratory ruling about the types of negotiated contractual arrangements between incumbent local exchange carriers lecs and competitive lecs that should be subject to the filing requirements of a.in re qwest commc ns int l.qwest argued that the following categories of arrangements should not be subject to the filing requirement in section a agreements regarding matters not subject to sections or,network elements that have been removed from the list of elements subject to mandatory unbundling.qwest pub.serv.comm of utah,wl,at,quoting qwest petition br.
the fcc rejected this approach,advising that 
a n agreement that creates an ongoing obligation pertaining to resale,number portability,dialing parity,access to,reciprocal compensation,interconnection,unbundled network elements,or collocation is an interconnection agreement that must be filed pursuant to section a w e do not believe that section a can be given the cramped reading that qwest proposes.indeed,on its face,section a does not further limit the types of agreements that carriers must submit to state commissions.
in re qwest,at.however,the fcc also disagreed with commentators who had urged that requires the filing of all agreements between an incumbent lec and a requesting carrier.id.at.instead,it ruled that only those agreements that contain an ongoing obligation relating to section b or c must be filed under a.id.although it held that agreements need not be filed if they simply provide for consideration,the fcc otherwise decline d to address all the possible hypothetical situations presented in the record before it.id.at.rather,the fcc emphasized that the state commissions should be responsible for applying,in the first instance,the statutory interpretation we set forth today to the terms and conditions of specific agreements.id.at.
iii.procedural background 
shortly after the passage of the telecommunications act,qwest and mcimetro entered into negotiations and reached an interconnection agreement governing their relations in fourteen states,including colorado and utah.pursuant to,the carriers filed their agreement with the state commissions in utah and colorado,which approved it.then,in early,qwest and mcimetro culminated additional negotiations and reached two new agreements,which mcimetro filed with both state commissions.the first was an amendment to the earlier interconnection agreement,and the second was the qwest master services agreement qpp agreement at issue in this case 
under the qpp agreement,qwest contracted to provide mcimetro with a service referred to as qwest platform plus,which is comprised of two network elements switching and shared transport.prior regulations required ilecs like qwest to provide these network elements pursuant to the duties imposed by c,but the fcc triennial review remand order determined that switching and shared transport were no longer required elements in most instances.see in re review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers trro,vacated in part,telecom ass.accordingly,qwest may refuse to provide these elements to clecs without violating its obligations under.however,requires qwest to provide switching and shared transport if it wishes to offer service to its local customers,and qwest asserts that the sole purpose of the qpp agreement was to satisfy this obligation.
in july,mcimetro petitioned both state commissions seeking approval of the qpp agreement.qwest timely moved to dismiss mcimetro petitions,arguing that the commissions lacked the authority to approve the qpp agreement because it was not an interconnection agreement under.specifically,qwest contended that it was not required to provide qpp services by b or c and that the state commissions only had authority to review agreements for services enumerated in those subsections.both commissions disagreed,denying qwest motions to dismiss and approving the qpp agreement 
qwest then filed actions against both commissions in the appropriate district courts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.it argued again that only agreements containing obligations enumerated in b and c are subject to the filing requirement in.the courts rejected qwest arguments,and the commissions orders were affirmed.now,qwest appeals both district court rulings.the two cases were consolidated for oral argument,and we decide them both in this opinion.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standing 
before reaching the merits of this case,we have an independent duty to ensure that the district courts properly asserted jurisdiction over qwest lawsuits.see phelps hamilton,cir.qwest sought both a declaratory judgment,pursuant to and,and an injunction,invoking the district court jurisdiction under as well as e.although e by its own terms confers jurisdiction only to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section,the supreme court has held that this statement does not divest the district courts of their authority under to review a commission order for compliance with federal law.verizon,at.the court has also held that the district courts federal question jurisdiction extends to lawsuits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against a state commission even though the challenged action was neither the approval nor the rejection of a filed agreement.id.at.accordingly,we have recognized that e grants federal courts jurisdiction in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section.sw.bell.brooks fiber commc ns of,cir.we conclude that the district courts properly asserted jurisdiction.
we are likewise obliged to satisfy ourselves that qwest had standing to invoke the district courts jurisdiction.daimlerchrysler cuno,d.article iii of the constitution bars the federal courts from issuing advisory opinions accordingly,a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen wright,d.here,the asserted by qwest is an obligation which it contends does not apply to file under,which could force qwest to provide switching and shared transport services no longer required under c to other clecs on the same terms that it reached with mcimetro.see i in re qwest,aplt.supp.br.on juris.issues at.this claimed injury could be redressed if we determined that the utah and colorado commissions were in error in requiring qwest to file the qpp agreement if we vacated the commissions orders,i would be rendered inapplicable and no clec could force qwest to accept the same terms it agreed upon with mcimetro.accordingly,we conclude that qwest has standing,and we proceed to consider qwest appeals on the merits.
ii.is the qpp agreement an interconnection agreement subject to filing 
the question presented in these appeals is whether the qpp agreement is an interconnection agreement that must be filed pursuant to of the telecommunications act of.we apply a de novo standard when reviewing state commissions interpretations of the act,as those decisions turn on determinations of federal law.sw.bell,at see also atlas,at.
our own statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the act.united states,cir.we construe the words of the statute in their ordinary sense giv ing effect,if possible,to every word of the statute.quarles ex rel.bureau of indian affairs,cir.however,given that i t would be a gross understatement to say that the act is not a model of clarity.it is in many important respects a model of ambiguity or indeed even,iowa utils,at,we must defer to reasonable fcc interpretations of the act where they are applicable,see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the parties agree that a contract must be filed as an interconnection agreement if it contain s an ongoing obligation relating to section b or c in re qwest,at section c imposes t he duty to provide,for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,interconnection with the local exchange carrier network c.interconnection is defined as the physical linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of first local competition order,vacated in part,people of the state of cal,cir,rev in part sub nom.at t iowa utils.bd,d therefore,we must affirm if the qpp agreement contains ongoing obligations related to the physical linking of two networks.
alternatively,we must affirm if we conclude that the qpp agreement contains an ongoing obligation relating to unbundled network elements.section c imposes the duty to provide nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point,c,if the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer,id.d b.congress has provided that t he term network element means a facility or equipment used in the provision of telecommunications service.such term also includes features,functions,and capabilities that are provided by means of such facility or equipment id.accordingly,the qpp agreement was subject to filing under if it contains an ongoing obligation relating to a facility or equipment used in the provision of telecommunications service.
switches are equipment directing calls to their destination.iowa utils,at.although the fcc has not given a simple and authoritative definition of the term switching,its discussion of the term in the trro makes very clear that switching relates to the physical linking of two networks.the fcc began by noting that an important function of the local circuit switch is as a means of accessing the local loop.trro,at.moreover,one of the most essential functions a switch performs is to provide routing information that sends a call to the appropriate destination.id.at.the fcc explained that clecs must either gain access to the ilec switches or create physical connections between their own switches and the ilec loop in order to provide local service.id.at.additionally,switching performs several specific functions,including connecting loop facilities to the network,switching loops to other lines and trunks,and providing service capabilities to customers,such as dial tone and vertical features.id.at.the commission has defined switching to encompass and facilities,plus the features,functions,and capabilities of the switch includ ing the basic switching function of connecting lines to lines,lines to trunks,trunks to lines,and trunks to trunks.id.at internal citations omitted.
in the trro,the fcc determined that ilecs were not required to provide switching as an unbundled network element pursuant to c because the failure to provide access to switching would not impair a clec ability to provide local telephone service to its customers.see trro,at d b.however,the conclusion that c does not require ilecs to provide switching says nothing about whether switching is related to the obligation to interconnect found in c.insofar as the fcc has described the basic switching function of connecting lines to lines,lines to trunks,trunks to lines,and trunks to trunks,trro,at,switching is unmistakably related to the physical connection of two networks.see also mci,at characterizing remote switching that contain multiple devices used for interconnection.accordingly,we conclude that as the qpp permit ongoing access to an ilec switches are interconnection agreements that must be filed under.
furthermore,the switching service in the qpp agreement is related to the provision of unbundled network elements under c.qwest does not dispute that switching is a network element,see qwest utah br.at,and the qpp agreement gives mcimetro ongoing access to switching on an unbundled basis.although the fcc has concluded that a lack of access to switching would not impair mcimetro ability to provide services within the meaning of d b,the fcc has also determined that access to switching generally facilitates a clec ability to provide services,especially in the mass market.trro,at.thus,while access to switching is not required by c,it is related to qwest c obligations because it will assist mcimetro in providing services.as a result,required qwest and mcimetro to file the qpp agreement with the state commissions.
shared transport 
transport trunks are wires carrying calls between switches.iowa utils,at.the fcc has defined shared transport as transmission facilities shared by more than one carrier,including the incumbent lec,between end office switches,between end office switches and tandem switches,and between tandem switches in the incumbent lec network.trro,at see also telecom ass,it has also noted that switching and shared transport are inextricably linked,such that a clec must be given access to unbundled shared transport if it is entitled to unbundled switching under c.trro,at.
in light of this understanding of shared transport,we conclude that shared transport relates to the physical linking of two networks.indeed,calls must often pass through a switch,travel across a shared transport trunk,and then pass through another switch in order to cross from one network to another.in this way,switching and shared transport are inextricably linked and both relate to the physical connection of two networks.
likewise,shared transport relates to qwest obligation to provide unbundled network elements.shared transport is a network element that qwest is providing on an unbundled basis.the fcc has determined that a lack of access to shared transport impairs a clec ability to provide services to the extent that a lack of access to switching impairs the clec ability to provide services.id.as with switching,access to shared transport facilitates the clec provision of services to its customers.it is therefore related to the ilec c duty to provide access to unbundled network elements whose absence would impair the clec ability to provide services.
iii.qwest contrary arguments 
qwest valiantly attempts to persuade us to adopt a very narrow reading of the act and the fcc precedents.it conveniently ignores the word relating in the fcc interpretation of the act,asserting that i f an agreement does not involve these section b and c duties,the section process can not be triggered and the agreement,as a matter of law,can not be an interconnection agreement subject to the section filing requirement.qwest utah br.at emphasis added.in support of this reading,qwest advances four main arguments,all of which we find unpersuasive 
section pursuant to section clause 
first,qwest argues that the introductory clause of a excludes the qpp agreement from the filing requirement.according to a,u pon receiving a request for interconnection,services,or network elements pursuant to section,an ilec may negotiate an interconnection agreement,which must be submitted to the state commission.qwest argues that pursuant to means that the clec must have requested access to an element that the ilec has a duty to provide under c and that the ultimate agreement must implement a section requirement.qwest utah br.at.
in support of this position,qwest points to a recent federal district court decision from montana.qwest schneider,no,dist.lexis.june.in schneider,qwest appealed from a decision by the montana public service commission that asserted jurisdiction over a line sharing agreement between qwest and covad.id.at.the parties in the parties in this that the agreement was for access to an element that was not a required unbundled network element under c.see id.at.thus,the court was confronted with the legal question of whether filing obligation could apply to elements that were not required by.in holding that the agreement was not subject to filing under,the court interpreted pursuant to section to limit the filing obligation to those agreements that contain section obligations.id.at emphasis added.it also held that its interpretation was consistent with the language ongoing obligation relating to section b or c in the fcc declaratory order.see id.at.
qwest argues that the state commissions reached the opposite result after considering that exchange carriers who receive requests pursuant to section may negotiate agreements without regard to the standards set forth in subsections b and c of section.a.qwest asserts that the commissions believed that this phrase freed their approval authority from the specific provisions of those subsections,and it urges us to interpret the phrase as permitting the parties to reach terms not required by for example,a different pricing method but only with respect to the network elements included in c.an alternative understanding of the statute,qwest contends,leaves no practical limit on the agreements over which state commissions would have jurisdiction.qwest utah br.at.
however,qwest reading of the without regard clause does not confirm its interpretation of pursuant to in a.the plain language of directs that when an ilec has received a request for network access as described in b and c resale,number portability,dialing parity,access to,reciprocal compensation,interconnection,unbundled access,or may negotiate an agreement for one or more of these means of network access.see a.the statute does not say that the agreement may only provide what is described in b and c.instead,it must be given a broader reading that is consistent with the fcc understanding of interconnection,services,or network elements.id.a.the most logical reading of the statute is that the filing obligation in covers agreements reached following a request for is,the physical linking of two networks,first local competition order,at network is,facilit ies or equipment used in the provision of telecommunications service,or services.qwest reading is too narrow,both because it would exclude an agreement that contained an ongoing obligation relating to section b or c if it did not specifically include a required element under those subsections and because it would exclude an agreement that contained a required element but was initiated by a request for a element 
it is notable that congress chose three terms with broad meanings interconnection,services or network elements rather than the more specific and narrow language it used in.qwest argues that congress used the term network elements when it meant unbundled network elements as that term is used in.adopting this interpretation would require us to ignore the word unbundled in contravention of the familiar principle of statutory construction that courts should give effect,if possible,to every word that congress has used in a statute.dep t of income maintenance heckler,d.this we refuse to do.
sections and were designed to address different concerns,and congress prescribed different criteria by which to judge compliance with the obligations they impose.while the mandatory provision of a network element under c is triggered by a finding that a lack of access impairs a clec ability to provide services,see d b,a state commission can only reject a voluntarily negotiated agreement if it finds that the agreement is discriminatory or inconsistent with the public interest,see id.e a i ii.thus,obligations reflect congress concern for the interests of the requesting carrier,whereas the filing requirement is driven by concerns for the public interest and the interests of other carriers.congress sensibly recognized that the class of network elements whose would impair a clec ability to enter the market is substantially narrower than the class of network elements whose provision on favorable terms could discriminate or impact the public interest.accordingly,we conclude that congress used unbundled network elements in c and network elements in a because it intended to convey different meanings in those two sections.
it is also significant for the purposes of this case that switching and shared transport are undoubtedly network elements,although they are not included in the category of network elements that must be offered on an unbundled basis pursuant to c and d.switching and shared transport do not qualify as unbundled network elements under c,but we need not look to c for a definition of network element because congress defined the term in.the trro leaves no doubt that the fcc considers switching and shared transport to be network elements,and that understanding is entirely consistent with the definition given in.
therefore,we are not persuaded by qwest argument that the qpp agreement was not subject to filing under because it was not negotiated following a request made pursuant to section.qwest does not challenge the fcc determination that agreements must be filed if they contain an ongoing obligation relating to section b or c,and the commission use of the word relating is entirely consistent with congress use of terms that are similar to,but broader than,those found in.schneider holding that agreements containing an ongoing obligation relating to section b or c are those agreements that contain section obligations is entirely untenable.see schneider,dist.lexis at emphasis added.the practical limit that qwest seeks comes not from the pursuant to clause but from the fcc use of the word relating.thus,not all agreements between carriers must be filed rather,only those containing an ongoing obligation relating to section b or c are subject to filing requirement.
b.the arbitration element of section 
qwest next contends that the range of negotiated agreements subject to filing is coextensive with the range of arbitrated agreements that must be filed pursuant to.because a clec may only compel arbitration of issues that the ilec is under a duty to negotiate pursuant to c,the interconnection agreements that result from arbitration necessarily include only the issues mandated by b and c.see,mci telecomms.bellsouth,cir.qwest argues that it would be strange to interpret interconnection agreement to cover a broader spectrum of issues when the agreement is generated by negotiation than when it is created by arbitration.
we disagree.it makes perfect sense that the commission may only compel an ilec to arbitrate with respect to services that it is under a duty to provide.arbitration is an option specifically designed to address situations where an ilec is under a duty to provide a service but can not reach an agreement with a clec deadlock would violate the ilec statutory duty to provide the element,but allowing no alternative would permit the clec to force the ilec to accept unfavorable terms in order to avoid violating its duty.when negotiations fail,arbitration must be broad enough to allow the ilec to fulfill its statutory obligation.however,the state commissions can not create a duty to provide services not required by the statute,so their arbitration power can not extend beyond the four corners of.
negotiation,on the othe
