opinion of the court 
this case arises out of a special proceeding conducted by the new jersey board of public utilities board to determine rates that would be generally available to telecommunications carriers seeking to negotiate or arbitrate interconnection agreements under the telecommunications act of,stat.telecommunications act or act.the board decided to substitute these newly determined rates for the previously arbitrated rates in an interconnection agreement between communications of new jersey and bell atlantic new jersey now known as verizon new jersey,verizon.brought suit challenging the board substitution.thereafter,the district court entered an order affirming the board decision to substitute rates but reversing the board on its methodology.on appeal,the new jersey division of the ratepayer advocate the advocate,which had been allowed to intervene in the proceedings,contends that the district court erred in holding that the board had the legal and statutory authority to substitute its own rates for those set by arbitration.we will not reach this issue,however,because we conclude that the advocate lacks constitutional standing to bring this appeal.
there are three main parties to this appeal.the appellant,the advocate,is an independent agency of the state of new jersey that is authorized to appear as a party on behalf of ratepayers in all utility matters that are before the board.on the opposing side,the board is an independent agency within the executive branch of the new jersey state government,that has general supervision and regulation of and jurisdiction and control over all public utilities,a.the board is a state public utility commission.federal law defines such entities as those which,under state law,have regulatory jurisdiction over intrastate operations of telecommunications carriers.the other main appellee is verizon,a telecommunications carrier previously known as bell atlantic.
to understand the somewhat complex procedural history of this case,we will begin with the statutory framework that congress established to deregulate local telephone markets.on february,congress enacted the telecommunications act of.see,stat.section of the telecommunications act inserted sections to into title of the united states code.stat.at.
for much of the history of telecommunications,federal law has carved out a regulatory role for state commissions such as the board.prior to,state commissions pervasively regulated local telephone service and granted exclusive franchises to incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,such as bell atlantic in new jersey,to provide service in particular areas see in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,at hereinafter local competition order,amended on other grounds by fcc rcd.
the telecommunications act ended these legal barriers to competition by providing that n o state or local statute or regulation,or other state or local legal requirement,may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.a.with respect to local telephone service,congress sought to create a transition mechanism from the ilec area monopolies to a system of competition,competition based on network facilities other than those owned by the ilecs.see conf,at,reprinted in.network facilities are the physical infrastructure through which telecommunications carriers deliver their phone services.
congress recognized that removing the legal protections traditionally afforded the ilecs would not,by itself,accomplish competition.in particular,congress believed that the ilecs were gatekeepers of telephone consumers in their respective areas,in part,because of their control over local network facilities.see conf,at,reprinted in.congress further believed that new telecommunications carriers clecs entering local telephone markets could not effectively compete with the ilecs if the new entrants were required to duplicate the ilecs networks before providing local service.see local competition order,at.
because of these concerns,congress imposed certain affirmative duties on ilecs to advance the transition toward competition.thus,among other things,ilecs must permit requesting telecommunications carriers to interconnect their facilities with the ilec network,c lease certain elements of their local network to carriers on an unbundled basis,that is,allow the use of individual pieces of the network,id.c sell carriers,at wholesale rates,any telecommunications services that the ilec provides to its own customers at retail rates,in order to allow those carriers to resell the services,id.c and allow carriers to construct facilities necessary for interconnection on the ilec premises,id.c.
the telecommunications act sets forth a procedure for arriving at the prices that an ilec may charge telecommunications carriers for interconnection to the ilec local network interconnection rates,as well as for the other services detailed above.id.thus,the act invites carriers to negotiate binding interconnection agreements with the ilec.id.a.the act allows parties to interconnection negotiations to petition the designated state commission to mediate or to arbitrate any unresolved issues.id.a,b.furthermore,state commissions have certain powers with respect to arbitrated agreements,such as the power to accept or reject agreements.see generally id.
in new jersey,the enactment of the telecommunications act in february led to the commencement of several proceedings.in december,in anticipation of the passage of the telecommunications act,the board began an investigation of the appropriate terms for local telephone competition in new jersey.on june,after the enactment of the telecommunications act,the board instituted a proceeding to establish the terms and conditions under which the local exchange market in new jersey should be opened to competition the generic proceeding.thereafter,the board stated that it would review interconnection agreements reached through arbitration,mediation,or negotiation in conformity with and.the board also stated that the generic proceeding would set rates,terms,and conditions that would be generally available for parties to adopt freely in negotiating and arbitrating interconnection agreements.
after the generic proceeding was underway,a number of telecommunications carriers sought to avail themselves of the provisions of the telecommunications act by negotiating or arbitrating interconnection agreements with ilecs.one of these carriers was,which,on march,asked bell atlantic to enter into an interconnection agreement pursuant to a.following negotiations with bell atlantic,petitioned the board on july,to arbitrate several unresolved issues.the board allowed the arbitration bell atlantic arbitration to be conducted by outside experts.
on august,the board noted the existence of ongoing negotiations and arbitrations between carriers and ilecs to set interconnection rates,but nevertheless decided to continue with the generic proceeding,stating that the information developed in the generic proceeding may well be relevant in assisting the board to avoid disparate or inconsistent decisions with respect to the issues in the arbitrations.app.at.a short while later,on august,the board rejected the advocate request to participate in the arbitrations,reasoning that the arbitrations were affairs and that the advocate would have the opportunity to comment in the generic proceeding before the board ruled on individual agreements resulting from the pending negotiations and arbitrations.
the board invited numerous parties to participate in the generic proceeding.testimony began on november,and lasted for twenty days.the advocate and representatives of segments of the telecommunications industry attended the hearings.fifteen parties submitted briefs and four different cost studies were presented.at the conclusion,the board determined a number of rates and conditions for interconnection and other services under the telecommunications act the generic rates.
four days after the beginning of testimony in the generic proceeding,
