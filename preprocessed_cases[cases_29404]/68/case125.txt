appellants,representing the michigan public service commission mpsc,a state regulatory body,seek review of the district court order stating that certain regulatory orders issued by the mpsc violate the public utilities regulatory policies act of purpa.the question presented is whether the mpsc orders created a case or controversy that can be adjudicated by a federal court,and if so,whether the members of the mpsc may be sued in their individual capacities.finding no case or controversy,we vacate the order of the district court and remand this matter to the district court,with instructions to dismiss the case.
this matter arises from the michigan public services commission mpsc appeal of the district court decision interpreting a series of mpsc orders.in,in preparation for deregulation of the electric industry,the mpsc issued a series of orders dealing with the recovery of stranded costs.the plaintiffs,a group of electric power generators,requested clarification of certain mpsc orders with regard to how the orders would affect their rights under contracts they had entered into pursuant to a federal statute.the mpsc then issued additional orders stating that the previous orders did not,and were not intended to,affect the rights of any parties under the power purchase agreements.the plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment to determine the effect that the mpsc orders had on their contract rights.the district court denied the mpsc motion to dismiss for lack of a case or controversy and granted summary judgment for the power producers,holding that to the extent that the mpsc orders infringed upon their contract rights,the orders were void.the mpsc filed a timely appeal to this court.
the public utilities regulatory policies act of purpa was enacted as part of the national energy act in response to the energy crisis of the.congress sought to lessen the dependence of electric utilities on fossil fuels by encouraging the development of alternative power sources in the form of cogeneration facilities,which create several forms of energy,for example,electricity and steam or other forms of useful energy which are useful for industrial,commercial,heating or cooling purposes,and small power production facilities.a.section a of purpa directs the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to promulgate rules to encourage the development of alternative sources of power,including rules requiring utilities to buy electricity from statutorily defined qualifying facilities qfs and requiring the setting of rates that are just and reasonable to ratepayers the price paid by the utility for this power is not to exceed the in the statute the incremental cost of alternative electric energy the utility would incur in generating the electricity itself or in purchasing it from a generator.see b.in the regulations promulgated under the statute,this cost is called the avoided cost.
transactions under purpa are structured as follows the transmitting utility contracts to purchase power from a qf at a cost not to exceed the cost the utility would incur to generate or purchase the power from a generator.that avoided cost,which the transmitting utility would have incurred in generating the power itself,is built into customers rates with the approval of the relevant state regulator in this case the mpsc.thus,the qf is guaranteed a certain level of sales,the utility essentially buys the qf power for what it would have cost the utility to generate the power itself,and the rate that the public pays for the power includes the avoided cost to the transmitting utility.courts have implicitly adopted the congressional rationale that what excess consumers might pay in terms of avoided is offset by the general public good of developing alternative energy sources.see american paper institute american electric power service corporation,d.
to further encourage these alternative power sources,purpa also reduced the regulatory burden on qfs.see ferc mississippi,d.purpa requires the ferc to promulgate regulations exempting qfs from most federal regulations and state laws and regulations respecting the rates,of electrical utilities.e.
this regulatory landscape changed when congress enacted the energy policy act of.see.this act gave the ferc authority to promulgate regulations opening the wholesale electrical market,paving the way for complete deregulation and competition.the energy policy act of did not amend or repeal the provisions of purpa requiring utilities to purchase power from qfs at the full avoided cost.see west penn power pennsylvania public utility commission.however,this move towards competition created the new issue of stranded costs.stranded investment represents that portion of capacity which has capital costs and operating costs so great that the power is produced at a cost that will not be competitive in the coming competitive marketplace id.stranded costs are the portion of that stranded investment that may be passed on to ratepayers to compensate the utility for stranded investment undertaken because of regulatory requirements.the question left for states to answer is to what extent avoided costs are recoverable as stranded costs.
beginning in january of,the mpsc began to issue orders to create a framework for the restructuring of the electric utility industry in michigan.the commission held public meetings and accepted public comments throughout the process.on june,the mpsc issued an order detailing its plan for deregulating the industry.the plan phases in customer choice of electricity providers,allowing choice for all customers by.the order permits utilities to collect stranded costs through the year.recovery of stranded costs is essentially remuneration for investment undertaken pursuant to regulatory requirements.under the old regime,utilities invested and submitted to regulatory rate control in exchange for monopoly status.as their monopoly status is revoked,the utility transmitters are allowed some recovery of this investment.
the mpsc limited the recovery of stranded costs to five categories regulatory assets,capital costs of nuclear plants,contract capacity costs arising from power purchase agreements,employee retraining costs,and costs related to implementing restructuring.on october,the mpsc issued more orders regarding the collection of stranded costs,stating that c ustomers who choose to continue as customers of the utilities will continue to pay those costs in their bundled rates.customers who choose to obtain generation services elsewhere will pay those stranded costs for their continued use of the distribution system.mpsc case no.opinion and order,october.the order also stated that the mpsc would implement a mechanism to prevent or of stranded costs as the new market forms.id.
during the public comment period,one of the qfs midland cogeneration venture,a plaintiff in this case argued that the mechanism must provide for full recovery of the qfs contracts throughout the life of those contracts.
the mpsc addressed this concern in its october,order saying 
the qualifying facilities have confused the recovery of stranded costs and the enforcement of power purchase agreements.there is nothing in the mechanism that affects the rights of the mcv or any qualifying facility.to the extent the qualifying facilities have enforceable contracts,the utilities remain obligated to honor the contracts and remain free to seek recovery of those costs from ratepayers.neither approval for the utilities to recover stranded costs nor approval of a mechanism changes the rights of the qualifying facilities.the commission therefore concludes that it need not address concerns about recovery of costs beyond.mpsc case no,opinion and order,pp.october.
concerned over the utilities ability to collect the avoided costs through the stranded cost mechanism,and subsequently make good on the power purchase agreements ppas,the qfs requested a rehearing of the october,orders.after rehearing,the commission issued an order on january,reiterating its previous conclusions.the qfs then asked for clarification regarding how the stranded cost collection and the p
