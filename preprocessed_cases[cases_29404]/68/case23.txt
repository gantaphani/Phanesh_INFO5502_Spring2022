the question presented is whether former utility company employees who took advantage of early retirement programs are entitled by reason of a labor agreement to vested lifetime dental benefits that could not be changed by the company.such dental benefits are not given to other former employees or to present employees.these benefits are welfare benefit plan benefits under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.welfare benefit plans plans that provide medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment,id.are not subject to the strict vesting requirements of erisa pension benefit plans.schoonejongen,d.employers are generally free for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans.id.
employers may provide retirees with vested retiree welfare benefits by contract or otherwise.u nder both section of the labor management and relations act lmra and erisa,if an employer promises vested benefits,that promise will be enforced.am.fed of grain millers int l multifoods,cir.the issue,then,is whether the labor agreements here provided for vested lifetime dental plan benefits that could not be changed by the company.the standard by which this question is evaluated is one of first impression in this court.
retired union employees of commonwealth gas company and their union,the united steelworkers of america,local,filed suit against the retirees former employer and its successor,nstar electric gas corporation.the plaintiffs took advantage of one of two early retirement programs offered by the company,one in and one in.these early retirement programs erps were negotiated between the company and the union,and the negotiated terms were memorialized in two memoranda of agreement the erp agreements.these erp agreements are enforceable under of the lmra,a.
the erps offered retirees continuing health and dental benefits,in line with the benefits that had been given to retirees by the company before the erps.in late,the company announced a number of changes,including the change that dental benefits for all retirees ceased once the retiree reached years of age,unless the retiree had already reached that age as of april.
the plaintiffs brought suit,alleging that the decision to cease reimbursement of their medicare part b premiums and dental plan coverage violated,inter alia,of the lmra,a,and a of erisa,id.a b,because,in their view,the decision was contrary to the erps which were part of the and erp agreements.
the district court granted the company motion for summary judgment on all counts.see senior nstar gas,d.although plaintiffs originally styled their case as raising claims both under erisa and,their claims,as reframed on appeal,are in fact dependent upon an interpretation of the labor agreements and otherwise state no independent erisa claim we analyze the case under of the lmra.
we affirm,though on different grounds than those relied on by the district court.
we recount the facts,taking all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs,the parties,as is done on summary judgment motions.see douglas york county,cir.the basic facts are not in dispute.to understand the dispute about the benefits provided for in the and erps at issue here,one needs to understand the status of those benefits before adoption of the erps.
retiree dental benefits predating the erps 
retiree dental benefits prior to april,
from april,to april,the collective bargaining agreements cbas between the company and the union provided dental benefits for current employees the cbas specified a particular dental plan and incorporated the terms and conditions of that plan.the cbas did not,however,explicitly provide dental benefits for retirees.still,the record reveals that union employees of commonwealth gas were given dental benefits upon retirement during this period.
the plaintiffs put into evidence personalized retirement benefits summaries,prepared by the company benefits coordinator,which were given to union employees who retired before and who are not plaintiffs here.these summaries described expected benefits,including pension payments,the employee savings plan,disability benefits,and life,medical,and dental insurance.one such summary given to an employee who retired in stated,as to dental coverage,in full your dental plan coverage will continue for you,your spouse and your dependent children.the summary also contained references to plan documents in all cases,the exact provision of the various benefit contracts and applicable laws will determine the benefits to be paid thereunder.
similar retirement benefits summaries were given to employees retiring in,and and contained nearly identical language concerning continued dental plan coverage and identical references to plan documents.
retiree dental benefits after april,
the cba covering the period from april,to april,like the agreements predating it,did not explicitly address retiree dental benefits,but provided for dental benefits for e ligible employees eligible employees,and their eligible spouses and dependents,will be covered under the terms and conditions of dental service of massachusetts,dpp ii,as amended,the provisions of which are made a part of this contract.
however,on april,the cba was amended,effective april,to provide with respect to dental benefits for qualified employees who retired after april,
dental plan 
benefits after retirement or termination 
if you were age or over with or more years of service as of january,and subsequently retire or terminate with the rule of with the system companies you will be eligible for the sponsored delta dental plan.if you retire or terminate prior to age,you will pay of dental premiums in effect as of january,of the year in which you terminate or retire.when you reach age,will pay your entire premium.
this amendment did not change retiree benefits,but only clarified the eligibility requirements for benefits,at least with respect to employees covered by the contract the dental benefits provided in the and erps closely mirrored the dental benefits already provided to union retirees via the amendment to the cba.
the personalized summaries given after april,to retiring employees reflected the new agreement.one such document given to a union employee retiring in,entitled information relative to employee benefits upon your retirement date,stated,for covered retirees meeting the threshold requirements your dental plan coverage will continue for you,your spouse and eligible dependents,and you will pay of the current premium january,premium at retirement from age to age.when you reach age,the company will pay the entire premium.the summary also contained the same reference to plan documents as earlier personalized retirement benefits summaries in all cases,the exact provisions of the various benefit contracts and applicable laws will determine the benefits to be paid thereunder.
the cba covering april,to april,again does not make explicit reference to the eligibility requirements for retiree benefits,providing only that e ligible employees,and their eligible spouses and dependents,will be covered under the terms and conditions of dental service of massachusetts,dpp ii,as amended,the provisions of which are made a part of this contract.however,the plaintiffs,in response to interrogatories,admitted that the cba did not change the retiree benefits established by the amendment to the cba.
indeed,with respect to dental benefits,a personalized retirement benefits summary given to an employee who retired on july,after the effective date of the cba contained language identical to the personalized benefits summary described above.it appears that under the cba,retirees were eligible for dental benefits to the same extent as provided in the amendment to the cba.
this sets the stage for the dispute about the erp benefits.
dental plan documents 
again,we give the background,working up to the time of the erps.much of the dispute here relates to the documents governing retiree dental plans,and the extent to which we must look to these documents when interpreting the and erp agreements.
it is undisputed that the dental plan contracts during all relevant times reserved the right of the company to amend,modify,or terminate the applicable dental plan although the plaintiffs point out that at times these reservations are made subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements the documentary evidence on record supports this conclusion three key points are not in dispute that such plan documents were explicitly incorporated into the and cbas,that the plaintiffs here received the plan documents,and that the separate memoranda of agreement which created the erps in and do not contain an explicit reference to plan documents.
the company periodically distributed summary plan descriptions spds for the dental plans to all employees these are,in part,the plan contracts or plan documents referred to in the cbas and other documents.one such spd,for the dental protection plan ii offered by delta dental plan,contains a revision date of june as to termination,the spd provides your plan sponsor may cancel your contract for any reason.in a section titled rights,that spd also provides although commonwealth energy system and subsidiary companies intends to continue this plan indefinitely,it reserves the right to amend any provisions or terminate the plan at any time.
another spd with a revision date of january for the deltapremier ii plan,also offered by delta dental plan of massachusetts,similarly provides for the company unrestrained right to terminate the plan your plan sponsor may cancel your contract for any reason.to do so,your plan sponsor must give us notice in writing at least days prior to the termination date.
an spd issued in as part of an employee benefits handbook stated,at the end of the section describing the deltapremier ii plan,under the heading your rights 
this section of the handbook describes the deltapremier ii plan in general.if any conflict arises between this summary plan description and the plan contract,or if any point is not covered,the terms of the plan contract will always govern.
the company reserves the right,subject to the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement,to amend,modify or terminate the plan at any time.
similar language appeared at the end of another spd for the dental blue program issued as part of the same handbook.in both these spds,the reserved rights of the company are constrained by the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement.
in february,the company sent to employees a package of updated spds.this package included an spd with a revision date of september,for the dental blue program offered by blue cross and blue shield of massachusetts.it contains an unconditional right to termination your plan sponsor may terminate your contract for any reason.but the document also contains language,under the heading your rights,substantially similar to the language under that same heading quoted from the spd,making the reserved rights subject to the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement.fahy and phipps received these spds after they elected to participate in the erp 
c.the early retirement programs 
personnel reduction program 
in,after commonwealth gas and commonwealth electric merged,the new entity,established an erp for company employees called the personnel reduction program prp.the company also entered into negotiations with local to allow the union employees to take advantage of the prp.these negotiations resulted in a memorandum of agreement,effective may.the agreement specified that employees taking advantage of the prp would receive a severance payment,educational and outplacement assistance,and group life insurance.the agreement provided 
insurance coverage 
employees who were at least age forty and had completed at least twelve full years of system service as of january,and currently meet the rule of will be entitled to medical and dental insurance coverage providing they pay ten percent of the current medical and dental premium until age.at age,the company will pay of the premium.
thus,this erp agreement provided the retirement benefits to certain union retirees,as plaintiffs here were,on the same terms as had been provided to retirees since april,it also preserved the date against which one aspect of eligibility was to be measured,so that only employees who had met the age and length of service requirements as of january,and then retired after meeting the rule of,could receive the dental benefits described.this latter provision ensured that the prp,on this issue,would not provide greater benefits than available earlier.there is nothing in the bargaining history for this erp agreement showing that the company and the union had agreed to increase the dental benefits for employees retiring under the prp,and make them vested and unchangeable.
the company gave to both union and employees a brochure entitled personnel reduction program information for commonwealth energy system and subsidiary companies employees in.the brochure contained information about the benefits available via the personnel reduction program.the brochure describes dental benefits in language identical to that found in the memorandum of agreement these same benefits terms also applied to employees.the brochure,however,also pointed employees to the plan documents and said that in case of conflict,the plan documents prevailed 
this summary is not intended to offer detailed descriptions of the system employee benefit plans.all information furnished is governed by the provisions of the actual plan documents pertaining to the appropriate benefit plans.if any conflict arises between this summary and the system employee benefit plan documents,or if any point is not covered,the terms of the appropriate plan documents will govern in all cases.
the plan documents,in turn,contained the reservation of the company right to modify or terminate the plan.
plaintiffs support their argument that the agreement granted vested lifetime benefits that could not be changed with two sets of items in evidence.the first are oral statements.fahy and phipps expressed interest in the prp and met with the company human resources personnel on several occasions.at these meetings,fahy and phipps were told that the benefits were lifetime benefits.they were not told this could be revised at any time.
further,in october of,fahy and phipps were each given a personalized document entitled information relative to employee benefits upon your retirement date,similar to the personalized retirement benefits summaries given to retirees before the prp.as to dental insurance,for both fahy and phipps the summary provided 
since you were age and had or more years of employment as of january,you will be covered by the company sponsored dental plan at your actual retirement date.
you will pay of the current premium the premium in effect as of the first of the year in which you retire from age to age.when you reach age,the company will pay the entire premium.
coverage for your spouse eligible dependents will be provided.
your dental coverage will be for your life.your spouse eligible dependents will be covered for months after your death 
emphasis added.these personalized documents differed from earlier such documents in that they stated that dental coverage will be for your life and that the retiree spouse and dependents would receive benefits for a period after the retiree death.the earlier personalized documents had provided only that the retirees dental benefits would continue.nonetheless,the personalized documents given to fahy and phipps also provided the same reference to the plan documents as the prp brochure,that the terms of the appropriate plan documents will govern in all cases.
fahy and phipps later received a series of spds,including the spd for the dental plan dental blue plan.these plan documents contained reservation of rights language.this was not the first time these plaintiffs had received the spds rather,spds for all the benefit plans were distributed periodically to all employees.
voluntary separation program 
in,merged with bec energy the parent company of boston edison and formed a new holding company,nstar.as part of this merger,the company created another erp for employees,the voluntary separation program vsp.negotiations between the company and the union resulted in another memorandum of agreement,effective august,allowing union employees to take advantage of the vsp.the memorandum of agreement provided that the company will offer the following voluntary separation program vsp to all employees that are members of the united steelworkers of america,local.at least with respect to health and dental benefits,the vsp agreement was identical to the prp agreement with the exception of a slight difference in cobra payments for retirees who did not meet the age and length of service requirements.it too preserved the january,date against which one aspect of eligibility for the dental benefits at issue here was to be measured.like with the erp agreement,there is nothing in the bargaining history for the erp agreement to suggest that the parties intended to provide unchangeable lifetime dental benefits to employees taking advantage of the vsp.
two versions of a program summary describing the vsp were given to employees,one for employees represented by certain unions including local and one for all other employees including all employees.neither version contained the particulars of the dental benefits.they stated that i f you are eligible for medical,dental and live insurance coverages,you will receive information from human at the time of your termination.both versions stated that i f any conflict arises between this summary and either the company employee benefit plan documents or the agreement and general release,or if any point is not covered,then the terms of the appropriate plan documents or agreement and general release,as appropriate,will govern in all cases.
however,the version of the program summary that was distributed to employees,in contrast to the union employees,contained the following statement the company reserves the right to change or terminate coverage for current and former employees at any time.any such change may be in the benefits provided,the contributions required,or in any other aspect in accordance with applicable laws.hirl and postma point to the lack of such a statement in the version of the vsp program summary given them as evidence that,as to members of local,the company intended the benefits to be unconditionally perpetual.
plaintiffs hirl and postma expressed interest in the vsp and met with company representatives.at these meetings,postma was told that his dental benefits would continue for as long as he lived and hirl was told that nothing in the contract could be changed.hirl and postma each received individualized retirement summaries these summaries are identical to the personalized summaries given to plaintiffs fahy and phipps under the prp as to the description of dental coverage your coverage will be for your life.and the reference to plan documents all information furnished is governed by the provisions of the actual plan documents pertaining to the appropriate benefit plans.
the plaintiffs do not dispute that spds were periodically distributed to all employees,and do not suggest that hirl and postma did not have access to or knowledge of the spds.
cancellation of retiree dental benefits 
for a number of years after the formation of nstar,the company maintained separate retiree health plans for retirees of and boston edison.the company decided to consolidate these plans on april,and in so doing,to make a number of changes to retiree health benefits,including terminating dental plan coverage for certain retirees and ceasing reimbursement of medicare part b premiums for all retirees.
in late,the company notified the plaintiffs and other retirees including retirees that if they had not reached age by april,their dental benefits would cease as soon as they reached age retirees who had reached age by that date would continue to receive dental benefits for life.the plaintiffs here were not age as of april.plaintiffs fahy and phipps lost their dental benefits after turning,and hirl and postma expect to lose their dental benefits as soon as they turn.the letter also stated that medicare part b reimbursements would stop for all retirees on april.
the company says the changes to retiree benefit plans were needed to save money on retirement benefits,normalize the benefits among retirees of boston edison and,and align retiree medical plans with those offered to current employees boston edison retirees never received dental benefits,while commonwealth gas retirees did.the company also notes that some of the changes provided additional benefits to retirees.present employees who retire will not receive dental benefits.
after the company announced its changes to retiree health and dental plan coverage,the plaintiffs filed suit challenging the termination of dental coverage and medicare part b reimbursement.the complaint alleged violations of a b of erisa,which provides a remedy for an improper denial of benefits,a b,and of of the lmra,which provides a remedy for a violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization,id.a,as well as claims based on theories of breach of fiduciary duty and estoppel under erisa,and claims under state law.
after discovery,plaintiffs and the company filed for summary judgment.on may,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion and granted the company motion on all counts.senior,d at.judgment entered against the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs challenge on appeal the district court decision only as to their claim that the termination of dental coverage violated of the lmra.the medicare part b reimbursement issue has dropped from the case.
the district court did not specifically anchor its reasoning as to the claims for dental benefits in the lmra although it did reject plaintiffs reliance on the erp agreements and the program brochures,stating none of these documents make any mention of vesting,and they do not indicate the duration of the dental benefits.as such,they are not sufficient to show that the retirees dental benefits were vested.id.at.
the district court found that the only documents with explicit language suggesting a vesting of dental benefits were the individualized benefits summaries given to each of the plaintiffs,which stated that y our dental coverage will be for your life.it also noted that the individualized summaries directed the retiree to consult actual plan documents these documents reserved the right of the company to amend,modify or terminate the plan at any time.id.at.the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that this reservation of rights language only gave the company the right to terminate a particular policy with a particular provider,but that coverage was to be perpetual.id.at.it thus refuse d to infer a vesting requirement based on personalized documents that plainly state they are not governing.id.
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.see mulvihill golf,cir.
we wish to be clear about what the case is about.this is not an issue of whether some documents in the erps stated that there would be lifetime dental benefits.the question is,rather,about whether there is a triable issue of fact that such a statement,when coupled with a reservation by the company of its right to change benefits,in light of the bargaining history and practice,usage and custom here,amounts to a promise by the company never to change the benefits announced.
interpretation of labor contracts,such as the erp agreements,under the lmra is a matter of federal common law.see fant new eng.power serv,cir.the retirees bear the burden of proving that their welfare plan benefits are vested and can not be changed by the company.see int l ass of machinists aerospace workers masonite,cir uaw skinner engine,cir.
acting against the background law that welfare plan benefits are generally not vested,rail employees ass atchison,topeka santa fe ry,d,the circuits have taken somewhat different approaches to resolving the question of whether a labor agreement has created vested rights in benefits also covered by erisa.the district court used the test that unless the labor agreement contained a clear and express statement of vesting,there is no vesting of erisa benefits.we reject that clear and express statement test,in this situation,as not compelled by federal labor law 
rejection of use of presumptions here 
under the federal law governing the interpretation of a labor contract under the lmra,a court should resort to traditional principles of contract interpretation to the extent such principles are consistent with federal labor law.see textile workers union of am.lincoln mills,d see also yolton el paso.pipeline,cir skinner engine,at masonite,at united paperworkers int l union champion int l,cir.
the parties take exaggerated positions,relying on optimistic readings of cases,to suggest that federal labor law requires us to abandon traditional contract principles and apply a presumption in their favor.the retirees argue that they are entitled to a presumption in labor agreements for vesting of benefits in their favor the company argues that there should be a presumption in labor agreements against vesting of benefits.neither is correct.
the plaintiffs rely on an old sixth circuit decision,uaw,cir,which that circuit has since held does not stand for the proposition that there is a presumption in favor of vesting benefits in yolton,the court said all that and subsequent cases instruct is that the court should apply ordinary principles of contract interpretation.id.at 
the company,in turn,overreads skinner engine,which involved construction of a cba that provided for retiree welfare benefits.the court found that the promise of benefits did not extend beyond the term of the cba.in doing so,it stated that under erisa,b ecause vesting of welfare plan benefits constitutes an commitment,an employer commitment to vest such benefits is not to be inferred lightly and must be stated in clear and explicit language,and that this cautionary principle applied to the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements as well.id.at.we do not read skinner engine to set forth a strict clear and explicit statement rule as suggested by the defendants.the bulk of the court opinion in skinner engine relied on traditional rules of contract construction to determine the meaning of the cba.id.at quoting,at see also id.at relying on language and context,and rejecting extrinsic evidence provided by plaintiffs.in addition,the court in skinner engine undertook an extended discussion of the plaintiffs argument that the contract was ambiguous,which likely would have been unnecessary had the court in fact relied on a strict clear and express statement rule.see id.at 
our view is that in a claim for benefits based on a labor agreement under the lmra federal labor law creates no presumption regarding vesting.this is in line with the view of some other circuits.see rossetto pabst brewing,cir grain millers,at.there are many reasons for our view.it certainly is possible that labor and management could bargain and intend to provide vested retirement welfare benefits that could not be changed as part of an early retirement plan or a voluntary severance plan,and yet fail to put in certain customary words we fear that the use of presumptions may interfere with the correct interpretation,under normal lmra rules,of the understanding reached by the parties.secondly,the use of presumptions may also be inconsistent with the dynamics of bargaining set up under the national labor relations act,and the lmra.third,congress could easily have created interpretive presumptions by statute had it cared to do so.the text of the lmra does not contain any statutory presumptions.
fourth,though the courts sometimes create judicial interpretive presumptions,there is no reason to craft judicial default rules here.see bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc.the supreme court has crafted only one presumption under the lmra the presumption in favor of arbitrability in labor contracts,which applies when a cba contains an arbitration clause.see local,serv.employees int l union nonotuck res.assocs,cir.as the supreme court stated in united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigation,d,such a presumption is required in order to be consistent with congressional policy in favor of settlement of disputes by the parties through the machinery of arbitration.id.at.see also at t,commc ns workers of,d.we see no similar congressional policy here.
fifth,in the end,the question will usually be one of the degree of clarity that benefits were or were not unalterably vested,and if vested,under what conditions.there are traditional rules of interpretation of labor agreements which have proven adequate to answer those questions as to benefits,and we do not see why those rules would not work when erisa benefits are at stake.those are the rules we use.
interpretation of the erp labor agreements 
having determined that traditional principles of labor contract interpretation apply to the dispute at issue in this appeal,we turn to those principles to determine whether the erp agreements provided for vesting benefits that could not be changed by the company.
an unambiguous contract must be enforced according to its terms,under both the common law and labor law.see grain millers,at holding in lmra case that a ll courts agree that if a document unambiguously indicates whether retiree medical benefits are vested,the unambiguous language should be enforced see also rossetto,at,at.the question of whether a contract is ambiguous is generally a question of law for the judge,and is subject to de novo review.see champion,at see also lohnes level commc ns,cir describing this rule as a bedrock principle.
we look first to the language of the erp agreements.plaintiffs argue that the language in the erp agreements is unambiguous in creating a vested entitlement to lifetime dental benefits that could not be changed by the company.defendants argue the erp agreements clearly express that the company retained its ability to alter benefits.we disagree with both positions.
the language in the erp agreements stating that at age the company will pay the entire premium does not establish that the parties intended the company to be unconditionally obligated for lifetime dental benefits.the language does not provide a durational term to the retirement benefits.rather,it defines the level of benefits a retiree may receive at a certain age the company pays ninety percent of the premium for dental coverage for retirees under years of age,but when the retiree reaches,the company pays of the premium.there is no language regarding the duration of the contract.
since the erp agreements do not unambiguously answer the question of whether the company bound itself not to ever change the dental benefits granted,we look to the pertinent rules of interpretation.there are several sources.one is a normal rule of contract interpretation,the others are rules about interpreting labor agreements.
under general principles of contract law,a contract that does not explicitly incorporate another agreement may nonetheless implicitly incorporate that agreement.for instance,williston states 
w hen the same parties execute two instruments concerning the same subject matter,they may,under some circumstances,be regarded as one contract and construed together whether made simultaneously or on different days,the fact that they were made or dated at different times being insignificant if they are related to and were part of the same transaction.
moreover,reference to an extraneous document may be essential to the interpretation and construction of a contract because,even though the writings in question were neither executed on the same day nor made by the same parties,the later writing may so far pertain to the same transaction as the earlier that its meaning at the time and place that it was made can be understood only by reference to the earlier writing.
lord,williston on contracts ed.footnotes omitted.corbin similarly notes 
internal references in one document to another are often helpful in the processes of interpretation and adjudication,but the absence of such a reference does not make a document unusable in these processes or inadmissible in evidence.its connection and relevancy can be established otherwise.
corbin on contracts.
this principle of general contract law aligns with substantive principles of interpretation of labor agreements,particularly the supreme court instruction that i n order to interpret a labor agreement it is necessary to consider the scope of other related collective bargaining agreements,as well as the practice,usage and customs pertaining to such agreements.cn employees union union pac,d.courts have relied on this principle,in a variety of circumstances,to construe related labor agreements together,even where there is no express incorporation of terms.see sprague cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund,cir interpreting a cba together with an earlier agreement that had not expressly been incorporated into the cba,where the parties intended that the plan be considered with the cba and the cba would not exist without the earlier agreement citing employees union,at.cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund kroger,cir every indication surrounding the execution of the cba points to the conclusion that the union and kroger intended the master agreement and the local supplement to comprise one agreement,and any consideration of the cba must begin with the recognition that it is one contract we are two.am.fed.of labor union,cir holding that a cba had implicitly incorporated the specific terms of a separate benefit and pension plan where the cba stated that the company would not abandon its existing benefit and pension plan.see also murphy keystone steel wire,cir rejecting an argument,in an erisa case,that a welfare benefit plan should be read in isolation from a cba,where the cba and plan were negotiated together,rested on the same consideration,and the cba expressly incorporated the plan terms.
it is also important to look at the broader context of a cba because the source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract,as the industrial common practices of the industry and the equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it.warrior gulf navigation,at.cn employees union,at.this rule is not simply a rule about the power of arbitrators.the rule has been recognized and used by courts,including the supreme court,as substantive law of labor contract interpretation.see consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d.in consolidated rail,the court stated 
i t is well established that the parties practice,usage and custom is of significance in interpreting their agreement.this court has observed a collective bargaining agreement is not an ordinary contract for the purchase of goods and services,nor is it governed by the same old concepts which control such private contracts i t is a generalized code to govern a myriad of cases which the draftsmen can not wholly anticipate the collective agreement covers the whole employment relationship.it calls into being a new common common law of a particular industry or of a particular plant.
id.citations omitted alteration and omissions in original quoting cn employees union,at.see also sprague cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund,at holding that when interpreting a cba a court must consider practices,usage and customs pertaining to related agreements quoting cn employees union,at.maurer joy,cir same bidlack,at reviewing prior cbas and prior custom and usage to interpret a later cba porter,at accord cherry,at relying on parties practice to find that neither party understood the benefits to be permanent or inalterable.
whether related agreements are to be construed together under the lmra depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.see lord,supra,to what extent the various provisions in another connected document should be interpreted as part of the writing in question depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.here,there are a number of factors that lead us to construe the erp agreements together with the underlying cba and the plan documents.the same union and the involved in the formation of the cba and the erp agreements.these parties negotiated the erp agreements against the background understandings they had under the cba and the plan documents,and there is no evidence that the parties intended the erp agreements to stand independently of the cba or the plan documents.
second,the practice,usage,and custom of the parties make the other cbas and the plan documents relevant.retiree dental benefits had been provided for a number of years and entitlement to dental benefits upon retirement was a subject treated variously either under the plan documents alone,or under both the cba and the plan documents.it would move away from the practice,usage and custom of the parties to now read the erp agreements as standing alone.third,the terms of the erp agreements are summary the agreements are only two pages,refer to dental insurance coverage but do not refer to a particular plan,and leave out many details which are only provided in the dental plan documents,such as the level of reimbursement for various dental health services.fourth,all other documentary evidence related to the erps,including that relied on by the plaintiffs,states that the plan documents will govern in all cases.
thus,we look here to related agreements,the practices in the company,and the custom and usage as to retiree dental benefits.the company had long provided union and dental benefits.these benefits were not originally provided for under a collectively bargained agreement.rather,during that time,the relevant terms of retiree dental coverage were provided in the dental plan documents,not the collective bargaining agreements.these dental plan documents,at all times,reserved the right of the company to amend,modify,and terminate plan coverage.plaintiffs do not claim that,during this time,the company had in fact been providing vested lifetime dental benefits that could not be changed by the company.
in,the union and the company agreed to amend the cba then in effect,to change only the threshold eligibility requirements for retiree dental benefits.that cba did incorporate the dental plan documents.this change to eligibility requirements locked in the date at which employees would be eligible for retiree dental benefits,so that only employees who met the age and length of service requirements as of january,would continue to be eligible for dental benefits which they would receive if they also met the rule of at retirement.this change reflects the parties understanding that employees who,by,had served a certain number of years and were of a certain age should continue to eligible for company preexisting retiree dental benefit program,while other employees would not get such benefits 
it was against this background that the union and the company entered into the cba governing the years to.although that cba in effect when the plaintiffs retired did not itself expressly mention retiree dental benefits,the plaintiffs acknowledged that such benefits continued into the relevant period under the amendment to the collective bargaining agreement.it is clear under that cba that no employee,retired or current,had lifetime dental benefits which could not be changed by the company.this was clear at the time the erp agreements were being negotiated.the effect of the erps was to give the employees who retired under them the same dental benefits the other employees had.plaintiffs argue that the erp went beyond this position of parity that the erp in fact put the erp retirees in a better position than all other employees and retirees of the company.as we shall see,there is no language anywhere incorporating the plaintiffs interpretation.
if the intent of the bargain contained in the erp agreements was to remove the reservation of rights the company had always retained and to advantage plaintiffs over all other employees,one would expect the agreement,or some other relevant document,to say so.as we discuss,the bargaining history shows nothing of the sort.
the erp agreements contain nothing which purported to change the terms of dental benefits tha
