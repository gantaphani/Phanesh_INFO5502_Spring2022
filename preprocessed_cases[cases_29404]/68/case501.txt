on december,this court affirmed the district court decision to deny the government motion.the government filed a suggestion that this court rehear that december decision en banc.this court unanimously accepted the petition.accordingly,this court,acting en banc,vacated the judgment of this court entered on december,and reported at.the en banc court then reassigned the opinion to the panel for revision.because the court of federal claims can offer an adequate remedy in this case,this court now reverses and remands.
con ed sued the government,challenging the constitutionality of epact.before epact,con ed contracted with the government for uranium enrichment services under a series of agreements.after enactment of epact in,the government began decontaminating and decommissioning several of its uranium processing facilities.epact stipulated that the government would pay percent of the decontamination and decommissioning costs annual assessments on domestic nuclear utilities would supply the remaining percent.epact made the department of energy responsible for computing each utility share of the assessment in proportion to that utility use of government enrichment services in the past.c amended.
after making initial payments under epact,con ed,and other nuclear utilities not parties to this suit,sued the government in the court of federal claims seeking refunds of those payments.the lawsuits before the court of federal claims asserted many of the same constitutional grounds as this lawsuit.in one such case,this court reversed the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment in favor of a nuclear utility,concluding that collection of the assessments under epact did not violate the utility contract under which it had purchased the enriched uranium from the government,nor constituted a taking of the utility contract rights.yankee atomic united states,cert.denied,d.
after several subsequent nuclear utility losses in the court of federal claims,con ed filed this suit in the district court.instead of seeking refunds of assessments,however,con ed sought a declaratory judgment that epact was unconstitutional on several grounds and an injunction on enforcement of the epact assessments.by taking this procedural posture,con ed sought a hearing in another forum.to achieve this objective,con ed drew its complaint to avoid prayers for relief actionable in the court of federal claims,such as claims against the united states for money damages.see.
the government moved the district court to transfer this case to the court of federal claims,where other nuclear utility cases await disposition.the government contended that con ed suit in the district court under the administrative procedure act apa amounts to impermissible forum shopping.the apa,according to the government,does not waive sovereign immunity from this suit in the district court because con ed can obtain full legal relief,if successful,in the court of federal claims.specifically,the government noted that the court of federal claims has,on occasion,asserted power under the tucker act to order a full refund of illegally exacted funds.see a new york life ins.united states.thus,if con ed can show illegal exaction of epact assessments,the government maintained,the court of federal claims may have authority to order a refund.lawsuits seeking that remedy were already pending in the court of federal claims.
the government discounted potential restrictions on the court of federal claims power to order injunctive or other prospective relief.if the epact assessments in fact violate constitutional guarantees,the government asserted,injunctive relief would not be necessary.rather,res judicata would bar the government from future assessments against con ed under epact in the face of a court of federal claims illegal exaction judgment.in addition,the government assured that it would not attempt to make future assessments after a loss in the court of federal claims.
in the face of these arguments,the district court denied the government motion.the district court cited cases from the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and the united states supreme court to confirm that the apa waives the sovereign immunity of the united states for suits that properly invoke equitable relief from agency action.bowen massachusetts,d in re chateaugay,cir.after denying the government motion,the district court certified the jurisdictional question for interlocutory review.this court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear the appeal under d a.
the sole question in this case is whether the apa waives sovereign immunity for an action in a district court on the merits of con ed claim because con ed seeks declaratory and prospective injunctive relief,rather than a refund of epact payments.this court reviews legal questions,such as jurisdiction and authority of the court of federal claims and the district court,without deference.terran sec y of health human.
to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court for relief from monetary obligations imposed by a federal agency,a litigant must show that the united states has waived its sovereign immunity.kanemoto reno,citing united states sherwood.the terms of the sovereign consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.the supreme court has explained that a litigant may invoke the apa as a waiver of sovereign immunity,thereby invoking district court jurisdiction,if the litigant can satisfy both by requesting relief other than money damages and no adequate remedy is available elsewhere,such as the court of federal claims.bowen,at.although con ed may satisfy by not seeking money damages,jurisdiction still lies in the court of federal claims because that court can provide an adequate remedy in this case within the meaning of.
under specified circumstances,the apa waives sovereign immunity for actions challenging agency actions in district court.section provides 
a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.an action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the united states or that the united states is an indispensable party nothing herein confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.

section,however,denies this sovereign immunity waiver to claims for money damages or for claims that seek remedies expressly or impliedly precluded by other statutes.transohio sav.bank,office of thrift supervision.in bowen,the supreme court examined this limitation on apa waivers.in that case,the commonwealth of massachusetts sought review of a final order of the secretary of health and human services refusing to reimburse a category of medicaid expenses.bowen,at.the supreme court set forth reasons that exclusion for money damages claims did not foreclose district court judicial review of massachusetts monetary claims.as explained below,however,this court need not address the limitation in this case because another limitation on apa review precludes district court review.
