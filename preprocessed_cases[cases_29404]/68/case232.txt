as in public utility district ferc pud,et cir,a related case also decided today,the,the california public utilities commission puc and the california electric oversight board ceob collectively,public utilities commission challenge the statutory validity of electric power rates in certain wholesale power contracts.again as in pud,that challenge hinges on whether the federal energy regulatory commission ferc was correct to apply the public interest doctrine or whether in doing so it failed to meet its statutory obligation to provide just and reasonable review.see a.
in pud,we explained that represents a presumption that private parties to a wholesale electric power contract have negotiated a just and reasonable contract over a designated period of time,lawful under the fpa throughout that period.pud,slip op.at.that presumption,however,can be rebutted by establishing that the contract adversely affects the public interest,slip op.at.we concluded that,to establish the presumption,three prerequisites are necessary the contract by its own terms must not preclude the limited review the regulatory scheme in which the contracts are formed must provide ferc with an opportunity for effective,timely review of the contracted rates and where,as here,ferc is relying on a system to produce just and reasonable rates,this review must permit consideration of all factors relevant to the propriety of the contract formation,slip op.at.in pud we found two of these prerequisites lacking and remanded to ferc for it to consider the propriety of applying the mode of review to the contracts at issue.we held,in the alternative,that even if properly applied,ferc finding that the challenged contracts do not affect the public interest was based on a substantively erroneous mode of analysis,slip op.at.
applying pud to the challenged contracts in this case,we grant the petition to review and remand to the agency to apply the modes of review outlined in pud.
much of the relevant background to this case is described in pud.see,slip op.at.we therefore will summarize only those facts relevant to the present case.
california energy crisis 
california responded to the energy crisis outlined in pud in several ways,although not until after rolling blackout became a household phrase and several of california largest utilities bordered on insolvency.governor gray davis declared a state of emergency on january,and ordered the california department of water resources cdwr to purchase forward power as expeditiously as possible.on february,the california legislature passed assembly bill of the first extraordinary session,which authorized cdwr to purchase power through the end of december.
between february and august,cdwr executed forward contracts with suppliers.some of these contracts explicitly called for applying the relatively stringent public interest test,rather than the relatively relaxed just and reasonable test to judge the rates included in the contracts.other contracts were silent regarding the test to apply.the contracts include agreements with the in this case 
coral power,for prices from to,for delivery in and 
dynegy power marketing,for mwh,for delivery from january,through december,
mirant americas energy marketing,for mwh,for delivery between june,and december,
pacificorp ppm,for,for delivery between july,and june,and 
sempra energy resources,for,for delivery between june,and september.
under,the people of california must pay the cost of these contracts through their electricity rates.see cal.water code west upon the delivery of power to them,the retail end use customers shall be deemed to have purchased that power from the department.payment for any sale shall be a direct obligation of the retail end use customer to the department.raymond hart,who testified for the public utilities commission,described this statutory provision as ensuring that costs of cdwr contracts would be passed on to the retail of the ious utilities through their retail electricity rates.in other words,cdwr passed the costs of the power it purchased to local as pacific gas and,in turn,passed it on to california consumers.ferc questions whether the challenged contracts call for rates above competitive prices,pub.utils.comm sellers of long term contracts,at,but does not contest that the cost of those contracts is passed on to california consumers.
on june,ferc issued a price mitigation order for spot markets regarding several western states,which went into effect the following day.subsequently,prices generally returned to levels in both spot and forward markets,completing a downward cycle that had begun about a month prior to the june order.
procedural background 
on february,puc filed complaints under section a of the federal power act a,seeking modification of all power contracts signed by cdwr in the only contracts at issue on this appeal are those listed above,which puc alleges overcharge cdwr and california consumers by a total of billion.in the process of adjudicating and ultimately denying these complaints,ferc issued a series of orders 
on april,ferc ordered a hearing to determine whether the dysfunctional california spot markets adversely affected the bilateral markets,and,if so,whether modification of any individual contract at issue was warranted.pub.utils.comm sellers of long term contracts,at footnote omitted.ferc announced that it would review all contracts explicitly calling for public interest review under while setting for hearing the question of whether it would also apply that standard to contracts that were silent on the issue id.ferc dismissed the complaints with regard to all contracts executed on or after june,the date its final price mitigation order went into effect,including the cdwr contract with ppm,which had been negotiated before but signed after that date.finally,the april order held that both the puc and ceob stepped into the shoes of cdwr,which is not a party in this case,because they are all state agencies.id.accordingly,the petitioners would both be treated as if they were the same entity as cdwr.id.
before the administrative law judge alj,puc sought discovery regarding the sellers ability to exercise market power in the spot markets.the alj denied this request,reasoning that the hearing order in this case takes as a given the proposition that the california spot markets were dysfunctional.additionally,the alj excluded some evidence,in the form of testimony by puc expert witnesses,that related to the sellers market power in the forward markets.
at the conclusion of the alj hearing,ferc created a process.for contracts that had explicit provisions calling for the public interest test,ferc instructed the alj not to rule on those cases and instead to certify the record directly to the commission.for the other contracts,the alj was directed to decide only whether the parties intended the public interest test to apply.pub.utils.comm sellers of long term contracts,at.
on february,ferc,on remand from this court,pub.utils.comm of cal.ferc,order of august,cir.docket,et,issued an order in a separate case relating to spot market manipulation,permitting discovery for over days regarding such manipulation and requiring parties in that case to provide an index of discovered material for each other pending or proposed proceeding where the parties so request.san diego gas sellers of energy ancillary,at.through this days proceeding,puc discovered additional evidence regarding sellers spot market manipulation.
on march,ferc staff issued its final report on price manipulation in western markets.staff of the federal energy regulatory commission,final report on price manipulation in western markets investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural gas prices staff report,available at staff report.the staff report concluded that the spot market dysfunction had significant adverse effects on the forward markets.id.at.
ferc issued an initial decision on june,rejecting all of puc claims.pub.utils.comm n.most importantly,ferc concluded that the public interest test would apply to all contracts at issue,upholding the alj opinion that parties to all contracts intended to trigg
