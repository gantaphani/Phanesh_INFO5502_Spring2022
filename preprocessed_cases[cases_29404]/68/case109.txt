in this case,we affirm the federal district court resolution of a dispute over one element of the compensation that tennessee law requires when a city annexes territory and exercises its right to purchase electric utility property within the annexed territory.the federal court had jurisdiction because a federal agency,the rural utilities service rus,was a party defendant.we reverse,however,a order enjoining the city from providing electric service in this annexed area pending resolution of the compensation dispute.
when a tennessee municipality that owns and operates its own electric system annexes territory in which an electric cooperative is providing electric services to customers,the municipality has two choices of how to provide electric services to those customers under tennessee law.see city of south fulton counties rural coop.the municipality can either grant such cooperative a franchise to serve the annexed area or,as the city of cookeville chose to do here,offer to purchase any electric distribution properties and service rights within the annexed area owned by any electric cooperative.ann.a.the same tennessee statute that requires this choice also provides a formula for determining the amount of compensation that the municipality must offer the cooperative.see ann.a.as part of this compensation,the municipality must offer a n amount equal to the cost of constructing any necessary facilities to reintegrate the system of the cooperative outside the annexed area after detaching the portion to be sold.ann.a b.
cookeville annexed nine areas in which the upper cumberland electric membership corporation ucemc provided electric services.cookeville sued ucemc,originally in state court,to condemn ucemc facilities and electric service rights in the annexed areas.rus was later added as a defendant.cookeville and ucemc disagreed on the cost of argued that the cost was approximately whereas ucemc argued that the cost was million.the district court agreed with ucemc and ordered cookeville to pay the higher amount so that ucemc could build a new substation and distribution loop.cookeville appealed.while that appeal was pending,cookeville began building electric facilities in the annexed areas and providing electric services to customers in those areas.ucemc sought and obtained an injunction from the district court enjoining cookeville from building facilities or providing service until it paid ucemc the damages owed for the condemnation.cookeville appealed,and now the propriety of both the damage award and the injunction are before this court.cookeville also challenges the district court jurisdiction over the entire case and the district court jurisdiction to enter the injunction while the first appeal was pending.
the district court properly exercised jurisdiction because a federal agency was a party.the district court order requiring cookeville to pay reintegration costs of million was legally proper and not clearly erroneous.the district court injunction,entered during the pendency of the appeal from the district court compensation order,however,improperly expanded the scope of the previous order.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
in,cookeville annexed five areas surrounding the city.in,cookeville annexed four additional areas.with respect to each annexed area,cookeville gave notice to ucemc,an electric cooperative serving customers in the annexed areas,as required by tennessee law,but ucemc refused to sell voluntarily any of its electric distribution properties or service rights in those areas.see ann.a requiring notice.
removal and denial of motion to remand 
on july,cookeville brought a civil action against ucemc in tennessee state court in order to condemn ucemc facilities and service rights.on august,cookeville amended its complaint and added rus and national rural utilities cooperative finance corporation cfc as defendants.rus is a federal agency.see.rus and cfc each hold a security interest in all of ucemc equipment and service rights within the annexed areas.ucemc,rus,and cfc removed the case under a to the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee.cookeville then filed a motion to remand in the district court arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court denied cookeville motion to remand.tennessee ex rel.city of cookeville upper cumberland membership,d.section states that t he united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right,title or authority claimed under any act of congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue can remove a civil action to the district court.courts have also required as necessary for removal under this statute that the defendant assert a colorable federal defense.here,the district court held that c learly,the rus is an agency of the united states being sued for acting under color of its office in this case.tennessee ex rel.city of cookeville,d at.the court also held that defendants asserted the colorable federal defense of preemption because they adequately pled such a defense and the defense was an issue the district court needed to decide.id.
tennessee statute 
the crux of this case is what compensation cookeville must pay to ucemc for ucemc facilities and service rights in the annexed areas.tennessee law provides the following formula for determining the amount of compensation an annexing municipality must pay an electric cooperative 
the municipality shall offer to purchase the electric distribution properties of the cooperative located within the annexed area,together with all of the cooperative rights to serve within such area,for a cash consideration,which shall consist of 
a the reproduction cost,new,of the facilities being acquired,less depreciation computed on a basis plus 
b an amount equal to the cost of constructing any necessary facilities to reintegrate the system of the cooperative outside the annexed area after detaching the portion to be sold plus 
c an annual amount,payable each year for a period of ten years,equal to the sum of 
i percent of the revenues received from power sales to consumers of electric power within the annexed area,except consumers with large industrial power loads greater than three hundred kilowatts,during the last twelve months preceding the date of the notice provided for in subdivision a and 
ii fifty percent of the net revenues,which is gross power sales revenues less wholesale cost of power including facilities rental charge,received from power sales to consumers with large industrial power loads greater than three hundred kilowatts within the annexed area during the last twelve months preceding the date of the notice provided for in subdivision a.
ann.a.cookeville and ucemc agreed on the first and third elements of the statutory formula.cookeville agreed to pay ucemc for the reproduction cost,new,less depreciation of ucemc electric distribution properties located in the annexed areas.cookeville also agreed to make ten annual payments to ucemc of to comply with section a c.
cookeville and ucemc did not agree on the second element of the statutory formula the cost of constructing any necessary facilities to reintegrate the system of the cooperative outside the annexed area after detaching the portion to be sold.see city of cookeville upper cumberland membership,d,quoting ann.a b.at a bench trial in november of,each side presented testimony of an expert who had produced a reintegration plan.cookeville expert,thomas barnes,testified about the report that he prepared.in the report,barnes stated that to reintegrate ucemc system,ucemc would only need to construct facilities in one of the annexed areas and would incur costs related to coordination of the facility transfer and a restocking charge of metering equipment in all of the annexed areas.barnes estimated the total reintegration costs to be.prior to the annexations,cookeville and ucemc shared a substation in west cookeville west substation,and barnes plan anticipated that ucemc would continue to use that substation.
ucemc expert,robert dew,testified about the report that he prepared.in his report,dew concluded that ucemc needed a new substation and distribution loop built.dew estimated that this would cost million.dew plan anticipated that ucemc would no longer use the west substation after the annexations.at trial,dew testified that the new substation was needed to have the same operational flexibility,same capacity,same reliability,and better efficiency as compared to ucemc system prior to the annexation.dew testified that after cookeville removes ucemc former customers,ucemc will be left with extra line that continues through the annexed areas without serving any customers,resulting in increased costs from maintaining the line and losing electricity due to resistance in that line 
district court decision 
the district court agreed with ucemc and found that the disputed second part of the formula equaled million.city of cookeville,d at in coming to that conclusion,the court first noted that t here was some argument at trial as to whether the statutory definition meant the cost of returning the system to running as well as it had before or whether it meant the cost of making the system adequate for operation.id.the court concluded that reintegration costs are those costs associated with returning the system to running as well as it had before the extra inefficiencies and no extra costs related to the system.id.the district court found that reintegration costs equal the cost of a new substation and the cost of restoring ucemc distribution loop with the new substation.id.this was because the condemnations otherwise would lead to inefficient electric distribution for ucemc due to the loss of electricity along lines no longer serving ucemc customers and due to the maintenance of those lines.id 
overall,the district court found that ucemc condemnation damages totaled a single payment of and annual payments of per year.id.
motions to alter or amend and appeal 
cookeville and ucemc moved to alter or amend the court order.the issues presented in the motions involved how and when cookeville was to pay ucemc,whether ucemc would be allowed to petition the court for additional reintegration costs if the cost of building the substation and distribution loop exceeded million,and whether cookeville was condemning feeder lines associated with cookeville west substation.the district court denied the motions of cookeville and ucemc as to the means and timing of payment because there was no good reason that the parties should not be able to come to a resolution of how to execute the judgment.the court also held that million was the maximum amount cookeville had to pay and that if the actual costs are less than that amount,the remaining amount shall revert to or remain with cookeville.finally,the court held that cookeville did not condemn the feeder lines,which remained ucemc property.
both parties appealed.ucemc later voluntarily dismissed its.
injunction 
while the appeal was pending,cookeville began constructing electric distribution facilities inside some of the annexed areas.cookeville admits that it installed street lighting and other electric facilities in the annexed areas,but maintains that none of those facilities serviced ucemc customers.cookeville explained that it has only begun to serve new customers,customers who had moved into the annexed areas into the city of cookeville after the annexation and who had not previously been ucemc customers.
on december,defendants filed with the district court a joint motion for injunctive relief and costs.defendants moved for an order compelling cookeville to immediately transfer to ucemc all electric service currently being provided by cookeville within ucemc exclusive service territory,enjoining cookeville from constructing electric distribution facilities servicing customers within ucemc exclusive service territory,and requiring cookeville to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred by d efendants in connection with bringing the motion.cookeville responded by arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to issue an injunction because the notice of appeal filed in appeal transferred jurisdiction to the court of appeals,and that even if the district court had jurisdiction,it should not issue an injunction because,a municipality has the right to provide electric service,not an electric cooperative.
on january,the district court granted defendants motion for injunctive relief and costs.the court concluded that cookeville was 
unlawfully constructing new electric distribution facilities and providing electric services to customers within one or more of the nine annexation areas at issue in this case that such annexation areas were within the exclusive service territory of ucemc and that while cookeville had sued to condemn ucemc exclusive service rights associated with these annexations areas,it ha d not yet paid the condemnation damages awarded and wa s not entitled to the use and benefit of such exclusive service rights until ucemc ha d been fully compensated 
accordingly,the district court held that cookeville actions constituted an unlawful interference with ucemc exclusive service rights to the nine annexation areas.the district court ordered cookeville to transfer to ucemc within days all electric service customers within any of the nine annexation areas that are currently being served by cookeville.furthermore,the court enjoined cookeville from providing electric service to customers within the annexed areas until appeal is resolved and cookeville pays in full the ultimate damage award to ucemc,including reintegration costs,or until otherwise ordered by the district court.finally,the court ordered cookeville to pay defendants reasonable costs and attorneys fees associated with the injunction motion because it found that cookeville actions were not undertaken in good faith,and that said interference continued despite reasonable efforts by d efendants to avoid needless additional litigation.cookeville filed a timely notice of appeal of this order.
we affirm the district court order in appeal.defendants properly removed the case to the district court and the district court decision on the merits awarding reintegration costs of million to ucemc was not clearly erroneous.however,we vacate the district court injunction in appeal.the district court did not have jurisdiction to issue the injunction because the injunction sought to expand the district court previous order.
removal jurisdiction 
defendants properly removed this action to federal court a civil action may be removed to the federal district court if the action is brought against 
t he united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right,title or authority claimed under any act of congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.
a.in the context of federal officer removal,the supreme court has held that the officer must both raise a colorable federal defense and establish that the suit is for a n act under color of office.jefferson county acker,d quoting a citation omitted emphasis and alteration in acker.
although the parties assume that the jefferson county acker officer removal test applies to federal agency removal as well,the text and legislative history of a demonstrate that any federal agency sued can always remove under a because the sued clause in that provision applies only to federal officers 
the text of a,is best read to mean that the three entities that can remove are the united states any agency thereof or any officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.a possible different by the parties in this that the three entities that can remove are the united states any agency thereof or any officer of the united states or of any agency thereof and that each of these entities must be sued in an official or individual capacity for an act under color of such office.although the latter reading is supported by the placement of a comma directly preceding the word sued suggesting that everything after the comma,the sued clause applies to each element of the list before the comma the united states,any agency thereof,or any officer of the united states or any agency thereof,that reading does not make sense because the united states and federal agencies are not sued in an official or individual capacity and are not sued for an act under color of such office.indeed,distinguished scholars of federal jurisdiction have questioned whether amended a should be read to permit the united states to remove only when it is sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office perhaps a null set and surely a peculiar category.see richard fallon,daniel meltzer david shapiro,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed.moreover,the supreme court rejected an interpretation of an earlier version of the statute that would have applied a similar sued clause to agencies because under that interpretation,the statute read very awkwardly because a n agency would not normally be described as exercising authority under color of an office.int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund,d.our independent reading of the text of a is thus that a federal agency defendant may remove without more.
the legislative history provides compelling confirmation of this reading the addition of the united states or any agency thereof was the result of a amendment that sought to reverse an earlier supreme court decision.in international primate protection league,at,the supreme court held that the version of permitted only federal officers,not federal agencies,to remove suits to federal courts.the version stated that,any officer of the united states or any agency thereof,or person acting under him,for any act under color of such office or on account of any right,title or authority claimed under any act of congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue could remove a civil action to district court.congress responded by replacing the beginning of the section up to the phrase or on account of with the current language at issue.see,at,reprinted in.this effectively added the united states and any agency thereof as parties that could remove cases to district court.id.at,cong,noting that the amendment legislatively reverses the supreme court decision in international primate protection league.
the senate report supports a reading that a as amended permits a federal agency to remove to federal district court without limitation.the senate report in multiple places separates the sued clause from reference to an agency and includes that clause only with reference to officers.for example,the senate report notes that the amended statute allows civil actions against federal agencies as well as those against federal officers sued in either an individual or official capacity to be removed to federal district court.id.at,cong.the senate report goes on to state that the amendment clarifies that suits against federal agencies,as well as those against federal officers sued in either an individual or official capacity,may be removed to federal district court.id.at,cong.the report,therefore,demonstrates that the sued clause applies only to federal officers and not to federal agencies.such a reading is consistent with the clear command from both congress and the supreme court that is to be interpreted broadly in favor of removal.durham lockheed martin,cir.rus therefore properly removed the action to the district court under a because rus is a federal agency.
we recognize that other courts of appeals have suggested that a federal agency may also have to assert a colorable federal defense.see city of jacksonville dep t of the navy,cir we recognize that it remains to be decided whether the requirement of a federal defense also applies to removal by the united states or one of its agencies.parker della rocco,cir expressly not deciding whether a colorable federal defense is required for agency removal united states todd,cir finding that the united states had asserted a colorable federal defense for removal under rather than rejecting the need for one.the requirement of a colorable federal defense,however,is not only not supported by the statutory language,but also is not necessary to ensure the constitutionality of a under article iii of the constitution.article iii,section extends the federal judicial power to controversies to which the united states shall be a party.this case is thus different from mesa california,d,in which the supreme court rejected the government argument that a federal defense is not required for officer removal.the mesa court reasoned that an interpretation of requiring such a defense ensures article iii jurisdiction by virtue of the case arising under federal law.id.no such interpretation is required where the united states is a party.
but even if a colorable federal defense were required,rus fulfilled this requirement by asserting the defense of preemption.defendants argued that federal law preempted cookeville proposed condemnation of ucemc facilities because the condemnation frustrated the purposes of the rural electrification act of react,as amended.city of cookeville,d at.the district court noted that this was an issue of first impression in the sixth circuit,and that other courts had split on the issue.id.at.compare pub.util.dist.of pend oreille county united states,cir disregard of federal interest precluded condemnation under state law,pub.util.dist.of franklin county big bend,cir condemnation under state law not permitted after disapproval by the rural electrification administration,city of morgan city.coop.ass n,cir condemnation preempted by react,with city of stilwell ozarks rural coop,cir react does not preempt oklahoma condemnation statute,reg l auth.alaska,alaska similar.although the district court ultimately sided with cookeville and held that the react did not preempt tennessee law permitting the condemnations a decision defendants do not challenge on appeal,this does not mean that the defense was not colorable.for instance,in acker,at,the supreme court concluded that defendants presented a colorable federal defense of intergovernmental tax immunity even though the court ultimately rejected that defense.see also magnin teledyne cont l motors,cir a colorable federal defense need only be plausible its ultimate validity is not to be determined at the time of removal.here,where the federal defense was an issue of first impression in this court and had previously found success in other circuits,one would be hard pressed to say that the defense was not colorable.therefore,rus properly removed the action to the district court even if assertion of a colorable federal defense were required for agency removal under a.
reintegration costs 
the district court did not clearly err by holding that cookeville must pay to build ucemc a new substation and distribution loop.tennessee law requires as part of the compensation that an annexing municipality must pay to an electric cooperative a n amount equal to the cost of constructing any necessary facilities to reintegrate the system of the cooperative outside the annexed area after detaching the portion to be sold.ann.a b.cookeville argues that the district court erred by awarding reintegration compensation of million for two reasons the district court applied an incorrect legal standard by requiring financial efficiency even though the statute requires only engineering efficiency and even if the district court applied the correct legal standard,ucemc reintegration plan,which the district court adopted,does not comply with that standard.this court reviews the district court conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.overton,heritage bank,cir.
legal standard 
the district court applied a legal standard that is consistent with t
