qwest corporation qwest,a telecommunication provider,appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of the city of portland and other oregon cities cities,who intervened in the action.qwest contends that the federal telecommunications act of fta,preempts the municipal ordinances pursuant to which the franchise fees were assessed.the district court ruled that the cities ordinances and various franchise agreements were not preempted by the fta the district court also determined that the fees imposed on the telecommunication providers by the cities were valid under the fta.because the district court failed to conduct an individualized preemption analysis for each city ordinances,and misapplied our holding in city of auburn qwest,cir,we must remand the case to the district court for additional consideration.because the district court correctly concluded that qwest challenge to the cities gross fees was barred by claim and issue preclusion,that ruling is affirmed.
background 
in,the portland city council issued a revocable permit to the pacific telephone and telegraph company to use the city public to provide telecommunications services.in,pacific telephone and telegraph company transferred the permit to pacific northwest bell telephone company pnwb.west communications succeeded to pnwb interests,and qwest eventually acquired west 
in,qwest lobbied for adoption of a separate privilege tax for incumbent local telecommunications carriers in exchange for their use of the.the oregon legislature subsequently enacted ors to,which authorized oregon cities to assess incumbent local telecommunications carriers fees of up to of gross revenues.in response to this legislation,the cities entered into nonexclusive agreements with qwest,allowing qwest to use the public.in exchange for this privilege,qwest agreed to pay the cities a fee equal to of gross revenues earned within the cities boundaries 
some ten years later,the city of portland notified qwest that it was revoking qwest permit to use its public.the parties entered into unfruitful negotiations for a new permit.in the interim,the city of portland issued qwest a temporary revocable permit trp allowing qwest to continue to use its public.
qwest brought this action seeking a declaration that portland franchise and telecommunications ordinances are invalid under of the fta.nine other cities intervened and filed counterclaims seeking franchise fees.following the filing of for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to all ten cities,holding that qwest had failed to show that the cities fees,or other franchise requirements,prohibited or had the effect of prohibiting qwest provision of telecommunication services under.qwest city of portland,d.the court also ruled that the fta did not categorically prohibit cities from basing public fees on a company gross revenues,rather than on actual costs for use of local.id.at.finally,the court determined that qwest action against the city of eugene was barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion and that issue preclusion barred qwest from challenging the other cities fees.id.at.even if the cities fees were presumptively preempted under a,the district court concluded that the fees would still be valid under the provision of c,and any preempted provisions could be severed under oregon law.id.at.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see plans,sacramento city unified school,cir.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,and whether the district court applied the law correctly.see fortyune american,cir.
discussion 
to resolve this case,we must interpret the fta,which provides in part 
a in general.no state or local statute or regulation,or other state or local legal requirement,may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.
b state regulatory authority 
nothing in this section shall affect the ability of a state to impose,on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with section of this title,requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service,protect the public safety and welfare,ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services,and safeguard the rights of consumers.
c state and local government authority 
nothing in this section affects the authority of a state or local government to manage the public or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers,on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis,for use of public on a nondiscriminatory basis,if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government.
section a preempts regulations that not only prohibit outright the ability of any entity to provide telecommunications services,but also those that may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of such services.a.in city of auburn,we considered whether preempted local ordinances that established permit processes for telecommunications providers.in discussing preemption,we noted that t he preemption is virtually absolute and its purpose is aspects of telecommunications regulation are uniquely the province of the federal government and congress has narrowly circumscribed the role of state and local governments in this arena.city of auburn,at.accordingly,cities have a very limited and proscribed role in the regulation of telecommunications.id.citation omitted.
to determine whether preemption exists under a,it is necessary to analyze whether the regulatory scheme in combination has the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services.city of auburn,at.in conducting this analysis in city of auburn,we examined such factors as the nature of the franchise application process,the requirements to obtain a franchise,the threat of penalties for failure to obtain a franchise,and the discretion the city reserves to grant,deny,or revoke a franchise.id.and,the ultimate cudgel is that each city reserves discretion to grant,deny,or revoke the franchises and the cities may revoke the franchise if the terms in the ordinance are not followed.in city of auburn,we held that the combination of features present in the regulatory scheme created a substantial and unlawful barrier to entry into and participation in the telecommunications markets.id.
qwest challenges the cities ordinances in two ways.first,qwest argues that the cities ordinances are similar in scope and substance to those preempted in city of auburn.as was the case in city of auburn,qwest contends that these ordinances,taken as a whole,are preempted by.qwest also makes a more na rrow challenge,asserting that prohibits the cities from basing fees on qwest gross revenues.in support of this argument,qwest posits that allows local officials to recover only the costs of the use of the,rather than to assess fees based on the gross revenues of the telecommunication providers.each challenge will be discussed separately.
general franchise requirements 
in analyzing the cities franchise requirements generally under a,the district court ruled that the franchise agreements and ordinances at issue here do not give the cities unfettered discretion to deny telecommunications franchisees city of portland,d at.the court determined that unfettered discretion did not exist because some franchise agreements allowed the parties to terminate on days notice.id.the court concluded that the requirement that telecommunications service providers submit information about revenues and ownership did not create a barrier to entry into the market or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services.id.
the district court ruling raises several concerns.as an initial matter,we note that there was no individualized analysis of each cities challenged ordinances.there are ten oregon cities involved in this litigation,and each city has unique ordinances that are being challenged by qwest.the district court general conclusion that the cities franchise agreements and ordinances were not preempted by is not conducive
