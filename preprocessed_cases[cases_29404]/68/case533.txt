factual and procedural background 
the authority is a joint powers authority formed under california law,et.on december,the authority proposed a fee for collection and disposal at the four household hazardous waste facilities in alameda county of the household hazardous waste component of garbage and refuse generated by alameda county households.the proposed annual fee of on each county household,beginning july,and ending june,would fund the facilities operating as part of the county sanitation system.the authority set a public hearing for february,to consider the proposed fee.the authority executive director was directed to prepare a report describing each parcel of real property with one or more households that would be subject to the ordinance,the number of households on each parcel,and the amount of the proposed charge for each parcel.
in advance of february,the authority executive director mailed to each record owner of the subject properties a written notice of the proposed annual fee,its purpose,and the opportunity to protest the fee specifically,the notice reads this letter is to inform you that the authority will consider adopting a fee of per year per residential unit,collected through the property tax roll,at its meeting on february,revenue from the fee will be used to support the countywide household hazardous waste program,which provides safe,legal,environmentally sound collection and disposal services for residential household hazardous waste such as paint,solvents and pesticides.the fee will support expanded services to all residents of alameda county.without these services,most household hazardous waste will be illegally and improperly disposed of,abandoned on streets,poured down drains,placed in garbage or recycling carts.improper disposal is often dangerous,litters our streets and sidewalks,and can detract from residential property values.
on january,the authority extended the protest hearing date to march,and mailed notice of the extended protest hearing date to each record owner.the extension provided days notice to certain property owners to whom the original mailing had inadvertently been delayed.the resolution also provided that the authority would not adopt the ordinance if written protests are presented by either i a majority of the owners of the identified parcels subject to the ordinance or ii the owners of a majority of the residential units subject to the ordinance.
on march,the authority held its hearing and considered protests of the ordinance.neither a majority of the owners of affected parcels nor the owners of a majority of the affected households protested the ordinance.on may,the authority adopted the ordinance by a vote of its governing body.
thereafter,crawley an alameda county homeowner and taxpayer filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus code civ,as well as an ex parte petition for alternative writ of mandate.he argued that the authority abused its discretion by failing to adopt the ordinance pursuant to a majority vote of the electorate,as allegedly required by article xiii d.the trial court denied the ex parte application for an alternative writ of mandate and ordered the authority to answer crawley petition.respondents the authority and real parties in interest gary wolff,don biddle,and richard taylor the authority executive director,president,and general counsel,respectively instead demurred to crawley petition,asserting the petition failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because article xiii d,section,exempts refuse collection fees from a voter ratification requirement.crawley filed a motion to strike the demurrer,which was considered as an opposition.
the trial court granted respondents demurrer and dismissed crawley action.the trial court order states t he court finds that section of article xiii d does not apply to the adoption of the household hazardous waste fee at issue here because the fee is a property related fee subject to the requirements of article xiii d,section.see,howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th.crawley has not alleged any facts or presented any legal argument demonstrating that the ordinance imposed a special benefit assessment that would be subject to article xiii d,section crawley also alleges that the authority adoption of the ordinance violated section because the agency did not require a public vote by ballot.however,the household hazardous waste fee imposed by the ordinance is a fee for refuse collection.see health,defining refuse,in part,as anything thrown away as worthless e defining household hazardous waste as waste generated incidental to owning or maintaining a place of residence.article xiii d,section c specifically exempts fees for refuse collection services from the requirement that a new fee or charge be submitted and approved by a majority of property owners.crawley filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion

crawley contends that the household hazardous waste collection service has no direct relationship to property ownership because it is not delivered directly to residential property.he asserts,in his opening brief,that a property owner or tenant will instead have to himself deliver household hazardous waste to one of the authority collection facilities.however,the ordinance does not state as much on its face and crawley has alleged no facts to support his assertion.and,even if we assume that crawley could amend to state such facts,crawley cites no authority suggesting this single factor is determinative.
