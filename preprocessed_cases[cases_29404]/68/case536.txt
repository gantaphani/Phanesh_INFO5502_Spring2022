sces motion for judgment on the pleadings 
introduction 
this is laabss fourth appeal,and the second involving sce.in the first two appeals we affirmed summary judgments in favor of the county and the city in the third appeal,we reversed summary judgment in favor of sce.laabs southern california edison th,laabs iii.in laabs iii,we held that there existed triable issues of fact as to whether sce owed a duty of care to motorists relative to the placement of street lights immediately adjacent to the traveling lanes of a roadway.id.at.
following remand,sce moved for judgment on the pleadings based on the argument that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the present action.see code civ,subd.c b i.its motion was premised on an argument that public utilities code section precluded the superior court from entertaining any lawsuit dealing with matters that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the public utilities commission puc or commission.it argued that the placement or location of street lights fell under the exclusive province of the puc,and the trial court could not entertain an action for damages because it would interfere with the pucs exercise of its plenary power.more particularly,sce contended that upon sces filing of its tariff with the puc and the pucs approval of said tariff,the conditions contained therein had the force and effect of law.sce submitted that the location of the subject pole was part of the approved tariff and that under the express conditions of the tariff,sce is relieved of all liability for acting in accordance therewith.see pub,subd.a.
the trial court granted the motion and the present appeal ensued.because the trial court does have subject matter jurisdiction over the present matter,we reverse.
background 
in laabss second amended complaint,she alleges the following facts.laabs was a passenger in a car driven by james dimeo.dimeo was driving northbound on ridgecrest road in victorville.dimeos car was struck by another car at an intersection with pebble beach drive,spun out of control and across ridgecrest road,and hit a concrete light pole erected inches away from the curb.laabs was injured.the light pole was owned and maintained by sce.
laabs sued sce on the theory that sce acted negligently by installing and maintaining the light pole so close to the curb.
judicially noticed documents 
sces motion for judgment on the pleadings relies exclusively on documents of which it requested the trial court take judicial notice.first is an agreement for service for street lighting entered into between the city and sce on august.attached as exhibits to this agreement are puc schedule no.ls,which deals with a utility owned system and schedule no.ls,dealing with a customer owned installation.
the second document is a schedule ls,dated june,dealing solely with systems it includes a reference to decision the tariff sets forth certain rates applicable to street and highway lighting service where sce owns and maintains the street lighting equipment and associated facilities it includes two special conditions relevant here.special condition.provides the applicant for street light service shall specify the type of service,lamp size,and location of street lights.special condition provides liability of company the company shall not,by taking action pursuant to its tariffs,be liable for any loss,damage,or injury,established or alleged,which may result,or be claimed to result,therefrom.
the third document is a document dated november,and revised april,it appears to be a schematic drawing which includes the descriptions,city of victorville and commercial corner utility location it shows a utility pole placed inches from the curb.
the trial court granted the request for judicial notice as to each document.
based on these documents,sce contends that laabss action is barred by section.specifically,sce argues that when the puc approved sces tariff,it exercised its authority over subject matters addressed in the tariff the tariff required sce to place street lights where the city wanted them and included a limitation of liability provision because the location of street lights and the limitation of liability are addressed in the tariff,any issues related to them are subject to the pucs exclusive jurisdiction and any action addressing them is barred by section.
initially,we note that schedule no.ls customer owned installation appears not applicable.laabss second amended complaint alleges that sce owns the specific street light installation.
further,the pleading does not allege the date the street light was installed it is therefore left to some conjecture as to whether the schedule no.ls or the ls applies.this date may be important because if one were to accept sces position as to the significance of the release of liability,the release is contained only in the ls,not the schedules.additionally,there are no conditions in the earlier schedules referencing location of street lights.as such,any approval by the puc of those schedules would not have entailed the siting of street lights.for purposes of our opinion,however,we assume the applicability of the ls 
lastly,there is nothing about the street corner schematic depicting the location of a utility pole that suggests it was submitted to the puc or relates to any tariff or puc decision.

legal background 
jurisdiction of the puc 
the commission is a state agency of constitutional origin with duties,functions and powers.cal,art.xii.the constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities,including the power to fix rates,establish rules,hold various types of hearings,award reparation,and establish its own procedures.the commission powers,however,are not restricted to those expressly mentioned in the constitution the legislature has plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article,to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission cal,art.xii.citation.pursuant to this constitutional provision the legislature enacted,inter alia,the public utilities act.et that law vests the commission with broad authority to supervise and regulate every public utility in the state and grants the commission numerous specific powers for that purpose t he legislature further authorized the commission to do all things,whether specifically designated in the public utilities act or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction over public utilities.citation.accordingly,the commission authority has been liberally construed citation san diego gas electric superior court cal th.
in particular,the commission has comprehensive jurisdiction over questions of public health and safety arising from utility operations.thus the commission is generally authorized to require every public utility to construct,maintain,and operate its plant,system,equipment,or apparatus in such manner as to safeguard the health and safety of its employees,customers,and the public.to this end,the commission is further empowered to prescribe the installation and use of appropriate safety or other devices,and to require every utility to do any other act which the health or safety of its employees,customers,or the public may demand.citation.san diego gas electric superior court,supra,cal th at.
the pucs most obvious regulatory authority includes the regulation of rates.hartwell superior court cal th,see also cal,the commission may fix rates.section,subdivision a,requires every public utility to file with the puc a tariffa schedule showing all rates,tolls,rentals,charges,and classifications together with all rules,contracts,privileges,and facilities which in any manner affect or relate to rates,tolls,rentals,classifications,or service.such a tariff,when approved by the puc,has the force of law.pacific bell public utilities com.th,italics added.
in approving a tariff,the puc has the power to control that which in any manner affect or relate to rates or service.pacific bell public utilities,supra,th at.as part of this power,the puc may also limit the liability of the utility to the public.in a case involving a telephone company tariff,the court explained that the limitations on liability are an equitable power to regulate rates and to set them below the amount an unregulated provider might otherwise charge requires a concomitant limitation on liability.los angeles cellular telephone superior court th.
further,and as directly relevant to the present motion,section,subdivision a states no court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal,shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court.italics added.
bearing in mind the basic plenary power of the puc,the legislature has provided for a limited scope of private action against a utility for damages.as set forth in section any public utility which does,causes to be done,or permits any act,matter,or thing prohibited or declared unlawful,or which omits to do any act,matter,or thing required to be done,either by the constitution,any law of this state,or any order or decision of the commission,shall be liable to the persons or corporations affected thereby for all loss,damages,or injury caused thereby or resulting therefrom an action to recover for such loss,damage,or injury may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by any corporation or person.
the relationship of sections,and local regulation to the present facts 
the question before us is whether the present action for damages is precluded by the overall grant of plenary power to the puc by the constitution and sections and,or falls within the limited exception of section.in addressing a similar issue,the court in san diego gas electric stated addressing the question of statutory construction,this court in waters pacific telephone cal d declared the primacy of section and the correspondingly limited role of section.the waters court held that in order to resolve the potential conflict between sections and,the latter section must be construed as limited to those situations in which an award of damages would not hinder or frustrate the commissions declared supervisory and regulatory policies.citation.t he two sections must be construed in a manner which harmonizes their language and avoids unnecessary conflict.section reasonably may be interpreted as authorizing only those actions which would not interfere with or obstruct the commission in carrying out its own policies.under the waters rule,accordingly,an action for damages against a public utility pursuant to section is barred by section not only when an award of damages would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,when it would reverse,correct,or annul that order or decision,but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission,when it would hinder or frustrate or interfere with or obstruct that policy.san diego gas electric superior court,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.
as such,if the puc has the authority to regulate or otherwise establish policy in a given area,and has exercised that authority by regulation or policy,then the superior court may do nothing that hampers or interferes with that exercise of jurisdiction,including awarding damages in a private action.see generally san diego gas electric,supra,cal th at.stated another way,t he puc has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation and control of utilities,and that jurisdiction,once assumed,can not be hampered or by a superior court action addressing the same issue.anchor lighting southern california edison th.
with the above said,a city exercising its police powers may impose conditions and regulations upon a public utility to the extent they are not in conflict with the exercise of jurisdiction by the puc.as explained in orange county air pollution control dist.public util.com.cal d c oncurrent jurisdiction may well exist as to some matters but if there is a direct confrontation with the jurisdiction exercised by this commission the jurisdiction of this commission in the matter is either exclusive or paramount t he commission has been held to have paramount jurisdiction in cases where it has exercised its authority,and its authority is pitted against that of a local government involving a matter of statewide concern.id.at,fn.omitted.
as stated in san diego gas electric city of carlsbad th the general authorization for a local entitys police power is found in california constitution,article xi,section a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.california constitution,article xi,section,subdivision b permits municipalities to prescribe conditions and regulations for the operation of public utility works by private entities.id.at.
finally,section provides that the chapter of the public utilities code governing the surrender of municipal control to the puc shall not be construed to authorize any municipal corporation to surrender to the commission its powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationship between a public utility and the general public in matters affecting the health,convenience,and safety of the general public,including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility,the location of the poles,wires,mains or conduits of any public utility,on,under,or above any public streets italics added.
discussion 
the puc does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the location of street lights 
as previously indicated,sces basic position is the puc has the authority to regulate the siting of light poles the puc has exercised that authority by approving the tariff.included within the tariff is language dealing with location of poles and a release of liability as to actions taken in compliance with the tariff.as such,sce argues that allowing a plaintiff to recover damages resulting from actions pursuant to the tariff would interfere with the pucs jurisdiction and is thus precluded by section.we disagree.
as evident from the above,the puc has general plenary power over utilities.at the same time,local municipalities may,pursuant to their police power,regulate utilities to the extent the regulation is not inconsistent with law.more specifically,a city may control the location of utility poles within its jurisdiction.
initially,sce has not cited to any specific puc policy,regulation,decision or study which indicates that it has exercised authority over the siting of street lights.indeed,the closest this court can come to determining whether the puc has entered the field of controlling the location of utility poles is in in re competition for local exchange service d decision at one portion of its order,the commission addresses its jurisdiction relative to section.it states the obligations of a city,county or other political subdivision to provide access to under its control is addressed under part of the public utilities code.the legislature has expressly recognized the duties and responsibilities of a municipal corporation,and the ability of a municipal corporation to retain or surrender control of some of its powers to the commission.municipal corporations are expressly authorized not to surrender the power to supervise and regulate the relationship between such public utilities and the general public in matters affecting the health,convenience,and safety of the general public,including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility,the location of the poles,wires,mains,or conduits of any public utility,on,under,or above any public streets section.l ocal governments thus may regulate the time,location,and manner of installation of telephone facilities in public streets,but they may not arbitrarily deny requests for access by public utilities decision at see also southern cal.gas city of vernon th,the language of public utilities code section simply reflects that the location of pipelines beneath city streets is a matter for the municipal corporation,not the puc.
the commission goes on to explain that if the telecommunications company is unable to resolve its dispute with the local entity as to siting and access,then it can apply to the puc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity.decision.in so indicating,however,the puc states we recognize that the commission lacks the jurisdiction to directly order a local governmental body to grant access.in the event that we grant the siting authority sought in the application,it will be the responsibility of the telecommunications carrier to notify the local governmental body of the commission order.in the event that we grant such an application,and the local governmental body still refuses to grant access in accordance with the commission order,the telecommunications carrier recourse shall be to file a lawsuit in the appropriate court of civil jurisdiction seeking resolution of the dispute over access.id.at.
here,the city schematic depicting a street light located inches from the curb face indicates that the city has exercised control over the location of the street light.see.although the puc could perhaps exercise jurisdiction over the placement of poles,nothing in the ls or the puc related decision indicates that it has.indeed,it appears otherwise.as stated in special condition.the applicant city of victorville for street light service shall specify the type of service,lamp size,and location of street lights.italics added.thus,to the extent the puc and the city had concurrent jurisdiction over the location of street lights,the puc,in accordance with san diego gas electric and its own construction of section,allowed the city to exercise its jurisdiction as to the siting of the street lights.as such,the citys exercise of jurisdiction is not inimical to the public utilities act.
although the puc has the authority to regulate the siting of light poles as a condition affecting or relating to the rates,tolls,rentals,classification,or service see,subd.a,the tariff in this case indicates that the city,not the puc,has control over the siting of light poles.we therefore reject sces argument that the pucs approval of the tariff constitutes an exercise of the pucs jurisdiction over that subject matter.
the release of liability found in special condition of the ls is also inapplicable.as provided the company shall not by taking action pursuant to its tariffs,be liable for any loss,damage,or injury,established or alleged,which may result,or be claimed to result therefrom.because the placement of light poles was generally under the control of the city,sce did not take any action with respect to the placement of the light poles pursuant to its tariffs as a result,the limitation of liability provision is inapplicable.
while defendant argues that a utility may limit its liability to the public by way of a tariff,we note that all of the cases setting forth this proposition,save one,deal with phone service and involve subscribers to the service.additionally,and again with one exception,the cases postdate and refer to the puc decision in in re telephone corporations,wherein the commission specifically investigated all rules,conditions or tariff provisions limiting the liability of telephone corporations.id.at.
we have not found and have not been cited to any puc decision addressing limitations on liability for utilities other than those providing phone services.further,as alluded to in thrify tel,bezenek th,a lthough article xii,sections and of the california constitution authorize the commission to establish rates utilities may charge for their services,it is a debatable question as to whether they empower the puc to liquidate a utility tort damages against third parties.see also colich sons pacific bell d,fn.inapplicability of limitation of liability provisions to cases involving personal injuries by third parties.
in conclusion,we find that while the puc may have concurrent jurisdiction with the local entity relative to the placement of light poles,it did not,in this case,exercise that authority.moreover,there is nothing about an award of damages against sce that would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,or would have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission.therefore,under section,the superior court has jurisdiction to maintain the present action.
ii.citys demurrer to sces first amended complaint 
introduction 
sce did not file a timely governmental claim against the city before filing its first amended naming the city as a.the trial court sustained the city demurrer without leave to amend based on sce failure to comply with the government claims statute.both at the trial level and on appeal,sce contends it did not need to file a claim because its for equitable indemnity was solely defensive in nature.see krainock superior court d krainock.we agree with the trial court and affirm the judgment entered thereon.more particularly,we find that sce is based on facts outside of the pleadings,of which the city was a party,such that the is not solely defensive in nature.because of this,compliance with the government claims act was necessary.
background 
in october,laabs filed her initial complaint against the driver,owners,and manufacturer of the vehicle in which she was a passenger.additional named defendants were the driver of the other vehicle,as well as the city of victorville and the county of san bernardino.the theory against the city and the county was that they were negligent in designing,constructing,maintaining,controlling and otherwise creating and failing to correct a dangerous road condition due to inadequate sight distance and lack of warning signs,devices and signals.fifty doe defendants were named.ten doe defendants were associated with the dangerous condition of public property.the remaining doe defendants were alleged to be associated in some way to the vehicle in which laabs was a passenger or the other vehicle involved in the accident 
laabs original complaint makes no allegations of any condition of property north of the intersection of ridgecrest road and pebble beach drive.additionally as to the doe defendants associated with the property,the allegations deal solely with inadequate sight distance at the intersection and the absence of warning signs and signals.laabs complaint additionally omits any allegation that the doe defendants were negligent in ways unknown to plaintiff.
on april and april,the city filed two successive.the more recent named as each of the city named codefendants.it further alleged that unknown moe were jointly and severally liable for plaintiff injuries as alleged in the complaint in this action.italics added.in its charging allegations,the city went on to allege.if plaintiff sustained damages as alleged in her complaint,these damages were caused,entirely or in part,by cross defendants as set forth herein a.the county of san bernardino owned and controlled the northbound lanes of ridgecrest road and pebble beach drive,and if there was a dangerous condition thereon the county of san bernardino is responsible therefor james dimeo,operated his vehicle in a negligent,careless,reckless and wanton manner,driving at a speed in excess of miles per hour while under the influence of alcohol intoxicating drugs cross defendants james dimeo,and tina dimeo negligently supervised james dimeo,their minor child,in that they knew of their child dangerous tendency and propensity to take and operate the vehicle involved in the collision without authorization and in a reckless and careless manner.these cross defendants failed to take the appropriate action and corrective measures to prevent james dimeo,from intentionally or negligently inflicting harm on others.these cross defendants further failed to secure the vehicle to prevent unauthorized use by james dimeo.cross defendants actions and failure to act resulted in the injuries and damages sustained by plaintiff d.the vehicle driven by james dimeo,a porsche carrera,california license number,including its component parts,failed to perform in a manner reasonably to be expected in light of its nature and intended function,including but not limited to failing to stay under control and failing to provide adequate protection and restraint of its occupants cross defendant dorothy jean specter operated her vehicle negligently at the time of the collision by failing to exercise due care to ensure that she could enter safely into the roadway.
as with the complaint,the city is based upon limited facts.there is nothing in the that speaks to conditions of property that are adjacent to the southbound lanes of ridgecrest road north of its intersection with pebble beach drive.
in may,the trial court granted the city motion for summary judgment as to laabs complaint.an appeal followed while the appeal was pending,laabs filed her second amended complaint.in this pleading,laabs omitted the city and the county as named defendants.she added sce to the action.the alleged basis for sce liability was its ownership of the luminaire and its dangerous proximity to the traveling lanes of ridgecrest road.sce was served with the second amended complaint on october.
in november,sce filed a for indemnity and contribution against james dimeo and his parents.sce also included an affirmative cause of action for damages for the repair of the luminaire 
in july,almost two years after being served with the second amended complaint,sce was granted summary judgment as to laabs.two years later,in july,this court reversed the judgment.see laabs iii,supra,th.following the supreme court denial of sce petition for review,the matter was remanded to the superior court in november.approximately three months later,sce filed a governmental claim against the city.in the claim,sce sought indemnification and costs of defense from the city based on the allegation that t he city made the decision with regards to the location of installation,type of equipment to use,mounting height,type of light and output for the area streetlights,including the electrolier.the claim was returned to sce as being untimely.
thereafter,in january,after filing another claim which was also returned as untimely sce filed a first amended complaint seeking indemnification from the city.in the,sce alleged it substantially complied with the claims requirement.in march,the city filed a demurrer contending,among other arguments,that sce was barred because of its failure to comply with the government claims act.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer.following the entry of judgment for the city,sce filed the present appeal.
standard of review 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.further,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.city of dinuba county of tulare cal th.where a seeks indemnity from a governmental entity stemming from an underlying personal injury action,compliance with the claims statute is required.state of california superior court d.failure to allege compliance with the claims statute renders the complaint subject to general demurrer.citation.a cause of action for damages is barred unless an exception relieves them of this requirement.bates franchise tax bd.th.
discussion 
pursuant to government code section t he date upon which a cause of action for equitable indemnity or partial equitable indemnity accrues shall be the date upon which a defendant is served with the complaint giving rise to the defendant claim for equitable indemnity or partial equitable indemnity against the public entity.a claim for money damages relating to a cause of action for injury to a person must be filed not later than six months of the date of accrual of the cause of action,subd.a.
the claim filing requirements apply to all claims for money or damages against the governmental entity for an injury for which the entity is liable.citation.state of california superior court,supra,d at.notwithstanding sce prayer for declaratory relief,its in essence states a claim for money or damages,against the governmental entity,relating to a cause of action for injury to person,and hence is subject to the requirement that a claim be presented not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.citations.ibid.
here,both parties to the appeal agree that sce did not comply with the applicable claim filing requirement.laabs second amended complaint was served on sce on october,sce did not file a claim until january,more than four years later 
on appeal,sce contends it is excused from filing a claim against the city because its is solely a defensive pleading and as such the governmental claim requirements do not apply.to support its position,sce relies on krainock,supra,d,wherein the court held that a defendant may file a defensive for indemnity against a public entity which has already filed a against it without first filing a claim.we disagree with sce that krainock is applicable to the present facts.
in krainock,plaintiff fiorello filed a personal injury action against defendants krainock and the poway unified school district.fiorello claimed that krainock struck him during a fracas at a school athletic event.the school district was sued on a premises liability theory.krainock,supra,d at.at the time of filing its answer,the school district filed a for indemnity,apportionment,and declaratory relief against krainock.krainock thereupon answered the and,without filing a governmental claim against the school district,filed a against the school district for the same relief sought by the school district in its.ibid.
the court of appeal held that krainock did not need to comply with the claims statute before filing his.krai
