petitioners challenge three orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that require the city of vernon,california vernon to issue refunds to the california independent system operator corporation caiso for overcollection of its transmission revenue requirement trr any opinion whose opening sentence includes three acronyms,one footnote that refers to three ferc orders and another that requires a definition of an accounting procedure is likely to be about a matter of some complexity.fortunately,the legal issue that resolves the controversy before us is not so complex as the dispute itself,and because this case is a continuation of the litigation that resulted in our decision in pacific gas electric company ferc,pg e,we have some prior familiarity with the events and disputes out of which it arose.
in pg e,we were asked to review a challenge brought by some existing ptos of caiso to a ferc order that approved the trr vernon filed when it sought to become a pto as well.we concluded that ferc had failed to demonstrate that caiso rates also referred to as the transmission access charge or tac would be just and reasonable if vernon were to participate under the proposed trr.on remand,ferc issued three orders directing vernon to pay refunds to caiso so as to restore caiso just and reasonable rate.vernon now petitions for review of these orders and asks us to consider whether ferc has authority to review vernon trr under the just and reasonable standard and to order vernon to refund any overcollection of its trr.
joining vernon are the transmission agency of northern california tanc,the city of santa clara,california,the city of redding,california,and public power agency collectively,the tanc parties together,they argue that because vernon,as a municipality,is exempted from the federal power act when it provides transmission services,see.power,ferc,citing united states pub.util.comm of,ferc has no authority to order vernon to pay refunds.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that although ferc has sufficiently demonstrated its authority to review vernon trr under the just and reasonable standard,ferc lacks jurisdiction to order vernon to pay refunds to caiso.accordingly,we vacate the portions of the orders requiring refunds by vernon and remand for further proceedings.
the federal power act fpa grants ferc authority to provide effective federal regulation of the expanding business of transmitting and selling electric power in interstate commerce.new york ferc,d citing gulf states util.fpc,d.section of subchapter ii under the fpa permits ferc to ensure that all rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to its jurisdiction are just and reasonable.fpa,a.
in the past,the monopoly control of utilities presented a major structural problem in the electricity industry because consumers were forced to pay a single price for bundled generation,transmission,and distribution services.see,midwest iso transmission owners ferc,midwest iso pub.util.dist.of snohomish ferc,snohomish.in an attempt to correct this problem,ferc implemented several policies to minimize anticompetitive behavior among public utilities.ferc began by requiring utilities that owned transmission facilities to guarantee all market participants access to those facilities,midwest iso,at citing promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities,order.next,ferc encouraged,but did not require,the development of umbrella entities called independent system operators isos and regional transmission organizations rtos.see id.at.ferc encouraged public utilities to participate in these organizations,which would manage the transmission facilities of each of its members and return to them the revenues set forth in the trrs.by assuming operational control but not ownership of the transmission facilities,isos which manage rtos would separate operation of the transmission grid and access to it from economic interests in generation,order.at,and promote efficiency by taking advantage of economies of scale in segmentation and control of facilities,see midwest iso,at.finally,ferc encouraged all entities in the nation,including entities,governmental entities,regional transmission organizations,order,emphasis added see also order.at,to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control of rtos,see order.at,some of which would be managed in turn by isos,see also order.at.
this last step created a complication from which this case arises.because governmental entities are exempt from the fpa,see fpa f,f,ferc can not regulate them even when they join regulated isos.see pg e,at.it is settled,however,that ferc may analyze and consider the rates of utilities to the extent that those rates affect jurisdictional transactions.id.citations omitted.in other words,ferc may consider the rates of a municipal utility pto to the extent that they affect the rates of the iso,which is subject to the fpa.
established in by the state of california,caiso is an iso subject to the fpa.initially,it had three ptos,each subject to ferc gas electric company,southern california edison company,and san diego gas electric company.under,ferc had authority to examine these ptos trrs to ensure that they were just and reasonable.on march,caiso proposed to amend its tariff to allow utilities,including governmental entities,to become ptos.see cal.indep.operator,ferc.although the aim of the proposal was consistent with ferc effort to encourage entities to become ptos,ferc nonetheless determined that this particular proposal was at odds with ferc regulatory responsibility because it barred any ferc review of the trrs of entities.see id.at.careful to disavow any intention to broaden the applicability of section to utilities,id.internal quotation and citation omitted,ferc accepted a revised caiso proposal only when it required ptos to submit their trrs to either an iso panel subject to ferc review or directly to ferc.see cal.indep.operator,ferc.
on august,vernon,seeking to become a pto of caiso,filed its trr.see city of vernon,ferc.ferc accepted vernon proposal subject to certain modifications of no significance here,see cal.indep.operator,ferc,which vernon made.see city of vernon,ferc.two of caiso ptos appealed ferc decision to accept vernon proposal on the ground that vernon trr did not meet just and reasonable standard and that ferc had failed to adequately consider how vernon participation and its trr would affect caiso overall rates.see pg e,at.
it should not be surprising that these ptos were troubled by ferc approval of vernon trr.because caiso rates are based on the trrs of each of the ptos,a vernon trr that is not just and reasonable could frustrate ferc effort to ensure that caiso rates are.observing this,in pg e we held that ferc never clarified or developed either the approach or the standard that it applied to review vernon trr,id.at,and remanded the case so that ferc can articulate with clarity what approach and standard are governing its review and how both ensure caiso rates are just and reasonable under,id.at.
on remand,ferc held a hearing and collected comments from interested parties,including vernon,the tanc parties,and the other ptos of caiso.in the initial decision,the administrative law judge alj concluded that vernon trr should be subject to a section like review,in order to ensure that its inclusion in the caiso rate results in just and reasonable caiso rates.city of vernon,ferc,emphasis added.reflecting the tension between vernon exemption from the fpa and ferc duty to ensure that caiso rates are just and reasonable,the alj left the standard of review vague,providing only that each element of vernon trr must be closely scrutinized using a method approximating a section review.id.at emphasis added.the alj made no determination whether ferc has authority to order a entity to pay refunds to an iso,because it believed that vernon overcollection could eventually be netted out in the iso balancing account.id.at.
in opinion,ferc affirmed much of the alj initial decision but clarified that vernon trr should be reviewed under just and reasonable standard.ferc.vernon having voluntarily made its trr part of a jurisdictional rate,the trr is subject to our jurisdiction and both can and must be reviewed thereunder.id.at.vernon sought a rehearing of opinion on the ground,inter alia,that ferc overstepped its authority in subjecting vernon to a review.
in opinion,ferc denied rehearing of opinion and emphasized that it read pg e as fully endorsing ferc review of vernon trr.ferc,wl,at.throughout the pg e remand litigation,vernon had argued that ferc was without authority to order vernon to pay refunds,see,id.at,but ferc only finally addressed this question in opinion.ferc determined that the refund issue was governed by section of caiso transmission control agreement with vernon agreement,which obligated vernon to pay refunds for any overcollection it received from caiso see id.at.ferc concluded that the iso had proposed section specifically to remedy the situation in which a participating transmission owner,such as vernon,will not be obligated to adjust rates or make refunds in accordance with the iso tariff,id.at citation omitted,and accordingly directed vernon to pay refunds to caiso,id.at.in response to vernon argument that the disputed order constituted an unlawful exercise of jurisdiction over vernon activity,the ratemaking activity of a governmental entity,ferc viewed the order as an appropriate exercise of its jurisdiction over the iso tac rate,of which vernon trr is a component.id.at.vernon sought a rehearing of opinion,requesting a determination that ferc had no authority to require a municipal utility to pay refunds.the tanc parties,who,as governmental entities,would be affected by ferc conclusions in opinions and,sought review of the two orders in this court.
in opinion,ferc denied rehearing of opinion,see ferc,and held that the agreement,which had been accepted by ferc,provided a basis for ferc authority to order compliance with its refund terms.because vernon bound itself contractually,ferc concluded that it could properly hold vernon to its commitment despite vernon status as a municipal utility exempt from fpa regulation.id.at.vernon timely petition for review followed,and vernon petition was consolidated with the tanc parties petition for review of opinions and.
we begin by determining whether we have jurisdiction to review petitioners claims.section b of the fpa provides that a party seeking judicial review of a ferc order must be aggrieved by that order.fpa b,b.a party is aggrieved within the meaning of b if it can establish both the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing.snohomish,at.to establish constitutional standing,petitioners must show three elements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.see,grassroots recycling network,epa,citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.to establish prudential standing,petitioners must show that the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute.ass of data processing serv,camp,d.
we have no trouble finding jurisdiction to review claims initially raised by vernon under administrative review by ferc.vernon has constitutional standing.it has been injured in fact because it was ordered to make payments out of its treasury,the injury was caused by ferc orders,and this court can redress vernon injury if ferc order is contrary to law.vernon also has prudential standing.because vernon sought to become a pto of caiso,its relationship with caiso falls within the zone of interests protected by the fpa.
were the consolidated petition before us to include only arguments previously raised by vernon in its administrative hearing,we would not need to resolve whether the tanc parties also have standing.see,ry.labor executives ass united states,i f one party has standing in an action,a court need not reach the issue of the standing of other parties when it makes no difference to the merits of the case.citing doe bolton,d.but the petition raises an additional argument not previously raised by,that ferc should apply a comparability standard to review vernon trr.see petitioners br.at.because vernon can not raise this argument for the first time before us,see entergy,ferc,parties seeking review of ferc orders must petition for rehearing of those orders and must themselves raise in that petition all of the objections urged on appeal.quoting platte river whooping crane ferc,emphasis in original,we must determine whether tanc,alone among the tanc parties to have raised this argument at the administrative hearing,see opinion,ferc at,has standing.
for tanc to have standing,its must be a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.quotation marks and citations omitted.the tanc parties argue that they each have standing because they are governmental entities and ferc orders are an important factor in determining whether ever becoming a pto is advisable for these entities.petitioners br.at emphasis added.but none of the tanc parties has yet sought to participate in caiso,nor has any developed revenue requirements for such participation,or submitted them to be reviewed by ferc,or been ordered by ferc to pay refunds.even if the resolution of vernon petition could affect the tanc parties decision to join caiso,at the end of the day,participation in caiso is not compulsory,but is voluntary.because their alleged injury is speculative at best,the tanc parties lack constitutional standing and therefore none of them may bring this petition.vernon alone has standing to challenge these orders,and accordingly,we address only the arguments raised by vernon at the administrative proceedings.
we first consider whether ferc,in its effort to ensure that caiso rates are just and reasonable under,may review vernon trr under the same just and reasonable standard.we begin by determining the appropriate standard of review for our analysis of this question.
in general,w e set aside a decision of the ferc only if it is arbitrary and capricious or otherwise contrary to law.envtl.action,ferc,citation omitted see also administrative procedure act.in making this determination,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment we are not empowered to substitute our judgment for that of the agency.exxonmobil gas mktg.ferc,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.w here an agency departs from established precedent without a reasoned explanation,its decision will be vacated as arbitrary and capricious.anr pipeline ferc.
petitioners argue that because vernon is exempt from fpa jurisdiction,ferc review of its trr is beyond the scope of ferc statutory authority.but once vernon becomes a pto,its trr becomes a component of the rate design under which caiso operates.and as we acknowledged in pg e,ferc may analyze and consider the rates of utilities to the extent that those rates affect jurisdictional transactions.pg e,at citations omitted.the new question for us involves the appropriate standard under which ferc should review the rates of utilities like vernon when those rates affect jurisdictional transactions.when ferc considered this question in opinion,it found itself constrained by several competing factors i its lack of statutory authority to regulate vernon ii its duty to ensure that caiso rates are just and reasonable iii the mandate of this court in pg e that ferc adequately explain how vernon participation in caiso can ensure that caiso rates will remain just and reasonable and iv the economic reality that caiso rates are affected by the rate designs of each pto.see opinion,ferc at.ferc held a hearing,received comments,and considered briefs filed by numerous interested parties,including jurisdictional ptos and entities seeking to become ptos.ferc considered alternative standards of review,including the substantial evidence standard suggested by vernon see opinion,ferc at,the comparability standard suggested by tanc see opinion,wl,at rejecting the comparability standard because it applies only to rates,and the section standard suggested by the alj,see opinion,ferc at.ultimately,however,ferc rejected these limited standards and concluded that vernon trr would be subject to just and reasonable standard.because vernon has no obligation to caiso ratepayers who will foot the bill for the trr,ferc reasoned,unless ferc reviews the individual components of vernon trr under the just and reasonable standard,vernon has every incentive to increase its trr at the expense of caiso ratepayers,as their subsidy grows with the trr and inures to vernon benefit,id.ferc thus concluded,the only way to ensure that caiso rate is just and reasonable is for ferc to examine each component of vernon trr under the full review.id.at emphasis in original.we find that ferc was neither arbitrary nor capricious in its decision.ferc properly considered the relevant factors,provided an adequate and reasoned explanation for its holding,and committed no clear error.
petitioners arguments to the contrary are unavailing.first,petitioners argue that because the pg e court directed ferc to ensure that caiso rates not vernon trr were just and reasonable,ferc should have subjected only caiso rates to the just and reasonable standard.but ferc has sufficiently demonstrated that it is impossible to ensure that caiso rates are just and reasonable without reviewing vernon trr under the same standard.see opinion,ferc at.nothing in pg e prohibits ferc from reviewing vernon trr under the just and reasonable standard,and it is not within our discretion to ferc determination after such a meticulous process and analysis.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.
second,petitioners argue that ferc ignored its own precedent,in which it has previously held that ferc can not review a transmission owner rates under the section just and reasonable standard petitioners br.at quoting cal.indep.operator,ferc.as we have previously noted,where an agency departs from established precedent without a reasoned explanation,its decision will be vacated as arbitrary and capricious.anr pipeline,at.in opinion,ferc explained its departure by reasoning that it read pg e as fully endorsing ferc review of vernon trr.wl,at.petitioners are therefore correct that ferc has not in the past reviewed a entity trr under just and reasonable,before pg e,ferc accepted vernon trr without reviewing it under this standard.but in light of our discussion and holding in pg e,where we specifically instructed ferc to ensure that caiso rates meet the just and reasonable standard of,at,we find ferc departure from precedent justified and in compliance with our instructions.under the circumstances,ferc was neither arbitrary nor capricious in subjecting vernon trr to the just and reasonable standard 
petitioners next argue that ferc,even if it may review vernon trr,lacks authority to order vernon to pay refunds.on this point,we agree with petitioners because the structure of the fpa clearly reflects congress intent to exempt governmental entities from ferc refund authority.again,we begin our analysis with our standard of review.
because ferc is a creature of statute,and the agency has only those authorities conferred upon it by congress,ass of regulatory util.comm,naruc,ferc exceeds its jurisdiction under the apa if it regulates an entity that congress has explicitly exempted from the statute,see,michigan epa,stating that in the absence of statutory authorization for its act,an agency action is plainly contrary to law and can not stand citations omitted atlantic city ferc.in determining whether ferc has acted beyond its jurisdiction,we grant ferc chevron deference.see nar uc,at ferc interpretations of the jurisdictional provisions of the federal power act enjoy chevron deference.citation omitted.we therefore review petitioners jurisdictional challenge to ferc orders by applying the analysis of chevron natural resources defense council,d.under this analysis,we first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,id.at.see also am.library ass fcc,an agency interpretation of a statute is not entitled to deference absent a delegation of authority from congress to regulate in the areas at issue emphasis in original citation omitted.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,chevron,at,we proceed on to the second step,in which we ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,and we uphold the agency interpretation as long as it is reasonable.see village of bergen ferc.
in this case,we need go no further than step one of chevron to hold that ferc acted contrary to law when it ordered vernon to pay refunds to caiso.section f of the fpa unequivocally exempts from subchapter ii any political subdivision of a state unless included by specific reference fpa f,f.the implication of this exemption is clear subsections of subchapter ii do not apply to governmental entities including municipalities unless a provision expressly provides ferc with such authority.we find it significant that congress has in fact authorized ferc with limited refund authority in subchapter ii in order to ensure that its jurisdictional entities maintain just and reasonable rates.section b gives ferc authority to order a public utility to make refunds of any amounts paid in excess of those which would have been paid under the just and reasonable rate.fpa b,b.this subsection,however,does not apply to vernon because a municipality is not a public utility.see,bonneville power admin.ferc,cir bpa demonstrating the difference between municipalities and public utilities under the fpa.congress has therefore specifically exempted governmental entities from subchapter ii of the fpa and has only provided ferc with refund authority over public utilities without making any reference to governmental entities.the intent of congress is clear from the plain language of the statute ferc has no authority to order vernon to pay refunds to caiso.
ferc alternative interpretation is impermissible.it argues that the agency here is legitimately employing its section authority to assure that a jurisdictional rate of a jurisdictional utility is just and reasonable.respondent br.at.but because nothing in the language of contravenes f specific exemption of municipalities,the plain language of congress remains dispositive on this point.a recent and similar case from the ninth circuit reflects this conclusion.in bpa,the ninth circuit reviewed ferc orders requiring both public and utilities to make refunds to california ratepayers for excess charges these utilities collected in some spot market transactions.the central issue was whether ferc authority to order refunds is based on the identities of the sellers subject to the refund order,public versus utilities,or on the nature of the transactions,ferc broad regulatory authority over the sale of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce.id.at emphases added.relying on the clear and unambiguous text of f of the fpa,and refusing to second guess congress judgment as to the breadth of ferc refund authority as provided by b,the court held that ferc authority is based on the identities of the sellers,rather than the nature of the transactions.see id.at.the court thus conclude d that ferc does not have refund authority over wholesale electric energy sales made by governmental entities and utilities.id.at.the court noted that ferc interpretation of and confirms that governmental utilities lie outside its and refund authority,id.at,and held that ferc can not expand its statutory authority to reach governmental utilities through b simply because such entities voluntarily participated in markets approved by ferc that involved wholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce.id.at.we a
