plaintiff phillippe lefebvre filed a putative class action suit against defendant southern california edison company edison.in his second amended complaint,lefebvre alleged that edison fraudulently enrolled ineligible customers in the california alternate rates for energy care program,which provides rate assistance to electricity and gas customers.the care program is subsidized by all other ratepayers,and lefebvre alleged that edison practice of enrolling ineligible participants caused the care program surcharge he and other ratepayers were assessed to be higher than it should have been.
the trial court sustained edison demurrer to the second amended complaint without leave to amend.the court did not address edison argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the second amended complaint under public utilities code section,subdivision a instead,it concluded that the action was barred by section,which prohibits a public utility from refund ing or remit ting,directly or indirectly,in any manner or by any device,any portion of the rates,tolls,rentals,and charges specified in a filed tariff.
we begin and end our de novo review with edison jurisdictional argument,which the parties have fully briefed.we conclude that section,subdivision a forecloses lefebvre claims because a judgment in his favor would have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the california public utilities commission the commission or puc.we further conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual background 
in an appeal arising from the sustaining of a demurrer,we accept as true the material allegations of the complaint.carter prime healthcare paradise valley llc th.the pertinent facts as alleged in the second amended complaint,the operative pleading,are summarized as follows 
a.the parties 
edison is a public utility company that provides electric service to customers in several counties in california,including los angeles county.lefebvre is a resident of los angeles county who at all relevant times was a ratepaying customer of edison.lefebvre asserts his claims on behalf of a putative class of edison ratepayers.
b.the care program 
edison is subject to regulation by the california legislature and the puc,subd.b.it also is required by statute to participate in the care program,a program of assistance to electric and gas customers with annual household incomes that are no greater than percent of the federal poverty guideline levels.former,subd.b.the puc is responsible for implementing and overseeing the care program.ibid.
all customers of public electric and gas utilities who meet the income requirements are entitled to enroll in the care program.the puc is required to examine methods to improve care enrollment and participation former,subd.d,and to work with service providers like edison to establish enrollment penetration goals former,subd.c.lefebvre alleges that the puc set a care program penetration goal of percent of eligible customers who wished to participate.
by statute,the rates charged to customers participating in the care program shall not exceed percent of the corresponding rates charged to residential customers not participating in the care program.former,subd.b.funding for the care program comes both from governmental sources and through surcharging the bills of all ratepayers like lefebvre and the putative class he seeks to represent.the surcharge these ratepayers pay is tied directly to the number of participants in the care program for each enrollee there is an incremental increase in the total subsidy needed to pay for that enrollee discount.the amount of the care surcharge is determined by a mathematical formula and is revised annually to take into account changes in ratepayer participation levels,residential rates,allowances,average usage,numbers of eligible households,sales forecasts,and other factors.
c.the alleged misconduct 
lefebvre alleges that edison enrolled and used funds collected from customers to subsidize ratepayers whose care applications showed on their face that the ratepayer was financially ineligible for the care program because the ratepayer household income was above the threshold levels established by law.he further alleges that by inflating the care program participation rolls,edison caused all enrolled ratepayers to pay a higher rate than they otherwise would have,because,given the increased number of enrollees,the total amount of any given care program subsidy in any given period is necessarily higher when more enrollees are receiving the subsidy.lefebvre alleges that enrolling ineligible customers in the care program pushed edison closer to the puc percent penetration goal for the care program,thereby allowing edison to curry favor with the puc and increasing the likelihood that the puc would approve edison requests for future rate increases.lefebvre further alleges that the ineligible enrollees increased edison customer base and therefore its profits,though he undermines that allegation in his brief by clarifying that the care program has no financial effect on the utility companies because the cost of the care discount is subsidized by ratepayers who are not enrolled in the care program.
it is unclear from the second amended complaint when edison allegedly engaged in this fraudulent conduct lefebvre alleges only that the scheme came to light internally in.at that time,edison performed an internal audit of its care enrollees and found that a substantial number of their applications demonstrated that they were financially ineligible for the care program.edison management ordered that the audit cease,and thereafter covered up the results,never reporting their ineligible care enrollment practice to the puc,the public at large,or ratepayers like lefebvre who were directly affected by the care enrollment practice.moreover,edison did not adjust the mathematical formula or its accounting practices to reflect or correct the problem.
d.the alleged harm 
lefebvre alleges that if edison had not enrolled ineligible applicants in the care program and subsequently reimbursed themselves for having subsidized the rates of these ineligible applicants,the care surcharge paid by all ratepayer s would have been less than it was.additionally,no ratepayer would have paid the excessive surcharge if edison had not billed them for it.edison never made any effort to remedy the damage to the ratepayers who had been unknowingly subsidizing financially ineligible care enrollees through a refund or credit.
procedural history 
a.the qui tam action 
this suit began as a qui tam action.the original complaint,filed on november,alleged substantially the same facts recited above and asserted causes of action for violations of the california false claims act,subds.a,a a violations of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et money had and received and accounting.the attorney general declined to intervene in the action.the relator subsequently dismissed the qui tam allegations and requested his removal from the suit.the trial court granted both requests.
b.the first amended complaint 
lefebvre replaced the relator as lead plaintiff and filed the first amended complaint on behalf of a putative class of edison ratepayers on may.lefebvre alleged that edison inflated the care program rolls and violated the ucl by doing so.he also asserted causes of action for money had and received an accounting.lefebvre alleged that he was injured by the overcharges he paid to subsidize care enrollees and requested equitable relief in the form of restitution or disgorgement.
edison demurred to all three causes of action asserted in the first amended complaint.as to each,edison contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction code civ,subd.a,that the first amended complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action code civ,subd.e,and that resolution of the first amended complaint should be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.as is pertinent here,edison argued the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case under section,which prohibits public utilities from refund ing or remit ting,directly or indirectly,in any manner or by any device,any portion of the rates,tolls,rentals,and charges specified in a filed tariff,and section,subdivision a,which deprives superior courts of jurisdiction to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the puc in the performance of its official duties.edison also argued that,at a minimum,the court should stay the proceedings under the primary jurisdiction doctrine see farmers insurance exchange superior court cal th,to allow the puc an opportunity to evaluate lefebvre claims in the first instance.
edison also requested that the court take judicial notice of puc documents pursuant to evidence code sections and.the documents,which pertained to the puc supervision of the care program,spanned nearly pages and included rate tariffs filings and decisions,orders,and resolutions promulgated by the puc.lefebvre did not oppose the request,which the trial court granted,along with edison subsequent supplemental request for judicial notice.
the trial court,judge lee smalley edmon presiding,sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.judge edmon concluded the entire action was precluded by section because lefebvre requested relief barred by its terms,namely remittance of the difference between the filed rate and the amount he believes he and the putative class should have paid.judge edmon did not address any of edison other arguments,though she indicated at the hearing on the demurrer that she was also persuaded by a lot of the arguments about.judge edmon gave lefebvre days to file an amended complaint.
c.the second amended complaint 
lefebvre filed his second amended complaint on november.in addition to repleading the three causes of action from the first amended complaint,lefebvre asserted four new causes of action.two of those causes of action,for violation of the ucl and imposition of a constructive trust,were expressly aimed at edison alleged misconduct in subsidizing ineligible care program participants and receiving money from ratepayers like him in order to do so.the third new cause of action,fraud,alleged that edison misled and defrauded the puc by failing to disclose its enrollment of financially ineligible customers in the care program and making false representations to the puc regarding the current and projected amounts of the subsidies provided to care enrollees.the fourth new cause of action alleged that edison misconduct violated section,which imposes upon public utilities liability for any act,matter,or thing prohibited or declared unlawful,or the omission of any act,matter,or thing required to be done.in addition to damages,lefebvre prayed for the disgorgement of all monies wrongfully obtained,an injunction ordering the imposition of a constructive trust on all monies wrongfully withdrawn from its books to fund the subsidies given to ineligible care program,and an injunction requiring edison to return those funds to its books.
edison demurred to all seven causes of action.as before,edison contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction code civ,subd.a,that the second amended complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action code civ,subd.e,and that resolution of the second amended complaint should be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.edison reiterated the arguments it made in connection with its previous demurrer,namely that the suit was barred by section because it sought relief tantamount to a refund and that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit under section.edison also requested that the court take judicial notice of four additional rate tariffs and the transcript of the demurrer hearing before judge edmon.lefebvre did not oppose that request,which the trial court granted.
in his opposition to the demurrer,lefebvre argued that he was not seeking a refund of a filed rate but rather the return of his future,beneficial interest in the account edison uses to deposit care surcharges and pay out subsidies,which would affect only future and rates.he further contended that his claims were not jurisdictionally barred by section because the puc oversight of care program enrollment practices was minimal,his claims were predicated upon past violations for which the puc could not offer relief,and a judgment in his favor would not hinder or frustrate the puc policies concerning the care program.
the trial court,judge amy hogue presiding,again sustained the demurrer,this time without leave to amend.like judge edmon,judge hogue concluded lefebvre claims were barred by section because they sought an unlawful refund or reduction of a filed tariff.judge hogue further concluded that n o amount of artful pleading will alter the basic fact that the gravamen of the actions is that a filed tariff was too high and that plaintiff and putative class members are entitled to a refund whether that refund is whole or partial,direct or indirect,immediate or,and therefore denied leave to amend.judge hogue did not address edison section argument,stating instead that the issue of jurisdiction need not be resolved because the suit is prohibited by section notwithstanding section.judge hogue also noted,however,that she share d judge edmon concerns under section.
judge hogue dismissed lefebvre suit with prejudice on april.lefebvre timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint flying dutchman park,city and county of san francisco th.the standard governing our review of an order sustaining a demurrer is well established.we review the order de novo,exercising our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citations.ibid.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citations.zelig county of los angeles cal th.we affirm a judgment based on an order sustaining a general demurrer if any one of multiple grounds for the demurrer is well taken,regardless of whether it was the ground on which the trial court relied.casey bank nat.th.
one of the several grounds on which edison demurred was that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate lefebvre claims.we agree with edison that lefebvre claims lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission.
general principles of subject matter jurisdiction 
subject matter jurisdiction is a fundamental requirement for judicial consideration of claims.saffer jp morgan chase bank th.the principle of subject matter jurisdiction relates to the inherent authority of the court involved to deal with the case or matter before it.citation.thus,in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,a trial court has no power to hear or determine the case.citation.and any judgment or order rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is void on its face citation.varian medical systems,delfino cal th.for these reasons,an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be addressed whenever it comes to a court attention.saffer jp morgan chase bank,supra,th at.moreover,it ordinarily is addressed as a threshold matter,as its absence deprives the court of authority to adjudicate the merits of the dispute.see holiday matinee,rambus,th,young tri city healthcare district th,assuming arguendo that trial court retained subject matter jurisdiction before addressing the merits.
section is jurisdictional 
edison argued below and contends here that both sections and deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate lefebvre claims.as we explain below,however,of the two statutes invoked by edison,only section is jurisdictional.we therefore begin our analysis with that provision,which the parties have fully briefed.
a.the puc and the public utilities act 
as the supreme court explained in san diego gas electric superior court cal th covalt,t he commission is a state agency of constitutional origin with duties,functions and powers.cal,art.xii.the constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities,including the power to fix rates,establish rules,hold various types of hearings,award reparation,and establish its own procedures.id.covalt,supra,cal th at.the constitution also gives the legislature plenary power to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission,which the legislature did by enacting the public utilities act et.wilson southern california edison company th,wilson.the public utilities act vests the commission with broad authority to supervise and regulate every public utility in the state and grants the commission numerous specific powers for the purpose,as well as the authority to do all things,whether specifically designated in the public utilities act or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction over public utilities.citation.covalt,supra,cal th at.
the legislature also has the power to establish the manner and scope of review of commission action in a court of record.cal,art.xii.pursuant to this authority,the legislature enacted article of chapter of the public utilities act,entitled judicial review.et covalt,supra,cal th at.that article sets forth a method of judicial review that is narrow in both manner and scope.ibid.under the provisions of section,the legislature restricted review of a commission decision to an action filed directly in the supreme court or court of appeal by means of a petition for writ of review.wilson,supra,th at,fn.additionally,the legislature then made it clear in section of the public utilities act that no other court has jurisdiction either to review or suspend the commission decisions or to enjoin or otherwise interfere with the commission performance of its duties.covalt,supra,cal th at.
as the above discussion makes clear,section was designed to protect the puc constitutional and statutory authority to regulate utilities.wilson,supra,th at.section,subdivision a,provides no court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal,to the extent specified in this article,shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the public utilities commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court.
section explicitly limits the subject matter jurisdiction of trial courts.wilson,supra,th at.by its terms,it divests trial courts of jurisdiction to entertain lawsuits that would interfere with the puc regulation of utilities.ibid.this distinguishes it from section,which governs the behavior of public utilities.see empire west southern california gas cal d,cundiff gte california,th,fn.section,entitled compliance with schedule,neither facially nor substantively concerns jurisdiction.instead,it provides in relevant part that no public utility is authorized to refund or remit,directly or indirectly,in any manner or by any device,any portion of the rates,tolls,rentals,and charges so specified in its tariffs.in other words,it precludes public utilities from charging rates different from those provided in their tariffs.cundiff,supra,th at,fn.although claims seeking relief that necessarily violates section may fail as a matter of law see empire west,supra,cal d at,cellular plus,superior court th,cellular plus,there is no indication that they fail for want of jurisdiction.edison has not cited any authority supporting its assertion to the contrary.we accordingly focus our attention on section rather than section.
the jurisdictional limitations in section place it in tension with another provision of the public utilities act,section,which authorizes the traditional private remedy of an action for damages covalt,supra,cal th at and provides that such actions may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by any corporation or person.to reconcile the conflict between these two provisions,our supreme court has declared the primacy of section and the correspondingly limited role of section.covalt,supra,cal th at.in waters pacific telephone cal d,the court held that in order to resolve the potential conflict between sections and,the latter section must be construed as limited to those situations in which an award of damages would not hinder or frustrate the commission declared supervisory and regulatory policies.the court in covalt further clarified that actions for damages under section are barred by section not only when an award of damages would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,when it would reverse,correct,or annul that order or decision,but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission,when it would hinder or frustrate or interfere with or obstruct that policy.covalt,supra,cal th at.on the other hand,superior courts are not precluded from acting in aid of,rather than in derogation of,the puc jurisdiction.hartwell superior court cal th,hartwell.synthesizing and applying these principles,courts generally have held that damages actions challenging a ruling of the commission on a single matter such as its approval of a tariff or a merger would not hinder a policy of the commission and may proceed.covalt,supra,cal th at.but when the relief sought would have interfered with a broad and continuing supervisory or regulatory program of the commission,the courts have found such a hindrance and barred the action under section.id.at.
section bars lefebvre claims 
a.the covalt test 
in covalt,the supreme court developed a test for courts to employ when determining whether an action brought pursuant to section is precluded by section.see covalt,supra,cal th at.the test consists of three questions whether the puc has the authority to adopt a policy on the issue in question whether the puc has exercised its regulatory authority governing the issue in question and whether the superior court action would hinder or interfere with that exercise of regulatory authority.see also guerrero pacific gas electric company th,guerrero.if all three questions are answered in the affirmative,section divests the superior court of jurisdiction over the action.hartwell,supra,cal th at.
application of the covalt test 
the parties agree on the nature of the issues in question both lefebvre identify them as ratemaking and the care program.they also agree that,as to these issues,the first two questions of the covalt test must be answered in the affirmative.indeed,lefebvre argues only that the claims asserted in the present case fall outside the purview of section because the third element of the covalt test is not satisfied.thus,for purposes of this appeal,we operate from the premise that the puc possesses authority to adopt policies regarding ratemaking and the care program and has exercised that authority.we concern ourselves only with the third question,whether lefebvre action in superior court would hinder or interfere with the commission exercise of its regulatory authority.
lefebvre contends that his lawsuit will not hinder the puc exercise of its regulatory authority over ratemaking and the care program because he is not seeking to change the way the puc administers the care program,or any of the utility rates the puc has approved.instead,he characterizes his lawsuit as one challenging the manner in which edison manipulated the implementation of the care program surcharge.he contends
