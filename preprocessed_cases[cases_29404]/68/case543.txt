factual and procedural summary 
the relevant facts of this appeal are not disputed.edison has installed bird guards to prevent animal contact with energized components of its electrical facilities.unfortunately,on january,near the intersection of valley street and lyons avenue in the city of newhall,these guards did not prevent a large bird from coming into simultaneous contact with an energized power line and grounded equipment on a utility pole,causing the bird death and a ground fault that sent electricity through pacific bell underground telephone cables,burning several of them.although aware of the risk to its equipment from ground faults,pacific bell underground system was not designed to withstand such faults and was placed in the same trench as edison facilities to reduce overall costs.the parties stipulated that the damage to pacific bell telephone cables was.

discussion 
edison liability for inverse condemnation 
on appeal edison contends that the central case relied upon by the trial court in finding edison liable for inverse condemnation,barham,supra,th,d,wrongly interpreted supreme court precedent to hold privately owned public utilities like edison may be liable for inverse condemnation as a public entity.id.at,d.edison also argues that under california supreme court case law,a privately owned public utility like edison can be held liable for inverse condemnation only in two limited situations where the private entity takes or damages private property directly through the exercise of eminent domain power delegated to it by the legislature and where the conduct that causes the taking or damaging of property involves joint participation of a government entity.
we find edison reading of the supreme court cases to be overly limited and agree with the conclusion reached in barham and by the trial court that edison may be liable under inverse condemnation for the damage to pacific bell property.
the authority for prosecution of an inverse condemnation cause of action derives from article i,section of the california constitution,which states in relevant part private property may be taken or damaged for a public use only when just compensation has first been paid to,or into court for,the owner.the construction of the public improvement is a deliberate action of the state or its agency in furtherance of public purposes.if private property is damaged thereby the state or its agency must compensate the owner therefor citations,whether the damage was intentional or the result of negligence on the part of the governmental agency.citations.albers los angeles county cal d,albers.
in barham,supra,th,d,the fourth district held that edison was liable under inverse condemnation in a situation very similar to the facts here.there,plaintiffs home was damaged by fire after high winds caused an edison power line to break resulting in a wildfire id.at,d.as it does in this appeal,edison argued that inverse condemnation should not apply because it is a privately owned public utility not a public entity and cited to the supreme court decision in breidert southern pac.cal d,breidert.barham,supra,th at,d.edison urges that breidert requires a private entity such as edison to be a joint participant with a government entity in order to be subject to inverse condemnation liability.see barham,supra,th at,d.
in breidert,defendant railroad and city closed a crossing depriving plaintiffs of access to a.breidert,supra,cal d at.the closure was authorized by an order of the public utilities commission.breidert,supra,cal d at.defendant railroad argued that it was not a proper party defendant to the present action,an inverse condemnation case.breidert,supra,cal d at.the supreme court simply noted that s ince defendant railroad was an active joint participant in closing the crossing,it is a proper party to the present litigation.citations.breidert,supra,cal d at.like the barham court,we do not believe the language of breidert supports the interpretation that liability for inverse condemnation required with a public entity.barham,supra,th at,d.while joint participation may certainly give rise to inverse condemnation liability,we do not believe it is required.
likewise we do not agree with edison overly narrow reading of pettis general.of cal.cal d.edison reads pettis as involving a narrow situation where the private entity takes or damages private property directly through the exercise of eminent domain power delegated to it by the legislature.in pettis,plaintiff landowner brought suit against two public utilities and his grantor to quiet title,to compel removal of utility lines and for trespass,and the defendant utilities argued that plaintiff was not entitled to injunctive relief or to quiet title against them because his property had been put to a public use and the public interest had intervened.id.at.the supreme court agreed that if defendants established at trial the necessity of maintaining their utility lines through plaintiff property,then plaintiff would be relegated to the remedy of damages as in inverse condemnation.id.at.we do not read the language of pettis as limiting a public utility inverse condemnation liability to only situations involving the direct exercise of its eminent domain power 
the barham court found further support for its conclusion that edison may be liable for inverse condemnation in the supreme court decision in gay law students association pacific.cal d.in gay law students association,the california supreme court held that defendant,a privately owned public utility,which enjoys a monopoly or,violates the california constitutional equal protection guarantee in article i,section,when it utilizes its authority arbitrarily to exclude a class of individuals from employment opportunities.cal d at.the supreme court reasoned that the utility was in many respects more akin to a governmental entity than to a purely private employer and the breadth and depth of governmental regulation of a public utility business practices inextricably ties the state to a public utility conduct,both in the public perception and in the utility activities.citations.ibid.of particular significance in this case is that a public utility monopolistic or authority derives directly from its exclusive franchise provided by the state.id.at,see pub,et a public utility monopoly is guaranteed and safeguarded by the state public utilities commission,which possesses the power to refuse to issue certifica
