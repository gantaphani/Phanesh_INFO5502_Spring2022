petitioners challenge the federal energy regulatory commission approval of tennessee gas pipeline company proposed method for awarding pipeline capacity and allocating meter amendments.finding that the commission engaged in reasoned decision making with respect to both issues,we affirm.
the natural gas act nga,et,requires that natural gas companies charge just and reasonable rates for the transportation and sale of natural gas.id.a.to promote compliance with this mandate,the act requires gas pipelines to file rate schedules with the federal energy regulatory commission and to notify the commission of any subsequent changes in rates and charges.id.c,d.on submission of a tariff revision,the commission may hold a hearing to determine whether the pipeline has met its burden to show that the amended rates and charges are just and reasonable.id.e.
this case involves a proposed tariff revision that tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee filed with ferc in.in that revision,the company proposed adopting a net present value,or npv,method to allocate pipeline capacity and to process meter amendments.two aspects of the revision are relevant here whether tennessee must impose a cap on the length of bids for pipeline capacity,and whether it must credit existing gas shippers contracts for mainline capacity in evaluating meter amendment requests.we considered both issues in process gas consumers group ferc pgc i and,finding ferc reasoning defective,remanded to the commission for further proceedings.here,we explain each issue in turn,first outlining ferc original position,then summarizing our decision in pgc i,and finally describing the commission orders on subject of this petition.
capacity allocation 
tennessee transports natural gas through a pipeline system stretching from the gulf of mexico to new england.historically,the company awarded firm capacity transportation for which the pipeline guarantees delivery,as distinct from interruptible capacity,for which delivery can be delayed if and when the pipeline has insufficient capacity to meet all customers demands,see pgc i,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted on a,basis.the first shipper to submit a request received the available capacity,even if the shipper requested service for only a few days or weeks while others sought transportation for longer periods.
recognizing the inefficiency of this capacity allocation method,tennessee tariff revision proposed adoption of an npv method,under which the company would announce an open season whenever it wanted to sell capacity,accept a range of bids,compare the bids by discounting the value of each bid to the present,and accept the bid with the highest npv.this new system,the pipeline argued,would permit it to award firm capacity to those shippers who value the capacity is,since rates are capped,to those shippers offering the longest contracts.
responding to tennessee proposal,various parties,including petitioner process gas consumers group,an association of industrial users of natural gas,warned that although ferc sets the maximum rate tennessee may charge for transporting gas,the pipeline could exercise its market power to induce shippers to bid for longer contracts than they would in a competitive market.in other words,the commenters worried that shippers would us e long contract duration as a price surrogate to bid beyond the maximum approved rate,united distribution ferc,udc,thereby giving tennessee insurance against future instability in the natural gas market.the commenters urged ferc to address this concern by capping the duration of bids tennessee could consider in its npv calculations,to simulate the end product of a competitive market.pgc i,at.
ultimately,ferc approved tennessee proposed switch from the,to the npv approach.gas pipeline,at.in response to the commenters market power concerns,however,the commission suggested that the pipeline include a uniform cap on the length of bids submitted during open seasons.id.at.acquiescing,tennessee proposed a cap,explaining that it chose such a high cap because bids beyond the twentieth year are unlikely to have a significant impact on the npv analysis.pgc i,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
following another comment period,ferc approved the cap.the commission dismissed process gas objection that the cap was too long to provide adequate protection against the pipeline market power on the ground that b idders are not forced into the maximum duration of twenty years rather,the primary issue here,is when two shippers both desire new capacity should that capacity go to a shipper who values it more,for a longer term,than another shipper who might value it less.id.at quoting.gas pipeline,at.unsatisfied with this response,process gas filed a petition for review,contending that ferc failed to engage in reasoned decision making in accepting the cap.id.at.
in our first encounter with these issues in pgc i,we found process gas argument persuasive.noting ferc acknowledgment that the market served by tennessee pipeline has monopolistic characteristics,we held that the commission had not adequately justified its conclusion that a cap would prevent the npv method from compelling shippers to offer the pipeline longer contracts than they would in a competitive market.id.at.we pointed out that the data on which ferc based its approval of the cap three previous commission decisions involving ten and fifteen year agreements in fact suggested that competitive market contracts typically run to no more than fifteen years.id.in light of that evidence,we continued,a cap would allow tennessee market power to induce excessively long bids.id.we recognized the legitimacy of ferc goal of encouraging the allocation of pipeline capacity to parties willing to pay the most for it,but reminded the commission of its need to balance th at goal with its duty to prevent exploitation of tennessee monopoly power.id.at.observing that the orders suggest ferc approved the cap because,functionally,twenty years would amount to no cap at all,we remanded to the commission,directing it to take the problem of tennessee monopoly power seriously and confront it with a forthright explanation of why a cap would not augment that power.id.at.
ferc then took an entirely different tack.noting that when orders are remanded,an agency generally has discretion to reconsider the whole of its original decision.gas pipeline,at rehearing order internal quotation marks and citation omitted,aff g remand order,ferc not only declined to impose a shorter cap on capacity bids,but removed the cap altogether,explaining that,for various reasons,there is little risk that tennessee will exercise its monopoly power to force shippers into excessively long contracts.process gas sought rehearing,but the commission denied its petition.rehearing order,at.
meter amendments 
the second relevant aspect of tennessee tariff revision involves meter amendments.pgc i explained this term as follows 
when natural gas is shipped through a pipeline,the points at which the gas enters and leaves the system are called receipt and delivery points,respectively.a firm transportation shipper selects primary receipt and delivery points as part of its contract with the pipeline.designating a point as primary guarantees the shipper use of the point,an important right when the pipeline lacks sufficient capacity at the point to satisfy demand.firm shippers can select other points on a secondary basis,but can only use those points if there is sufficient capacity beyond that taken by shippers using them on a primary basis.a change in a primary receipt or delivery point is referred to as a meter amendment because gas is measured at these points.
the issue here concerns tennessee method for allocating new primary points as they become available.historically,tennessee permitted existing shippers to switch primary points on a,basis as long as the chosen new points were available and the shippers notified the pipeline far enough in advance.when tennessee adopted its new npv method for allocating mainline capacity,however,the company indicated that it also intended to use this method to allocate primary points.thus,a meter amendment request would trigger an open season,and the requester would have to compete with other interested shippers on the basis of npv.id.at.
this new approach generated considerable controversy because in calculating the npv of competing bids for a particular primary point,tennessee declined to credit existing shippers preexisting promise to pay for firm capacity on the company mainline.that is,the pipeline proposed to assign promised future payments an npv of zero.under this system,therefore,an existing shipper wishing to switch its primary delivery point from city a to city b could not compete against a new shipper wanting to purchase mainline capacity with a primary delivery point in city b the existing shipper promise to continue paying for its firm capacity would have an npv of zero,while the new shipper promise to pay for unallocated mainline capacity would have a positive npv.
various parties objected to the proposed change,claiming that applying this method to meter amendments was inconsistent with ferc professed aim of assuring that existing firm shippers have receipt and delivery point flexibility.pgc i,at.the commission sided with tennessee,however,emphasizing that allocating capacity to parties who value it the most would foster economic efficiency,and further,that nothing in the new npv policy would prevent existing shippers from using the desired points on a secondary basis.id.quoting tennessee gas,at.the objecting parties sought rehearing and,when ferc declined to change its position,filed a petition for review.
considering meter amendments in pgc i,we agreed with the commenters that ferc approval of the npv method emphasized maximization of pipeline revenue at the expense of the ability of existing shippers to change primary points.id.at.we rejected ferc notion that shippers unable to obtain a point on a primary basis could simply use the point on a secondary basis because the latter option would not guarantee access to the point over any fixed period of time.id.at.at the end of the day,we observed,ferc position is that regardless of the ability of existing shippers to compete for points,it is best to award primary point capacity on the basis of the amount of additional revenue generated for tennessee.if existing shippers are injured,so be it.id.at.rejecting this approach,we remanded the meter amendment issue to the commission,explaining that,as we understood the situation 
existing shippers entered into their contracts with tennessee with the expectation of a certain amount of primary point flexibility.when the pipeline proposes to take away that flexibility altogether or reduce it substantially,ferc is obligated to provide a better explanation of why the shippers resultant loss can not be taken into account in a more balanced application of the npv pricing system.
on remand,the commission reconsidered its meter amendment ruling but again concluded that it is just and reasonable for tennessee to use an allocation method that gives a priority to bids for primary points which include a request for the related mainline capacity.remand order,at.in response to process gas petition for rehearing,the commission reaffirmed its order.see rehearing order,at.
seeking review again,petitioners challenge the commission approval of tennessee procedures for capacity allocation and meter amendments,reiterating many of the challenges raised in pgc i and arguing that the commission remand and rehearing orders ignore that decision express requirements.in reviewing these arguments,we uphold ferc factual findings if supported by substantial evidence and endorse its orders so long as they are based on reasoned decision making,texaco,ferc,and responsive to pgc 
with these standards in mind,we begin with the capacity allocation issue.in its remand and rehearing orders,ferc offers several explanations for its decision to revoke the cap on the duration of bids for pipeline capacity.most important,the commission argues that existing regulatory controls already limit tennessee market power,thereby minimiz ing any danger that the pipeline will withhold capacity from the market to create the artificial scarcity necessary to force shippers to bid for supercompetitive contract terms.rehearing order,at.specifically,ferc cites its regulations setting the maximum rate tennessee may charge for its transportation services,and requiring tennessee to sell all available capacity to shippers willing to pay that maximum rate.id.given these regulatory limitations,the commission contends,the only way tennessee could withhold capacity to force shippers to accept longer contract terms is by refusing to build additional capacity to meet increased demand.remand order,at.but,ferc continues,
t here is little reason for the pipeline to exercise market power by withholding new capacity because the maximum rates established by the commission prevent the pipeline from charging rates above the just and reasonable rates based on its cost of service.as a result,even if the pipeline refused to build new capacity,its annual revenues in any given year would be capped at its annual cost of service.all that the pipeline could potentially accomplish by withholding new capacity is getting the customers to sign up for longer term contracts than they otherwise might but this gives the pipeline no immediate benefit in the form of increased revenues or profits.it just reduces its risk somewhat by enabling it to obtain contracts with longer terms.by contrast,if the pipeline built new capacity to serve the increased demand,it could increase its current revenue and profits as a result,even without a term matching cap,it would appear that a pipeline has a greater incentive to build new capacity to serve all the demand for its service,rather than withhold capacity by refusing to build new capacity in order to create scarcity.
id.footnote omitted.according to ferc,therefore,to the extent shippers are bidding for longer contract terms than they would in a competitive market,they are motivated not by pipeline monopoly power but by competition with other shippers for scarce pipeline capacity.id.
reinforcing this argument,the commission points out that if tennessee ever refused to build new capacity to meet shippers demands,the shippers could file a complaint with the commission.id.moreover,applicable rules,see pt,prohibit tennessee from favoring or colluding with its affiliates to manipulate the market through sham bids,rehearing order,at,so longer bids truly reflect shippers desire to establish contracts with the pipeline.
finally,the commission explains that absent a widespread competitive market for primary pipeline capacity,there is no way of estimating what contract terms such a market would produce.id.at.any cap would therefore be imposing an arbitrary cap could distort efficient operation of the market by prevent ing a shipper who is willing to offer a longer contract term from doing so.id.at.thus,the only efficient solution,ferc contends,is to eliminate the cap altogether and to rely on other regulatory controls to limit tennessee market power.
these several rationales for uncapping the npv bidding process not only satisfy our deferential standard of review but also address our principal concern in pgc failure to articulate how a cap would prevent tennessee from exploiting its monopoly power.no longer relying on a cap to accomplish that objective,ferc now explains that other regulatory constraints adequately limit tennessee ability,as well as any incentive,to induce lengthy contracts.we think this persuasive for two reasons.first,because the commission already regulates the rates pipelines may charge and requires them to sell all available capacity at those rates,we agree with ferc that tennessee has neither the legal ability to withhold existing capacity nor an incentive to refuse to build new capacity.second,any effort by tennessee affirmatively to manipulate the bidding process would violate other commission rules and would therefore presumably be actionable.accordingly,as ferc argues,the fact that shippers may at times bid up contract length likel
