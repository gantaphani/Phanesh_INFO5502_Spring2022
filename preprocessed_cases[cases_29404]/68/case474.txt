the public utilities commission of the state of california calpuc seeks review of orders by the federal energy regulatory commission allowing the california independent system operator iso to enter into reliability rmr contracts with generators owned by entities not subject to the commission rate jurisdiction,and to pass through the costs of such contracts in the iso rates without filing under of the federal power act fpa.see.because it considered the iso tariff to be satisfactory as a formula rate,the commission rejected the argument that a filing was required.calpuc contends that the iso tariff does not meet the commission standards for formula rates,and alternatively,that even if it is a valid formula rate,requires when the formula is changed,whichcalpuc maintains occurs when the iso adds a new component by entering a new rmr contract.additionally,calpuc maintains that the commission reliance on of the fpa,is misplaced because the availability of review under does not abrogate the filing requirement.we hold that the commission could properly determine that although the rmr contracts are components of the formula rate or affect the ultimate rates charged pursuant to the formula,filing was not required and affords an adequate statutory remedy.accordingly,we deny the petition.
the state of california has restructured its electric supply operations,as implemented in large part by commission decisions,so that the iso now operates portions of the transmission systems of three california utilities,referred to as responsible utilities pacific gas electric company,southern california edison company socal edison,and san diego gas electric company.see pac.gas,at southern.in providing transmission services,the iso is required to maintain transmission system reliability.see pac.gas,at.the iso accomplishes this in part by use of rmr contracts to ensure ancillary services,voltage support,and energy to support the reliability of the grid see southern,at.under the rmr structure approved by the commission,see cal.indep.operator,cal.indep.operator,see generally pac.gas,at,the cost responsibility for the rmr contracts is reflected in of the iso tariff pursuant to its tariff,the iso passes through to the responsible utilities the costs of rmr contracts in each utility service area.see supra see also southern,at.calpuc concern arises because the costs are then passed along by the utilities to california retail ratepayers.
insofar as calpuc is concerned,the problem arose after the commission approved amendment to the iso tariff.the iso requested the amendment,in september,in order to enhance its ability to support reliability of the grid.relevant here is the provision allowing the iso to enter into rmr contracts with generating units that are outside the service area of any responsible utility and that make no jurisdictional sales of power.see fpa.the commission conditionally approved amendment on november.cal.indep.operator,at.the commission declined to require that the iso make a filing every time it seeks to pass through rmr contract costs involving a nonjurisdictional entity.see id.at.responding to concerns expressed by calpuc and socal edison,the commission noted,however,that the iso proposal did not explain how the iso would allocate rmr costs between responsible utilities if more than one was contiguous with an rmr unit.id.at.the commission stated as the iso is,in effect,proposing a formula rate,this lack of specificity is unacceptable.id.the commission therefore required the iso to make a separate filing under whenever it sought to allocate rmr costs where more than one responsible utility was contiguous to an rmr unit,and to revise its tariff accordingly.id.
calpuc and others sought rehearing regarding,as relevant here,the necessity of filings for rmr contracts with entities.calpuc asserted that i n the absence of such a requirement california ratepayers will be subject to paying rmr contract costs which have been negotiated by the iso without any public,consumer,or ratepayer input,and with no regulatory review.calpuc argued that the charging of rmr costs to a responsible utility by the iso was a jurisdictional sale under and,therefore,the commission was obligated to ensure that such charges were just and reasonable.the commission denied rehearing,responding 
the recovery of rmr costs under the iso tariff is through a formula rate.the iso purchases rmr services under the contracts and passes through the costs to responsible utilities under the formula rate.the filed rate in this circumstance is the formula.socal edison,calpuc,and others may challenge the costs recovered under this formula by filing a complaint under fpa section,and such challenges to costs recovered under a formula rate are not limited to prospective relief.accordingly,we see no purpose to also requiring the filing under fpa section of each contract the iso enters into with a entity.

on appeal,calpuc contends that the commission has violated both the fpa and its obligation to engage in reasoned decisionmaking.essentially,calpuc maintains that filing of the rmr contracts is required because rmr contract costs significantly affect the iso rmr rate,and thus must be filed under fpa c and d.the court reviews the commission orders under the administrative procedure act arbitrary and capricious standard.see power partners,ferc,a.because i ssues of rate design are fairly technical and,insofar as they are not technical,involve policy judgments that lie at the core of the regulatory mission,our review of whether a particular rate design is just and reasonable is highly deferential.id.quoting town of norwood ferc.thus,for calpuc to prevail,the court must be able to conclude that the commission was required to review the rmr contracts with entities pursuant to before allowing the pass through of rmr costs and could not rely on possible investigation,review,and refund proceedings under.pub.serv.comm ferc.
it can hardly be doubted at this late date that the commission need not confine rates to specific,absolute numbers but may approve a tariff containing a rate formula or a rate rule transwestern pipeline ferc.the commission has been accepting formula rates since the early.see me.yankee atomic power,at.as defined by the commission,a formula rate specifies the cost components that form the basis of the rates a utility charges its customers.hampshire gas,at.the commission acceptance of formula rates is premised on the rate design fixed,predictable nature,ocean state power ii,at,which both allows a utility to recover costs that may fluctuate over time and prevents a utility from utilizing excessive discretion in determining the ultimate amounts charged to customers.see id.thus,w hen the commission accepts a formula rate as a filed rate,it grants waiver of the filing and notice requirements of,and t he utility rates,then,can change repeatedly,without notice to the commission,provided those changes are consistent with the formula.power ferc,quoting san diego gas,at.as further explained,because the formula itself is the rate,not the particular components of the formula,periodic adjustments made in accordance with the formula do not constitute changes in the rate itself and accordingly do not require filings.ocean state power ii,at footnote omitted 
the commission has required filings,as calpuc points out,for matters that are central to the determination of a level of payments that affect the rate charged for jurisdictional service.see,cent,at,reh g denied,collectively central infra.yet it is the norm not to require filing of contracts that merely affect jurisdictional rates.most pertinent here,the commission has explained 
for example,a formula rate may have a component covering labor costs.obviously,if the public utility enters into a new wage agreement,this will affect the rate to be charged.however,the wage agreement would not need to be filed with the commission,although it might have to be produced in the course of discovery in a litigated case or in an audit.
