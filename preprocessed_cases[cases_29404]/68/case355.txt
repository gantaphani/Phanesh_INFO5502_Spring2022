here we review the competing claims of six independent electric power generators and three public utility companies,each dissatisfied with the manner in which the federal energy regulatory commission resolved an unusual problem involving an application of its interconnection pricing policies.the generators filed complaints with ferc,seeking to recover from several utilities funds paid to cover the cost to interconnect to the utilities transmission systems.arguing that these funds were a loan to improve the utilities systems,the generators sought a credit against charges for future transmission service.ferc agreed in part and awarded the generators a partial refund in the form of credits.but the amount awarded was not enough,in the generators view,and they now ask us to review ferc decision.three of the utility companies that would be required to issue the transmission credits are also dissatisfied with the outcome and likewise seek review,arguing ferc was without authority to award any credits.because we find ferc decision reasonable,we deny the generators petitions.we dismiss the utilities petitions because they lack standing.
we begin with a description of the context in which the parties competing claims arise a complex web of statutory provisions,regulations,agency and judicial precedent,and economic principles that is typical of federal energy law.
statutory background 
section of the federal power act fpa,b,grants ferc exclusive jurisdiction over the transmission and sale of electric energy in interstate commerce.section requires every public utility to file with ferc a schedule that includes the rates charged to customers for the transmission or sale of energy.id.c.ferc must ensure the rates are just and reasonable.id.a.
once approved,there is only one way for ferc to revisit its determination that a rate is reasonable.section a of the fpa requires ferc,upon its own motion or the filing of a complaint,to determine whether any rate,charge,or classification observed or charged by any public utility for any transmission or sale is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.id.a.ferc must remedy such a rate by determin ing the just and reasonable rate,charge,or classification to be thereafter observed and in force,and shall fix the same by order.id.ferc may not retroactively alter a filed rate to compensate for prior underpayments.see towns of concord ferc.a corollary to this rule against retroactive ratemaking,the filed rate doctrine,forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.gas hall,d.together,these rules generally limit the relief ferc may order to prospective remedies.see id.at.
the fpa provides a narrow exception to the limitations imposed by these rules,under which ferc can order the refund of some past rate payments.section b of the fpa permits ferc,when ordering prospective relief under section a,to order refunds of any amounts paid in excess of the just and reasonable rate during a statutorily defined period.b.today,this refund period begins at the latest five months after the filing of a complaint,and ends fifteen months later.id.in short,ferc can order a refund of overcharges paid during a limited time period that begins after the filing of a complaint.
interconnection pricing 
in what we have referred to as the bad old days,midwest iso transmission owners ferc,public utilities owned most of the nation electricity grid and there was little competition within wholesale electric energy markets,id.in exercising their monopoly power,these utilities refused independent electricity generators access to their transmission lines on competitive terms and conditions.see transmission access policy study group ferc.
in its landmark order,ferc did away with the old arrangement and sought to establish competitive wholesale power markets to increase consumer welfare.see id.at see also promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities order.may.to achieve this goal,order requires that public utilities provide open access to their transmission lines on nondiscriminatory terms to any independent entity that generates or purchases electricity.transmission access,at.
to take advantage of open access,generators must be able to link their plants to the utilities transmission systems.the process of physically connecting a generating plant to a transmission grid is called interconnection.although order did not address interconnection,ferc has since made clear that interconnection is an indispensable component of open access that must be offered on a nondiscriminatory basis.see.power,at.
the rates,terms,and conditions of interconnection are set forth in interconnection agreements between the utility that owns the transmission system and the interconnecting generator.these agreements identify the new facilities needed and what the generator must pay to achieve interconnection.the parties file their agreements with ferc for its certification that they are just and reasonable.see entergy,ferc.the agreement rate for interconnection becomes a filed rate that can only be modified under the section process.
ferc originally evaluated the cost allocations laid out in interconnection agreements on a basis but over time found this approach inadequate.see ass of regulatory util.comm rs ferc.in order and three successive rehearing orders,ferc standardized the method by which utilities must set their rates for interconnection.see standardization of generator interconnection agreements and procedures order.the pricing model ferc adopted recognizes that interconnection requires an initial cost outlay for two types of facilities.interconnection facilities are located before the point of interconnection and allow generators to connect to the transmission grid.network upgrades are located on the is,at or beyond the point of improve the network for the benefit of all users.see id.at see also ass n,at.the interconnecting generator pays up front for both sets of facilities.see order.at entergy,at.
placing the full cost of these new facilities on the generator alone,however,is unreasonable.see order.at.because interconnection facilities benefit only the interconnecting generator,the generator properly bears their full cost.see id.at.network upgrades,by contrast,improve the entire network,thus their cost must be spread among all users.see see also entergy,at.this distribution is achieved by assigning the cost of network upgrades to the utility whose network is improved.the utility rolls this cost into its transmission rates so that all users of the grid pay their fair share.because an interconnecting generator pays up front for network upgrades,it would be unfair to make it pay again for those upgrades through increased transmission rates designed to spread the cost of the upgrades among all beneficiaries of the improved service.the utility must therefore grant the interconnecting generator transmission service credits equal to the total cost of the network upgrades.the interconnecting generator uses its transmission service credits to offset future transmission charges paid to move power over the improved grid.see order.at see also entergy,at.
in the typical case,assignment of transmission service credits is straightforward.if a newly created facility is classified as a network upgrade in an interconnection agreement,the generator receives a credit to apply against its transmission service charges.as one might expect,this case is not typical.
factual background 
the generators entered into interconnection agreements with utilities before ferc interconnection pricing policies were settled.these agreements,accepted by ferc between and,classified facilities located at or beyond the point of interconnection as interconnection facilities rather than network upgrades.the generators were thus forced to bear the full cost associated with their construction and received no corresponding transmission service credits.see,exxonmobil entergy,exxon order,at,reh g denied exxon rehearing order.
after ferc interconnection pricing policies were settled,the generators filed complaints under section of the fpa,arguing that the classification of these facilities as interconnection facilities was unjust and unreasonable.the generators asked ferc to reclassify the facilities as network upgrades and order the utilities to issue transmission service credits equal to the amount the generators paid to fund their construction.
ferc granted the generators complaints in early.the commission had recently addressed a similar circumstance in duke energy hinds,llc entergy services,duke hinds ii,reh g denied duke hinds iii,and applied this precedent to resolve many of the substantive issues raised by the generators.in the duke hinds proceedings,ferc found that facilities located at or beyond the point of interconnection should be classified as network upgrades regardless of how they are characterized in an interconnection agreement.see id.at.any interconnection agreement that improperly classifies a network upgrade must be corrected,and the generator that paid for the facility is entitled to transmission service credits.see id.accordingly,ferc ordered that the generators interconnection agreements be revised and that they receive transmission service credits for the amount of their network upgrade payments.see,tenaska.ii partners.power tenaska order,at,reh g denied tenaska rehearing order,exxon order,at.
so far,so good for the generators.the catch came with ferc method for calculating the appropriate amount of transmission service credit owed to the generators.ferc concluded that the refund limitations of section b,together with the filed rate doctrine and the rule against retroactive ratemaking,prevented it from providing the generators with the full credits they would have received had the facilities been properly classified at the outset.see,tenaska order,at exxon order,at.the generators petitioned for rehearing,arguing that their upfront network payments were actually loans to the utilities that did not involve a rate or charge subject to section b.see,at.ferc disagreed,concluding that the upfront payments were not loans but rather a term or condition for interconnection service that charges the customer and provides an opportunity for refund.exxon rehearing order,at.according to ferc,the generators complaints challenged a filed rate that could only be revised under section.under section b,the interconnecting generators could only receive credits equal to their initial outlay for network upgrades less an amount equal to the transmission service payments made by the generator outside of the statutorily defined refund period.see id.at.ferc could refund overpayments made during the refund period,but granting the generators full transmission credits without subtracting some of their prior rate payments would,according to ferc,violate the refund limits imposed by section b.see id.at citing duke hinds iii,at.
we explain this remedy and the rationale behind it more fully below.for now,the important point to keep in mind is that its application to the generators claims wiped out any prospect many of them had for obtaining a refund of their upfront network payments.because the amount most of the generators paid for transmission service prior to ferc orders far exceeded their upfront network payments,deducting these rate payments from the total amount of transmission credits that might have been awarded left the generators with nothing.see reply br.of generator pet rs at.these consolidated petitions for review followed the commission orders,and both the generator and utility petitioners challenge ferc application of its interconnection pricing policies 
we focus first on the generators petitions,which we have jurisdiction to consider under b.the generators challenge ferc orders on three grounds ferc erred by applying section b ferc departed from its precedent without adequate explanation and ferc failed to resolve the complaints within the time allotted by section.we review these challenges under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act.see.our review is deferential.we affirm so long as the commission made a reasoned decision based upon substantial evidence and the path of its reasoning is clear.see power partners,ferc.
we begin with the generators argument that section b does not apply to their claims.
section a provides the only mechanism by which ferc can revise established rates 
whenever the commission shall find that any rate,charge,or classification observed or charged by any public utility or any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate,charge,or classification to be thereafter observed and in force,and shall fix the same by order.
a.section b provides the relief ferc may order for amounts paid in excess of the just and reasonable rate 
t he commission may order refunds of any amounts paid during the refund period in excess of those which would have been paid under the just and reasonable rate,charge,or classification which the commission orders to be thereafter observed and in force.
id.b.r efunds of any amounts paid outside of the refund period are forbidden.see towns of concord,at.section thus creates a strict remedial scheme with two potentially conflicting directives.on the one hand,under section a,ferc can not allow utilities to charge transmission rates that are unfair.on the other hand,under section b,ferc can not order utilities to give back money already collected except for money collected during the limited refund period.
ferc concluded that the twin demands of this statutory scheme precluded awarding the generators a full refund.as noted,the commission was faced with a similar set of circumstances in the duke hinds proceedings.in duke hinds iii,ferc determined that interconnecting generators must receive credits equal to their initial outlay for network upgrades less an amount equal to the transmission service payments made by the generator outside of the statutorily defined refund period.see at.the rationale behind this remedy is complicated.in simple terms or at least as simple as we can put them,the remedy ensures compliance with section as follows hypothetical transmission credits accrue to interconnecting generators when they pay for a network upgrade.rate payments made thereafter are deemed unjust overpayments because they could have been paid with the credits.the rule against retroactive ratemaking bars ferc from refunding these overpayments unless they occurred during the refund period.to avoid ordering prohibited retroactive relief,ferc reduces the generators hypothetical transmission credits by an amount equal to their past rate payments made outside of the refund period.to ensure prospective relief,ferc grants the generators the remaining unused credits,if any,which may be applied toward the cost of future service.see generally id.explaining pricing policy.in ruling on the generators complaints,ferc relied upon this approach and provided the generators the same remedy.see,exxon rehearing order,at t o the extent that exxonmobil has not previously taken service for which transmission credits either did accrue or would have accrued,exxonmobil is entitled to receive transmission credits on a prospective basis from the date of the commission order.citing duke hinds iii,at.
although ferc use of hypothetical transmission credits may seem puzzling at first glance,upon consideration their use does not make ferc orders inherently arbitrary as the generators suggest.see br.of generator pet rs at.these credits are simply a tool ferc devised to explain its calculations and navigate between the scylla and charybdis of section statute twin directives that require ferc to ensure reasonable rates and prohibit impermissible refunds.see duke hinds iii,at explaining how hypothetical credits are used to ensure prospective relief.the commission reliance on these credits is therefore an exercise of its remedial authority intended to ensure the generators are charged a just and reasonab
