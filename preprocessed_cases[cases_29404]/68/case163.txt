qwest corporation qwest appeals two district court decisions upholding orders of the minnesota public utilities commission mpuc or commission which set and applied retroactively the rates that telecommunication companies are required to pay when leasing qwest network infrastructure.we affirm the district court.
the telecommunications act act was intended to create competition between carriers in local telecommunication service markets that had been traditionally dominated by a single monopoly carrier.incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,such as qwest,own the network infrastructure necessary to provide local telephone service.the act requires ilecs to lease their networks to competitive local exchange carriers clecs and outlines procedures for determining lease rates.section allows ilecs and clecs to negotiate lease terms themselves in the form of interconnection agreements icas.a.however,if the parties can not successfully negotiate a rate,state public utilities commissions have the authority to arbitrate rates.b.
fcc rules require state public utilities commissions to establish rates based on a cost methodology called total element long run incremental cost telric.see implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,first report and order,fcc,local competition order.under telric,unbundled network element une rates are not set based on an ilec actual costs in building and maintaining its network.rather,une rates are calculated according to what it would cost today to build and operate an efficient network that can provide the same services as the ilec existing network.in this way,une rates can provide accurate market signals to inform clecs decisions about whether to invest in their own facilities or lease the ilec facilities.
in the spring of,mpuc reviewed une rates,some of which the commission had previously set in a generic cost proceeding and were based on telric.a group of clecs contended that some of these rates no longer complied with telric due to changes in market conditions and technology.mpuc concluded that une rates would likely change,and therefore issued an order on april,declaring that all qwest une rates under review would be deemed interim and subject to payments after mpuc set permanent rates april order.mpuc adopted an administrative law judge alj recommendation on october,and filed an order establishing permanent rates on march.as a result,qwest owed the clecs almost million in payments,which began accruing on april.
qwest brought suit in district court,challenging both the establishment of interim rates in the april order and the permanent une rates set by mpuc.in two separate opinions,the district court denied both of qwest challenges and upheld the orders.qwest now appeals.

retroactive ratemaking 
qwest first argues that the april order violates the rule against retroactive ratemaking.the rule against retroactive ratemaking prohibits a commission from prescribing rates to recoup a utility past losses for transactions that have already taken place.see,bp west coast,llc ferc,pac.gas ferc,consol.edison of new york ferc.the purpose of the rule against retroactivity,and the closely related filed rate doctrine,is to ensure predictability.pub.util.comm of california ferc.therefore,the rule does not apply in situations where there is adequate notice that resolution of some specific issue may cause a later adjustment to the rate being collected at the time of service.natural gas clearinghouse ferc,see also oxy usa,ferc,the goals of equity and predictability are not undermined when the commission warns all parties involved that a change in rates is only tentative and might be disallowed.
the april order expressly put qwest and all other interested parties on notice that the existing une rates were under review and subject to payments when mpuc adopted permanent rates.rates collected prior to april,are not subject to payments.with these considerations in mind,the april order change d what would be purely retroactive ratemaking into a functionally prospective process by placing the relevant audience on notice at the outset that the rates being promulgated were provisional only and subject to later revision.natural gas clearinghouse,at citation omitted.therefore,the april order does not violate the rule against retroactive ratemaking 
b.the language and policy of the act and fcc orders 
the remainder of qwest arguments about the validity of the april order center around the language and policy of the act.qwest argues that congress intended parties to know the rates for network elements prior to the transactions to which they would apply because under the act,rates for network elements must be included in icas.see a,c.however,merely because state public utilities commissions must arbitrate and establish any rates for interconnection,services,or network elements,c,there is nothing in the act to suggest that these rates may not be interim.
qwest further argues that interim rates and payments are inconsistent with the act and fcc pricing rules,which were designed to facilitate a telecommunications industry with a preference for voluntarily negotiated icas and une rates that send the correct economic signals to clecs.see pac.bell.telecomm,cir iowa utils.bd.fcc,cir,rev on other grounds,at t iowa utils,d in re review of the commission rules regarding the pricing of unbundled network elements and the resale of service by incumbent local exchange carriers,notice of proposed rulemaking,fcc rel,telric nprm.however,none of the policy goals noted by qwest changes the state public utilities commissions responsibility to ensure that the rates charged by ilecs comply with the standards of the act.see verizon communications,fcc,d d.rather,the need for correct economic signals actually supports the use of interim rates and payments.while some regulatory lag is inevitable and even helpful to ensure competition,see verizon,at,a rate that is long out of date frustrates the goals of telric.at t communications of illinois,illinois bell tele,cir.a limited adjustment of une rates that are no longer will not discourage clecs from investing in their own facilities see verizon,at.
moreover,interim rates and payments will not discourage voluntary negotiations by clecs.parties may not seek arbitration until after negotiations have failed.a,b.the possibility of payments will not reduce the parties incentive to initially negotiate.rather,potential payments that may favor either an ilec or the clecs provide a disincentive for any party to delay negotiations so that out of date rates may continue to be charged.nothing in the language or policy of the act suggests that interim rates subject to are forbidden when a state public utility commission is uncertain whether the current rates are.in fact,contrary to qwest assertions,the fcc orders actually support the opposite conclusion.
the fcc approved the use of interim rates subject to when state public utilities commissions were initially attempting to arbitrate rates after the passage of the act.local competition order.the fcc has also authorized the use of interim rates subject to in proceedings under.ilecs enter into icas and make their local network infrastructure available to clecs so that the ilec may enter the interlata market.c.the fcc has approved several ilecs entry into the interlata market under even though the rates in the relevant icas were interim and subject to.see in re application by sbc communications,for authorization to provide,interlata services in california,fcc rel,california order in re application by sbc communications,pursuant to section of the telecommunications act of to provide,interlata services in texas,fcc rel.june,texas order in re application by bell atlantic new york for authorization under section of the communications act to provide,interlata service in the state of new york,fcc rel,new york order.
interim rates are also used in orders by the fcc wireline competition bureau.if states refuse to arbitrate une rates,the fcc will preempt the state commission jurisdiction and assume responsibility for the matter.see e.the fcc has delegated this authority to the wireline competition bureau.see in re procedures for arbitrations conducted pursuant to section e of the communications act of,as amended,fcc rel.when the wireline competition bureau arbitrates une rates for icas,the fcc requires the bureau to set the rates as interim subject to in the event the fcc ultimately modifies any of the rates set by the bureau.id.in,the wireline competition bureau arbitrated une rates in virginia.in re petition of worldcom.pursuant to section e of the communications act for preemption of the jurisdiction of the virginia state corporation commission regarding interconnection disputes with verizon virginia,fcc rel,virginia arbitration order.the wireline competition bureau set une rates for virginia and,in accordance with fcc requirements,ordered that any rate established would be subject to a retroactive if the fcc established different rates upon review.id.
qwest contends that these fcc orders do not support the interim rates set by mpuc in this case.first,qwest argues that the fcc approval of interim rates is limited to cases where permanent rates were not already established,or where there was misconduct by the ilec.second,qwest attempts to distinguish the virginia arbitration order by arguing that arbitration by the wireline competition bureau is a unique circumstance because the bureau orders are always subject to review by the fcc at a party request.
we find qwest arguments unpersuasive.first,merely because the fcc has allowed or in the case of the wireline competition bureau,required interim rates subject to in instances different than the one presented here does not mean the use of interim rates is limited to those circumstances.rather,it suggests the fcc recognizes that limited use of interim rates can be valuable when it is uncertain whether the current rates are.see california order,texas order new york order see also in re application of verizon new england for authorization to provide interlata services in massachusetts,fcc rel,stating that interim rates subject to are appropriate in certain circumstances.second,the fcc approved interim rates in the texas order,suggesting that the retroactive adjustment of rates is not disfavored by the fcc.texas order.third,while ilec misconduct was a contributing factor in the use of interim rates in the california order,california order,ilec misconduct is certainly not the sole instance where interim rates have been approved by the fcc.rather,the fcc has approved interim rates in orders so long as an interim solution to a particular rate dispute is reasonable under the circumstances,the state commission has demonstrated its commitment to fcc pricing rules,and provision is made for refunds or once permanent rates are set.texas order,quoted in california order see also new york order.
qwest argues that the interim rates established by mpuc create too much uncertainty.however,whether rates are interim as arbitrated by the wireline competition bureau or set by a state public utilities commission for the purposes of proceedings,there is always a significant amount of time where the rates are subject to a refund or in the future.the fcc relies upon a approach,where interim rates may be appropriate if they are reasonable under the circumstances.california order texas order,new york order.under the circumstances,we consider the limited uncertainty created by the april order to be reasonable.
finally,qwest argues that the april order violates the act by retroactively changing the terms of binding icas.see a.qwest bases this argument on the ninth circuit decision in pacific bell telecomm,cir.in pacific bell,the california public utility commission cpuc issued a generic order that designated all calls to internet service providers as local traffic,thereby subject to reciprocal compensation provisions in the parties existing icas.id.at.the ninth circuit first established that cpuc lacked authority under the act to promulgate generic regulations over internet service provider traffic because the fcc had deemed this traffic to be interstate.id.at.cpuc role over interstate traffic is limited to its authority under to approve new arbitrated icas and to interpret existing agreements.id.at.second,the court stated that the generic order violated because it effectively changed the terms of all applicable icas in california.id.at.finally,the ninth circuit concluded that cpuc could not be exercising its power to interpret icas under because cpuc failed to consider any specific ica or reciprocal compensation provision.id.at.
unlike cpuc in pacific bell,there is no question in the present case that mpuc has authority to arbitrate une rates under the act.c,d,g.moreover,the april order does not purport to interpret the rates or terms of existing icas.rather,mpuc exercised its authority to establish new une rates in a generic proceeding.g.the april order was not based upon an interpretation of the existing icas.therefore,there was no need for mpuc to review the terms of specific agreements before issuing the april order.
we must next consider whether mpuc was arbitrary and capricious in setting select permanent une rates.qwest challenges four mpuc actions the reduction of switching costs the rates set for high capacity loops the plant mix estimates and the adoption of the hai model to determine general support assets.after considering the record,we hold that mpuc was not arbitrary and capricious.
reduction of switching costs 
switches route telephone calls to their destinations.switches can either be modern,computerized digital loop carrier dlc systems,or older and more expensive analog switches to comply with telric,mpuc had to establish switch rates that included the percentage of digital switches that a hypothetical efficient network in minnesota would utilize.mpuc adopted the hai model,proposed by at,which uses the switching investment calculated by the fcc synthesis model.see in re mechanism for high cost support,tenth report and order,fcc rel,inputs order.the hai model makes a reduction to the calculated switching investment to reflect the savings that would result from an increased use of dlc systems.the hai model assumes that the fcc synthesis model accounts for only dlc and that in minnesota dlc penetration in a hypothetical efficient network would actually be.therefore,the mpuc adopted a dlc adjustment to account for the higher dlc penetration and resulting savings.
qwest argues that the dlc adjustment is arbitrary and capricious because there is no evidence that the fcc synthesis model assumed only dlc,or that the fcc synthesis model did not already reflect the savings associated with digital switches.the fcc refused to adopt a dlc adjustment for this very reason in the inputs order.see id.however,the fcc cost model was developed to determine federal universal support and the fcc explicitly cautioned parties against using the federal input values to make claims regarding une rate determinations in other proceedings.id.therefore,mpuc was not arbitrary and capricious merely because it reached a different conclusion than the fcc.
at t expert testified that the fcc inputs assumed approximately of the switches were digital.moreover,at t expert and an expert for the minnesota department of commerce department of commerce or department testified that the fcc inputs from did not adequately reflect the savings that a network would achieve with dlc switches.qwest provided no evidence to the contrary.therefore,the alj rejected qwest argument that the dlc adjustment should be set to zero,as in the fcc synthesis model,because this would overstate the switching investment for a network.the act requires state public utilities commissions to make their decisions based upon the best evidence available,and does not mandate that
