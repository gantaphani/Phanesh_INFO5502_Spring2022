in these appeals,we consider whether the california public utilities commission cpuc correctly determined the price that pacific bell telephone company pacific may charge its competitors for access to its local telephone network,pursuant to the telecommunications act of act or act and the implementing regulations of the federal communications commission fcc.we conclude that,although the general methodology chosen by the cpuc to calculate a common cost markup was appropriate,the cpuc improperly implemented the methodology by attributing some common costs to wholesale operations that should have been attributed to retail operations.we therefore reverse the decision of the district court with respect to the amount of common costs that pacific competitors must pay for access to pacific network.we affirm the decision of the district court in all other respects.
background 
because of the expense and difficulty of installing the lines and hardware necessary for local telephone service,the provision of local telephone service was thought for many years to be a natural monopoly.see at t iowa util.bd.iowa i,d.states therefore granted local telephone companies monopolies in the provision of local telephone service.until the,at t was the provider of most of the nation local telephone service,as well as the provider of long distance service.as a result of an suit brought by the federal government,however,at t was forced to divest itself of bell operating companies that provided local telephone service.see at t.the operating companies were forbidden to provide long distance service.during this time,local operating companies controlled the provision of local telephone service through monopolies,while other companies competed to provide long distance telephone service.
congress dramatically altered this structure when it passed the act,stat.codified in scattered sections of.relying on new technological developments that made it possible for other providers to gain access to local telephone companies networks,the act eliminated the monopoly protections granted to the operating companies.it further required that local telephone companies,termed incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,offer access to their local networks,either by selling local telephone service to competitive local exchange carriers clecs at wholesale rates,by leasing parts of their networks,or by allowing competitors to connect to their networks.at t,at.in return,ilecs were permitted to enter the long distance telephone and the cable television markets,both of which had been previously forbidden to them.
to determine how much an ilec may charge clecs to gain access to its network,the act allows the parties to negotiate an agreement providing for the terms of access,including the price for such access.see a.if the parties fail to agree on those terms,the act requires state commissions such as the cpuc to resolve the dispute by arbitration.id.b.as part of that arbitration process,the state commissions are directed to set rates that are just and reasonable in light of the cost of providing the various network elements.the act provides that these rates should be nondiscriminatory and should allow for a reasonable profit.id.d.
the fcc promulgated regulations governing the methodology to be used by the state commissions in the determination of the rates to be charged by the ilecs.in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,wl local competition order see also verizon communications fcc,d upholding the fcc regulations.under this methodology,termed total element long run incremental cost telric,ilecs are entitled to recover the costs directly attributable to the specified element,as well as a reasonable allocation of common costs.local competition order.thus,the cost for a particular unbundled network element une has two components the direct cost of providing the element itself and the portion of the ilecs common costs attributable to the provision of multiple elements.we discuss these two kinds of costs in turn.
first,direct costs are those that are directly attributable to the une.these are costs that are incurred as a direct result of providing the network elements,or that can be avoided,in the long run,when the company ceases to provide them.id.the fcc directs state commissions to measure these costs based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the lowest cost network configuration,given the existing location of the incumbent wire centers.c.while the technology on which the costs are based is not necessarily the technology that the ilec actually uses,the fcc reasoned that this method of calculating costs would best replicate,to the extent possible,the condition of a competitive market,which in turn would allow the clec to produce efficiently and to compete effectively,which should drive retail prices to their competitive levels.local competition order.
second,common costs are those that are common to multiple unes these are costs that are incurred in connection with the production of multiple products or services,and remain unchanged as the relative proportion of those products or services varies,the salaries of corporate managers.id.the fcc conceived of two types of common costs those that are specific to a particular subset of unes,and those that are common to the entire corporation 
as discussed above,some of these costs are common to only a subset of the elements or services provided by incumbent lecs.such costs shall be allocated to that subset,and should then be allocated among the individual elements or services in that subset,to the greatest possible extent.common costs also include costs that are incurred by the firm operations as a whole,that are common to all services and elements,salaries of executives involved in overseeing all activities of the business,although for the purpose of pricing interconnection and access to unbundled elements,which are intermediate products offered to competing carriers,the relevant common costs do not include billing,marketing,and other costs attributable to the provision of retail service.given these common costs,setting the price of each discrete network element based solely on the incremental costs directly attributable to the production of individual elements will not recover the total costs of operating the wholesale network a reasonable measure of such costs shall be included in the prices for interconnection and access to network elements.
in calculating common costs,the fcc provided the states some latitude to choose a methodology,so long as the method is consistent with the goals of the act.id.however,the fcc suggested various allocation methods it considered to be proper.one of those methods was adopted by the cpuc in these proceedings.under this method,common costs are allocated using a fixed allocator,such as a percentage markup over the directly attributable costs.id.this markup reflects a particular une share of the common costs.thus,if of an ilec costs are what the fcc would consider common,adding to the direct cost of any given une would allow the ilec to recover its total costs associated with providing that une.the ultimate goal of such a markup is to spread the costs that are not directly attributable to any particular une over all the unes that are supported by those costs.
as a result,when a clec leases a particular une,it is paying not only the direct costs of that une,but also the part of the common costs attributable to the production and maintenance of the particular une.depending on the type of common cost,all or part of it will be attributable to unes and allocated among them.thus,for example,all of the cost of salaries of technicians working only to service unes will be allocated to the various unes they service.by contrast,only part of the cost of the salary of the ceo of the company will be allocated to unes because the ceo supports the operations of the entire company,not just those that provide unes.
ii.proceedings below 
cpuc proceedings 
in this case,the cpuc determined what pacific,an ilec,may charge clecs such as appellants mci and at t for access to various network elements.prior to the passage of the act,california had passed legislation of its own that was designed to open local telephone service to competition.see cal.pub.west.as a result,the cpuc had already begun holding hearings to implement the california law when the act was passed.see the open network to bottleneck services and a framework for network architecture development of dominant carrier networks,cpuc oanad proceeding.after passage of the act and the adoption of the local competition order by the fcc,the cpuc adopted the telric methodology,finding that it was superior to the methodology it had initially decided to employ.at first cost decision one of the features of the telric methodology that the cpuc found attractive was the requirement that retail costs be removed from consideration when determining the amount of common costs to be borne by the clecs in gaining access to unes.in concluding that the telric methodology was better suited to its purposes,the cpuc relied on two experts who testified that because the clecs are purchasing access to specific network elements,and not the services that the clec will itself sell to customers,telric was a more appropriate method of calculating costs.they explained 
telric is a cost concept that refers to an intermediate level of production,or to goods sold at wholesale.therefore,telric costs should not include any of the costs of supplying services to end user customers.this is an important difference between the two cost concepts.an entrant using unes as the inputs for its end user services can compete with the incumbent either on the level of retailing,or on the way it combines those elements to provide services,or both.if the entrant has to incur both its own retailing costs as well as having to pay some of the incumbent retailing costs,it faces a barrier to entry.
first cost decision at emphasis in original.thus,the cpuc adopted telric,in part,in order to ensure that the clecs would not be forced to pay the ilec for the costs the ilec incurred in performing its retail operations.
determination of common costs 
in its first cost decision adopting the telric methodology,the cpuc noted that the costs from retail services should be excluded from the price of a une.id.at.this is so,according to the cpuc,because retail costs are not attributable to the production of network elements that are offered to interconnecting carriers.id.at.
in the same decision,the cpuc determined the amount of common costs that would be included in determining the common cost allocator,as well as the amount of common costs that were and thus would be excluded.see id.at in this phase our task is to determine the retail portion of common costs that are likely to be incurred by pacific in a environment.while pacific claimed before the cpuc that its total common costs were approximately billion,mci and at t claimed that this figure included over million in costs.the cpuc agreed with mci and at t only in part,determining that only million of the costs claimed by pacific as common had a clear retail component and thus should be excluded.the district court described these excluded costs as those that,in a hypothetical environment in which pacific is solely a wholesaler,pacific would not incur.at t,d at.in other words,under the cpuc analysis,if pacific were to cease all of its retail operations,the cpuc should consider all of the remaining common costs.since only million of the additional common costs claimed by pacific would not exist in a hypothetical world in which pacific engaged in no retail operations,the cpuc excluded only those costs.
operation support systems 
in the cpuc second cost decision,it set the costs for pacific operations support system oss gateways.see at second cost decision an oss gateway is a kind of une that allows clecs to interconnect with the ilec.costs associated with oss gateways consist of,ordering,provisioning,maintenance and repair,and billing functions supported by an incumbent lec databases and information.see also local competition order at.as noted by the fcc and the cpuc,an oss gateway is vital to implementation of the act,since it is only through such a gateway that a clec can efficiently gain access to an ilec network to provide service to.see second cost decision at.
although the primary purpose of the cpuc was to set the costs nrcs for the oss gateway,it also received studies from pacific addressing the need to recover recurring costs for the provision of oss gateways.nrcs are expenses associated with initiating or disconnecting a service,and include the labor necessary to effectuate the interconnection of a clec with an ilec.recurring costs,by contrast,are those necessary to maintain the oss gateway.compare second cost decision at with id.at.
the nrcs of providing oss gateways depend,in part,on how much labor is required to effectuate the interconnection.for example,a clec might call in or fax an order to the ilec requesting service,with a clec employee then implementing the request.this,of course,would involve high labor costs,increasing the nrc.or,to provide another example,the clec and ilec might interact electronically,with minimal employee involvement,leading to lower nrcs.see id.at.
in the proceeding before the cpuc to determine the oss gateway nrcs,the interested parties submitted different proposed models to the cpuc for setting rates for the oss gateways.not surprisingly,mci and at t assumed significant electronic interaction,leading to much lower nrcs.id.at.pacific,on the other hand,submitted a model with three variations,each with different levels of electronic interaction and cost.id.at.ultimately,the cpuc adopted pacific model for determining nrcs,though with modifications.id.at.it concluded that pacific model was the only one that included support for all of the unes specified by the cpuc and most of those specified by the fcc,and that accounted for variations in the ways that clecs might choose to connect with the ilec.id.at.as required by the fcc,the cpuc required that the costs ultimately adopted be based on the most efficient technology currently available.that is,it selected the model that assumed a high level of electronic interaction.
with respect to the recurring costs of providing the oss gateways,the parties were also in disagreement.mci and at t contended that the recurring costs were so low as to be de minimis and thus should not be included in the cost of providing the oss gateways.id.at.pacific,on the other hand,argued that these costs were significant and should therefore be passed on to the clecs.other parties responded that many of these recurring costs also supported pacific own retail operations,since the oss gateways are also used by the ilec in providing local telephone service to its own customers.id.at.based on the costs studies before it,the cpuc concluded that many of pacific proposed costs were,and further,that pacific had failed to isolate costs that were unique to providing clecs access to the oss gateways 
we find merit in at assertions that pacific oss functions provide benefits to its own retail operations.while pacific attempts to identify discrete customer specific costs in its access port cost analysis,its showing fails to reflect that the underlying systems and databases are in place to serve both retail and wholesale customers and thus the costs can not be attributed solely to clcs.we find pacific has not demonstrated that these costs should be recovered from competitors.
the cpuc concluded that pacific had provided insufficient evidence to permit the cpuc to separate the recurring costs from the recurring costs as required by telric.while concluding that the costs identified by pacific should not be included in the price charged to clecs,the cpuc did suggest that those costs might qualify as implementation costs,which were being considered in a separate proceeding id.at.pacific,apparently concluding that those costs were not implementation costs,declined to submit its cost studies at the separate proceeding and did not seek rehearing of the cpuc decision in this proceeding.
determination of une costs 
in its third and final decision,the cpuc set the rates that pacific would be permitted to charge for its unes.see oanad decision included in that decision was a determination of how the common cost markup would be calculated.again,the interested parties offered different methods.pacific argued that the markup should be determined by dividing the allocated common costs by the total direct costs of the various network elements.id.at.this method creates a fraction,with the numerator being the total common costs,and the denominator being the total direct costs.the cpuc discusses this method in terms of the numerator and denominator,and this terminology was adopted by the district court.for ease of discussion,we will also adopt this terminology.using this methodology,pacific arrived at a figure of for the markup.that is,the direct cost of each une would be increased by to account for the common costs incurred by pacific in producing that une.mci and at t,however,argued that the denominator should also include and category iii costs.category iii costs are associated with unregulated aspects of a lec,such as the provision of internet access.mci estimated that this adjustment would increase the denominator by approximately billion,yielding a markup of 
the cpuc adopted,in substantial part,pacific proposal.although it added million to the denominator to account for direct costs previously not counted,thereby decreasing the markup to,it rejected at t and mci position that the denominator should include and category iii costs.in so doing,it adopted a statement from pacific representative that at t and mci ignored the fact that all of the shared and common costs that are have been removed from the shared and common costs in this phase it is therefore entirely appropriate and proper to divide the shared and common costs by the direct costs to obtain the markup for unes.id.at emphasis in original.
with respect to the category iii costs,the cpuc noted that pacific unregulated category iii businesses have their own overhead organizations.to the extent they use pacific overhead departments,the costs are directly billed to them under the transfer mechanisms.since these costs,like costs,are excluded from the common costs claimed by pacific,the cpuc concluded that they should likewise be excluded from the direct costs in the denominator.id.at.
finally,the cpuc declined to revisit the issue of oss gateway costs.it noted that n o oss recurring costs were adopted,because the models submitted by pacific were found to contain significant flaws.id.at.it once again suggested that pacific seek recovery of oss recurring costs attributable to servicing clecs in the proceeding addressing implementation costs.
district court proceedings 
mci and at t brought suit in federal district court challenging the cpuc decision.specifically,they argued that the manner in which the cpuc calculated the markup,and consequently,the rates at which pacific must lease various unes to clecs,violated the act and the fcc order.pacific filed various also alleging that the cpuc violated the act.it argued that the cpuc acted unlawfully in not setting rates for recurring oss gateway costs,and asserted other claims not relevant to this appeal.in considering for summary judgment,the district court affirmed the decision of the cpuc in relevant part.
first,mci and at t challenged the cpuc decision to adopt pacific methodology in determining the markup,in particular its failure to include the direct costs of all of pacific operations in the denominator,including retail and category iii services.at t,d at.mci and at t argued that by including only direct une costs in the denominator,the cpuc effectively allocated all of pacific common costs exclusively to the cost of unes.id.pacific responded in the same manner as it did before the cpuc,arguing that since retail and category iii costs were not included in the,the numerator,it was inappropriate to include them in the denominator.
the district court agreed with pacific.citing of the local competition order,the district court held that the telric methodology calculates an ilec costs in a hypothetical,environment in which the ilec is solely a wholesaler.id.at.as a result,according to the district court,
all retail costs are excluded from the calculation of common costs and the common cost markup,because retail costs should not be included in the prices that ilecs charge clecs to lease unes.in other words,pacific common costs are the common costs that pacific would experience as a wholesale firm.in such a wholesale environment,it would make no sense to divide pacific common costs by anything more than pacific direct costs of unes.pacific,common costs are reasonably divided by only the direct costs of unes,and not to pacific retail services or category iii services,which would not exist in a wholesale only environment.
id.the district court thus found that the cpuc determination of the markup was reasonable,and affirmed the decision of the cpuc.
the district court also affirmed the cpuc refusal to permit pacific to seek reimbursement for recurring oss gateway costs.it found that the cpuc had made a decision on the merits with respect to whether pacific should be reimbursed for oss gateway recurring costs,and that by referring pacific to the local competition proceeding,the cpuc was not guaranteeing that it would reimburse pacific for those costs.id.at.ultimately,however,the district court affirmed the decision of the cpuc on exhaustion grounds,holding that by failing to petition the cpuc for rehearing on the matter,pacific was precluded from appealing that issue to the district court.id.at.
mci and at t appealed.they once again claim,inter alia,that the cpuc and the district court erred in not including retail and category iii costs in the denominator,and that the markup was thus inflated.pacific,claiming once again that the cpuc should have set rates for the recurring costs in providing oss.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.

iv.discussion 
common cost markup 
we turn first to the cpuc decision to adopt pacific methodology in determining the markup to be applied to the cost of unes,a decision we review de novo.we interpret the act and the fcc regulations in light of congress goals.see local competition order.
the local competition order grants state commissions considerable latitude in determining how to allocate common costs.id.f common costs shall be allocated among elements and services in a reasonable manner.the cpuc decided to use a fixed allocator of common costs,a method suggested by the fcc order.given the consistency of the fcc order with the terms and goals of the act,we can not say that the cpuc decision to use that methodology violates the act.since the common costs are,by definition,costs that are common to all or part of an ilec operation,allowing a standard markup over all unes for common costs properly attributable to unes should allow an ilec to recover the full costs of providing unes,as contemplated by the act itself,while still allowing clecs to compete with the incumbents on an level playing field.that is,the price paid by the clec should approximate the cost to the ilec of providing the unes.
mci and at t central challenge is not to this basic methodology,but rather to the cpuc implementation of it.they claim that the denominator should include and category iii direct costs,not just the direct costs of providing the unes.as noted by the cpuc,however,this would mix apples and oranges.see oanad decision at.the cpuc allocated the common costs of providing unes by d
