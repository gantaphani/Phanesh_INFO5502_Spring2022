american electric power,aep and central and south west csw,two large regional utility holding companies,jointly petitioned the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission for merger approval,as required by of the federal power act,a.when presented with a merger or acquisition request,ferc shall approve the request if the merger or acquisition will be consistent with the public interest.id.after lengthy review,ferc conditionally approved the merger and required the combined company,referred to as new aep,to divest certain generation assets and share transmission capacity information.see am.power cent,wl.wabash valley power association,wabash,an indiana competitor and customer of aep,petitions for review.
wabash contends that ferc decision was both procedurally and substantively defective.many of wabash claims have been forfeited,however,because they were not properly raised with ferc in the first instance.therefore,these claims may not be considered by the court.and we find no merit in the claims that are properly before this court.
because aep and csw sought merger approval in the midst of sweeping regulatory changes in the electric industry,ferc chose to impose interim mitigation measures to limit new aep market power.wabash contends that ferc approach is improper under the federal power act,because the interim measures are deficient.we disagree.on the record at hand,we find that ferc acted reasonably in adopting two stages of restrictions to limit new aep market power.both stages of restrictions adequately limit new aep ability to strategically manipulate electricity generation to cause transmission bottlenecks.we also reject wabash claims that ferc merger approval should be overturned because it is inconsistent with subsequent staff statements and because it did not fully eliminate rate pancaking.these claims have no bearing on the question of whether ferc approval of the merger was arbitrary and capricious.we therefore deny wabash petition for review.
background 
aep and csw sought to merge in the midst of a seachange in the regulations governing the electricity industry.because many of the issues raised by petitioner relate to the application of these new regulations,we begin with a brief summary of the current regulatory landscape and then move to the procedural history of this case.
current regulations 
by amending portions of the federal power act of,the energy policy act of authorized ferc to order utilities to transmit other sellers power over their transmission lines on a basis.see,stat,codified at transmission access policy study group ferc,hereinafter transmission access discussing history,cert.granted sub nom.new york ferc,d.finding that utilities would use their market power to deny transmission access to competing generation sources,ferc subsequently used its statutory authority,see b,a,to require utilities to provide open access to their transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory fashion.see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities,order,fed.reg.may,clarified,wl july,and fed.reg,on reh g,order,fed.reg,clarified,wl may,on reh g,order,fed.reg,on reh g,order,wl,aff,transmission access,cert.granted sub nom.new york.order,among other things,set forth the framework for creating independent system operators isos,independent companies that manage transmission facilities owned by utilities.fed.reg.at.isos have no financial stake in any power market participant,have the ability to halt generation causing transmission system constraints,and must provide transmission information to market participants.id.
at the same time,ferc also issued order which required all owners and operators of electricity transmission systems to participate in an open access information system,or oasis.open access information system and standards of conduct,order,fed.reg.may,on reh g,order,fed.reg,on reh g,order,fed.reg,aff,transmission access,cert.granted sub nom.new york.one of the main functions of an oasis is to calculate available transmission capacity atc,the difference between a transmission system total capacity and capacity.order,fed.reg.at.because atc often limits where electricity can be sold,this information allows generators to determine additional potential markets.
in,ferc found that the changes brought by orders and had imposed significant strain on traditional means of grid management and that continued discrimination in the provision of transmission services by vertically integrated utilities may also be impeding fully competitive electricity markets.regional transmission organizations notice of proposed rulemaking,fed.reg,at june.although orders and reduced overt discrimination,utilities resorted to more subtle means to frustrate their marketing competitors and favor their own marketing interests.id.at.as a consequence,the orders were ineffective in completely removing transmission discrimination.functional limitations arising from the relatively small size of the isos also limited their ability to provide essential information accurately,such as atc it is not possible to calculate accurately the transmission capability of one system without knowing the flows scheduled by all other interconnected transmission providers in the region.id.at.
in response to the shortcomings of orders and,ferc issued order,which established the framework for regional transmission organizations,or rtos.see regional transmission organizations,order,fed.reg,on reh g,order,fed.reg,petitions for review pending sub nom.public utility district of snohomish county,washington ferc.argued.rtos build upon many iso features and have four main characteristics independence,sufficient size and regional scope,operational authority for all transmission facilities under their control,and exclusive authority for maintaining short term grid reliability.fed.reg,at.ferc requires rtos to be larger,more independent,and exercise more sophisticated control over the transmission system than isos.in,ferc further clarified the scope requirements of rtos,forcing several parties into mediation with an ultimate goal of creating four rtos one for the northeast,southeast,midwest,and west.see,order provisionally granting rto status,wl july.
procedural history 
aep and csw jointly applied to ferc for merger approval on april.at that time,aep,through subsidiaries,provided power to three million customers in indiana,kentucky,michigan,ohio,tennessee,virginia,and west virginia with over megawatts mw of generating capacity and miles of transmission lines.am.power,at.csw,also through subsidiaries,served million customers in arkansas,louisiana,oklahoma,and texas with over mw of generating capacity and miles of transmission lines.see joint application of am.power,cent,reprinted in joint appendix,hereinafter joint application.
to determine whether a proposed merger meets the federal power act public interest standard,ferc requires applicants to conduct a competitive analysis screen,referred to as an appendix a analysis,using the framework established by the department of trade commission merger guidelines.see inquiry concerning the commission merger policy under the federal power act policy statement,fed.reg,at.the appendix a analysis requires applicants to 
identify the relevant products 
identify customers who may be affected by the merger 
identify potential competing suppliers to each identified customer and 
analyze market concentration,using the index hhi before and after the merger.
in their original application,aep and csw proposed connecting their two territories using a mw east to west transmission path,secured by contract from a third party.joint application,reprinted in.because this connection increased market concentration in several western markets to a level above that allowed by appendix a,aep and csw sought to mitigate these impermissible hhi levels by committing to the sale of mw in the former territory of csw.joint application,reprinted in.aep and csw also suggested other restrictions,including participation in an iso and the waiver of certain priority transmission rights.joint application,reprinted in.
ferc found that the applicants own analysis shows that the proposed merger fails the screen thresholds in several markets,there are problems concerning the assumptions and data used in the applicants screen analysis,and applicants analysis may not accurately define relevant geographic markets.order accepting for filing and suspending proposed tariffs and agreements,consolidating dockets,and establishing hearing procedures,at,wl.these factors led ferc to set the matter for a hearing to determine the effect of the merger on competition.id.at.
over parties filed objections to the merger,though most withdrew prior to the hearing.ferc trial staff and the applicants entered into two stipulations,one on may,and the other on july,resolving most of the issues in contention at the hearing.the hearing finished on july,and the presiding administrative law judge alj issued an initial order on november.the alj initial order imposed no conditions on the merger,other than those stipulated by the applicants.see am.power,at.on may,ferc approved the merger,but with significant additional conditions.id.at.
the applicants had agreed to divest mw of power,rather than the initially proposed mw,from the west region.instead of divesting entire plants,the applicants proposed selling minority interests in certain generating facilities,leaving new aep with operational control of generation.ferc found the amount of capacity to be divested acceptable but that the divestiture proposal was an ineffective remedy because the applicants retained operational control of the generation.this operational control could have given new aep the ability to withhold capacity from the market and thus affect electricity prices.id.at.ferc therefore required new aep to divest their entire ownership interest in the facilities at issue.id.because of the time necessary to divest this capacity,the applicants proposed forced interim power sales equivalent to the capacity.ferc accepted this proposal,recognizing that the forced sales would prevent the exercise of market power by withholding output,but required the sales to begin immediately rather than shortly after merger,as the applicants had proposed.id.at.
ferc also addressed market power concerns arising out of the consolidation of generation and transmission.ferc recognized the potential for new aep to exercise vertical market power,where one entity could affect the availability of transmission by controlling the generation of electricity,and found that applicants failed to show that the proposed merger will not adversely affect competition as a result of combining their generation and transmission.id.at.to remedy this market power,ferc imposed several requirements.first,the applicants must transfer operational control of their transmission facilities to a rto.id.at.second,because,under ferc newly established framework,rtos will not exist prior to december,see order,fed.reg.at,ferc imposed interim mitigation measures in the east region emulating many of the anticipated functions of an rto.am.power,at.thus,in the east region,new aep must have atc calculated and market monitoring conducted by an independent party.this third party would review generation dispatch information,steps taken to relieve transmission constraints,and the volume and price of energy after relief steps were taken.ferc stated,w e believe that such data are necessary to determine whether operations or wholesale transactions involving applicants are unduly discriminatory or preferential or show evidence of the exercise of market power.id.third,although ferc did not expressly identify the consequences of any transgressions of these requirements,the commission stated that it would use its authority under section b of the federal power act to address any concerns,and order further procedures as appropriate.id.at footnote omitted.
wabash filed a request for rehearing on april,challenging ferc order approving the merger.the principal points raised by wabash in its petition for rehearing were,as follows 
the commission identified serious problems with the merger,expressly recognizing that the merger increased applicants ability to foreclose competitors by strategic manipulation of generation,but approved the merger without conditioning it in a manner that even purports to address this significant threat to the public interest.
the commission recognized,but failed to address the potent arguments of wabash valley that applicants participation in the alliance rto,even if that rto were to satisfy the commission general requirements for ferc approval,would be insufficient to mitigate the applicants merger enhanced market power.
the commission erred by failing to insist upon implementation of applicants rto commitment before consummation of the merger.
the commission failed even to recognize,much less address,intervenor demonstrations that the merger would seriously adversely affect transmission availability to others.
the commission accepted as ratepayer protection provisions wholly inadequate to hold ratepayers harmless from the merger.
request for rehearing,reprinted in.ferc denied the request for rehearing on may,wl,and wabash petitioned this court for review on july.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction and ripeness 
ferc initially argues that judicial review is precluded in this case,because wabash is not an aggrieved party,the case is not ripe,and wabash failed to raise many of its arguments below,as required by of the federal power act.we conclude that wabash is aggrieved and the case is ripe,but that many of wabash claims have been forfeited because they were not properly raised with ferc in the first instance.
the federal power act provides that a ny party to a proceeding aggrieved by an order issued by the commission in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order by filing suit within days.b.under ferc regulations,wabash,as an intervenor,was a party to the merger application proceeding.see.parties are aggrieved under the federal power act if they satisfy both the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing.louisiana energy power auth.ferc,quoting bennett spear,d.in this case,as a competitor crying foul,wabash satisfies prudential standing requirements.louisiana energy,at stating as a competitor and customer petitioner comes within the zone of interests of the federal power act and hence has prudential standing.
ferc nonetheless argues that wabash fails to satisfy the standing requirements imposed by article iii of the constitution.
this irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires that the plaintiff have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court and that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
bennett,at.citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.ferc contends in particular that wabash lacks standing because the harm that it alleges is based only on injuries that might arise from new aep exercise of market power in the future.in other words,according to ferc,the injuries asserted by wabash are merely speculative.we disagree.
parties suffer cognizable injury under article iii when an agency lift s regulatory restrictions on their competitors or otherwise allow s increased competition.louisiana energy,at.wabash asserts that it will be injured by new aep market power which ferc has allowed by approving a merger with inadequate conditions.this claim satisfies the injury prong of article iii standing.see associated gas distribs.ferc,finding standing when the challenged action authorizes allegedly illegal transactions that have the clear and immediate potential to compete with the petitioners own sales.wabash likewise meets the remaining two prongs of the constitutional standing inquiry.its competitive injury is fairly traceable to ferc decision to approv
