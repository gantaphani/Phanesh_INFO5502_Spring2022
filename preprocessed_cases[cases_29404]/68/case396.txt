in these consolidated cases,owners of electric transmission facilities and several state public utility commissions petition for review of orders of the federal energy regulatory commission conditionally approving a proposal to form a regional transmission organization in new england.the transmission owner members tos challenge ferc authority to reject the provision of their transmission operating agreement providing that ferc review withdrawals from the rto under s public interest standard the tos also contend that ferc rejection of this provision,and its rejection of an incentive adjustment to the tos return on equity roe for local transmission service,were arbitrary and capricious.the state commissions maintain that ferc approval of a basis point incentive adjustment to the tos roe for regional transmission was arbitrary and capricious.
rtos are a creation of ferc,and ferc has broad authority over the decision to approve a rto.a proposal to establish a rto is essentially a proposal to change the rates on file as such,ferc had authority under section of the federal power act fpa,to modify the operating agreement as a condition of approving the rto.further,in light of concerns about the effects on market participants and the electricity market,ferc was not arbitrary and capricious in requiring the just and reasonable standard of review for withdrawals from the rto.finally,consistent with the court deferential review under of the fpa of ferc determinations regarding rate design,ferc roe incentive adjustments were not arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we deny the petitions for review.
in order,ferc required all public utilities that own,operate,or control interstate transmission facilities either to file a proposal to participate in a rto or to describe their efforts toward joining one.see regional transmission organizations,stats.regs.order,clarified on reh g,stats.regs.order codified at,petitions for review dismissed sub nom.pub.util.dist.of snohomish county,washington ferc,snohomish county.ferc conceived of the rtos as mechanisms for providing large and stable transmission systems that would reduce regional pricing disparities and create an efficient market for new power generators.see order,stats.regs,at order,stats.regs,at see also pub.serv.comm of ferc.by combining various utilities segmented transmission facilities into a regional transmission grid under the control of one independent entity,ferc anticipated that rtos would eliminate certain transmission inefficiencies and opportunities for discrimination that hindered the formation of competitive wholesale electric energy markets and that these new structures would therefore result in significant benefits to the public.see snohomish county,at.
by,however,ferc had fully approved only two rtos.see proposed pricing policy for efficient operation and expansion of transmission grid,wl,at pricing policy.to encourage timely formation of rtos,ferc proposed a basis point incentive adjustment adder to the roes for tos participating in a rto,and established the deadline of december,for qualifying for the proposed incentives.id.at.
on october,an independent system operator iso,england,and a group of tos submitted for ferc approval,under section of the fpa,a proposal to establish.under the tos transmission operating agreement toa,the tos would transfer operational authority over their transmission facilities to the rto,subject to certain reserved rights.section of the toa set the terms and conditions for members withdrawal from rto participation and termination of the rto,providing in subpart f that withdrawal shall be effective unless the ferc finds that such withdrawal is contrary to the public interest under the public interest standard of review as set forth in the doctrine,supra note.in a related filing,on november,the tos requested approval of a roe recoverable under the regional and local transmission rates charged by.the roe would consist of a base roe of percent,an additional basis points for participation in the rto and an additional basis points to reward future expansion by the new england tos,which is not at issue.the tos sought the basis point adder to reward their willingness to transfer operational control authority over their transmission facilities to,and noted that ferc proposed pricing policy stated 
any entity that transfers operational control of transmission facilities to a ferc approved rto would qualify for an incentive adder of basis points on its roe for all such facilities transferred.

ferc conditionally approved the by order of march.see iso new england,order granting rto status subject to fulfillment of requirements and establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures,wl,approval order.the petitioners challenge three determinations ferc made in the approval order first,ferc rejected the tos proposal that the public interest standard govern ferc review of termination and withdrawal from and ordered that the toa be modified to set the just and reasonable standard for such review in accordance with section of the fpa and ferc published guidance.see guidance on regional transmission organization and independent system operator filing requirements under the federal power act,wl,at guidance.ferc explained that the public interest standard would prohibit any meaningful review under section even in those instances where revisions to operating agreements may be necessary or appropriate as a result.approval order,at para.second,ferc summarily approved,without suspension or hearing,the basis point roe adder for regional transmission service,agreeing with the tos that their voluntary entry into and their commitment to transfer operational control to the rto warranted the roe adder.id.at.ferc explained that the adder was consistent with its rulings in other cases and appropriate here because of the benefits that w ould be set in place id.para.third,ferc rejected the tos proposed basis point adder for local network service transmission not controlled by the rto on the ground that it was beyond the scope of the incentive.id.the tos were directed to make a compliance filing within days.id.at.upon various intervenors requests for rehearing or clarification of the approval order,ferc reaffirmed its determinations by order of november.iso new england,order accepting partial settlement,subject to conditions accepting,in part,compliance filings and granting,in part,and denying,in part,requests for rehearing,wl,rehearing order.these petitions for review followed.
the tos challenge ferc modification of the termination provision of the toa on the ground that ferc violated the doctrine by rejecting the public interest standard agreed to by the parties and ordering that termination and withdrawals be subject to the just and reasonable standard,which would grant ferc more searching review.the tos maintain that just as they have the statutory right under section of the fpa to set rates and the right to enter into rto contracts waiving some of those rights,they also have the right to set terms,including the length of their service agreements.
to determine whether the agency action is contrary to law,we look first to determine whether congress has delegated to the agency the legal authority to take the action that is under dispute.michigan epa,citing united states mead,d chevron usa,nat.res.def.council,d.the court applies the traditional tools of statutory interpretation in determining congressional intent,looking to the text,structure,purpose,and legislative history of a statute.see chevron,at.
under section b of the fpa,congress has vested ferc with jurisdiction over all rates,terms,and conditions of electric transmission service provided by public utilities in interstate commerce,as well as over the sale of electric energy at wholesale.atlantic city ferc,b.section,in turn,provides that the rates,terms,and conditions of electrical transmission service subject to ferc jurisdiction shall be just and reasonable,and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is unlawful and bars utilities from exercising undue preference or undue prejudice in the rates charged.a b.a public utility may file changes to rates,charges,classification,or service at any time after providing days public notice.id.d.these changes go into effect immediately.cities of campbell ferc,papago tribal util.auth.ferc.ferc,however,can conduct a hearing under section to review any rate changes and suspend them for a period of five months,but it may reject them only upon finding that the proposed rate changes fail to meet the standards of section,with the utility bearing the burden of demonstrating that the proposed changes are just and reasonable,a,and,id.at b.gas pipeline ferc.in addition,under section,ferc itself may initiate rate changes but only upon finding that the existing rates are unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.a see cities of campbell,at papago tribal,at.
under the doctrine,however,utilities may choose to voluntarily give up,by contract,some of their freedom under section.atlantic city,at.thus,a utility may negotiate a transmission contract with a provision relinquishing its right to file for a unilateral change in rates.see id.at papago tribal,at.similarly,by broad waiver,the parties to a jurisdictional contract may eliminate ferc power to impose changes under,except the indefeasible right of ferc under to replace rates that are contrary to the public interest.papago tribal,at.such contracts are not subject to unilateral amendment by a party to the contract,and once accepted for filing,ferc may subsequently order modification only upon finding that the modification is required by the public interest,see potomac power ferc,and upon a showing that the changes are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,see atlantic city,at citing.gas,at.the public interest standard was described in federal power commission sierra pacific power as requiring modification of previously approved contracts in instances where the existing rate structure might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service,cast upon other consumers an excessive burden,or be unduly discriminatory.sierra,at see atlantic city,at.
as a threshold matter,and contrary to the tos position,it is not clear that has any relevance to ferc initial review of a contract to establish a rto.as ferc points out,this court has only had occasion to apply the public interest standard to contracts rather than those submitted to ferc for initial approval.see,potomac power,at.this interpretation is consistent with recognized purpose of ensuring contract stability by subordinat ing the statutory filing mechanism to the broad and familiar dictates of contract law.borough of lansdale fpc,see potomac power,at see also anr pipeline ferc.indeed,the tos recognize that the toa effects changes in existing transmission service contracts and is thus subject to ferc approval under section.thus,given that rtos are ferc creation,ferc has substantial leeway in deciding the conditions under which it will approve a proposal to establish a rto.this which a proposal for an rto has not yet received initial distinguishable from other situations in which parties have entered into a contract and ferc must summarily reject rate filings inconsistent with the outstanding fixed rate contract whether or not the contracts have been filed with the ferc.borough of lansdale,at.
again,the purpose of the is to preserve the benefits of the parties bargain as reflected in the contract,assuming that there was no reason to question what transpired at the contact formation stage.atlantic city,at citing town of norwood ferc.ferc points out that there is no expectation of contract stability when a contract is submitted to ferc for the first time,has yet to be approved by ferc,and has not yet gone into when that contract is a complex agreement establishing a new regional structure impacting all market participants.red this hardly seems the situation was designed to guard against,where one party to a rate contract on file with ferc attempts to effect a unilateral rate change by asking ferc to relieve its obligations under a contract whose terms are no longer favorable to that party.see sierra,at.see generally david tewksbury stephanie lim,applying the doctrine to rate contracts,energy.absent a rto operating agreement,the tos fail to explain why ferc would be obligated,under either the fpa or the administrative procedure act,a,to approve all of the terms of the toa,which is submitted as part of the proposal.
the tos rely upon two cases to support their contention that ferc exceeded its authority in ordering the modification to the toa both cases are readily distinguishable.in atlantic city,at,public utilities sought review of ferc orders approving their iso agreement on the condition that the utilities modify their agreement so as to relinquish the right,under section,to file changes in tariff rates,terms,and conditions,and to prohibit members from withdrawing from the iso without ferc approval under section,a the court held that ferc had exceeded its authority when it required the utilities to cede their section right to file rate changes and that ferc expansive reading of its section jurisdiction could not be reconciled with section,which leaves coordination and interconnection arrangements to the voluntary action of the utilities.see atlantic city,at.
the tos seek to have the court apply atlantic city holding to what they claim is their right under section to set the terms of the length of their rto service agreement,maintaining that,although ferc could have determined that the toa was contrary to the public interest,in the absence of such a finding,ferc lacks the authority to modify a negotiated contract to insert a different standard.however,the issue in atlantic city was limited to the question of whether ferc had jurisdiction under either sections or to oblige public utilities to cede their rights to make future filings under section.id.at.the court noted that the parties did not dispute ferc authority to review their agreement at the outset,or to decide,based on evidence in the record,whether the entry and exit rights specified therein were just and reasonable within the meaning of section.id.at.
in essence,the tos contend that they have a right to contract for protections with respect to a future unilateral decision to change an existing transmission service,the decision to withdraw from that ferc may not abrogate this right by requiring,in its initial review of the contract under section,that a provision be struck that purportedly protects the withdrawal decision from ferc review under the standards in sections and.although the court acknowledged in atlantic city that the right to set rates in the first instance is a statutory right of utilities,at,and that section does not authorize ferc to require a utility to cede the right to initially set such rates,id.at,there is no indication in the statute or in atlantic city that sections a blue gray or must be interpreted to grant utilities the unilateral right in proposing a rto to avoid the levels of review provided by the statute and the terms of ferc published guidance.to the extent that the fpa does not expressly address this question,ferc interpretation of its authority under section is permissible and therefore entitled to deference by the court under step two of the chevron analysis.see chevron,at.see indep.ins.agents of,hawke,pub.serv.of ferc.after all,the right provided by subsection f of the unilateral withdrawal shall be effective unless the ferc finds that such withdrawal is contrary to the public interest is not a right one signatory has against another it is not,as tos suggest,a mere term of the transmission agreement in the sense of the length of time that the agreement will be in effect.instead,it is an attempt to limit the statutory authority of ferc,a to the agreement,which ferc has not yet approved and accepted for filing.absent ferc approval of and the terms of the toa,this provision can not alter the statutory status quo ante.
in northeast utilities service ferc,the other case on which the tos rely,ferc conditionally approved the merger of a public utility pursuant to section and reviewed its ass
