on review,ameren argues that the commission erred in finding that the settlement agreement between ameren and rolla unambiguously prohibits ameren from adjusting rolla distribution charge in order to take into account costs that ameren incurred before the effective date of their agreement.ameren further argues that the commission improperly ignored extrinsic evidence and,in addition,impermissibly changed its rationale.we disagree and,accordingly,deny the petition for review.
ameren acts as the transmission provider and agent for two public utility affiliates central illinois public service company and union electric company.on october,the commission approved a settlement agreement between union electric company and certain of its municipal effectuate the transition of those customers from bundled to unbundled transmission service union,wl.pursuant to that agreement,ameren filed with the commission on october,a document entitled principles governing charges and loss factors for wholesale direct assignment facilities principles document.the principles document memorialized the agreement among the parties on the methodology for calculating each municipal customer distribution charge,the charge for using the wholesale direct assignment facilities owned and operated by ameren public utility affiliates.see principles document.a customer distribution charge takes effect once the customer begins to receive unbundled transmission service from ameren.
section of the principles document provides that a municipal customer distribution charge shall be calculated by applying an annual carrying charge of to the original installed cost of wholesale direct assignment facilities applicable to such customer as shown on the list attached to this agreement as attachment id.it further states that t he resultant charges for wholesale direct assignment facilities absent adjustment as provided for below are also set forth in attachment id.attachment a lists rolla preliminary annual distribution charge as and its adjusted annual distribution charge as id.at attachment 
the distribution charge adjustment s referred to in section are explained in the three subsequent provisions,only one of which section is relevant here allowing for the adjustment of a customer distribution charge in certain limited circumstances,section provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
if the transmission provider ameren makes significant modifications to wholesale direct assignment facilities or if there is a change in ownership or reclassification of wholesale direct assignment facilities,then the annual carrying charge would be applied to the original installed cost adjusted to take account of the change in the wholesale direct assignment facilities.
principles document footnote omitted.section also prohibits an adjustment for specific types of facility modifications,namely any adjustment to take account of changes in the wholesale direct assignment facilities that would properly be recorded as an operating and maintenance charge under the uniform system of accounts and any adjustment that would change the distribution charge by less than the deadband of per month.id.lastly,section requires ameren to consult with affected customers before proceeding with significant facility,those exceeding the deadband.id.
on january,rolla began taking unbundled transmission service from ameren public utility affiliates.shortly thereafter,on january,ameren filed an unexecuted sa with the commission governing rolla transmission service,requesting an effective date of january.after resolving some of the disputed issues with rolla,ameren filed a revised,unexecuted sa with the commission on august.the unexecuted sa included an annual distribution charge of rather than the adjusted annual distribution charge of set forth in attachment ameren calculated a higher distribution charge because its measure of the wholesale direct assignment facilities serving the measure in attachment the additional costs of upgrading ameren phelps substation in and modifying that substation control panel in december.as a result of the increased charge,rolla filed a protest with the commission on september,challenging ameren calculation of its distribution charge.
the commission issued its initial order on october,accepting the unexecuted sa for filing,but rejecting,inter alia,ameren calculation of rolla distribution charge.order accepting sa,at.although ameren maintained that the charges set forth in attachment a were merely illustrative,the commission concluded that the plain language of the principles document indicated otherwise t he resultant charges for wholesale direct assignment facilities are set forth in attachment id.quoting principles document.the commission further concluded that,even assuming that the attachment a costs were illustrative only,the principles document precluded ameren from collecting its proposed charge by operation of the moratorium agreed to by the parties.id.accordingly,the commission ordered ameren to revise the unexecuted sa to provide for an annual distribution charge of.see id.
on december,the commission denied ameren request for rehearing.order denying rehearing,at.in that order,the commission specifically rejected ameren assertion that section of the principles document entitle d ameren to recover costs that were known to exist at the time of its agreement with rolla but not included in the agreement itself.id.the commission interpreted section to permit adjustments to the distribution charge only where ameren makes significant modifications to wholesale direct assignment facilities or if there is a change of ownership or reclassification of wholesale direct assignment facilities.id.quoting principles document.relying on the words makes and change,the commission reasoned that b oth conditions expressly contemplate actions or events occurring after the date of the settlement.id.emphasis in original.because the modifications at issue were made before the filing of the principles document the commission concluded that section did not authorize ameren to include the costs of the modifications in rolla distribution charge.id.the commission also rejected ameren interpretation of the moratorium provision and instead concluded that the principles document precluded ameren from seeking an adjustment of rolla distribution charge not otherwise sanctioned by section.id.
ameren argues on review that the commission erred in concluding that the principles document unambiguously prohibits ameren from adjusting rolla distribution charge as set forth in the unexecuted sa.when read as a whole,ameren maintains,the principles document demonstrates that the distribution charge for each customer is to be determined by applying the annual carrying charge to the cost of the wholesale direct assignment facilities applicable to each customer at the time that customer commences unbundled service.thus,under ameren reading of the principles document,the distribution charges set forth in attachment a merely illustrate the charges that would result from application of the agreed upon settlement methodology.br.for pet r at.asserting that the commission orders turn on an erroneous finding that the plain language of the principles document prohibits the aforementioned interpretation,ameren seeks a remand for f
