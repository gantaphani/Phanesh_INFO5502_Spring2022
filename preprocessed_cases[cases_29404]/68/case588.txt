in this action cequel iii communications i,llc cequel,a franchised cable television provider,sought to invalidate the local agency formation commission of nevada county approval of the application of truckee donner public utility district district to provide broadband services,including cable television,to citizens within its jurisdictional limits.the trial court entered judgment for the local agency formation commission of nevada county lafco on cequel three causes of action for validation code civ,writ of mandate code civ,and declaratory relief.on appeal cequel does not challenge the trial court decision on its validation cause of action,but contends the trial court erred in denying its petition for writ of mandate because the district lacks legal authority to provide cable television services,lafco violated its statutory duty to determine whether there was a need for the proposed services and the services could be provided on a fiscally sound basis,and lafco violated its duty to conduct an independent determination of whether the district was authorized to provide broadband services.we disagree and shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on october,the district submitted an application to lafco seeking authorization to offer telecommunication services,which the district described as wholesale telephony and data transport,internet data transport,and cable television,within the district boundaries,generally described as the greater truckee area.
cequel predecessor in interest,usa media,opposed the district entry into the cable television market on the basis cable television service was not a utility service the district was authorized to provide.in light of this opposition and on advice of counsel,lafco required the district to agree to indemnify lafco for all costs of defending lafco in any litigation or administrative proceeding brought in connection with the district application.
lafco formed an ad hoc committee to work with the district in evaluating the application.after review of the application materials,a staff report,the report of the ad hoc committee and a public hearing,lafco approved resolution on january,determining it was in the interest of the public that the district be permitted to provide the new services to the community.lafco approved the district application subject to several specific terms and conditions,including that the district prepare a draft master service element for the communications services it intended to provide,that the district adopt a risk mitigation plan adequate to ensure its water and electrical service ratepayers would not be required to subsidize the new services,and that the district obtain franchise agreements with all applicable jurisdictions or reach alternative agreements satisfactory to the agencies.upon completion of the terms and conditions,a certificate of compliance would be issued by lafco.resolution stated only upon issuance of the certificate of compliance shall lafco approval to provide the additional class of service be effective.the resolution gave the district two years to comply with the requirements before lafco approval would expire.the period could be extended on the district showing of a good faith effort to satisfy the requirements.
on october,lafco approved a resolution extending the time for the district to comply with the terms and conditions of resolution until january.
in july a revised master service element for broadband telecommunications services was submitted by the district to lafco.the district also submitted a final risk mitigation plan and a revised fiber to the user business plan to lafco on july.the district provided lafco with a legal opinion regarding its financing and a copy of its earlier legal opinion regarding its authority to provide cable television service.lafco obtained an independent certified public accountant review of the district financial projections for the provision of the service and a legal opinion regarding the district risk mitigation plan.after extensive review,the ad hoc committee of lafco recommended lafco accept the master service element prepared by the district and incorporate it into the district sphere of influence plan,determine the risk mitigation plan provides adequate assurance the district water and electrical service ratepayers will not be required to subsidize the new services,and issue a certificate of compliance.
after a public hearing on august,lafco unanimously adopted resolution accepting the district master service element and amending the district sphere of influence plan accordingly.lafco also unanimously approved a certificate of compliance certifying the district had complied with the conditions of resolution.lafco adopted resolution extending the time to begin providing services to january.
on august,cequel requested lafco reconsider resolution,resolution,resolution,and its certificate of compliance relating to the district application to offer new services.cequel first claimed lafco failed to independently determine that the district business plan describes services that are needed and that the district can provide such services on a fiscally solvent basis.second,cequel claimed lafco failed to determine whether existing ratepayers will have to or already have subsidized the district proposed new services.third,cequel claimed lafco improperly determined the new services were permissible utility services the district was authorized to provide.cequel outlined a number of new or different facts relevant to its request.
at its september,meeting lafco reviewed the request for reconsideration.lafco continued the public hearing on the matter and directed the lafco ad hoc committee to review the request and develop recommendations for action.the ad hoc committee met a number of times thereafter to discuss the issues and hear testimony from the district and its potential competitors.the ad hoc committee submitted an extensive report,including responses,findings,and recommendations,to lafco regarding cequel request for reconsideration.at its public hearing on october,lafco reconsidered the resolutions and approved an amended resolution,an amended resolution,and an amended certificate of compliance with specific findings and determinations.
on october,cequel filed its complaint in the trial court challenging lafco actions.trial took place on november.on december,the trial court issued a decision resolving the issues raised by the parties in the action.judgment was subsequently entered in favor of lafco on all causes of action and this appeal followed.
discussion 
challenges to lafco determinations in resolution are not 
according to lafco,cequel is from challenging the determinations made by lafco in by resolution.lafco argues it intended its determination of both the district authority to provide the proposed services and the need for such services to be final at the time of resolution and that the failure of cequel or its predecessor in interest to timely challenge the determinations made in that resolution precludes the challenges made here.lafco claims the doctrine of laches bars cequel challenges 
other than citing one case defining laches,lafco brief on appeal cites absolutely no legal authority supporting these arguments.this court does not have to address an argument for which no authority is furnished.dabney dabney th,d.in any event,the arguments are meritless.
lafco arguments presuppose cequel or its predecessor could have properly filed a court action challenging resolution immediately after its adoption.the language of resolution,however,conditions lafco approval of the district application on the district further preparation of a master service element,adoption of a risk mitigation plan,and obtainment of franchise agreements,giving the district two years initially to accomplish these tasks.resolution provides lafco will only issue a certificate of compliance after the completion of all of these additional items.resolution then states only upon issuance of the certificate of compliance shall lafco approval to provide the additional class of service be effective.italics added.thus,until the district successfully completed the additional requirements and a certificate of compliance was issued,lafco approval was not final,but only tentative.there was no certainty the district would be able to successfully meet the additional requirements.any legal challenge filed immediately after the adoption of resolution and before lafco issuance of a certificate of compliance would have been premature.
as cequel did not have the ability to file an earlier legal challenge,the issues it raises regarding the determinations made by lafco in resolution are timely.
the district has authority to provide cable television servicesa.standard of review 
the district authority to provide cable television services is a question of first impression in california.the trial court concluded the district had the authority to provide such service.the parties disagree as to the applicable standard of review of that decision on appeal.cequel contends the question is subject to de novo review by this court.although the district agrees the standard of review for this question is the independent judgment of the court,it contends we must nevertheless give deference to the determination of the agency,to lafco interpretation of the relevant statutes.lafco disagrees that a de novo or independent judgment standard applies.it contends our review of this issue is limited to whether its decision was clearly erroneous under the applicable statutes.we agree with cequel that the applicable scope of review is de novo without deference to lafco determination of the issue.
to resolve the district authority to provide cable television,we must determine the proper statutory construction of public utilities code section issues involving the interpretation and application of statutes are subject to de novo review.blue city of los angeles th,d pac.gas of water resources th,d.admittedly,when an administrative agency is charged with enforcing a particular statute,its interpretation of the statute will be accorded great respect by the courts and will be followed if not clearly erroneous.citations.citation.judson steel workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.here,however,lafco is not charged with enforcing the public utility district act,from which the district derives its authority to provide services.et lafco determination of the district authority to provide the new services covered by its application to lafco is not entitled to special consideration or deference.
the district is a public utility district pud governed by the public utility district act.et section provides puds may exercise the powers expressly granted.section,in turn,grants puds the power to acquire,construct,own,operate,control,or use,within or without or partly within and partly without the district,works for supplying its inhabitants with light,water,power,heat,transportation,telephone service,or other means of communication,or means for the disposition of garbage,sewage,or refuse matter,and districts may do all things necessary or convenient to the full exercise of the powers granted in this article.the district and lafco claim the legislature grant of authority in section for a pud to acquire,construct,own,and operate works for supplying its inhabitants with other means of communication authorizes the district to supply broadband services,including cable television,to its inhabitants.we agree.
we stated the applicable principles of statutory construction in lewis county of sacramento th,d,as follows 
the primary objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citation.to do so,a court first examines the actual language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary,commonsense meaning.citation.the statute words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent if they are clear and unambiguous,t here is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge in it.citation.accordingly,i f there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.
where,however,the statutory language is ambiguous on its face or is shown to have a latent ambiguity such that it does not provide a definitive answer,we may resort to extrinsic sources to determine legislative intent.citations.under this circumstance,the court may examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.citation.in such cases,a court may consider both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment to ascertain the legislative intent.citation.lewis county of sacramento,supra,th at,d.
the phrase other means of communication in section does not explicitly include or exclude the provision of broadband services,in particular,cable television service.in considering whether cable television comes within the authority and powers granted by the language of section,we find helpful a opinion of the california attorney general.in such opinion the attorney general considered whether an existing pud could acquire,construct,own and operate a translator television installation.the opinion concluded the district was authorized to provide such service as the installation was a building used for a public purpose as authorized by section,but also under the alternate authority of section for providing other means of communication.id.at.
the opinion expressly considered the scope of the language other means of communication and determined the or used in section to separate other means of communication from telephone service was not intended by the legislature to be used in the disjunctive,corresponding to either this or that,supra,at.a pud was not required to choose between providing telephone service or acquiring works to provide some other alternate means of communication.ibid.for one thing,such a construction of section would be inconsistent with the clear legislative understanding of the authority of municipal corporations to provide services,which corporations were authorized by constitutional language virtually identical to section.former cal,art.xi,see now cal,art.xi.moreover,it was also indicative of legislative intent that a comma was used to separate the phrase telephone service from other means of communication,making the two phrases two separate classes,supra,at.
having concluded the phrase other means of communication was not limited to those means of communication that are similar to,and used as alternate to,telephone service,the opinion turned to the meaning of the word communication as used in section.the opinion adopted a broad construction of the term as meaning intelligence,news,that is communicated or imparted,a written or verbal message,and is not restricted to mere words but includes acts as well,embracing every variety of affairs that can form the subject of negotiation,interviews,or actions between two persons,and every method by which one person can contrive impressions or information from the conduct,condition,or language of another,supra,at,citing in re cattalini d.television,as a means of mass communication,fell within this definition.thus,the district was authorized by section to own and operate a translator television installation to supply its inhabitants with such a means of mass communication,supra,at.
we agree with this attorney general opinion.the phrase other means of communication used in section is not limited to means of communication similar to telephone service.the term communication used in section broadly means any form of passing information between two persons,including mass communication in the form of television.cable television is a means of communication that puds are authorized to provide their inhabitants.
our construction of the phrase other means of communication in section finds further support from the california supreme court opinion in in re orosi public utility district cal,orosi and a second opinion of the california attorney general found at.
the issue before the supreme court in orosi was the constitutionality of the legislation providing for the incorporation of puds in unincorporated territory and therefore,the validity of the orosi public utility district proposed bond issuance without prior notice to individual landowners.cal.to resolve this issue,the court determined it was necessary to consider the nature of a pud formed pursuant to the statute.id.at.in so doing,the supreme court compared the constitutional authority of a municipality to operate public utilities with the statutory authority given to a pud.the court noted that in the constitution of california was amended to provide that any municipal corporation may establish and operate public works for supplying its inhabitants with light,water,power,heat,transportation,telephone service,or other means of communication.such works may be acquired by original construction,or by the purchase of existing works,including their franchises,or both.cal,art xi.the adoption of the amendment definitely settled and removed all doubt from the question of the right of cities and towns to own and operate the kind of public utilities designated by the constitution.id.at.
the supreme court continued in enacting the statute here in question the public utility district act,the l egislature has made provision whereby the inhabitants of the state living outside the limits of cities and towns may serve their own purposes through the operation of the same kind of utilities,when organized for that purpose.that such was the intention of the l egislature may be gleaned from a reading of the provision declaring the purposes for which public utility districts may be created in unincorporated territory.they are the acquisition,construction,and use of works for supplying the inhabitants of the district with light,water,power,heat,transportation,telephone service,or other means of communication,or means for the disposition of garbage,sewage,or refuse matter.it has the power to do all things necessary or convenient to the full exercise of the powers granted by the act.it is significant that,when the l egislature came to pass the act extending to the inhabitants outside of incorporated cities and towns the privileges in regard to the acquisition and use of their own public utilities that are granted by the state constitution to municipalities,it should have followed so closely the language of the constitutional amendment of in the statement of the purposes for which the districts may be created.we are convinced that it was its intention to provide for the creation of public corporations of a character,with power to carry on the particular functions committed to them.orosi,supra,cal.at,italics added.as the supreme court concluded the orosi public utility district was properly formed as a corporation under the public utility district act,allowing it to tax its inhabitants and property owners for municipal purposes,the supreme court rejected the constitutional attack of the individual landowner.id.at.
although we recognize municipalities have greater powers and broader authority than puds in other areas orosi,supra,cal.at,with respect to the acquisition,construction,and operation of utility services that are identified by the same language for both municipalities and puds,the opinion of the california supreme court in orosi suggests the authority of cities and districts should be considered the same.
the california attorney general has issued an opinion concluding general law cities have the authority to construct,own and operate a community cable television system under the constitutional authority of article xi,section former section to furnish inhabitants with means of communication,supra,at.cequel concedes,as it must,that cable television is a form of communication and that,for the purposes of municipal corporations,could be considered a means of communication authorized within the scope of the constitutional grant of authority,but argues the same result can not be reached with regard to a pud statutory authority.we disagree.the statutory language in section has been found to intentionally track the constitutional language applicable to the authority of municipal corporations to provide utility services,so as to extend to the inhabitants outside of incorporated cities and towns the privileges in regard to the acquisition and use of their own public utilities that are granted by the state constitution to municipalities.orosi,supra,cal.at.
cequel argues,however,a pud statutory authority is limited to the provision of essential utility services,which it claims cable television is not.
specifically,cequel points us to the decision of television transmission,public util.com.cal d,television transmission,which it claims stands for the proposition that cable television service is not a utility service.actually,the question before the california supreme court in television transmission was whether a private corporation operating a community television antenna furnishing coaxial television antenna service cable television to areas of contra costa county was a public utility so as to be subject to regulation by the public utilities commission puc.id.at.thesupreme court determined the puc had no jurisdiction over a private corporation unless it fell within one of the classes of public utilities enumerated by section.id.at.the court went on to reject the puc finding that the cable television provider was a telephone corporation within the meaning of section,the only class of utility under section that was conceivably applicable.id.at.nowhere in the opinion does the supreme court ever consider whether cable television can be provided by an undisputed public utility as part of its utility services.television transmission is of no assistance in determining whether cable television can be offered by a pud as an other means of communication,a type of utility service authorized by section.
similarly,this court opinion in sacramento cable television city of sacramento d.sacramento cable,is inapposite.sacramento cable involved a challenge by a private cable television company and one of its individual users to a utility user tax imposed by the city on cable television users.id.at.this court recognized a private company providing cable television is not a utility under section,but found there is nevertheless a clear degree of similarity between telephone,gas,electric and cable television service that justified classifying cable television with the other utilities services for purposes of imposing a utility users tax.sacramento cable,supra,at.the case is not authority on the question of whether cable television service can be provided by a pud pursuant to section.
in orange county cable communications city of san clemente d.orange county cable,a private cable television provider sought a writ of mandate to compel the city to raise the rates it was allowed to charge its subscribers for its service.id.at.the appellate court found specious the argument that the cable television company had a constitutional right to a just and reasonable return on its investment.id.at.as the private cable television company was not a public utility,the relationship of the parties was contractual and the city was only required to act in good faith.id.at.the cable television company failed to show any evidence the city acted in bad faith.id.at.again,this case does not assist our inquiry into whether a pud is authorized to provide cable television service.
greening johnson th,d greening,was an action brought by mobilehome park owners against residents of the mobilehome park to recover unpaid monthly charges for cable television.the appellate court held the mobilehome residency law,et does not authorize a park owner to charge for cable television services not requested or used.greening,supra,at,d.the court stated it was at best uncertain from the language of civil code section whether cable television could be considered a permissible utility fee under that section,but as the legislative history reflected an intent not to allow charges for services not requested or used,it concluded the owners could not unilaterally arrange for cable television service and require the tenants to pay the charges.greening,supra,at,d.in the course of its discussion,the court stated utilities,in fact,are most commonly thought of as charges for essential services provided by government regulated and sanctioned monopolies and cable television can not reasonably be considered essential in the way that such services as water and electricity are.id.at,d.while it may be true that normally utilities are thought of as being essential services such as water and electricity,we do not see greening as providing support for cequel claim that cable television can not be a utility service provided under section.
cequel contends the list of works contained in section are subject to the limitation in section that all such works must be utility works or services.section provides,in part,o nly revenue producing utilities shall be acquired,owned,or operated by a district.cequel claims the word utilities used in this provision indicates a pud may operate only utility works and services.cequel then reiterates cable television is not a utility service.
section is directed at the financing of a pud services,not at defining what services may be offered.nevertheless,to the extent it can be read to limit a district services to utility services,we view all of the works identified in section as being utility services by virtue of their being authorized services of a pud.cable television fairly comes within the grant of authority in section for a pud to supply an other means of communication.as we have already explained,the cases that conclude a private corporation provision of cable television service does not make the private corporation a utility subject to puc regulation television transmission,supra,cal d,sacramento cable,supra,d.orange county cable,supra,d.are not authority that cable television may not be supplied by a pud as one of its utility services under section.section does not suggest otherwise.
we have also reviewed and carefully considered the other authorities cited by cequel for its claim that cable television may not be provided by the district because it is not an essential utility service.greyhound lines,public utilities com.cal d,involved a challenge by the bus company to the puc decision ordering it to extend its commuter bus service.the supreme court concluded the puc did not exceed its authority in making the order.the reference in the decision to public convenience and necessity requir ing operation,pointed out by cequel,is a reference to certificates of convenience and necessity to be issued by the puc for motor carriers and has nothing to do with the issue at hand.wood public utilities com.cal d,dealt with the puc creation of certain credit rules adopted as part of the utilities rate tariffs.id.at.the decision notes the puc deals with services that are essential.id.at.such passing comment was not made in the context of limiting utilities to the provision of essential services.cantu pacific gas d,is an inverse condemnation action.in the course of the opinion,the appellate court noted,civil code section provides a private right of eminent domain to acquire an easement to provide utility service defined as water,gas,electric,drainage,sewer,or telephone service.id.at.the definition of utility services provided in civil code section is not applicable here.in green superior court of san francisco cal d,the supreme court held a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in this state and that the breach of such a warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action.id.at.the case does not aid our construction of section.
nor do we see section as a restriction on a pud services under section to essential services.
section provides a district may acquire,construct,own,complete,use,and operate a fire department,street lighting system,public parks,public playgrounds,golf courses,public swimming pools,public recreation buildings,buildings to be used for public purposes,and works to provide for the drainage of roads,streets,and public places,including,but not limited to,curbs,gutters,sidewalks,and pavement of streets.for purposes of this division,all of those projects shall be considered a public utility or public utility works.
according to cequel,the only possible explanation for the last sentence of section expressly declaring the listed projects to be a public utility or public utility works is that the legislature,in light of the unquestionable limitation imposed by the public utility code restricting puds to essential utility services,deemed certain,albeit desirable,additional services as a public utility for the purpose of the public utility district act.
in light of the limitation of a pud powers to those expressly granted,the most reasonable understanding of section is that the legislature desired to expand the powers granted a pud to include additional utility services beyond those traditionally considered utility services,those denominated by section.to the extent those additional services can be considered services,section actually suggests utility services do not have to be essential before a public utility district may offer them.they need only be covered by an express grant of statutory authority.the existence of section certainly does not limit the powers granted a pud by section.
finally we come to cequel argument regarding section,the statute governing the kirkwood meadows pud.in the legislature enacted section,which provides,in pertinent part a in addition to all other powers,excepting telephone service,authorized by this division,the kirkwood meadows public utility district may acquire,construct,own,and operate public parking facilities and cable television facilities and may provide snow removal and road maintenance service for all roads open to the public,including,but not limited to,public roads and roads offered for dedication but not accepted,within the district.italics added.cequel claims the legislature explicitly acknowledged that specific statutory authorization was necessary in order to enable the kirkwood meadows pud to provide cable television services by its use of the language i n addition to all other powers at the beginning of section.cequel argument essentially is that if a pud already had the authority to offer cable television,the legislature would not have seen fit to expressly grant kirkwood meadows pud the authority to offer cable television service as an additional power.
such interpretation is not the only way section can be read.the phrase i n addition to all other powers can also be reasonably read as the legislature method of incorporating sections and into the powers granted the kirkwood meadows pud and its express authorization of cable television service can be seen as the legislature method of making sure cable television was an included power,in light of the lack of controlling authority on whether cable television was an other means of communication within the meaning of section.when statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including legislative history,to determine legislative intent.lewis county of sacramento,supra,th at,d.
the trial court granted cequel request for judicial notice of a packet of documents constituting the assembly final history for assembly bill reg.sess.which,among other things,added section to the public utilities code.included in the materials judicially noticed is an analysis of the proposed legislation for kirkwood meadows pud prepared for the bill proponent,sent to the bill author,and located in the files of the assembly committee on local government.neumiller beardslee,analysis sent to assemblyman waters,analysis.the analysis confirms the reading of section as being a clarification of the existing authority for a pud to provide cable television service,as opposed to a grant of a new power.the analysis states while existing law appears to give a public utility district somewhat broad authority to provide,inter alia,for transportation,phone service or other means of communication,it does not specify whether this would include facilities or services for snow removal and road maintenance,cable television,and public parking
