it was a close thing,but benedict arnold bold plan to capture canada for the revolution fell short at the battle of quebec in early.as a result,the federal energy regulatory commission must now decide when affiliates of canadian utilities utilities not subject to ferc jurisdiction may sell power at rates in the united states.in a purely domestic case,ferc requires an applicant for rates to show that it and its affiliates do not have or have adequately mitigated market power in generation and transmission,and can not erect other barriers to entry.an applicant with a affiliate must show that the affiliate has filed an open access,tariff for transmission service.see progress power marketing,ferc,at,wl.
ferc does not presume to tell foreign utilities what tariffs they must file.if a marketing affiliate of such a utility wants to sell power at rates in the united states,however,the utility must offer transmission service comparable to that required of a utility in the united states.just as a domestic utility must allow competitors of its marketing affiliate to use its transmission services on a basis to compete with the marketing affiliate,so too a foreign utility must allow companies that would compete with its marketing affiliate to use its transmission services to reach the united states market and compete on a level playing field with its marketing affiliate.see energy alliance,ferc,at,wl.
in this case,ontario energy trading international corporation ontario energy sought authority to sell power in the united states at rates pursuant to section of the federal power act.ontario energy application was opposed by consumers energy company consumers,a public utility providing service in michigan and potentially facing competition from ontario energy across the border.consumers argued that the ontario independent electricity market operator imo was an affiliate of ontario energy and did not offer open access,transmission service comparable to that required of power companies in the united states.specifically,consumers complained that the imo did not offer transmission service from point a to point b at all,as a united states utility would,but instead required companies seeking such service to sell power into the system at point a and buy it back out at point ferc nonetheless found the imo service comparable to that required of companies in the united states,and granted ontario energy the requested authority to sell power at rates.see ontario energy trading int l,ferc,wl initial order,on reh g,ferc,wl september order,on reh g,ferc,wl april order.finding that substantial evidence supports the commission decision and that the decision is otherwise reasonable,we deny consumers petition for review.
background 
in its landmark order,ferc required public utilities subject to its jurisdiction that own,control,or operate transmission facilities to guarantee transmission service to all market participants.see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,ferc stats.regs,at order.to ensure service,the commission required public utilities to functionally unbundle wholesale power services separating generation,transmission,and ancillary services,id.at,and to file open access,transmission tariffs,id.at.see generally new york ferc,d.
foreign market participants may also obtain transmission service through a public utility open access tariff.id.at.participants with foreign affiliates that own or control transmission facilities,however,may obtain open access transmission only if those affiliates comply with tariff reciprocity requirements.promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,order,ferc stats.regs,at order.those reciprocity requirements mandate that the foreign affiliate also provide open access,transmission service in the same manner as a public utility in the united states.id.
restructuring the ontario energy market 
in,ontario hydro,a utility servicing the province of ontario,sought a stay of order reciprocity requirement.see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,ferc,wl.the utility claimed that it would be irreparably harmed by the requirement because it could not allow open access into ontario without the approval of the provincial government of ontario.id.at.the commission rejected the stay,promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,ferc,wl,and the province of ontario elected to restructure its electricity market in order to secure access to that of the united states.
at that time,the provincial energy market was dominated by ontario hydro,a vertically integrated utility.ontario hydro generated most of the province power,owned and operated the bulk electricity transmission system,owned and operated much of the distribution system,sold power at wholesale rates to municipal utilities in urban areas,regulated those municipalities retail rates,and sold electricity directly to retail customers in rural and suburban areas.see initial order,ferc at.
to establish a competitive market,the ontario energy competition act of unbundled the functions of power generation,power transmission,and control of the bulk power system.the act separated those functions and transferred them to three new entities ontario power generation,opg owns and operates power generation facilities hydro one,owns and operates the transmission system and portions of the distribution system and the imo operates the bulk power system and the wholesale electricity market.application of ontario energy trading int l for order approving tariff,at ontario energy application.the provincial government holds all the shares of both opg and hydro one,appointing the directors of both.september order,ferc at.ontario energy an electric power marketing company that buys and sells electricity,but itself owns no power generation or transmission assets is a subsidiary of opg.the provincial government also appoints the directors of the imo,a transmission and market operator.those directors may be removed only for cause.id.at.
the imo assumed operational control of hydro one transmission assets,and became responsible for establishing and operating a provincial electricity market.see ontario energy application at.the act required the imo to develop rules to open the market to competition on an open access,basis.id.at.the imo complied,promulgating rules that created a electricity market in which the cost of electricity is set by market participants bidding to buy or offering to sell electricity.id.much like a stock exchange,the imo administers the market,and is neither a buyer nor seller of electricity except when required under emergency conditions to maintain system reliability.see imo market rules,chapter.
the market administered by the imo packages power and transmission together as a single product.see brief of ontario energy trading int l,docket no,at july,ontario energy ferc br.in the united states,most regional transmission organizations rtos and independent system operators isos treat power and transmission as two different products.indeed,order requires rtos and isos to allow market participants to reserve transmission capacity on their systems in advance of power purchases.see order at.in the united states,a power marketer can purchase the right to transmit power from point a to point b at a set time for a set price,apart from the purchase of power itself.not so in ontario.entities wishing to transmit electricity through and out of ontario,from point a to point b,must sell power into the imo market at point a to enter the transmission system,and then buy power from the market at point b to exit the system.because this distinction is central to the comparability dispute before us,a more detailed examination of the imo market is in order.
b.the imo energy market 
the imo operates a electricity market,establishing a uniform price for all electricity bought or sold within ontario.that uniform price is calculated based upon three factors the market price matching bids and offers the uniform uplift charge and transmission service charges.see ontario energy ferc br.at.the uniform uplift charge allocates the costs of internal congestion management across the market.see id.at transmission service charges recoup the costs of operating the transmission system,and are regulated.under this system,purchases and sales can be made at any location on the imo system at the uniform price without regard to internal transmission limitations.
the imo market uses the same system to facilitate imports into and exports out of ontario.the ontario transmission system is connected to adjacent regions transmission systems through external interfaces called interties.market participants import power into the ontario transmission system by selling electricity into the imo market at one of the interties,while those wishing to export power out of the province do so by purchasing electricity at an intertie adjacent to the desired destination.id.at.congestion may occur at an intertie when the imports offered or exports sought exceed the transfer capability at that intertie.unlike the situation with respect to the internal congestion control system,the imo controls congestion at the interties through a approach at each intertie,the imo establishes an intertie zone price izp set at the level at which supply meets demand within the transfer capacity of that intertie.see id.at.put another way,the izp clears congestion by prioritizing competing transfers according to price so that the most desired transfer clears first.see id.at.
say a market participant wishes to export power from new york into ontario.that participant must offer to sell the power into the imo market.if the price in the imo is,and the quantity of power offered at or below is equal to or less than the transfer capacity at the new intertie,then there is no congestion and all parties offering to sell power into ontario for or less will receive the price.see id.in the same scenario,if the quantity of imports offered exceeds the transfer capacity at the intertie,then the izp would fall below the price to reduce supply into the market the izp falling until enough market participants cease making offers to sell power into ontario from new york.
exporting power out of ontario is accomplished in a similar fashion by purchasing power at the price at an intertie adjacent to the desired destination.if the price is and the demand for exports out of ontario at or above that price is equal to or less than the transfer capacity of that intertie,then the transfer capacity can accommodate the demand.see id.at.if the demand exceeds the transfer capacity,the izp rises above to reduce the demand,increasing until enough purchasers cease bidding so that the transfer capacity can handle the remaining bids.
a party wishing to wheel power through the province must engage in a combined transaction.as explained,the imo system packages transmission service with the purchase of energy,so transmission service alone can be neither reserved nor obtained in a separate transaction,as it can in the united states.market participants wishing to transmit power,for example,from new york to michigan through ontario must simultaneously sell power into the imo market at the new intertie and purchase power out of the market at the intertie.see id.at.using the example above,if there is no congestion at either intertie,then the wheeler would sell into the system at the price and buy out of the system at the price,resulting in an transaction the only cost would be an export fee.see id.if there is congestion at either intertie,the cost would be the export fee plus any difference between the izp and the price at either intertie.id.
market participants can hedge the risk of congestion costs at interties during wheeling transactions by purchasing something called financial transmission rights ftrs.id.at see also april order,ferc at.ftrs are purely financial instruments that entitle the holder to payments equal to the difference between the ontario price and an izp.the imo maintains a market in ftrs,periodically auctioning ftrs that span durations of either one month or one year.ontario energy ferc br.at.each ftr corresponds to a particular intertie separate ftrs must be purchased for imports and exports at each intertie.id.ftrs effectively guarantee the import or export of power at the uniform price,regardless of any izp.
procedural history 
on february,ontario energy filed its application with the commission under section of the federal power act,seeking authority to sell energy,capacity,and ancillary services,and to resell transmission capacity,at rates.initial order,ferc at.consumers filed a conditional protest to ontario energy application,reserving the right to challenge the application if the imo failed to grant a transmission reservation allowing consumers to wheel power through ontario.motion to intervene and conditional protest of consumers energy at.consumers then went to the imo and asked for approval of a firm mw transmission reservation for may to facilitate its procurement of electricity from new york suppliers and transmission of that power through ontario to michigan.letter from consumers to imo.the imo denied the request,explaining that the imo system does not provide transmission reservations,but that instead consumers could perform an transaction to wheel power through the province.consumers thereupon filed a supplemental protest to ontario energy application,claiming that ontario energy possess es transmission market power by virtue of its affiliation with the imo,which is not mitigated by the provision of transmission service.supplemental protest of consumers energy at.
in the initial order,the commission concluded that ontario energy application presented no transmission market power concerns,finding that ontario energy does not own or operate transmission facilities and is not an affiliate of any public utilities.ferc at.the commission accordingly granted the application.id.at.consumers sought rehearing,arguing that the imo and ontario energy were affiliated entities and that the imo did not offer open access transmission service on a basis comparable to the standards established in order.september order,ferc at.this time the commission agreed with consumers that ontario energy and the imo were affiliated,but denied the request for rehearing,finding that the imo provides open access transmission service on a comparable,basis in accordance with the principles of order.id.
consumers again requested rehearing.see april order,ferc at.having prevailed on the affiliation issue,it argued that the imo service was not comparable to transmission service in the united states because the imo does not allow the reservation of transmission capacity.according to consumers,this inability to reserve transmission capacity prevents market participants from obtaining a fixed price for transmission service,creating price uncertainty for transactions through ontario.id.at.pointing to the fact that ontario energy could obtain firm transmission service reservations at a fixed price from utilities in the united states,consumers argued that the imo market failed to satisfy the basic reciprocity requirements of order.see id.
the commission again denied consumers request for rehearing.the commission noted that consumers concedes there is no evidence in this case suggesting that the imo operates its transmission system on a discriminatory basis,and that the imo governing statute prohibits such discrimination.id.at.rejecting consumers claims concerning lack of comparability,the commission found that allegations of potential price increases caused by the imo system failed to support a finding that the design of the imo transmission system,per se,unduly impedes consumers,or any of ontario energy other competitors,from reaching united states loads.id.to the contrary,evid
