this consolidated appeal presents the question,inter alia,of whether the bonneville power administration bpa determination to commence a rate hearing to decide whether the bpa should impose cost recovery adjustment charges is a final agency decision subject to judicial review.we conclude that it is not and dismiss the petitions for review for lack of jurisdiction.
the bpa is a federal agency within the united states department of energy created by congress in to market hydroelectric power generated by the federal columbia river power system,a series of dams along the columbia river in oregon and washington.congress has since expanded the bpa mandate to include marketing authority over nearly all the electric power generated by federal facilities in the pacific northwest.id.the bpa is charged with oversight of the federal transmission system used to deliver power generated at a federally owned and operated facility,as well as power to its customers.id.it owns and operates approximately eighty percent of the pacific northwest transmission system and markets approximately forty percent of the electric power consumed in the pacific northwest.ass of pub.agency customers,bpa,cir.
the bpa general authority is derived from four organic statutes the bonneville project act of the project act,the regional preference act,id.the columbia river transmission act the transmission act,id.and the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of the northwest power act,id.ass of pub.agency customers,at.the bpa authority is derived from the project act,the transmission act,the northwest power act,and the flood control act of.pursuant to the northwest power act,the bpa power rates are established by the bpa,but subject to approval by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.id.after,when congress transformed the bpa into a agency,see id,the power rates charged by the bpa became its source of revenue.cent.lincoln peoples util.dist.johnson,cir.
the northwest power act requires the bpa to establish rates that will produce sufficient revenues to ensure bpa fiscal independence and repay the treasury for the federal funds that were borrowed to build the projects in the federal columbia river power system.cal.energy comm bpa,cir,a.at the same time,congress requires that the bpa market federal power with a view to encouraging the widest possible diversified use of electric power at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles,a.
the bpa administrator is required periodically to revise rates to recover the capital costs and expenses associated with the columbia river power system.see id,a.the procedures governing the establishment of rates are set by statute and include the following issuance of a federal register notice announcing the proposed rates one or more hearings the opportunity to submit written views,supporting information,questions,or arguments and a decision by the administrator based on the record developed during the hearing process.id.rates established by the bpa only become effective after approval by ferc.id.a.
the rate schedules proposed by the bpa are termed general rate schedule provisions grsp.the origins of the present controversy arose out of a supplemental rate proposal promulgated by the bpa in.the bpa had previously proposed new wholesale power rates to be effective on october,and different rates to be effective fiscal year.
after these filings,increased load obligations and higher market prices caused the bpa to determine that its rate proposals would be insufficient to assure it could cover costs and repay treasury obligations.on december,the bpa published its proposed amendments to the power rate adjustment proposal.further market changes caused the bpa to issue supplemental wholesale power rate filing on june.the supplemental proposal adjusted the previous grsp by replacing the capped single cost recovery adjustment clause crac with a crac the crac or lb crac,as it is referenced in the bpa filings designed to cover augmentations costs the crac or fb crac designed to cover net revenue,and the crac or sn crac,available if there were a likelihood of missing a treasury or other creditor payment.
the cracs were created to allow the bpa to address any financial shortfalls without having to raise base rates.in particular,the cracs were intended to increase the bpa treasury payment probability to what it considered acceptable levels.ferc granted interim approval of the crac proposal on september,and final approval on july.ferc.
when triggered,the crac allowed an upward adjustment to posted power rates subject to the fb crac by modifying the fb crac parameters.under the grsp,the crac would be available if the administrator determined that,after implementation of the crac and any adjustments,either of the following conditions existed 
the bpa forecasts a fifty percent or greater probability that it will nonetheless miss its next payment to treasury or other creditor,or 
the bpa has missed a payment to the department of the treasury or has satisfied its obligation to the department of the treasury but has missed a payment to any other creditor.
under the supplemental proposal,once the bpa administrator determined that these conditions existed,the bpa would propose changes to the fb crac parameters that will,to the extent market and other risk factors allow,achieve a high probability that the remainder of treasury payments during the fy rate period will be made in full.in determining its initial proposal,the bpa was to give priority to prudent cost management and other options that enhance treasury payment probability while minimizing changes to the fb crac.
when the administrator determined that the crac had been triggered,the bpa would be required to send written notification to customers that purchase power under rates subject to the crac and to other interested parties.the notice was required to the documentation used by the bpa to determine that the sn crac has triggered,the amount of any forecast shortfall,and the time and location of a workshop on the sn crac.the scheduled workshops are to discuss the cause of shortfall,and any proposed changes to the fb crac that will achieve a high probability that the remainder of treasury payments will be made timely.
additionally,a s soon as practicable after a determination,the bpa was required to publish a federal register notice initiating an expedited hearing process to be conducted in accordance with section i of the northwest power act.the hearing was required to be completed within forty days of publication of the notice.
the bpa experienced continued financial problems in the winter of.due to lower than expected prices and less than expected hydro production,the bpa ended up selling less energy and at lower prices than forecasted in the supplemental proposal.under the grsp financial test,the administrator determined that the bpa had less than a fifty percent probability of making the next treasury payment,due october.on february,the bpa administrator commenced an emergency rate adjustment pursuant to the financial test in the crac provisions.the bpa issued a letter to interested parties and customers informing them of the trigger determination the letter included a table summarizing the documentation used by the bpa to determine that the sn crac had triggered,the amount of the forecasted shortfall,and the time and location for a workshop on the sn crac.
pursuant to the grsp,the bpa conducted workshops in february to explain the trigger determination.in march,the bpa published a federal register notice of proposed cost recovery adjustment clause adjustment to wholesale power rates.the bpa held full evidentiary hearings and allowed a comment period.
in june,the bpa published its administrator final record of decision final rod for the crac.the final rod contains the bpa analysis and conclusions based on the evidentiary record compiled,with respect to the adoption of the crac.subsequently,the bpa filed its crac rate adjustment proposal and record with ferc on july,along with a request for interim and final approval effective october.ferc.the
