franklin county power of illinois,llc,wants to build a coal power plant in southern illinois.because the plant will emit a significant amount of air pollution,the company must first obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd permit from the illinois environmental protection agency iepa,the agency that the federal epa has designated as the issuer of psd permits in illinois.although the iepa granted the company a psd permit in,the iepa has since made a preliminary determination that the permit has expired.
sierra club is a environmental organization that sought to enjoin the company from building the power plant by bringing this suit against the company,its parent company enviropower,llc,and khanjee holding us,under a citizen suit provision of the clean air act.sierra club alleged that the company psd permit had expired because the company had neglected to commence construction of the plant within an month window required under the permit.sierra club also claimed the permit was invalid under epa regulations because the company had discontinued construction of the plant for over months.the district court agreed with sierra club on both points and granted summary judgment in its favor.the court also permanently enjoined the company from building the plant until it obtained a new psd permit,and the defendants appealed to this court.
we agree with the district court that sierra club has standing to pursue this lawsuit and that its claim is ripe and permissible under the clean air act.we also agree that the psd permit has expired and that the district court properly granted permanent injunctive relief in favor of sierra club.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of sierra club.
background 
statutory and regulatory framework 
sierra club brought this suit under a,a citizen suit provision of the clean air act,which provides in relevant part 
a ny person may commence a civil action on his own behalf 
against any person who proposes to construct or constructs any new or modified major emitting facility without a permit required under uscs et relating to significant deterioration of air quality or who is alleged to have violated if there is evidence that the alleged violation has been repeated or to be in violation of any condition of such permit.
the parties agree that the coal power plant that the company seeks to build is a major emitting facility that requires a psd permit.such a permit contains an emission limitation that is set by the iepa and represents the best available control technology for pollution.see a.
once issued,a psd permit can expire and become invalid in three different ways 
a i f construction is not commenced within months after receipt of such approval,
b if construction is discontinued for a period of months or more,or 
c if construction is not completed within a reasonable time.
r.the iepa administrator may extend the month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified,otherwise,the psd permit terminates by automatic expiration.g psd permits may be terminated only by recission under w or by automatic expiration under r.
factual background 
on august,the company applied to the iepa for a psd permit to build a megawatt power plant in benton,illinois,on land for which it had a year lease.the iepa concluded the project would be a major air pollution source subject to psd review.on july,the iepa issued a psd permit for the plant.the permit states it will become invalid if 
construction of cfb circulating fluidized bed boilers is not commenced within months after this permit becomes effective,if construction of these boilers is discontinued for a period of months or more,or if construction of these boilers is not completed within a reasonable period of time.
the permit defines commence and construction in terms of b and b,respectively,which are provisions we will discuss in more detail later.
on december,the company entered into an agreement with black veatch b v,an engineering and construction company,that required the parties to work together on an exclusive basis in order to draft and negotiate the epc engineering,procurement and construction contract.on about december,the company contracted with alberici constructors,for excavation and foundation work.alberici was to dig a hole at the site down to the bedrock and pour concrete to lay part of the foundation for the plant.on january,four alberici employees began delivering equipment to the site,and five days later,they began excavating.
on february,alberici stopped the excavation after a dispute arose regarding payment.alberici bills after that date include one day where workers showed up but did no work.all other days only include a supervisor hours spent maintaining a protective barricade around the site.
in july,the company landlord had the hole refilled,apparently because the company did not make a payment on its lease.in september,the company signed another contract for excavation and concrete work,which began anew on september.an iepa inspector visited the plant site shortly thereafter and determined that construction had commenced.
in the meantime,khanjee holding us,had obtained an option to buy the company and all its assets.in june,khanjee affirmed its obligation to adhere to the company contract with b v.in january,the company secured a mandate letter from its lead financial arranger indicating that financing for the project was available.
on november,the iepa notified the company that it had made a preliminary finding that its psd permit had expired.the company challenged this preliminary determination and as far as we know,that matter remains pending before the iepa.
on may,sierra club filed this suit,alleging that the psd permit had expired and was invalid.the defendants moved to dismiss,claiming that the citizen suit provision of the clean air act did not provide a basis for this suit.they also moved for summary judgment,claiming that sierra club lacked standing and that the permit was valid.sierra club countered with its own motion for summary judgment.
the district court denied the defendants motions and found the permit to be invalid.it entered summary judgment in sierra club favor and permanently enjoined the defendants from building the plant until they obtained a valid permit.the defendants then filed this appeal.
ii.analysis 
sierra club had standing.
an organization has standing to sue if at least one of its members would otherwise have standing the interests at stake in the litigation are germane to the organization purpose and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires an individual member participation in the lawsuit.see friends of the earth,laidlaw env l servs.toc,d citing hunt washington state apple adver.comm n,d.the defendants do not seriously contest that sierra club satisfies prongs and.sierra club is a nonprofit organization formed and operated to preserve,protect,and enhance the natural environment,which is also its stated goal in bringing this lawsuit.the defendants also do not suggest this proceeding requires an individual sierra club member to participate rather,they claim that sierra club has not presented an individual member with standing.so the dispute here turns on prong.
to have standing,an individual must satisfy three requirements.first,she must have suffered an injury in fact that is both a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action.third,it must be likely,not just speculative,that a favorable decision will redress the injury.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.because these elements are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the case,each element must be supported with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.id.at.
to survive a defendant motion for summary judgment or to win on a for summary judgment,a plaintiff can not rely on mere allegations but must support each element by specific facts via affidavits or other evidence.see id.we review de novo the district court determination that sierra club has standing.see disability rights.walworth county bd.of supervisors,cir.
sierra club member barbara mckasson will suffer injury in fact.
sierra club relies on one of its members,barbara mckasson,to establish standing.e nvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.laidlaw,at.internal quotation marks omitted.mckasson states in an affidavit that she will experience diminished aesthetic and recreational value if the company constructs and operates the power plant under the psd permit.she explains that every other year since,mckasson and her family have taken trips to fish,kayak,camp,and enjoy the natural beauty and clean environment of rend lake,located three miles from the proposed plant site.she claims if the company builds the plant under the permit,she will cease her biennial recreational trips because the pollutants emitted based on the permit will harm her and diminish her aesthetic enjoyment of rend lake.
the defendants claim that mckasson injury is insubstantial,but the necessary for standing need not be large,an identifiable trifle will suffice.lafleur whitman,cir quoting sierra club cedar point oil,cir see also doe county of montgomery,cir a n identifiable trifle is enough for standing to fight out a question of principle quoting united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,d.if the proposed plant is built,mckasson will be exposed to emissions from the plant if she continues her longstanding tradition of visiting rend lake with her family.this likely exposure to pollutants is certainly something more than an identifiable trifle,even if the ambient level of air quality does not exceed certain national limits.lafleur,at see also bensman united states forest,cir individual had standing to challenge a proposed project in a national forest when he had visited the project area six times over years and planned to return soon.moreover,if mckasson foregoes her regular visits to the lake because of these pollutants,that would also constitute an.see laidlaw,at.individual affidavit stating that he foregoes using a river for recreational purposes because of pollution concerns was sufficient to show see also buono norton,cir we have repeatedly held that inability to unreservedly use public land suffices as.mckasson injuries are also ones that are concrete and particularized because they affect her in a personal and individual way.see lujan,at.coalition for the env t volpe,cir holding that a proposed development that would increase pollution and traffic and limit plaintiffs views was a cognizable injury that deprived plaintiffs of aesthetic and psychological benefit.
the defendants also argue that because the plant will take years to build,mckasson injury is not actual or imminent and does not meet the second requirement for injury in fact.but the defendants forget that threatened injury can satisfy article iii standing requirements.see babbitt united farm workers union,d o ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.if the injury is certainly impending that is enough.see also massachusetts epa,d epa refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presented an imminent risk of harm mainstreet org.of realtors calumet city,cir s tanding in the article iii sense does not require a certainty or even a very high probability that the plaintiff is complaining about a real injury,suffered or threatened.the company claims that the psd permit that it received is still valid,and it strenuously argues that it has actually begun construction of the plant.as a practical matter,it makes sense for sierra club to challenge the validity of the company permit now,rather than waiting until the plant is operational.see lafleur,at likely exposure to emissions from a proposed but not yet built facility was certainly an.moreover,while this suit has been pending,the company has again publicly announced its commitment to completing the plant.so t his is not a case of some abstract psychic harm or a allegation mainstreet,at.injury to mckasson has been freshly threatened and is not merely hypothetical.
the injury is traceable to the proposed construction under the permit.
sierra club must also demonstrate that mckasson injury is fairly traceable to the company construction of the plant under the psd permit.see texas indep.producers royalty owners ass epa,cir.if the independent action of some third party not before the court causes mckasson injury,then the complaint fails the traceability test.id.quoting lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants concede that under the psd permit the proposed plant will emit airborne pollutants,including mercury and particulate matter,three miles from rend lake.mckasson claims these pollutants and the resulting decrease in visibility will negatively impact her enjoyment of the lake.we agree that w here a plaintiff has pointed to a polluting source as the seed of his injury,and the owner of the polluting source has supplied no alternative culprit,the fairly traceable requirement can be said to be fairly met.friends of the earth gaston copper recycling,cir.here,the defendants point to no other polluting source that could be the cause of mckasson injury.
nonetheless,the defendants claim sierra club still can not show causation because the company has designed its plant to produce emissions below permitted levels,so until the plant is built,there remains a factual question whether mckasson will actually be injured.this argument is in essence just a variation on the defendants claim rejected above that mckasson has not yet suffered an actual or imminent injury.we agree that no one knows the ultimate magnitude of mckasson injury for example,we do know if the particulate matter from the plant will blot out the sky or merely create a thin haze that not visible to the naked eye,or if the airborne mercury will actually spread miles to poison fish that mckasson currently consumes from a pond near her home which is another harm she claims she will suffer.we do know,however,that the plant will release some pollutants and that mckasson believes these pollutants will ruin her ability to enjoy rend lake and taint the surrounding area.and her belief is not so irrational that it can simply be discredited.see laidlaw,at.finding that a local citizens group member suffered injury in fact because she believed that discharged pollutants had lowered her home value.because mckasson injury stems from the emissions of the company proposed plant,we find that her threatened injury is fairly traceable to the plant.
enjoining the company from building based on its permit would likely redress mckasson injury.
finally,a plaintiff must show that a favorable decision will likely,not just speculatively,relieve her injury.id.at.the defendants contend that the iepa might not set lower emissions levels for a new psd permit and that mckasson concerns might remain even if the plant polluted at lower emission levels.
the defendants argument,of course,presumes that the company will actually seek out and receive a new permit.despite publicly announcing that it would seek a new permit after it lost in the district court,the company represented at oral argument that it had not yet begun this process.and even if the company applied for and received a new permit,there would be some delay the iepa took almost a year before granting the permit before the company could begin construction.a decision in favor of sierra club,therefore,would at least redress mckasson injury during that time.
moreover,as sierra club notes,pollution control technology tends to improve over time,so it makes sense that a new permit would have more stringent emission standards than the permit.see a facilities must use the best available control technology to receive psd permits in re suburban recycling and energy,epa app.bd.indeed,the record indicates that the iepa issued psd permits in and for similar power plants with emission standards that were significantly more stringent than those in the company permit.it is therefore reasonable to believe that any new permit the company obtains will have tougher emission standards than the psd permit.we need not determine exactly how much tougher those standards will be because mckasson need not show that a favorable decision will relieve her every injury.massachusetts.at citing larson valente,d.it is enough that her concerns will be addressed if more stringent emission standards are imposed than those required under the permit,even though the plant will still emit some pollutants if the company obtains a new psd permit.see id.at e ven a small probability of injury is sufficient to create a case or controversy provided of course that the relief sought would,if granted,reduce the probability.quoting vill.of elk grove vill.evans,cir.so it is likely that a favorable decision here will redress mckasson,and hence sierra club,injury.
therefore,we conclude that sierra club has organizational standing to pursue this suit because it has shown that the company construction under the expired psd permit would cause at least one of its members to suffer injury in fact that is traceable to the company and is redressable if sierra club prevails here.
sierra club claim is ripe and permissible under a.
the defendants rely on two district court decisions to argue that sierra club claim is not ripe.see united states.power,d,new york niagara mohawk power,d.the defendants contend that sierra club must wait until the company actually begins constructing the plant before sierra club can allege that the company has violated its preconstruction psd permit.
the defendants misread these cases,which specify when the limitations period begins for claims that a company has violated a preconstruction permitting requirement.in that context,it makes sense to conclude that the last possible moment at which a preconstruction violation occurs is when the actual construction is commenced,and not at some later point in time.power,d at see niagara mohawk power,d at.but it does not logically follow nor do these cases suggest that a preconstruction permit violation can not occur until actual construction begins.
the defendants also argue that the citizen suit provision that sierra club relies upon,section a,only allows suits against entities that are without a permit,so sierra club can not bring this suit because the company received a permit albeit one that may no longer be valid.the defendants cite no direct support for this position,instead claiming the matter is not ripe and can not be adjudicated until the iepa issues a final decision whether the company permit has expired.
the defendants argument ignores the explicit language of section a.that provision states that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf against any person who is alleged to be in violation of any condition of a psd permit.the company certainly is a person alleged to be in violation of a psd permit sierra club alleges that the company violated the terms of its permit by not commencing construction of its facility in a timely fashion,which in turn caused the permit to expire.see g.and the iepa made the same allegation when it preliminarily found that the company permit had expired.moreover,even if having an expired permit were akin to having no permit at all,sierra club would still be able to sue under section a,which enables citizens to sue entities like the company that propose to construct new or modified major emitting facilit ies without a psd permit.a emphasis added.
it is irrelevant that the iepa has yet to finish deciding whether the company permit is invalid because that not what section a requires.in a circuit case referenced by both parties,grand canyon trust tucson power,cir,the ninth circuit held that a district court had jurisdiction over a citizen suit that challenged the validity of a permit even though the epa had not yet acted to revoke the permit.the defendants claim grand canyon analyzed a different citizen suit provision than the one at issue here.that seems doubtful.see id.at unauthorized construction of a power plant violates the clean air act and provides grounds for a citizen suit under the act citizen suit provision.see a.regardless,grand canyon does not suggest there is a categorical rule requiring a plaintiff to wait until the relevant agency finishes deciding whether a permit is valid at least when,as here,a suit is not asking us to review an agency action.so in accordance with the plain language of section a,we find that sierra club has properly brought this suit under that provision.
c.the company did not commence construction of the plant.
as noted above,a psd permit can expire and become invalid in one of three ways if construction is not commenced within months after receipt of the permit,if construction is discontinued for a period of months or more after construction has begun,or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time.see r.similarly,the company psd permit stated it would become invalid if 
construction of cfb circulating fluidized bed boilers is not commenced within months after this permit becomes effective,if construction of these boilers is discontinued for a period of months or more,or if construction of these boilers is not completed within a reasonable period of time.
the permit issued on july,so its date was january,the question is whether the company commenced construction of its plant by that deadline.
a states there are two ways in which construction can commence 
i the owner or operator has begun,or caused to begin,a continuous program of physical construction of the facility or 
ii the owner or operator has entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations,which can not be canceled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator,to undertake a program of construction of the facility to be completed within a reasonable time.
see also b defining c ommence as applied to construction similarly.the district court concluded the company had neither commenced a program of actual construction nor entered into a binding agreement to undertake such a program.the district court also found that even if the company had begun constructing the plant,it had lapsed in its construction activity for more than months,thereby invalidating the psd permit.
on appeal,the defendants assert there are genuine factual disputes that should have prevented the district court from granting summary judgment to sierra club.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and construe all facts in the light most favorable to the defendants.see rawoof texor petroleum,cir.
no reasonable factfinder could find that the company had started a timely program of actual construction or engaged in construction activities without an impermissible lapse.
the defendants claim that the company prevented its psd permit from expiring by beginning a continuous program of actual construction that included conducting engineering studies and excavation work.we disagree.
the epa defines begin actual construction as 
i n general,initiation of physical construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature.such activities include,but are not limited to,installation of building supports and foundations,laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.with respect to a change in method of operations,this term refers to those activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change.
b emphases added see also b defining construction as any physical change or change in the method of operation including fabrication,erection,installation,demolition,or modification of an emissions unit that would result in a change in emissions.we acknowledge as the defendants strenuously argue that beginning actual construction might be something slightly different than beginning a continuous program of physical construction,as required under a i.but the company did not engage in any kind of permanent construction activity at all.as of the psd permit expiration date of january,the company had laid no foundation and constructed no building supports,underground pipework,or permanent storage structures.importantly,the company had not begun constructing the cfb boilers,which was something that the psd permit had explicitly required that the company do before january.indeed,the only construction activity performed by the company was that it had directed alberici constructors to dig a hole,which alberici began to do on january.alberici minimal work hardly heralded the start of a continuous program of actual construction,as alberici stopped digging the hole on february,after a payment dispute.and digging the hole was not construction activity of a permanent nature,as the company landlord later had the hole refilled.
our conclusion here is further buttressed by a july,memorandum sent by edward reich,director of stationary source enforcement at the epa,and entitled commence construction under psd the reich memorandum in addressing what constitutes physical construction,the reich memorandum specifically notes that a ctivities such as site clearing and excavation work will generally not satisfy the commence construction requirements.reich memorandum as stated in the preamble to the draft regulations,it will not suffice merely to have begun erection of auxiliary buildings or construction sheds unless there is clear evidence through contracts or otherwise that construction of the entire facility will definitely go forward in a continuous manner.the defendants have provided no reason why we should ignore the epa guidance on this issue or why this case is a special one that merits ignoring this general rule.
finally,we note that even if the company had commenced construction of the plant,it lapsed in construction for over months,thereby invalidating its psd permit.after alberici stopped digging on february,it performed no more excavation work at the site.indeed,the site appears to have lain dormant for over months until september,when another company began digging a second hole for the company.this month lapse in construction activity killed the company psd permit.see r,g.
no reasonable factfinder could find that the company had timely entered a binding contract to undertake a program of actual construction.
the defendants alternatively claim that the company had commenced construction within months of the permit issuance by signing a construction memorandum with b v in late,thereby requiring those parties to work together on an exclusive basis in order to draft and negotiate the epc engineering,procurement and construction contract.to count as a contract that commenced construction,the construction memorandum would have to be one which could not be canceled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator,to undertake a program of construction of the facility to be completed within a reasonable time.a ii.
even if entering the construction memorandum counted as commencing construction of the power plant,the company permit expired because of the month lapse between february and september in which the company did no construction work on the facility.see supra ii c.the company would have to argue which it does that the construction memorandum somehow prevented this month lapse from killing the permit.but such an interpretation would in effect allow a psd permittee to trump the month lapse provision and indefinitely delay the construction of a facility so long as the permittee has entered a contract that commences construction.we see no basis for reading the epa regulations in this manner.see r noting that a psd permit expires if construction is discontinued for a period of months or more or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time see also b reich memorandum in order to assure that construction proceeds in a continuous manner and is completed within a reasonable time,the regulations require that a break in construction of greater than months or failure to commence construction within months of psd permit issuance will generally invalidate a source psd permit.
at any rate as we discuss below,the company signing of the construction memorandum did not commence construction of the power plant.before we interpret the memorandum,however,we note that the parties disagree on which jurisdiction law we should apply.sierra club claims we should follow a choice of law provision in the construction memorandum,which specifies that the agreement is to be interpreted in accordance with the substantive law of the state of new york,except for its choice of laws provisions.see am.fuel utah energy dev,cir w here the parties have agreed to the application of the forum law,their consent concludes the choice of law inquiry.the defendants counter that an illinois statute renders the memorandum choice of law provision void and points us to illinois law see.comp.stat.ann.a provision contained in or executed in connection with a building and construction contract to be performed in illinois that makes the contract subject to the laws of another state is against public policy.such a provision is void and unenforceable.
we need not decide who is right because both new york and illinois law would characterize the construction memorandum as a preliminary agreement that required the parties to conduct further negotiations,not a construction contract to build a power plant.new york law recognizes that parties can enter into precisely this kind of preliminary agreement 
the parties agree on certain major terms,but leave other terms open for further negotiation this type of agreement does not commit the parties to their ultimate contractual objective but rather to the obligation to negotiate the open issues in good faith in an attempt to reach the objective within the agreed framework.a party to such a binding preliminary commitment has no right to demand performance of the transaction.
adjustrite gab bus,cir quoting teachers ins.annuity of am.tribune.similarly,illinois law recognizes the prerogative to agree to further negotiations,even after most essential contract terms have been settled,while remaining free to back out of a pending deal until the occurrence of some later event.venture zenith data systems,cir.
here,the construction memorandum was merely a preliminary step toward the parties ultimate goal agreeing on an epc contract for building the power plant.contrary to the defendants claim that the memorandum required the parties to undertake a program of construction of the facility,the memorandum only required the parties to work together toward reaching an actual construction agreement.the memorandum specified that the parties would agree to work with each other in good faith to complete the drafting and negotiation of the epc contract,with the goal of agreeing and signing such epc contract by september.the memorandum was clear that it did not enable the company to demand that b v perform construction work the parties agree that upon termination of the construction memorandum,contractor shall have no liability to perform the epc work scope for the fcp franklin county power project for the owner.moreover,the memorandum was hardly a final agreement for building the plant as it noted that b v was continuing to develop a firm price and draft epc contract for the project.
the construction memorandum also listed various events that could terminate the agreement,but none of these events was anything like completing construction of the plant or finishing the construction project,which would have suggested that the construction memorandum was the contract for building the plant.rather,the terminating events included t he date of signature of the epc contract for the fcp project and the f ailure of the parties to reach agreement on an epc contract by september,or such later date as may be agreed in writing by the parties,which again indicate that the construction memorandum was just a preliminary agreement en route to an epc contract.
even if the language of the construction memorandum was unclear,extrinsic evidence which the defendants encourage us to utilize would support the same conclusion.as of january,after the construction mem
