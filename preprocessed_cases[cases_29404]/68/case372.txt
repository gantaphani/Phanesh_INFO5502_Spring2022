ced rock springs,llc rock springs and old dominion electric cooperative old dominion together,petitioners petition for review of a federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission order rejecting their rate filings under section of the federal power act fpa.they also petition for review of ferc order denying their request for rehearing.because we conclude that the commission adequately explained its decision to deny petitioners rate filings and its decision was not unduly discriminatory,we deny their petition for review.
background 
in,petitioner old dominion began planning the construction and development of a natural combustion turbine generating facility to be located in rising sun,maryland.the facility is now complete and consists of four generation owned by old dominion and two by petitioner rock transmission facilities consisting of a kv substation and two kv transmission lines jointly owned by petitioners.petitioners connected their generators to the electrical grid first by running radial lines from their generators to the substation.they then looped their two transmission lines from the substation to a kv transmission line owned by peco energy company peco.electricity flows freely from other generation facilities through peco transmission lines,and subsequently,through petitioners substation and two lines.electricity produced by petitioners generators only flows out from the generators onto the transmission grid via the radial lines that connect their generators to the substation.in other words,petitioners substation and two looped kv lines are fully integrated in the electrical grid petitioners generators are not.
pjm transmission system pjm is a regional,interconnected transmission grid composed of transmission and generation facilities owned by petitioners,peco,and others.all owners of generation and transmission facilities in the pjm transmission system are parties to the pjm interconnection open access transmission tariff tariff.the tariff establishes the rates,terms,and conditions of service for transmission services over the pjm transmission system.the tariff also requires an interconnection customer,a generator that needs to connect to the pjm transmission system,
to pay for percent of the costs of the minimum amount of network upgrades necessary to accommodate its interconnection request and that would not have been incurred but for such interconnection request,net of benefits resulting from the construction of the upgrades,such cost not to be less than zero.
during construction of the rock springs and old dominion generating facilities,petitioners submitted an interconnection request as set forth in the tariff for peco to connect their generators to the pjm transmission system.peco indicated to petitioners that it would be unable to build the interconnection facilities on the schedule that they preferred,so instead of waiting for peco to build the facilities,they opted to build them themselves.petitioners then began construction on the kv substation and two kv lines that now connect their generators to the pjm transmission system.if peco had built the interconnection facilities,the tariff would have allocated the cost to petitioners minus any benefit to the pjm transmission system,and peco would have owned the interconnection facilities.tariff id.except to the extent otherwise provided in a construction service agreement entered into pursuant to subpart f below,the transmission owners shall own all attachment facilities,local upgrades,and network upgrades constructed to accommodate interconnection requests.however,petitioners built the interconnection facilities themselves,so they each own a share in the substation and feet of transmission line,making them transmission owners tos.because petitioners are tos and not simply owners of generation facilities,in addition to being parties to the tariff,they are also parties to the transmission owners agreement toa.
prior to signing the toa,the relationship between pjm and petitioners was governed by a facilities operation agreement foa,a contract written to address petitioners unique position as both generation owners and tos.because petitioners wanted to preserve their status as exempt wholesale generators ewgs under the public utility holding company act of puhca,et,repealed by the energy policy act of,stat,the foa included a provision that waived their right to receive any revenue that pjm may collect for transmission services for which pjm may use the facility foa.but other tos were not satisfied with the foa,so the parties modified the toa to allow rock springs and old dominion to opt out of cost recovery.the modified toa gives each party the right at any time unilaterally to file pursuant to section of the federal power act to change the revenue requirements underlying its rates for providing services under the pjm tariff.toa.the next sentence addresses petitioners ewg concerns and gives each party the unilateral right to adopt a revenue requirement of zero and to forgo any right or claim to compensation for providing transmission services under the pjm tariff or any other document.id.emphasis added.section of the toa states that n otwithstanding any other provision of this agreement,or any other agreement or amendment made in connection with the restructuring of pjm,each individual party shall retain all of the rights set forth in this section 
later ferc orders and the repeal of the public utility holding company act of assuaged petitioners concerns about their ewg status.as a result,rock springs and old dominion filed petitions with ferc to recover operating and management expenses,depreciation expenses,property taxes,and return on equity for their substation and feet of transmission line.old dominion,filing of transmission revenue requirement rate application and tariff revisions,at,docket no.these figures represent the portion of plant costs attributable to the two transmission lines and related kv substation,along with operating expenses for these facilities.ced rock springs,llc,filing of transmission revenue requirement rate application and tariff revisions,at,docket no.

petitioners were not satisfied with ferc initial order so they sought rehearing,which ferc denied.ced rock springs,llc,et,ferc,order denying rehearing.as in the first order,ferc determined that because petitioners put forth no evidence that their interconnection facilities were necessary but for their interconnection request,section bars petitioners from recovering the costs of those facilities through transmission revenue.id.at.ferc noted that,despite petitioners assertions to the contrary,they cited no case in which similarly situated projects have been treated differently.id.at.
rock springs and old dominion now petition this court for review of ferc initial order and its order denying rehearing.

we grant substantial deference to ferc orders,setting them aside only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also fpl energy marcus hook,ferc.under this deferential standard of review we uphold orders in which we can discern a reasoned path to the decision.fpl energy marcus hook,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
this court also generally gives substantial deference to ferc interpretation of filed tariffs,even where the issue simply involves the proper construction of language.cal.edison ferc,internal citation and quotations omitted.however,we do not defer to ferc interpretation when the tariff language is unambiguous.fpl energy marcus hook,at.this level of review is in nature.consol.edison of ferc,see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
petitioners ask this court to review de novo ferc interpretation of the tariff and the toa based on their conclusion that ferc found the language in the relevant documents to be unambiguous.it is true that a n agency is given no deference at all on the question whether a statute is ambiguous,and if an agency erroneously contends that congress intent has been clearly expressed and has rested on that ground,we remand to require the agency to consider the question afresh in light of the ambiguity we see.cajun power,ferc.in this case,however,ferc considered policy concerns and extrinsic evidence proffered by petitioners,demonstrating it recognized the tariff and the toa were ambiguous and exercised its discretion to resolve the ambiguities.see order rejecting rate filings,ferc at order denying rehearing,ferc at.therefore,we afford substantial deference to the commission interpretation of the relevant contract language.see chevron,at.koch gateway pipeline ferc.
network upgrades 
petitioners first argue that section of the tariff does not apply to their rate filing because their substation and feet of transmission line are not network upgrades.petitioners contest ferc classification of their transmission facilities as network upgrades for two reasons one,transmission facilities can not also be classified as network upgrades and two,no document refers to their transmission facilities as network upgrades,while other facilities were expressly defined as network upgrades.
in order for section to apply to petitioners rate filings,their interconnection facilities must be either local upgrades or network upgrades.tariff referring only to payment responsibility for network and local upgrades.network upgrades are defined as m odifications or additions to facilities that are integrated with and support the transmission provider overall transmission system for the general benefit of all users of such transmission system.tariff.petitioners do not object to ferc acknowledgment that even petitioners recognize the facilities they own are modifications and additions to the existing transmission system,an admission that plainly places them in the category of network upgrades.order denying rehearing,ferc at.petitioners contend only that because their facilities are transmission facilities,they can not also be network upgrades.
ferc sensibly rejected this contention,determining that network upgrades can also serve as transmission facilities and noting that the tariff makes no distinction between network upgrades and transmission facilities.id.ferc also reasonably found that the lack of designation of these facilities as network upgrades in the toa or tariff or any other part of the record is irrelevant.id.at.the only reason for designating the facilities in such a way would be to ensure that petitioners repay another entity for the cost of constructing the facilities.id.there was no reason to designate petitioners facilities as network upgrades when petitioners were already paying for the construction costs themselves.
generation interconnection customers 
petitioners also claim that section does not apply to them because they are not ordinary generation interconnection customers gics.request for rehearing of ced rock springs,llc,at,docket no,see also request for rehearing of old dominion,at,docket no.a gic is defined as a n entity that submits an interconnection request to interconnect a new generation facility with the transmission system in the pjm region.tariff petitioners do not contest that they submitted an interconnection request as required under the tariff.pjm filing of interconnection service agreement with rock springs,old dominion and rock springs generation and the foa,at,docket no.may.nor do they contest that instead of waiting for pjm to construct the interconnection facilities,petitioners and pjm entered into an interconnection agreement and a foa that referred to petitioners substation as an interconnection substation and their feet of kv transmission line as interconnection facilities.id.at foa.instead,petitioners argue that they can not be gics because they are tos,and,according to petitioners,tos can not also be gics.for support,they present an excerpt from a transmittal letter peco sent to ferc upon filing its interconnection agreement 
the subject interconnection agreement establishes the requirements,terms,and conditions for the interconnection of rock transmission facilities with peco transmission facilities,and defines the continuing responsibilities and obligations of the parties as transmission owners of interconnected transmission facilities 
the interconnection agreement differs from other interconnection agreements recently filed by peco because it is between two transmission owners,as opposed to between a transmission owner and a generator pjm standardized tariff for generation interconnection is also designed to address the interconnection of new generation stations to transmission facilities,and does not address the unique situation presented here.

ferc adequately responded to petitioners attempt to dichotomize tos and gics by relying on the definition of a gic and examining it in light of the policy underlying section.the commission found that gic is defined without limitation and applies regardless of whether the interconnection customer is also a transmission owner.order rejecting rate filings,ferc at.ferc noted that the policy underlying section,which is to promote efficient interconnection and enhance overall economic efficiency would be undermined by requiring generators initially to pay their interconnection costs and allowing generators then to allocate those costs to transmission service customers.see also order denying rehearing,ferc at allocation of cost responsibility under section does not depend on which party chose to build facilities,but rather on whether the facilities would have been built but for the generation interconnection project.in response to the excerpted letter,ferc reasonably noted that creating an interconnection agreement when parties rearrange ownership and operational arrangements is both expected,and under the tariff,irrelevant.order denying rehearing,ferc at.we find that ferc reasoning adequately explains why petitioners are classified as gics.
but for facilities 
because ferc reasonably determined that petitioners interconnection facilities are network upgrades and that petitioners are gics,it was reasonable for the commission to apply the cost responsibility provisions in section of the tariff.section of the tariff assigns to the interconnection customer percent of the costs of the minimum amount of network upgrades necessary to accommodate an interconnection customer interconnection request and that would not have been incurred under the regional transmission expansion plan but for such interconnection request,net of benefits resulting from the construction of the upgrades
