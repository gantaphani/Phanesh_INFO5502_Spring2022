pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa,et,the department of energy department contracted with operators of nuclear power plants to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel snf not later than january.a b.it failed to do so.hoping to stem the tide of litigation arising out of this massive breach,the department entered into a settlement agreement with one utility,exelon generation company exelon,in which the department amended its contract with exelon by giving it an equitable adjustment in effect,an offset against future payments that exelon like all other utilities that produce nuclear waste is obligated to pay into the nuclear waste fund nwf the petitioners challenge this final agency action pursuant to the nwpa judicial review provision.they contend that this offset is indistinguishable from a direct payment of nwf monies,and that such payments are unauthorized by law.we agree.
what should be done with nuclear waste who should pay for its disposal these were the central questions animating the nwpa.the legislation took a large step toward answering these questions the government would take responsibility for disposing of the waste,and the utilities that produced the waste would bear the cost.the nwpa thus established a quid pro quo the government would provide a valuable service and utilities would pay money for this service.rather than promulgating legislation that would cover all of the intricacies of this arrangement,congress authorized the department to enter into contracts with energy firms.these contracts were to contain only a few statutorily required provisions,with the remainder to be established by the department.the department promulgated a standard contract through a rulemaking proceeding.see.important terms include the obligations of the department and the reciprocal obligations of energy firms under the statute,both of which are discussed below.also important are the remedial issue left untouched by the statute.specifically,article of the standard contract covers unavoidable delays it provides that a party will not be liable under the contract if its failure to perform is not due to its fault.id.if a delay is caused by something within the reasonable control of either party,then article provides that the charges and schedules specified by this contract will be equitably adjusted to reflect any additional estimated costs incurred by the party not responsible for or contributing to the delay.id.article xi,governing remedies,states that n othing in this contract shall be construed to preclude either party from asserting its rights and remedies under the contract or at law.id.finally,article xvi,entitled disputes,requires an internal dispute resolution procedure for any dispute concerning a question of fact under the contract.id.
the nwpa provides that the entities owning and operating nuclear power plants,as generators and owners of nuclear waste,will pay the full cost of disposing of the waste.under both the statute and the standard contract,holders of snf must pay into the nwf,which serves as the financing vehicle for the nuclear waste disposal program,art.viii.in paying such a fee,the person delivering spent fuel to the federal government shall have no further financial obligation to the federal government for the storage and permanent disposal of such spent fuel.a.the nwf is the only source of funding that congress identified in the nwpa for matters relating to the programs and policies established pursuant to the act.the initial amount of the fee was set by both the statute and standard contract at mil per.a,art.vii.to date,total payments into the nwf exceed billion.see department of energy,summary of program and budget information as of december,tbl.
although the nwpa allows congress to make appropriations to the nwf beyond those monies that the standard contract holders deposit into it,c,the act provides that the fees charged to the generators of snf for permanent disposal should fully offset the costs of developing and operating such facilities,a.as previously noted,the original fee amount was set by statute and the standard contract at mil per.this initial assessment was to be only a starting point.because the nwpa expressly established the nuclear waste program on a full cost recovery basis,the act requires that the nwf have neither too much nor too little to pay for the program costs.specifically,the act requires the secretary annually to review the ongoing fee amount to determine whether fee collections will result in either insufficient or excess revenues to cover the costs of the program.id.if the secretary determines that there will be either insufficient or excess revenues,the secretary is required to propose to congress an adjustment to the fee to insure full cost recovery.id.the act,partially unconstitutional under ins chadha,d,states that t he adjusted fee proposed by the secretary shall be effective after a period of days of continuous session have elapsed following the receipt of such transmittal unless during such period either house of congress adopts a resolution disapproving the secretary proposed adjustment.id.no such change has ever been proposed by the secretary,prompting the circuit to observe that the secretary,not unlike goldilocks,always finds that the statutory fee is not too high,and not too low,but just right.national ass of reg.util.commissioners naruc dep t of energy.
there is one statutorily required contractual provision that has been the source of much litigation the department commitment to dispose of snf beginning not later than january.enacted in,the nwpa gave the department over fifteen years to select a repository site and begin permanent much needed lead time in light of the arduous regulatory processes mandated by the nwpa in the name of science,safety,and cooperative federalism.after this date,the department was obligated to begin its reciprocal obligation to dispose of the waste.see a.by,the department became certain that it could not meet its obligation.it announced that it had become apparent that neither a repository nor an interim storage facility constructed under the act will be available by and that the department would not begin disposing of the snf until at the earliest.final interpretation of nuclear waste acceptance issues,may.what to do with all of that waste in the mean time the department denied having any contractual or statutory obligation to dispose of snf pending the construction and licensing of a permanent repository.id.the department further asserted that it was not authorized to accept,store,or dispose of snf absent the existence of a permanent repository.id.at.this interpretation of the nwpa was challenged in the circuit,which found the department interpretation unreasonable and therefore not entitled to chevron deference.indiana michigan power dep t of energy.the department argued that the use of the word dispose in the statute presupposed the availability of a repository this is because the statutory definition of disposal a form of the word dispose was defined by the act as the emplacement in a repository of spent nuclear fuel with no foreseeable intent of recovery.therefore,the department argued,the act contemplates that a repository be operational before it becomes contractually obligated.the circuit rejected this argument,holding that the ordinary meaning of the phrase dispose of does not presuppose the availability of a permanent repository.indiana michigan,at.the court concluded that the department had an unconditional obligation to begin disposing of the utilities snf by january.id.at.
after the circuit vacated the department final interpretation,the department responded by announcing yet again that it would be unable to begin acceptance of snf and asserted that it had no financial responsibility for its failure to meet the time contending that its delay was unavoidable within the meaning of article of the standard contract.several utilities sought a writ of mandamus from the circuit compelling the department to comply with indiana michigan.the circuit,though sympathetic with the utilities,denied the requested relief,holding that the remedial scheme of the standard contract provided a potentially adequate remedy and therefore mandamus was inappropriate.northern states power dep t of energy.it neither ordered the department to begin disposal nor relieved the utilities of their continued obligation to remit the mil fee in accordance with the nwpa.it did,however,issue a writ prohibiting the department from characterizing its failure to meet the statutory deadline as an unavoidable delay,characterizing the department use of article as a recycled form of the same argument that it does not have responsibility for the costs resulting from its failure to perform rejected by the indiana michigan court.id.
the department continued to refrain from removing the snf.standard contract holders filed suit in the court of federal claims,alleging breach of contract,breach of a duty of good faith,and a taking in violation of the fifth amendment.the department responded that a suit for money damages in claims court could not lie because the standard contract triggered an exclusive remedy for,equitable adjustment of the mil fee as established under the agency internal dispute resolution scheme the federal circuit rejected this argument.see maine yankee atomic power united states.the court reasoned 
the provision is not a general one covering all delays,but a more limited one dealing with specified kinds of delays,namely,those in the delivery,acceptance or transport of nuclear waste.these involve particular delays involving individual contractors.they are not the kind of delays that routinely may arise during the performance of the contract.for them to arise,however,the parties must have begun performance of their obligations relating to disposal of nuclear waste.
since the clause was inapplicable,this meant that the contract did not provide for the complete relief necessary adequately to compensate yankee for the damages it alleges it suffered from the government breach of the contract.id.at.this left the utilities free to seek ordinary money damages in the claims court.query how could the federal circuit jettison the equitable adjustment remedy of article when the circuit pointed directly to that remedy as a potentially adequate alternative sufficient to make mandamus improper to this the federal circuit responded 
the circuit statements were all made in explaining why mandamus would not be appropriate,because the petitioners had another potentially adequate remedy,namely,the scheme the standard contract provided for dealing with delayed performance.the circuit twice characterized that remedy as potentially adequate,and that was sufficient to deny mandamus.
the court did not focus on or address the issue presented the presence of the contractual administrative dispute resolution provisions precludes the present suit for breach of contract.the court concern was whether there was an alternative potential remedy available that made mandamus inappropriate it held that there was.it was not required to,and did not determine the precise scope of that remedy.as the court of federal claims stated in rejecting the government similar argument,it was simply the existence of those remedies as opposed to any determination regarding the completeness of the relief they afforded that explains the circuit decision.

just before the federal circuit rendered its decisions in maine yankee and northern states power,the department sought to negotiate settlement agreements that would allow those standard contract holders willing to give up their breach of contract claims to recoup from the nwf some of the costs incurred as a result of the department default.on july,the department and exelon entered into an agreement in which exelon agreed to forfeit its contract claim in exchange for credits against the mil per payments that exelon would otherwise be obligated to pay into the nwf.this credit arrangement came in the form of an amendment to exelon original standard contract the department has announced that it will use the amendment as a settlement model on an basis.hoping to prevent the widespread use of this sort of agreement,various energy firms have challenged the amendment validity by arguing that it is not an authorized use of nwf monies.
before we analyze the standing and ripeness issues in this case,we must first determine the secretary duties under the statute in light of the supreme court decision in ins chadha,d.two options are presented.first,we could strike down the section in its entirety.this would leave in place the mil per fee as the statutory requirement,totally immune from administrative alteration.second,we could strike down only the word unless and all of the language following that word.our inquiry boils down to the likely legislative intent.see buckley valeo,d holding that invalid portions of a statute are to be severed u nless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power,independently of that which is not.if we were to conclude that congress would rather set the fee itself rather than give the secretary unfettered administrative discretion to alter it,we would take the first option if we were to conclude that congress would rather give the secretary full discretion to alter the fee in the event that the legislative veto provision is invalidated,we would take the second option.we think the second option is best 
the chadha court considered an almost identical provision in the immigration and nationality act,which allowed the attorney general to suspend the deportation orders of immigration judges.upon such suspension,the attorney general was required to make a complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case to congress.congress then had the power under section c of the act,c,to veto the attorney general determination that the immigrant should not be deported.like the decision of the secretary of energy in the present case,the decision of the attorney general served as the default rule after a certain period of time elapsed,trumped only by a veto by either chamber of congress within the relevant time period.
pointing to the severability clause in the act,the court held that the provision was unambiguous and gives rise to a presumption that congress did not intend the validity of the act as a whole,or any part of the act,to depend upon whether the veto clause of c was invalid.chadha,at.at emphasis added.the presumption raised by a severability clause,then,is that congress desires to save as much of the act as possible.our task in this case is therefore greatly eased by the existence of a severability clause.see if any provision of this chapter,or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance,is held invalid,the remainder of this chapter,or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid,shall not be affected thereby.even absent a severability clause,the court has asserted that whenever an act of congress contains unobjectionable provisions separable from those found to be unconstitutional,it is the duty of this court to so declare,and to maintain the act in so far as it is valid.alaska airlines,brock,d citations omitted.
a provision is further presumed severable if what remains after severance is fully operative as a law.champlin ref.comm n.in chadha,the court observed that 
the administrative process enacted by congress authorizes the attorney general to suspend an alien deportation under a.congress oversight of the exercise of this delegated authority is preserved since all such suspensions will continue to be reported to it clearly,survives as a workable administrative mechanism without the veto.
chadha,at.at.the same thing can be said in the present case.through the reporting requirement,congress will still have the ability to keep tabs on the secretary use of administrative discretion.the statutory scheme will continue to function if that singular clause in the sentence is struck down.
these presumptions lead us to the conclusion that only the unless clause should be invalidated.this is so even if the existence of the veto evinces some hesitance on the part of congress to grant unfettered authority to the secretary.the supreme court made a similar conclusion in chadha although it may be that congress was reluctant to delegate final authority over cancellation of deportations,such reluctance is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of severability raised by.chadha,at.at.indeed,administrative flexibility best comports with the overall statutory scheme.because congress wanted to ensure that the nwpa would be funded on a basis,it probably wanted fees to be adjusted in the most responsive way.if the political inertia required for bicamerialism and presentment were required,the resulting lag might be large enough to make the nwf grossly over or.
before article iii authorizes a court to decide a case,there must be a justiciable case or controversy.perhaps the most important of the article iii doctrines grounded in the requirement is that of standing.wooden bd.of regents of the.of,cir.the courts have an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of a claim.region forest serv.timber purchasers council alcock,cir.standing doctrines are employed to refuse to determine the merits of a legal claim,on the ground that even though the claim may be correct,the litigant advancing it is not properly situated to be entitled to its judicial determination.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,at.in lujan defenders of wildlife,d,the court held that to satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show that it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to conduct of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.
the department contends that the petitioners are not injured.noting the petitioners precarious position as to the settlement agreement,the department argues that any downward or upward adjustment of the fee is speculative at best.instead of challenging its allegedly unauthorized expenditures,it says,the utilities should await a final decision by the department that alters the ongoing fee requirements.we disagree.because the nwf is designed to collect all of the costs for disposing of snf,any shortfall in the nuclear waste fund caused by the amendment would have to be made up by fees paid by other standard contract holders.the net effect of the settlement is that the petitioners will have to pay more fees into the nwf to compensate for the allegedly unauthorized expenditures that the department has given exelon.alternatively,if there were to be excess dollars in the nwf,the petitioners would be deprived of the reductions in the one mil fee that would otherwise ensue.in either circumstance,they will be forced to pay for the damages resulting from the department breach of its contract with exelon.the department points out that no adjustment of the ongoing fees is automatic,even if the secretary were to propose one.after all,the statute still requires the secretary to report to congress,which might alter the fee adjustment through ordinary legislation.but this argument proves too much congress could always alter an agency statutory requirement through ordinary legislation.if the department argument were correct,nobody would ever have standing to challenge an agency actions.we do not think it is significant that the nwpa requires a report to congress.
we can understand the department attempt to force petitioners to bring a suit challenging the inevitable fee increase or failure to decrease directly rather than challenging particular unauthorized expenditures.given the nebulous calculations that must be made in order to assess the costs of waste storage that will be incurred in the distant future,it is not surprising that the statutory fee has never been challenged by the utilities.they would face an insurmountable burden of proof.by shifting particular challenges to its expenditures into the rubric of a larger challenge to the fee,the department could effectively insulate its expenditures from challenge.it could,for example,get away with purchasing a fleet of yachts for its staff out of nwf monies with virtual impunity.the standing doctrine does not countenance such a result.
given the nature of the fund and our reading of the statute in light of chadha,we are confident that any unauthorized expenditures would automatically raid the fund of monies that would otherwise be used to fund authorized expenditures which must be paid for with yet more fees or reimburse the utilities the amendment will cause an injury,injury is imminent,and the injury will be redressed by precluding the department from expending nwf monies in this way.
exelon and the department argue that the petitioners claim is not ripe for review.the purpose of the ripeness doctrine is summarized in abbott laboratories gardner,d 
the basic rationale of the doctrine is to prevent the courts,though avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.
id.at.at.exelon and the department basically recycle their standing arguments under the heading of ripeness,so we will not restate them here.in deciding whether a case is ripe,we look primarily at two considerations the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration and the fitness of the issues for judicial decision.id.at.at.as we discussed in part,the future harm is certain,not speculative.if we force the petitioners to postpone review until the secretary increases or fails to increase the fee,the parties will face a much more difficult burden in establishing the extent of their injury.we think this unattractive alternative creates a hardship sufficient to enjoin any unauthorized expenditures now rather than in the context of litigation over the fee.the issue is also fit for judicial resolution.the question is purely legal,and we do not fear that a decision will be tantamount to entangling ourselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies.id.at.at.in short,this case falls squarely within that range of cases normally found to be,cases that present either or both of two features significant present injuries or legal questions that do not depend for their resolution on an extensive factual background.laurence tribe,american constitutional law ed.
we find national association of regulatory utility commissioners department of energy naruc,distinguishable.in that case,the petitioners challenged a notice published in the federal register in which the department of energy tentatively established a method for allocating the costs of developing,constructing,and operating nuclear waste repositories between the government and commercial producers of such waste.first,the court held that the methodology had yet to be applied to anybody,leaving the court to conclude that its deliberations might benefit from letting the question arise in some more concrete and final form.naruc,at citations omitted.in this case,by contrast,the settlement agreement has already been made.we would scarcely benefit from additional facts.second,the court found that the claims may well prove to be no more than theoretical when petitioners revisit them in the context of a concrete application.id.at.it is clear that judicial intervention will be required to save the petitioners from injury in this case.finally,the court held that there was no hardship to the parties any injury they allege is a hypothetical future injury owing to the department expected use of the methodology in its report,not a present hardship resulting from the notice itself.id.in the present case,the department has already done the damage by entering into the unlawful settlement agreement 
exelon argues that in light of the northern states power holding that the utilities must pursue the remedies provided in the standard contract,and as a general proposition of administrative law,the availability of a potential suit in the court of federal claims under the tucker act precludes an administrative challenge to the department action.see,brazos power,united states,holding that suit under the apa is precluded where a suit in the court of federal claims pursuant to the tucker act provides plaintiff with an adequate remedy for its grievance.if and when any particular petitioner suffers the harm,an increase in fees,the department argues,there is nothing to preclude that petitioner from asserting in the court of claims that the secretary has breached the full cost recovery contractual provision by improperly adjusting the fees.as we stated in the standing context,we think that a subsequent suit challenging the secretary nebulous predictions of future costs would be extremely difficult to maintain,and therefore provides an inadequate alternative remedy.both justice and judicial economy dictate that we stop any unauthorized expenditures at this stage.
the department argues that any challenge to its right to make equitable adjustments is untimely,because the real final decision being challenged is the equitable adjustment provision article provision that became subject to judicial review in when it became part of the standard contract and was published in the federal register.accordingly,the petitioners should have brought a challenge within days after that action pursuant to c.the petitioners,however,do not challenge the facial validity of the equitable adjustments provision.rather,they challenge a particular settlement agreement that allegedly embodies an unlawful expenditure of nwf monies.it is that agency action,not the standard contract,that is being challenged.although this case does not raise ripeness or standing concerns,a hypothetical challenge brought in lacking in factual context and devoid of any real harm to the would.
when the department granted exelon an offset against the fees it would otherwise be required to pay into the nwf,this action was tantamount to an expenditure of nwf dollars on what the offset was effectively,exelon continued interim storage costs incurred as a result of the department breach.put differently,one option was for the department to settle its breach of contract liabilities by paying money out of the nwf and continue charging all utilities the same fee as it always had.another option was to make this exchange in a single transaction by giving any settling utility an offset against its fees as they become due.the department has taken the latter option,but it should be examined no differently from an expenditure of nwf monies.see,harrold comm r of internal revenue,cir in law,payment may just as effectively be made by offset or credit.this common sense intuition is confirmed by the language the department has used in describing the amendment.in the amendment itself,for example,the department characterizes the credits awarded to exelon as reimbursement by doe of exelon snf storage costs resulting from the department breach of contract.moreover,exelon is obligated to reimburse the nuclear waste fund in the event that it receives reimbursement for its storage expenses from an alternative funding source,indicating that the credits were seen as a substitute for a direct expenditure of nwf monies.the question,then,is whether such a payment is authorized by the nwpa.
the level of deference we are to give to the department legal interpretation is unclear.our starting point in reviewing an administrative agency interpretation of a statute that it administers is chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the court held 
if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation in such a case,a court may not substitute its own construction for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.
id.at.at internal footnote omitted.
the chevron doctrine has been complicated in recent years by the court decision in united states mead,d,which held that only certain embodiments of agency interpretations are to be given chevron,those interpretations found in an administrative action with the effect of law.id.at.at.such interpretations are typically pronouncements with a relatively formal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pronouncement of such force.id.although the court has granted chevron deference even when no administrative formality was required,id.at.at,the settlement agreement in this case,like the classification rulings in mead,present a case far removed not only from process,but from any other circumstances reasonably suggesting that congress ever thought there should be deference.id.
using traditional tools of statutory construction,we find that the nwpa clearly does not allow the department to utilize nwf monies to pay for the interim storage costs of the department contract creditors.thus,even if chevron deference does apply,the department interpretation is not saved.we therefore do not have to reach the thorny question as to whether the challenged interpretation of the nwpa is embodied by article of the standard contract which became effective pursuant to the apa rulemaking procedures or the amendment which is far removed from any circumstances suggesting that congress thought such settlement agreements deserve deference.whether or not the agency is entitled to chevron deference,its interpretation can not be the law.
we arrive at our conclusion for several reasons.first,the statute provides that the secretary may make expenditures from the waste fund only for purposes of radioactive waste disposal activities under subchapters i and ii of this chapter.d emphasis added.an expenditure on interim storage is not an act of disposal.rather,payments the department makes for storage is the opposite of disposing of the waste.
the act makes a list of things that might be considered acts of disposal.although the list is not exhaustive it is instructive of the kinds of activities that might be characterized as disposal.the items in the list all have one thing in common they entail some sort of advancement or step toward permanent disposal,or else an incidental cost of maintaining a repository.none of them encompass the maintenance of the status quo.to be sure,the circuit did give broad meaning to the term dispose in indiana michigan,construing the term to mean more than the emplacement in a repository of spent nuclear fuel with no foreseeable intent of recovery as the statutory definition of disposal,might have one believe.indiana michigan power dep t of energy.but the court adhered to the ordinary meaning of that term.id.webster third new international dictionary unabridged defines dispose as meaning,among other things,to get rid of throw away discard.payments for the purpose of interim storage costs simply are not payments for disposal.indeed,the department itself once disavowed any authority to utilize the nwf to compensate plant owners for additional storage costs at reactor sites caused by the department delay.see final interpretation of nuclear waste acceptance issues,may.
our interpretation is confirmed by the interim storage fund provisions in the act.see.the nwpa expressly requires additional storage capacity provided by the department at reactor sites to be funded from a separate interim storage fund,financed by those utilities receiving the benefits of the additional storage capacity.congress clearly contemplated interim storage costs when it enacted this provision.therefore,the nwf can not be used as a separate source of funding for interim storage costs.this conclusion is not unlike that r
