sprint,and worldcom,collectively,sprint,petition for review of a federal communications commission rule governing the means by which payphone service providers are compensated for certain calls made from their payphones.sprint contends that the rule was promulgated in violation of the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedure act apa,b,and is also arbitrary and capricious.because the commission failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity to comment,we grant the petitions and remand the case to the commission.
section b a of the telecommunications act of act directs the federal communications commission to establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers psps are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call using their payphone.two types of calls may be placed from a payphone.the first and most common type is the coin call,in which the caller inserts a coin directly into the payphone before making the call the rates for coin calls are set by state commissions.at issue here is the second type of call coinless calls which a caller places by using a service such as directory assistance,operator service,an access code,or a subscriber number.
the commission explains in its brief that when a caller places a coinless payphone call,the call is initially received by the local exchange carrier lec that services the payphone.if the call is local,the lec completes the call itself if it is long distance,the lec routes the call to a carrier,typically an interexchange carrier ixc.the ixc,such as sprint,and worldcom,is the first carrier to receive the call.if the recipient of the call is a customer of the ixc,the ixc will simply transmit the call to the lec that serves the customer the ixc is thereby able,sprint acknowledges,to track completion of the call.if the call recipient is not a customer of the ixc,however,the ixc transfers the call to a reseller of the ixc services.two types of resellers exist.the first,known as switchless resellers,do not possess their own switching facilities and must rely on an ixc to perform the switching and transmission functions that are required to complete a call.when the ixc transfers the call to a switchless reseller,the ixc handles the call as if it were transferring it to one of its own customers,and the ixc is again able to track the call to completion.by contrast,the second type,resellers sbrs,possess their own switching capacities hence,when an ixc routes a call to an sbr,the sbr assumes control of the call,and,sprint asserts in its brief,the ixc can no longer track the call to completion.as the parties acknowledge,in some instances the sbr transfers the call to another sbr,which in turn routes the call to yet another sbr,and so on.
in,the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm proposing a method for compensating psps for coinless calls.notice of proposed rulemaking,wl.a summary of this nprm was also published in the federal register.after a period of notice and comment,the commission determined that the primary economic beneficiary should bear the burden of both tracking coinless payphone calls to completion and compensating psps for those calls.payphone docket,report and order,wl first payphone order.the commission therefore concluded that the ixc,or the underlying,carrier,should,as the primary economic beneficiary,compensate the psp in lieu of a carrier that resells services.id.at.the commission did not define the terms carrier or reseller.the commission determined,in response to petitions for reconsideration or clarification,that sbrs possess the switching capabilities necessary to track payphone calls and accordingly clarified that sbrs are carriers within the meaning of the initial rule.payphone docket,order on reconsideration,wl first reconsideration order.
as carriers,then,sbrs were obligated under the first reconsideration order to compensate psps for all completed coinless payphone calls they handled.id.ixcs,in turn,were required to compensate psps only for those calls that the ixcs terminated on their own behalf or on behalf of a switchless reseller,and not for those calls the ixcs transferred to an sbr.id.the commission common carrier bureau bureau,in granting,two years later,a waiver to ixcs that had not complied with the first payphone order within the required period,further clarified that ixcs must provide requesting psps with information about the sbrs to which the ixcs route their calls so that the psps could identify precisely which sbrs owed them compensation.payphone docket,mem.opinion and order,wl.on review,the court upheld the portions of the commission rules that are pertinent here.illinois pub.telecomms.ass fcc.
in,a coalition of the largest psps coalition submitted to the commission a petition for clarification of the payphone compensation orders coalition petition.the coalition requested that the commission clarify,on a basis,which interexchange carrier is the party responsible for payment of compensation when a or subscriber call is made from a payphone.the coalition explained that t he commission effort to assign this obligation jointly to ixcs and sbrs has led to disagreements among psps and ixcs,and has encouraged some ixcs to shirk their payment responsibilities.this has in turn contributed to a serious shortfall in payments of compensation.the coalition suggested that the best way to reduce the shortfall would be to place the obligation for payment of compensation on the entity identified by the carrier identification code cic used to route the compensable call from the local exchange carrier network.
in april,the common carrier bureau issued a public notice seeking comment on the issues raised in the coalition petition request for clarification for payment responsibility of compensation when a or subscriber call is made from a payphone.common carrier bureau seeks comment on the payphone coalition petition for clarification,wl.the bureau notice summarized the coalition petition general request for clarification and its suggested method of using cics to identify the entity responsible for compensating the psp.id.the notice included filing dates for comments and reply comments,but the bureau did not publish the notice in the federal register or issue a notice of proposed rulemaking.sprint and others filed comments that focused mainly on the coalition proposal to rely on cics,with little discussion of the general method of requiring both ixcs and sbrs to compensate psps for coinless payphone calls.sprint also registered a procedural objection,in a letter to the bureau,noting that the commission could substantively alter the existing compensation rules only after providing notice and an opportunity for comment.
two years after the bureau issued its notice,however,the commission largely jettisoned the approach adopted in the first reconsideration order.in the second order on reconsideration,wl second reconsideration order,the commission stated that it was revis ing and modify ing its rules to address the difficulty which psps face in obtaining compensation for coinless calls placed from payphones which involve a telecommunications reseller in the call path.id.at.declining to adopt the coalition proposed method of using cics to identify the carrier responsible for compensating the psp,id.at,the commission instead shifted the burden of tracking all calls to completion and compensating psps to the ixcs alone,while permitting the ixcs to recover these costs from the sbrs to which they transferred the calls.id.at.the commission explained that the ixcs were in the best position to track calls and to make reporting a condition of their contracts for providing services.id.at.the commission also broadened ixcs reporting obligations to require ixcs to inform each psp of the volume of calls for each and number that the ixc received from that psp payphones.compare first payphone order,at,with second reconsideration order,at.finally,the commission noted that psps could continue to arrange alternative compensation schemes through private contracts with ixcs and sbrs.second reconsiderati
