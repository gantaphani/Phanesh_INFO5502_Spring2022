this case concerns unused storage space in the central basin,an area containing a groundwater reservoir capable of furnishing a substantial water supply.central and west basin water replenishment dist.southern cal.water th,d,fn.wrd i.the central basin extends underneath approximately square miles and provides a source of water for cities,municipalities,water companies,school districts,landowners,and others.id.at,d.appellants seek to amend a judgment,originally issued in,which,among other things,allocated the right to extract water from the central basin.id.at,d.
in,we considered a motion seeking to allocate the underground storage space in the central basin to persons with the adjudicated right to extract water from the central basin.we found that although the court had jurisdiction to consider the motion,the proposed allocation was inconsistent with the mandate for the beneficial use of water as required by the california constitution.wrd i,supra,th at,d.article x,section of the california constitution mandates that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable,and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented,and that the conservation of such water is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people and for the public welfare.
in,appellants moved to amend the judgment to allocate storage space in a manner different from the proposed allocation we considered in.the trial court did not consider appellants motion on the merits,but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion in general and to implement specific proposed amendments including contracts between water right holders in the central and west coast basins and the appointment of one appellant as the new watermaster.on appeal,appellants challenge the court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction.
because we previously held that the court had jurisdiction to consider a motion to allocate storage in the central basin,we reach the same conclusion here under the doctrine of law of the case.wrd i,supra,th,d.we also conclude that the court erred in finding it lacked jurisdiction to consider a provision governing the contractual transfer of water and finding it was prohibited from appointing one of the appellants as watermaster.we reverse the trial court order.as this appeal is limited to jurisdictional questions,we do not reach the merits and express no opinion on the desirability of any proposed amendment.
background 
appellant water replenishment district of southern california wrd was created by statute for the purpose of replenishing the central and west coast basins,et other appellants are the cities of lakewood,long beach,los angeles,huntington park and vernon as well as the golden state water company and the california water service company.respondents are the cities of cerritos,downey and signal hill and intervener central basin municipal water district cbmwd 
in addition to the parties,more than other entities have an adjudicated right to extract water from the central basin.wrd i,supra,th at,d.according to appellants,collectively appellants hold over percent of the total permissible pumping allocation from the central basin 
inter se judgment 
wrd predecessor sued over parties,resulting in a consent judgment declaring and establishing water rights in the central basin and enjoining extractions from the central basin in excess of specified quantities.wrd i,supra,th at,d.to meet water requirements in the central basin,the judgment imposed a physical solution an equitable remedy designed to alleviate overdrafts and the consequential depletion of water resources in a particular area,consistent with the constitutional mandate to prevent waste and unreasonable water use california american water city of seaside th,d,citing cal,art.x.the court appointed the california department of water resources as the watermaster to assist the court in administering and enforcing the judgment.
the court reserved continuing jurisdiction to among other things review its determination of the permissible level of extractions from the central basin in relation to achieving a balanced basin and an economic utilization of central basin for ground water storage,taking into account any then anticipated artificial replenishment of central basin appoint a new watermaster and revise the duties of the watermaster and provide for such other matters as are not contemplated by the judgment and which might occur in the future,and which if not provided for would defeat any or all of the purposes of this judgment to assure a balanced central basin subject to the requirements of central basin area for water required for its needs,growth and development.
second amended judgment 
the may second amended judgment is the operative judgment.like its predecessor,it not only declared the parties rights but also appointed the california department of water resources as watermaster.as in the judgment,the court retained continuing jurisdiction.
prior proposed third amended judgment 
in,several parties who held the right to extract water from the central basin sought to amend the second amended judgment to utilize unused storage space in the central basin.wrd i,supra,th at,d.they sought an adjudication of the rights to use underground storage space and argued that the total usable storage space should be divided among those with the right to extract water from the central basin hereafter pumpers.id.at,d.in,we held that t he allocation of storage space falls within this broad provision reserving jurisdiction contained in the second amended judgment.id.at,d.but,we rejected the theory that the right to extract water creates a concomitant right to store water,which was the sole allocation proposed by the appellants in that case.id.at,d.stated otherwise,we held that storage space may be considered but the particular proposed allocation of storage rights conflicted with california law.we also rejected the argument that the retention of jurisdiction contravenes the rule that a court can not adjudicate future water rights.id.at,d distinguishing city of pasadena city of alhambra cal d,orange county water district city of colton d.
current proposed third amended judgment 
in,another group of pumpers and the wrd filed a different motion to amend the second amended judgment to allocate storage space in the central basin motion.the stated goal of the motion was to utilize of dewatered space in the central basin to store water for later use.appellants describe such storage space as an important basin resource to be managed as an integrated whole.the current proposed third amended judgment proposal includes multiple provisions governing the storage and extraction of stored water and proposes significant substantive revisions to the second amended judgment.the provisions challenged on appeal concern the transfer of stored water between the central and west coast basins through contractual agreements without physically importing the water,and the appointment of three watermaster bodies,which include wrd.
trial court findings 
in an order dated july,the trial court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because the judgment did not allocate storage space in the central basin.it also concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate water rights covering the west coast basin and was statutorily precluded from appointing wrd as a watermaster.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we first consider respondents challenge to the appealability of the trial court order.we then discuss appellants arguments that the trial court has jurisdiction to consider storage allocation in the central basin the trial court has jurisdiction to consider contractual transfers between the central and west coast basins and the trial court is not precluded from appointing wrd as watermaster.finally,we explain why respondents remaining arguments lack merit.
