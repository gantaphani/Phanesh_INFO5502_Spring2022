in calculating the permissible return on equity for iso new england,a regional organization of transmission owners,the federal energy regulatory commission explicitly hiked the rate in order to induce the iso and its members to proceed swiftly in the completion of certain key transmission projects.it applied the basis point bonus in their return on to projects completed by december.petitioners,mainly state utility regulators in new england,challenge the decision,arguing that the bonus,which presumably will be paid by power consumers in new england,is contrary to applicable precedent,and arbitrary and capricious.we deny the petition.
iso new england,and owners of various new england transmission facilities,applied on october,to establish a new regional transmission organization rto in new england for the purpose of coordinating energy transmission in that area.shortly after filing the application to establish the rto,the transmission owners asked ferc to establish the return on equity percentage for transmission investments contemplated in the new rto expansion plan.specifically,the rto asked ferc to set a base return on equity,plus an incentive of basis points to induce the utilities to join the rto,and an additional incentive of basis points.ferc conditionally approved the rto and the basis point incentive for rto participation.see iso new england,ferc see also maine pub.utils.comm ferc,upholding the basis point incentive.
as to the basis point bonus,the commission ordered a hearing before an administrative law judge,at which the transmission owners would be required to demonstrate why the basis point adder is needed to incent investment in new transmission facilities and whether the adder should apply to all types of transmission expansion or be more narrowly focused on innovative,less expensive technologies.iso new england,ferc,at p.petitioners do not dispute the commission conclusion that even with the adder the total rate of return afforded to the transmission owners is within the range of reasonable returns.see bangor,ferc,at p opinion calculating a zone of reasonable returns from to.
at the hearing,the transmission owners introduced expert testimony suggesting that the incentive,applied to the projects at issue before us,would cost customers million in present value terms in the form of higher rates,but,by protecting customers from future reliability costs,would yield them benefits worth million for each year by which the incentive accelerated the transmission projects completion putting aside less easily quantified benefits.rebuttal testimony of michael schnitzer,see also bangor,ferc,at pp.petitioners do not attack the expert analysis,though they say it largely irrelevant.hence,in the transmission owners view,the incentive would provide ratepayers an unequivocal net benefit if it accelerated completion of the projects by two years.nevertheless,another transmission owner expert witness conceded that the projects would be completed eventually whether or not they received an incentive.id.at p.
the alj found this evidence inadequate to show a need for the adder within the meaning of the commission prior order as she understood it.the evidence cited above,she said,did not show that the adder will result in building of transmission that would otherwise not be built at all or that the projects would otherwise not be built in a timely manner.id.at p.
the commission reversed the alj,expressing the view that she had erred in requiring the utilities to show that but for the incentive,the projects at issue will not be built.opinion,ferc,at p.instead,the commission described the applicable standard as whether i the proposed incentive falls within the zone of reasonable returns and ii there is some link or nexus between the incentives being requested and the investment being made,to demonstrate that the incentives are rationally related to the investments being proposed.id.at p.we will return to the commission rationally related standard,but we should say upfront that the commission clearly did not mean the equivalent of the famously rational basis review that courts apply under some provisions of the constitution.the commission found that its standard was met since the proposed incentive will give project owners a significant impetus to push hard for their projects at all phases of the approval process.id.at p.
on rehearing,the commission limited the incentive to projects completed by december.bangor,ferc,at pp,order on rehearing.transmission owners with projects completed after that date must seek incentives on a basis in their rate filings,following a procedure the commission adopted in response to the energy policy act of,stat,codified at.see order on rehearing,ferc,at p see also opinion,ferc,at p noting that the incentive is consistent with epact and ferc final rule issued pursuant to epact,promoting transmission investment through pricing reform,order,ferc,order on reh g,ferc.after the petition for review was filed in this matter,the commission granted a waiver of the december,date for certain projects.see,bangor,ferc,at p northeast utils.serv,ferc,at p.
petitioners launch several attacks on the legal standard that ferc applied.they regard the rationally related nexus requirement as attenuated and vague absent more specific criteria for ascertaining the presence or absence of the required nexus,they contend that the standard is not really a requirement at all.in their view,every transmission owner will be able to satisfy the nexus requirement and thus secure a basis point adder up to the outer limit of the zone of reasonableness.
we are sympathetic to petitioners concern about the rationally related formulation facial vagueness.but the commission application of the standard in this case belies the notion that it employed the phrase as a fig leaf for accepting any link,however nominal or trivial.rather,ferc made by the proposed projects exceptional value under circumstances of congestion and unreliability.see opinion,ferc,at p we begin with the observation that there is an undisputed need for the projects to which the proposed adjustment will apply.the experts calculation of dramatic savings from a mere acceleration of the facilities availability seems to confirm this sense of urgency.as we shall see,the commission linked the urgency of bringing the projects on line to the incentive likely tendency to speed up that event.
petitioners contend that instead of simply requiring nexus,the commission should have required that the transmission owners demonstrate a causal link between the incentive adder and any expected customer benefit,petitioners br.at,as well as a demonstrated need and identifiable benefits,id.at.this argument is inseparable from their contention that ferc lacked substantial evidence that the proposed incentive would affect the transmission owners conduct or benefit consumers.once we examine the commission goal in providing the adder,however,we see that it in effect did insist on evidence establishing the requisite causal link.
first,nothing in the law or ferc stated purposes required ferc to adduce evidence,as petitioners occasionally suggest,that the adder would produce new transmission investment.petitioners br.at see also id.at arguing that the record indicates that the base rate of return provided sufficient revenues to motivate the transmission owners to complete required new transmission and that the incentive would not increase transmission investment.in fact the commission made clear that it was concerned not with ensuring that the projects would be completed eventually,as the transmission owners witness conceded they would be,but with ensuring that they would be completed promptly t he proposed incentive will give project owners a significant impetus to push hard for their projects at all phases of the approval process.opinion,ferc,at p.hence,we review the record to determine whether ferc had a reasonable basis for concluding that the incentive might benefit consumers by accelerating completion of the projects.thus the case is quite different from new england power pool,ferc,which petitioners characterize as establ
