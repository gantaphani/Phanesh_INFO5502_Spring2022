usgen new england,now dominion energy brayton point,llc dominion,filed suit against the environmental protection agency,its administrator,and its regional office collectively,the epa,alleging that the epa failed to perform a duty when it refused to grant dominion request for a formal evidentiary hearing after issuing a proposed final national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit.the district court dismissed the case for want of subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal,the central question presented concerns the effect of this court decision in seacoast league costle,cir,in light of the supreme court subsequent decision in chevron natural resources defense council,d.concluding,as we do,that seacoast does not control,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
dominion owns an electrical generating facility in somerset,massachusetts the station.the station opened in the and,like most power plants of its era,utilizes an cooling system.specifically,the station withdraws water from the lees and taunton rivers,circulates that water through the plant generating equipment as a coolant,and then discharges the water which,by then,has attained an elevated temperature into mount hope bay.
the withdrawals and discharges of water are regulated by the clean water act cwa.for the last three decades,these actions have been authorized by a series of npdes permits issued by the epa pursuant to section a of the cwa.see id.a.the standards incorporated into those permits are determined under the thermal variance procedures laid out in section a.see id.a.
in,the station applied for renewal of its npdes permit and thermal variance authorization.the epa issued a proposed final permit on october,in which it rejected the requested thermal variance.on november,dominion sought review before the environmental appeals board the board,see a authorizing board review,and asked for an evidentiary hearing.the board accepted the petition for review but declined to convene an evidentiary hearing.see in re usgen new.brayton point station,eab july.
on august,dominion notified the epa of its intent to file a citizen suit under section a of the cwa,a,to compel the board to hold an evidentiary hearing.receiving no reply,dominion proceeded to file its complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the epa moved to dismiss.
the district court granted the motion on jurisdictional grounds.see.b.in a bench decision,it concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction because the suit,though billed as a citizen suit,constituted a direct challenge to the epa hearing rule and,thus,came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court under b e.this timely appeal followed 
ii.the legal landscape 
we set the stage for our substantive discussion by undertaking a brief review of the legal rules that frame the controversy at hand.
before the epa either issues an npdes permit or authorizes a thermal variance it must offer an opportunity for public hearing.a,a.no definition of public hearing is contained within the four corners of the cwa.
the administrative procedure act apa,et,is also part of the relevant legal landscape.most pertinent here are those sections that combine to describe the procedures for formal administrative adjudications.see id.these procedures apply in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.id.a.the apa does not directly address whether these procedures apply when a statute simply calls for an opportunity for public hearing without any specific indication that the hearing should be on the record.
in seacoast,this court interpreted public hearing as used in sections a and a of the cwa to mean evidentiary hearing in other words,a hearing that comports with the apa requirements for a formal adjudication.at.examining the legislative history of the apa,we adopted a presumption that unless a statute otherwise specifies,an adjudicatory hearing subject to judicial review must be an evidentiary hearing on the record.id.at.applying that presumption to the cwa,we concluded that the statute certainly does not indicate that the determination need not be on the record.id.at emphasis in original.
so viewed,seacoast established a rebuttable presumption that,in the context of an adjudication,an organic statute that calls for a public hearing should be read to require an evidentiary hearing in compliance with the formal adjudication provisions of the apa.two other circuit courts reached the same conclusion,albeit through different reasoning.see marathon oil epa,cir steel train,cir.acquiescing in this construction,the epa promulgated regulations that memorialized the use of formal evidentiary hearings in the npdes permit process.see npdes revision of regulations,june.
in,a sea change occurred in administrative law and,specifically,in the interpretation of organic statutes such as the cwa.the supreme court held that w hen a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,the reviewing court first must ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if congress intent is clear,that intent the court and the agency must give it full effect.id.at.if,however,congress has not directly addressed the question and the agency has stepped into the vacuum by promulgating an interpretive regulation,a reviewing court may not simply impose its own construction on the statute,but,rather,ought to ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
this paradigm,sometimes called the chevron,increases the sphere of influence of agency action.if congressional intent is unclear and an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers is reasonable,an inquiring court must defer to that interpretation.see id.at.that is so even if the agency interpretation is not the one that the court considers to be the best available interpretation.see id.at.
armed with the chevron decision and a presidential directive to streamline regulatory programs,see remarks on regulatory reform,weekly comp.doc,the epa advanced a proposal to eliminate formal evidentiary hearings from the npdes permitting process.see amendments to streamline the npdes program regulations round two.in due course,the epa adopted that proposal as a final rule.see amendments to streamline the npdes program regulations round two,may.
this revision depended heavily on a chevron analysis.the agency began by finding no evidence that congress intended to require formal evidentiary hearings or that the text of section a precludes informal adjudication of permit review petitions.id.at.then,it weighed the risks and benefits of employing informal hearing procedures for npdes permit review,determining that these procedures would not violate the due process clause.id.finally,it concluded that informal hearing procedures satisfy the hearing requirement of section a.id.
it was under this new regulatory scheme that the epa considered dominion request to renew its npdes permit and to authorize a thermal variance.thus,it was under this scheme that the epa denied dominion request for an evidentiary hearing.
iii.analysis 
the court of appeals reviews a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.gabriel preble,cir.in doing so,the court accepts the factual allegations of the plaintiff complaint and indulges all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.united states,cir.the appellate court is not wedded to the lower court reasoning,but may affirm the order of dismissal on any ground fairly presented by the record.see intergen grina,cir.
here,dominion claim on appeal rests on the premise that it has satisfied the jurisdictional requirements for a citizen suit under section a of the cwa.subject to a notice may not be commenced prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of such proposed action,b the statute invoked by dominion grants federal district courts jurisdiction over any citizen suit brought against the administrator of the epa where there is alleged a failure of the administrator to perform any act or duty u
