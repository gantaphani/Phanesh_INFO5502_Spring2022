for many years,new england supply of electricity capacity was barely sufficient to meet the region demand.ferc and new england generators,electricity providers,and power customers made several attempts to address the problem.this case arises from the latest effort to design a solution.concerned parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement agreement that,inter alia,established mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and provided that the public interest standard would govern rate challenges.ferc approved the agreement,finding that it presents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public interest.objectors to the settlement sought review in the circuit,which largely rejected their efforts to overturn ferc approval order,but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate is brought by noncontracting third parties,public interest standard does not apply.
held the presumption does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks ferc investigation.the presumption is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties.it applies,as well,to challenges initiated by noncontracting parties.
a morgan stanley did not reach the question presented here,but its reasoning strongly suggests that the circuit holding misperceives the aim,and diminishes the force,of the doctrine.announced three months after the court of appeals disposition in this case,morgan stanley reaffirmed instruction to ferc to presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated contract meets the just and reasonable requirement unless ferc concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.at.the morgan stanley opinion makes it unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not,as the circuit suggested,independent of,and sometimes at odds with,the just and reasonable standard.rather,the public interest standard defines what it means for a rate to satisfy the standard in the contract context.at.and if ferc itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting from fair,negotiations,noncontracting parties may not escape that presumption.moreover,the doctrine does not neglect interests it directs ferc to reject a contract rate that seriously harms the consuming public.at.finally,the circuit confinement of to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine animating purpose promotion of the stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the energy industry.mobile,at.a presumption applicable to contracting parties only,and inoperative as to everyone else consumers,advocacy groups,state utility commissions,elected officials acting parens patriae could scarcely provide the stability aimed to secure.

the federal power act fpa or act,stat,as amended,et,authorizes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission to superintend the sale of electricity in interstate commerce and provides that all rates must be just and reasonable,a.under this court doctrine,ferc must presume that a rate set by a freely negotiated contract meets the statutory just and reasonable requirement.morgan stanley capital group public util.dist.of snohomish,slip,at.the presumption may be overcome only if ferc concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.ibid.
this case stems from new england difficulties in maintaining the reliability of its energy grid.in,after several attempts by the commission and concerned parties to address the problems,ferc approved a comprehensive settlement agreement hereinafter settlement agreement or agreement.most relevant here,the agreement established mechanisms for sales of energy capacity,and provided that the public interest standard would govern rate challenges.parties who opposed the settlement petitioned for review in the united states court of appeals for the circuit.among multiple objections to ferc order approving the agreement,the settlement opponents urged that the rate challenges of nonsettling parties should not be controlled by the restrictive public interest standard.the court of appeals agreed,holding that when a rate challenge is brought by a third party,the doctrine simply does not apply.maine pub.util.comm ferc,per curiam.
we reverse the circuit judgment to the extent that it rejects the application of to noncontracting parties.our decision in morgan stanley,announced three months after the circuit disposition,made clear that the public interest standard is not an exception to the statutory standard it is an application of that standard in the context of rates set by contract.the venerable doctrine rests on the stabilizing force of contracts.morgan stanley,at slip,at see,at describing contract rates as a key source of stability to retain vitality,the doctrine must control ferc itself,and,we hold,challenges to contract rates brought by noncontracting as well as contracting parties.
in a capacity market,in contrast to a wholesale energy market,an electricity provider purchases from a generator an option to buy a quantity of energy,rather than purchasing the energy itself.to maintain the reliability of the grid,electricity providers generally purchase more capacity,rights to acquire energy,than necessary to meet their customers anticipated demand.for many years in new england,the supply of capacity was barely sufficient to meet the region demand.ferc and new england generators,electricity providers,and power customers made several attempts to address this problem.this case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.
in,a group of generators sought to enter into reliability agreements with the new england independent system operator iso,which operates the region transmission system in its orders addressing those agreements,ferc directed the iso to develop a new market mechanism that would set prices separately for various geographical.devon power llc,ferc.
in march,the iso proposed a market structure responsive to ferc directions.see devon power llc,ferc.ferc set the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge alj,who issued a order largely accepting the iso proposal.devon power llc,ferc.several parties filed exceptions to the alj order on september,the full commission heard arguments on the proposed market structure,and thereafter established settlement procedures.devon power llc,ferc.
after four months of negotiations,on march,a settlement was reached.of the negotiating parties,only opposed the settlement.
the settlement agreement installed a forward capacity market under which annual auctions would set capacity prices auctions would be conducted three years in advance of the time when the capacity would be needed.devon power llc,ferc.each energy provider would be required to purchase enough capacity to meet its share of the installed capacity requirement,the minimum level of capacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid,as determined by the iso,at.for the gap between the first auction and the time when the capacity procured in that auction would be provided the agreement prescribed a series of fixed,payments to generators,at.
the issue before us centers on of the agreement hereinafter provision.under that provision,challenges to both payments and prices would be adjudicated under the public interest standard of review set forth in united gas pipe line mobile gas service,and fpc sierra pacific power,the doctrine.app.applies,instructs,whether the price is challenged by a settling party,a party,or by the ferc acting sua sponte.ibid.
ferc approved the settlement agreement,finding that as a package,it presents a just and reasonable outcome for this proceeding consistent with the public interest.ferc,at.the provision,ferc explicitly determined,appropriately balances the need for rate stability and the interests of the diverse entities who will be subject to the forward capacity market auction system.at.
six of the eight objectors to the settlement sought review in the circuit.for the most part,the court of appeals rejected the objectors efforts to overturn ferc order approving the settlement,at.but the objectors prevailed on the issue the circuit held that applies only to contracting parties,at.in this court,the parties have switched places.defenders of the settlement,including the provision,are petitioners objectors to the settlement,victorious in the court of appeals only on the issue,are respondents.
because of the importance of the issue,and in light of our recent decision in morgan stanley,we granted certiorari,to resolve this question does standard appl y when a contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a party to the contract brief for petitioners satisfied that the answer to that question is yes,we reverse the circuit judgment insofar as it rejected application of to noncontracting parties.
the fpa gives ferc authority to regulate the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.see b.the act allows regulated utilities to set rates unilaterally by tariff alternatively,sellers and buyers may agree on rates by contract.see c,d.whether set by tariff or contract,however,all rates must be just and reasonable.a.rates may be examined by the commission,upon complaint or on its own initiative,when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed or after a rate goes into effect.e,a.following a hearing,the commission may set aside any rate found unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,and replace it with a just and reasonable rate.a.
the doctrine originated in twin decisions announced on the same day in united gas pipe line mobile gas service,and fpc sierra pacific power.both concerned rates set by contract rather than by tariff.mobile involved the natural gas act,which,like the fpa,requires utilities to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.c.in mobile,we rejected a gas utility argument that the requirement authorized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a purchaser simply by filing a new tariff,at.filing,we explained,was a precondition to changing a rate,not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful contract,at see morgan stanley,at slip,at.
the sierra case involved a further issue.not only had the commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed tariff superseded a contract rate.in addition,the commission had suggested that,in any event,the contract rate,which the utility sought to escape,was itself unjust and unreasonable.the commission thought that was so solely because the contract rate yield ed less than a fair return on the utility net invested capital.at.
the commission suggestion prompted this court to home in on the question of how the commission may evaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.morgan stanley,at slip,at.the sierra court answered the question this way 
t he commission conclusion appears on its face to be based on an erroneous standard.w hile it may be that the commission may not normally impose upon a public utility a rate which would produce less than a fair return,it does not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate affording less than a fair return or that,if it does so,it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain.in such circumstances the sole concern of the commission would seem to be whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest as where it might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service,cast upon other consumers an excessive burden,or be unduly discriminatory.at some emphasis added.
in a later case,we similarly explained the regulatory system created by the fpa is premised on contractual agreements voluntarily devised by the regulated companies it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.permian basin area rate cases,
two terms ago,in morgan stanley,the court reaffirmed and clarified the doctrine.that case presented two questions first,does the presumption that contract rates freely negotiated between sophisticated parties meet the just and reasonable standard imposed by a apply only when ferc has had an initial opportunity to review a contract rate without the presumption at slip,at.second,does the presumption generally impose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of wholesale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers at slip,at see,at.answering no to the first question and yes to the second,the court emphasized the essential role of contracts as a key factor fostering stability in the electricity market,to the longrun benefit of consumers,at,slip,at,see,rates,fed.reg.noting chilling effect on investments caused by uncertainties regarding rate stability and contract sanctity nevada power duke energy trading marketing,ferc,competitive power markets simply can not attract the capital needed to build adequate generating infrastructure without regulatory certainty,including certainty that the commission will not modify contracts unless there are extraordinary circumstances.
morgan stanley did not reach the question presented here does public interest standard apply to challenges to contract rates brought by noncontracting parties but morgan stanley reasoning strongly suggests that the circuit negative answer misperceives the aim,and diminishes the force,of the doctrine.
in unmistakably plain language,morgan stanley restated instruction to the commission ferc must presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated contract meets the just and reasonable requirement imposed by law.the presumption may be overcome only if ferc concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.at slip,at.as our instruction to ferc in morgan stanley conveys,the public interest standard is not,as the circuit presented it,a standard independent of,and sometimes at odds with,the just and reasonable standard,see,at rather,the public interest standard defines what it means for a rate to satisfy the standard in the contract context.morgan stanley,at slip,at.and if ferc itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting from fair,negotiations,how can it be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless may escape that presumption 
moreover,the doctrine does not overlook interests it is framed with a view to their protection.the doctrine directs the commission to reject a contract rate that seriously harms the consuming public.morgan stanley,at slip,at see verizon communications fcc,when a buyer and a seller agree upon a rate,the principal regulatory responsibility i s not to relieve a contracting party of an unreasonable rate,but to protect against potential discrimination by favorable contract rates between allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale customers.emphasis added.
finally,as earlier indicated,see supra,at,the circuit confinement of to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose of the doctrine promotion of the stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the energy industry.mobile,at.that dominant concern was expressed by ferc in the order on review stability is particularly important in this case,which was initiated in part because of the unstable
