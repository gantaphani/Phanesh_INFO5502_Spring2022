the environmental protection agency epa issued an information request to william gurley on february,pursuant to e of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,codified at e and b.gurley was directed to respond to the request within days.he was warned that the failure to do so could result in an enforcement action by the epa and civil penalties of up to per day of noncompliance.
the epa filed a complaint on august,alleging that gurley had failed to adequately respond to the agency request.gurley answered that he had previously disclosed the requested information on january,in a deposition taken by the epa in a companion case.see united states gurley refining,aff in part and rev in part,cir.summary judgment was granted in favor of the united states on december,and its petition for the imposition of civil penalties was granted on november.
gurley appeals both the grant of summary judgment and the consequent imposition of approximately million in civil penalties.he argues that the information request was invalid,he is exempt from compliance with the agency request,the epa action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata,and the agency motivation remains a disputed issue of material fact.gurley also challenges the imposition of the penalty against him on the grounds that a portion of the fine was based upon a nonexistent cause of action,the fine levied was in violation of the excessive fines and due process clauses of the united states constitution,and the district court abused its discretion by imposing the penalty.finally,gurley argues that the statutory scheme that provides for the issuance of information requests violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the relevant facts are set forth in the district court two opinions,the first of which granted the epa motion for summary judgment and the second of which granted the agency petition to impose a civil penalty.in its summary judgment order,the court summarized the factual background as follows 
this case arises from epa investigative actions surrounding a former landfill near south eighth street in west memphis,arkansas.as early as,the epa detected various hazardous chemicals at the site.later investigations led the epa on october,to place the site on the cercla national priorities list.the united states is presently engaged in several cases surrounding the attempt to clean up that site.
from until the present,the plaintiff was the president and majority stockholder in gurley refining company grc.grc bought used oil and treated it,thereby allowing it to resell that oil.the refining process created a residue of oily waste.grc disposed of this waste by dumping it at,among other locations,the south eighth street landfill.
on february,the epa,pursuant to its authority under e,issued a general notice letter and information request to the defendant.after several unsuccessful attempts to deliver that request,the united states marshals service served it on the defendant wife.the information request sought gurley individual knowledge of,among other things,gurley assets,generators of material that was disposed of at the site,site operations,and the structure of grc.
on september,the defendant sent a letter to the epa stating his position that grc was the entity that the epa should contact for information related to the site.the epa responded on january,by indicating that the february,information request was addressed to the defendant individually and must be answered in that capacity.the epa also posed six additional questions to gurley.on january,the defendant again sent a letter refusing to respond individually and suggesting that any information requests be directed to grc.
the united states then filed its action.gurley subsequently provided the epa with an individual response however,he refused to answer the questions regarding his financial condition and he ignored the six additional questions added to the epa original request for information.the united states also believes that gurley responses to the other questions were incomplete.
a significant delay in the proceedings was caused by gurley filing for personal bankruptcy in july of.his bankruptcy petition was finally dismissed in august of,allowing the district court to move forward on the epa motion for summary judgment.the motion was granted on december,with the order providing that the usa remains free to petition the court for the imposition of a civil penalty under e b.such a petition was filed by the epa in june of.the petition was granted in november of,with penalties imposed in the amount of based upon the following calculation 
first,the court fines gurley for the period from february,until september,the date gurley finally responded day x days.second,the court fines gurley for the period from september,until july,the date gurley provided deposition testimony regarding other prps potentially responsible parties and site operations day x days.finally,the court fines gurley for the period from july,until february,when gurley answered the section e request under court order x days.the court bases this penalty structure on the varying levels of egregiousness gurley demonstrated in failing to comply fully with the epa information requests.
this timely appeal followed.
