smita and tarun sanghvi the sanghvis wanted to expand their residential alzheimer care facility located in an unincorporated area of los angeles county the county adjacent to the city of claremont claremont or the city.to that end,they sought to obtain sewer service from the city.explaining that it had an existing policy against connecting properties outside its corporate limits to its sewer system unless the property owners agreed to annexation,the city refused to provide the requested service.additionally,in what the sanghvis contend were unlawful acts of retaliation,the city took numerous actions opposing the sanghvis efforts to expand their facility,including instituting legal action against them and lobbying county officials.the sanghvis contend that the city alleged acts of retaliation and the denial of their request for sewer service violated their civil rights and discriminated against handicapped alzheimer patients who would reside in their expanded facility.they asserted claims against the city and various city officials collectively the city under and the fair housing act fha,
summary judgment proceedings disposed of all claims except the sanghvis fha claims of discrimination based on disparate treatment,and the city alleged failure to reasonably accommodate the housing needs of the disabled alzheimer patients.those claims were tried to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of the city.the district court denied the sanghvis motions,and entered judgment in the city favor.the sanghvis appeal.they argue that the district court should have granted their motions for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial.in support of that argument,they contend they established a prima facie case of discrimination under the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,and no reasonable jury could have failed to find that the city unlawfully discriminated against,and failed reasonably to accommodate the housing needs of,the alzheimer patients.
the sanghvis also argue that the district court erred in its jury instructions and special verdict form,both of which employed the mcdonnell douglas formulation for resolving the discrimination issue.in addition,they challenge the district court summary judgment in favor of the city on their retaliation claim,which judgment the court granted by relying on the doctrine.finally,they contend the district court erred in precluding them from presenting evidence of losses sustained by their corporation,mountain view alzheimer center,view.

motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial 
we review de novo the district court denial of the sanghvis motion for judgment as a matter of law.pavao pagay,cir.we will not reverse the district court denial of that motion unless,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the city,we conclude there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find in the city favor.a reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
we review for abuse of discretion the district court denial of the sanghvis motion for a new trial.pavao,at citation omitted.the sanghvis challenge that ruling on the ground that the jury verdict was contrary to the clear weight of the evidence.
having reviewed the record as a whole,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying either motion.
discrimination claim 
to prevail on their discrimination claim under the fha,the sanghvis had to prove that the city discriminated against the facility refusing to connect the sanghvis facility to the city sewer system unless the sanghvis agreed to annexation.f b in attempting to prove their fha claim,the sanghvis presented evidence to establish a prima facie case based on the mcdonnell douglas framework the elements of which,as applied to this case,are 
plaintiff is a member of a protected class plaintiff applied for a sewer connection and was qualified to receive it the sewer connection was denied despite plaintiff being qualified and defendant approved a sewer connection for a similarly situated party during a period relatively near the time plaintiff was denied its sewer connection.
gamble,at citations omitted 
the sanghvis argue that because,on their discrimination claim based on disparate treatment,they made the showing necessary under the mcdonnell douglas formulation to survive summary judgment,the district court should have instructed the jury that they had established a prima facie case of discrimination under the fha.this argument misconstrues the role of the prima facie case in the mcdonnell douglas framework.
a mcdonnell douglas prima facie showing is not the equivalent of a factual finding of discrimination rather,it is simply proof of actions taken from which we infer discriminatory animus because experience has proved that in the absence of any other explanation it is more likely than not that those actions were bottomed on impermissible considerations.
gay,at quoting furnco constr,at.emphasis and first alteration in gay.thus,the mcdonnell douglas inference can but need not result in an ultimate judgment for the plaintiff.in other words,a prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas is one in which the plaintiff has met his immediate burden of production,but not necessarily his ultimate burden of persuasion.gay,at citing.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d emphasis added.
during trial,the city produced evidence that,by requiring the annexation of property in exchange for a sewer connection,the city could require property owners to conform their properties to the city general development plan.although the city had not enforced its annexation policy before the sanghvis applied for a sewer connection,city engineer craig bradshaw testified that the reason the city had approved earlier connections without annexation was that theretofore he and other employees in the engineering department had been unaware of the annexation policy.once the city manager made the engineering department employees aware of the policy,it was strictly enforced.the city has not,since then,extended sewer service to properties outside its corporate limits.this evidence supported an inference that the sanghvis did not qualify to receive a sewer connection,and it supported a finding that the city had a legitimate,reason for denying a sewer connection to the sanghvis property.
when the trial evidence reached this point,the mcdonnell douglas its presumptions and burdens was no longer relevant.mary honor ctr.hicks,d.although the sanghvis circumstantial evidence established a mcdonnell douglas prima facie case,meeting this burden of production simply permitted but did not compel the jury to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination.id.at.the city burden was to present evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.because it did so,it did everything that would be required of it if the sanghvis had properly made out a prima facie case.united states postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d.at that point in the trial,the presumption drops from the case,and the fact finder need only address the ultimate question of discrimination.id.quoting burdine,at.the jury decided that question in favor of the city.because the jury verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence,the district court properly denied the sanghvis motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial on their fha discrimination claim based on disparate treatment.
reasonable accommodation 
under the fha,discrimination includes a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.f b.while a city need not be required to make fundamental or substantial modifications to accommodate the handicapped,it may be required to make reasonable ones.city of edmonds.state council,cir quoting alexander choate,d,aff sub nom.city of edmonds oxford house,d alterations in.state.
the sanghvis presented no evidence from which the jury could conclude that the requested accommodation was an accommodation required by the alzheimer patients.it was an accommodation sought by the sanghvis for their personal benefit.they wanted a sewer without annexation because they did not want to incur the added cost of complying with the city building requirements.this was an economic concern of the sanghvis,not a therapeutic concern of the alzheimer patients.see brandt village of chebanse,cir holding that no grant of a variance from single family zoning was necessary where developer had not shown that her proposed complex,of which two units would be,was for therapeutic rather than economic reasons.
the sanghvis reasonable accommodation claim fails because there was a legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find in the city favor.a.
jury instructions and special verdict form 
the sanghvis argue that the district court erred in its jury instructions and special verdict form,both of which set out the mcdonnell douglas framework although we have never directly addressed the question of the propriety of the use of the mcdonnell douglas framework in jury instructions and special verdict forms,we have stated that it is not normally appropriate to introduce the mcdonnell douglas framework to the jury.costa desert palace,cir en banc,cert.granted,d.
a majority of our sister circuits concur in this view,although none has found the error substantial enough to warrant reversal.some decisions criticize any use of the mcdonnell douglas formulation in instructing the jury,emphasizing that the only question that should go to the jury is the ultimate question of discrimination other circuits condemn the use of legalistic language and the complexities of burden shifting without rejecting the mcdonnell douglas framework outright.see cabrera jakabovitz,cir holding that,although a jury instruction that included the phrase prima facie case and referred to defendant burden of produc tion created a distinct risk of confusing the jury,in certain instances it would be appropriate to instruct the jury on the elements of a prima facie case watson southeastern.transp,cir holding that,although it is proper to instruct the jury that it may consider whether the factual predicates necessary to establish the prima facie case have been shown,it is error to instruct the jury on the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting scheme,cert.denied,d mullen princess anne vol.fire,cir noting that the shifting burdens of production of burdine are beyond the function and expertise of the jury and are overly complex walther lone star gas,cir instructing the jury on the elements of a prima facie case,presumptions,and the shifting burden of proof is unnecessary and confusing.instead,the court should instruct the jury to consider the ultimate question of whether defendant terminated plaintiff because of his age.ryther kare,cir en banc loken,in part.of the dissent,which a majority of the court joined holding that the jury need only decide the ultimate issue of intentional discrimination,and usually need not make findings on the prima facie case or whether the defendant explanation is pretextual dudley stores,cir we stress that it is unnecessary and inappropriate to instruct the jury on the mcdonnell douglas analysis.
in contrast,only one circuit has not disparaged the use of the mcdonnell douglas framework in jury instructions.see gafford,cir holding that it was not error to guid e the jury through a order of proof as opposed to instructing solely on the ultimate issue of sex discrimination.
having considered the views and observations of this and other circuits,we conclude that it is error to charge the jury with the elements of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case.the technical elements of the presumptions and shifting burdens have significant potential to confuse juries.see costa,at.
moreover,at the jury stage,the framework unnecessarily evades the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.id.at,quoting aikens,at.instead of burdening the jury with the details of a framework designed to allocate burdens and promote the orderly presentation of evidence,district courts should focus the fact finders on the one essential question whether the plaintiff is a victim of intentional discrimination aikens,at.gehring,at.
in the present case,however,the sanghvis waived their challenge to the instruction the district court gave by failing to object to it.see.moreover,they requested an alternative instruction of their own that incorporated the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis.
with regard to the special verdict form,the sanghvis objected in the district court to questions one through five,stating that those questions were likely to confuse the jury on the discrimination and accommodation issues.their objection,however,did not alert the district court to the mcdonnell douglas issue.in an attempt to raise that issue in this appeal,they recast their objection to the special verdict form citing watson,at,for the proposition that the technical aspects of the burden shifting framework are confusing.because the sanghvis failed to make this objection in the district court,they waived it insofar as they now contend it was error to employ the mcdonnell douglas framework.they have not waived,however,their contention that the special verdict form was confusing.as to that contention,we conclude that any possible error was harmless.
although questions one through five incorporated elements of the mcdonnell douglas framework,there was abundant evidence that the city denied the sewer connection for reasons other than intentional discrimination against the handicapped.thus,any confusion that may have been engendered by the inclusion of questions modeled on the mcdonnell douglas factors was harmless,and did not constitute reversible error.see cancellier federated stores,cir citations omitted holding that where the record convincingly rebuts any presumption of prejudice,an instruction that does not misstate the law,but is less clear than it ought to be,is harmless.
the sanghvis argue,however,that the jury was in fact confused,as demonstrated by a question the jury submitted to the court during deliberations.the jury asked re questions,what is meant by qualified who or what agency qualified the sanghvis for sewer connection answering this question,the court explained qualified,as used in these instructions,means whether plaintiffs were similarly situated as other persons outside the city who received sewer.the city of claremont was the sole agency which could qualify plaintiffs for a sewer connection.the sanghvis do not contend that this explanation was erroneous.instead,they argue the fact that the jury sought clarification proves the jury was confused,and as a result they are entitled to a new trial.we disagree.
the jury request for clarification of the term qualified does not reflect confusion with the special verdict form or with the court instructions.rather,it reflects a jury focused on the threshold issue of whether the sanghvis qualified for a sewer connection.the court responsive instruction answered that inquiry.given the parties conflicting evidence regarding the existence and application of the city annexation policy,it was appropriate for the jury to determine,consistent with the district court explanatory instruction,whether or not the sanghvis met the threshold requirement of qualifying for a sewer connection.see,lynn regents of the of,cir recognizing that it should make little difference to the outcome whether the defendant evidence was analyzed at step one,to determine whether the plaintiff was qualified to receive tenure or at step two,to determine whether the defendant had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for denying tenure.moreover,regardless whether the jury determined,as it did,that the sanghvis were not qualified to receive the sewer connection or,as it could have,that the city had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for denying the connection,the weight of the evidence simply does not support a conclusion that the sewer connection was denied based on impermissible discrimination against the handicapped.
neither the court jury instructions nor the special verdict form require reversal in this case.
