the town of norwood,massachusetts norwood,which operates a municipal electric system serving local businesses and residents,seeks review of an order of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.the order sustained a contract termination charge contained in a tariff previously filed by new england power company nepco.the background events have been the subject of prior litigation in this court,principally in town of norwood ferc norwood i,cir,cert.denied,d.
for many years,nepco was a major power wholesaler in new england.it operated generating plants and a transmission network,and sold power wholesale to affiliated distribution companies such as massachusetts electric company,which served massachusetts,and narragansett electric company,which served rhode island as well as to distributors like norwood.service to norwood was provided under a requirements contract of a kind then common in the utilities industry.
the contract,which began in and thereafter was extended by norwood until october,required nepco to supply,and norwood to purchase,norwood power requirements from nepco at rates provided by nepco tariff.the contract could be terminated by norwood without penalty but only upon seven years prior notice.the present litigation arises out of nepco action in providing,and norwood decision to exercise,a new option permitting customers to terminate their contracts early.
beginning in late,in response to legislative and regulatory initiatives to promote competition and consumer choice in the electric power industry,nepco made a series of regulatory filings.among these were settlements offered by nepco to nepco distributor affiliates and including norwood permitting them to terminate their nepco requirements contracts earlier than otherwise permitted,upon payment of a contract termination charge.
the aim was to allow distributors flexibility to choose new suppliers while permitting nepco to recover its stranded costs that is,investments made by nepco to meet the projected requirements of its distributor customers the proposed settlement terms also provided that nepco would offer its affiliates,but not norwood,low but gradually escalating wholesale standard offer rates for power without the need for a contract the affiliates were required to offer corresponding retail standard offer rates to their retail customers,but norwood,as a municipal utility,was not.laws ch.
additionally,as part of its restructuring,nepco sought approval from ferc to sell virtually all of its generating facilities.the buyer,usgen new england,agreed to assume responsibility for providing the wholesale standard offer service to nepco affiliates who terminated,and agreed not to raise rates for nepco remaining distributor customers,including norwood.new eng.power,wl,at new eng.power vii,reh g denied,wl,new eng.power viii.
ferc approved the settlement offers and divestiture over norwood objection nepco three affiliated customers and three of its unaffiliated municipal customers opted to accept nepco settlement offer,to terminate early,and to pay the contract termination charge.other opted to continue to purchase their power requirements from nepco at tariff rates through the contractual notice period for termination.
norwood was unwilling to take either course of action.it did not want to continue buying power at tariff rates when its distributor competitors had been offered lower rates it viewed such an arrangement as discriminatory.nor did it want to pay a contract termination charge for nepco stranded costs because it purchased its transmission services from boston edison,not nepco,it fell outside the stranded cost obligations imposed by ferc under order 
instead,norwood notified nepco on march,that on april it would unilaterally terminate its contract with giving the required seven years switch to a different power supplier.nepco then filed a tariff amendment to its tariff permitting any of its remaining distributor customers,including norwood,to terminate their requirements contracts on thirty days notice upon the payment of a contract termination charge ctc whose formula was specified in the tariff amendment.norwood i,at.
this ctc was calculated using a formula that would enable nepco to recover the revenues that it would have collected had a terminating customer continued to pay the tariff rate then in effect through the end of the contract term.the ctc equaled the number of years remaining on the contract l multiplied by the difference between the expected annual revenue from the terminating customer based on the rates in effect at the time of termination r and the estimated market value of the released capacity m that is,ctc l x.the ctc was capped so as not to exceed the terminating customer contribution to nepco fixed power supply costs the tariff defined that contribution as l multiplied by the difference between r and nepco annual average fuel costs with respect to the customer.
this ctc was in several respects less favorable than the contract termination charge applied to settling customers it did not provide the terminating customer a credit for the recovery of costs associated with nepco business,for example,through the profitable divestiture of generating plants and it did not update the formula values to reflect actual,rather than projected,market values for released capacity.new eng.power,wl,at nn,new eng.power ix,reh g denied,wl,new eng.power x new eng.power v,wl,at.
in proceedings before ferc,norwood objected to the tariff amendment on a number of grounds,including claims that it violated the stranded cost recovery provisions of ferc order,and that the disparities between the ctc offered to norwood and the ctc offered to settling customers constituted an undue preference in violation of the federal power act.b.norwood also sought an evidentiary hearing on the reasonableness of the ctc amount which it estimated at million.norwood i,at.
ferc rejected norwood claims,found the tariff amendment to be reasonable,new eng.power ix,wl,at,and on rehearing refused to provide an evidentiary hearing because no party had raised any issue of material fact.new eng.power x,wl,at.ferc noted that norwood could file a section complaint arguing that the underlying contract was no longer reasonable and that norwood should be able to break it without paying the amounts owed under it.new eng.power ix,wl,at.
norwood i affirmed ferc decision,holding inter alia that order did not by its terms apply to norwood,at,and that the disparity between norwood ctc and the contract termination charge of settling customers did not constitute an undue preference.id.at.at several points norwood present appeal appears to attempt to relitigate these two issues,but in these respects it is foreclosed by our prior adjudication.springfield television fcc,cir.
we also upheld the ctc formula as designed to cover certain projected losses to new england power caused by not supplying electricity after preparing to do so,calculated based on rates already approved by ferc and said that norwood had failed to show any factual dispute requiring an evidentiary hearing.norwood i,at.however,we left open the possibility that norwood could file a section complaint challenging the substance of the contract termination charge.id 
norwood declined to pay the termination charge and,faced with state court proceedings to recover amounts due under the contract,norwood filed a section complaint with ferc in,alleging among other things that nepco erroneously calculated the ctc and ctc cap by relying on incorrect r and m values.in particular,norwood claimed that the r value should have been reduced to reflect nepco profitable divestiture of its generating plants,that the m value should have been to reflect actual,market values,and that these omissions were unreasonable under section.
the commission set norwood claims for a hearing,saying that it had accepted nepco ctc formula,but ha d not accepted the individual components of the ctc calculation.town of norwood grid usa,at grid i.before the alj,norwood also argued belatedly that the interest rate of percent applied by nepco to overdue ctc payments was contrary to the tariff amendment and,since the rate was in excess of nepco cost of money,unjust and unreasonable.
the alj accepted norwood argument that it should get a reduction in the r value figure to reflect the plant divestitures but rejected its other claims.on review,the commission reversed the alj as to the credit for plant divestitures,ruling that the language of the ctc formula did not provide for an adjustment for divestiture of assets,and that the disparity between the ctc formula applied to norwood and the contract termination charge offered to settling customers was not an undue preference because the parties were not similarly situated the commission did not directly address norwood argument that the formula was unreasonable in failing to provide a credit for plant divestitures.
on the interest rate issue,the commission in its initial decision rejected the alj ruling in nepco favor,instead siding with norwood.grid iii,wl,at.on rehearing,it reversed itself and sided with nepco ferc also reaffirmed its holding in favor of nepco on the r and m values.grid iv,wl,at.the commission thereafter denied norwood request for further rehearing on the interest rate issue.grid v,wl,at.this appeal followed.
we begin by considering norwood arguments concerning the r and m values.to the extent that norwood purports to interpret the language of the ctc tariff amendment as requiring credit for divestiture of assets and,its arguments are properly before us but fail on the merits.the ctc provides for certain kinds of credit adjustments to r,including for transmission services provided by third parties,but nowhere mentions credit for divestiture of assets.the ctc was clearly intended as a,as the staff urged,merely as a starting point.grid ii,wl,at.
norwood says that such a credit was implicitly intended because the ctc was modeled on the contract termination approved in order and offered to settling customers,which provided credit for asset divestiture.but when ferc approved the ctc tariff amendment,it expressly noted that t he proposed formula differs from that applicable to other wholesale power customers.new eng.power ix,wl,at nn.
nor does the ctc anywhere indicate that the m values will be quite to the contrary,the letter accompanying the tariff states that,although nepco planned to periodically update the estimates of market value provided in the tariff,a ny updated estimates would not affect the contract termination charges payable by a customer that exercised the early termination charge prior to the filing of the update.in short,the ctc tariff language is clear and adverse to norwood.
however,the main thrust of norwood position on appeal is that the ctc formula,as ferc reads it,is unlawful under the statute.norwood argues that,because the formula fails to account for the divestiture of assets or to incorporate market values for power,it is not is,the ctc would give nepco more than it needs to recover any losses incurred by not supplying power to norwood after preparing to do so and that the ctc is therefore unjust and unreasonable.
as we have noted,the commission did not address these unreasonableness claims on the merits.its position is that norwood can not now raise them because the reasonableness of the ctc opposed to its res judicata.although the commission would likely prevail on the merits,this would likely require a remand and further proceedings.we agree that they need not be reached because norwood attacks on the reasonableness of the formula are foreclosed.
over seven years ago,the commission pronounced the ctc formula to be reasonable despite the fact that it failed to provide for any adjustments for asset divestiture or.new eng.power ix,wl,at nn.norwood sought review of the ferc decision in norwood i but on appeal norwood developed only its discrimination claim and a different unreasonableness argument but not the unreasonableness arguments concerning r and m that it now makes.
to permit norwood now to advance new and previously available theories in opposition to an tariff amendment would frustrate the values of repose and efficiency that res judicata doctrine is meant to protect.of elliott,d.res judicata does not merely prevent of issues actually decided but also the presentation of new grounds that could and should have been raised when the same transaction was the subject of earlier,different attacks.restatement second of judgments.
generally speaking,such res judicata doctrine applies to agencies when they are acting in an adjudicative capacity to resolve a controversy between two parties.aunyx canon,cir,cert.denied,d.here and in the prior proceeding in which norwood sought rejection of the ctc tariff,the parties are the same and,so far as norwood contests the validity of the ctc formula,the subject matter is the same.the first proceeding resolved the reasonableness issue in what was effectively a final judgment attacks not properly developed there can not now be resurrected 
norwood says that when we sustained ferc in norwood i,we expressly left open to norwood a section challenge to the substance of the contract termination charge,adding that i f these charges were miscomputed or unsupported,norwood might well have a legitimate objection.at.when setting for hearing the claim currently on appeal,ferc agreed that it had not yet approved the individual components used in nepco calculation of the ctc.grid i,wl,at.
but what was left open by these statements was the proper computation of the r and m values according to the new attacks on the formula itself.norwood,quoting the ferc staff,says that the prior reservation could not have meant only to giv e norwood a chance to challenge nepco arithmetic.but whether the figures proffered by nepco complied with the formula mattered a good deal and norwood itself did urge that nepco had employed unreasonable estimates of the market value of the released load and had miscalculated its fixed power supply costs in determining the ctc cap.
norwood says that rate orders are not subject to the rules of res judicata a rate that was once reasonable may,in light of changed circumstances,become unreasonable.tesoro alaska petroleum ferc.but the ctc is not a rate it is a charge calculated based on rates already approved by ferc,norwood i,at,payment of which permitted norwood to opt out of a contract before it had run its course.the charge became a fixed and final contractual obligation at the time of termination.
norwood counters that the ctc,if not itself a rate,incorporated rates that should be open to challenge as unreasonably high.but there is nothing in the statute or case law cited by norwood that prevents the construction of termination charge based on rates in effect as of a certain date.creating a fixed and knowable obligation had advantages and disadvantages for norwood in choosing whether to terminate but the terms of the ctc were clear when it made its decision.
in effect,nepco bore the risk of higher costs and lower market prices than the ctc incorporated,and norwood bore the risk of lower costs and higher market prices.norwood was free to argue,in its original ctc challenge,that the tariff rates to be incorporated by the ctc were unreasonably high in light of what was known then about nepco costs but norwood chose not to do so.norwood was also free to terminate and contest the ctc terms as it did,albeit unsuccessfully.what it could not do was to defer some of the available attacks on the ctc formula and now raise them in court for the first time eight years later.
indeed,if we were to permit this kind of hide and seek litigation tactic,nothing would prevent norwood from filing tomorrow a new section attack to present new arguments as to why the original ctc formula was unlawful.norwood has managed to defer making the full installment payments for years.it is now faced with large obligations but the obligations are ones easily foreseen,have been enlarged by delays in payment and are the product of norwood own choices.
norwood would not likely have prevailed even if the merits were open.the reasonableness of nepco approach in excluding and future plant divestitures is a regulatory issue within the prov
