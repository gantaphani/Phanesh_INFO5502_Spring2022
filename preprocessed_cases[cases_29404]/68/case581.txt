this case presents the issue of whether a disappointed applicant to a local agency formation commission can take the depositions of the commissioners to learn what information the commissioners had when they denied the application and what additional information they needed to approve the application.because evidence is not admissible in an action or proceeding challenging a administrative decision and because the discovery permitted in this case would violate the deliberative process privilege,we hold such depositions can not be taken.
after san joaquin county county local agency formation commission sj lafco denied the application of the south san joaquin irrigation district district for approval to provide retail electric service,the district filed suit against sj lafco and noticed the taking of depositions of certain sj lafco commissioners and the executive officer.sj lafco moved for a protective order to prevent the taking of depositions,contending discovery was not permitted because review of an administrative agency action was limited to the administrative record and questioning the commissioners about their decision violated the deliberative process privilege.the superior court adopted the referee ruling to grant only partially sj lafco motion for a protective order.sj lafco petitions for a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order adopting the referee recommended ruling and to enter a new order granting sj lafco motion for a protective order in its entirety.we issue the writ.
background 
the district is a special district formed in pursuant to the act,the predecessor to water code sections et.the district provides irrigation water service and,through its ownership interest in hydroelectric generating facilities,wholesale electric generation and electricity marketing services.
the district has an ownership interest in the project,a series of three hydroelectric generation plants on the stanislaus river.a new power sales agreement with pacific gas and electric company pg e,effective january,provided the district with more revenue from the project than its allocated portion of the costs.in,the district developed a plan to provide retail electric service within its existing service territory.the district plan included the acquisition of pg e existing distribution facilities either through purchase or eminent domain.pg e opposed the district plan.
the district submitted a justification for proposal the application to sj lafco for approval to proceed with its plan to provide retail electric service in june,sj lafco certified the application as complete.
the county prepared an environmental impact report for the project to provide retail electric service,concluding there would be no significant impacts on the environment.the california public utilities commission analyzed the plan and concluded it would not substantially impair pg e ability to provide adequate service at a reasonable rate.
in may,sj lafco held a workshop on the district application.pg e opposed the application as an abuse of eminent domain.several sj lafco commissioners expressed concern about the possible use of eminent domain.sj lafco staff recommended approving the application.
in june,sj lafco held a formal hearing on the application.counsel for sj lafco advised the commissioners they were not to consider the eminent domain issue sj lafco did not have jurisdiction to condition approval on the exercise or nonexercise of eminent domain.nonetheless,several speakers addressed the issue of eminent domain.pg e opposed the application,contending the district had not demonstrated its ability to provide retail electric service and the plan was not an appropriate use of eminent domain.
a motion to oppose the staff recommendation and deny the application was passed by a vote of four to one.in proposing the motion,commissioner gary giovanetti stated the staff recommendation was based solely on information provided by the district and he would like to see an independent study performed.the proposal was to acquire pg e distribution system and pg e was not a willing seller.i convinced that it will end up being an eminent domain issue.commissioner victor mow,chairman jack sieglock and commissioner steven nilssen stated there was a lack of sufficient information to prove the case as required by government code section 
about three months after the hearing,sj lafco adopted a resolution stating the application is denied on the basis that the applicant did not demonstrate its administrative,technical,and financial capabilities to provide retail electrical service to the satisfaction of the commission pursuant to the requirements of government code section.
before this resolution was filed,the district filed suit against sj lafco,stating four claims for relief.it sought declaratory relief as to whether it had the right to provide retail electric service without the approval of sj lafco.a claim for inverse condemnation sought compensation for the taking of the district right to provide retail electric service.the district sought a writ of administrative mandamus,claiming sj lafco decision was a prejudicial abuse of discretion that was not supported by substantial evidence.finally,the district petitioned for a writ of mandate because the decision to deny the district application was based on concerns regarding eminent domain and was not supported by substantial evidence.
pg e moved to intervene.
the district gave notice of the taking of depositions of jack sieglock and gary giovanetti,sj lafco commissioners.the deposition of bruce baracco,the executive officer of sj lafco,was added.
sj lafco moved for a protective order to prevent the taking of these depositions.sj lafco argued no discovery was permissible in a mandamus case because review was limited to the administrative record.further,questioning the commissioners about their decision violated the deliberative process privilege.
a referee was appointed to hear the discovery matters.
the referee recommended partially granting the protective order,limiting the depositions of sieglock,giovanetti and baracco to all unprivileged information that the deponents had prior to june,including information obtained from third parties including but not limited to pg e,and what additional information the commissioner deponents needed to recommend adoption of the staff recommendation to approve the project.objections could be made based on the deliberative process privilege.
both sj lafco and pg e objected to the referee recommendation.
the trial court adopted the referee recommended ruling.
sj lafco petitioned for a writ of mandate or prohibition.this court issued an alternative writ.
discussion 
preliminarily,we note that discovery orders are generally not reviewed by prerogative writ.drugs,superior court cal d.there is an exception,however,when the petitioner contends that compelling an answer would violate a privilege.ibid.here,sj lafco contends that compelling the commissioners and executive officer to answer questions posed in the deposition would violate the deliberative process privilege.accordingly,we consider the merits of the discovery order.
the discovery order pertained to a lawsuit challenging a decision of sj lafco denying the district proposal to provide a new class of services,retail electric service,pursuant to government code section.lafcos have been described as watchdogs,guarding against the wasteful duplication of services that results from indiscriminate formation of new local agencies or haphazard annexation of territory to existing local agencies.citation.placer county local agency formation com.nevada county local agency formation com.th,d.sj lafco is a administrative agency.san miguel consolidated fire protection dist.davis th,d morgan community redevelopment agency d.its proceedings are in nature and its decisions are reviewed by ordinary mandamus rather than administrative mandamus.san miguel consolidated fire protection dist.davis,supra,at,d.
an unbroken line of cases holds that,in traditional mandamus actions challenging administrative decisions,evidence outside the administrative record evidence is not admissible.citations.carrancho california air resources board th,d.e evidence is generally not admissible in traditional mandamus actions challenging administrative decisions western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,western states.
limiting review to the administrative record is appropriate due to the scope of review.an action or proceeding to attack a determination of sj lafco extends only to whether there was fraud or a prejudicial abuse of discretion.prejudicial abuse of discretion is established if the court finds the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record,subd.c.this substantial evidence review is purely a question of law and is limited to the administrative record.western states,supra,cal th at,d.
permitting the admission of evidence would also infringe upon the separation of powers.the legislature has delegated authority to sj lafco under the local government reorganization act of,et excessive judicial interference with sj lafco actions would conflict with the principle that the legislative branch is entitled to deference from the courts because of the constitutional separation of powers.citations.western states,supra,cal th at,d.
discovery is intended to produce or lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.code civ.since evidence is generally not admissible in an action or proceeding to challenge a decision of sj lafco,discovery is usually not necessary.
the district contends its discovery request falls within an exception permitted by western states,supra,cal th,d.in western states,the court identified an exception that was to be very narrowly construed.evidence is admissible under this exception only in those rare instances in which the evidence in question existed before the agency made its decision,and it was not possible in the exercise of reasonable diligence to present this evidence to the agency before the decision was made so that it could be considered and included in the administrative record.id.at at,d,original italics.
this exception applies to evidence the applicant or opponent had,but was unable to present to the agency for some reason despite the exercise of reasonable diligence.the district contends this exception applies because it asserts it was held to a standard it did not know existed.the commissioners required additional information,but did not tell the district what that information was.the district construes the commissioners remarks that they needed more information to approve the application as invocation of a secret law or unwritten rules that were not disclosed to the district.
the lower court discovery order permits depositions limited to all unprivileged information that the deponents had prior to june,and what additional information the commissioner deponents needed to recommend adoption of the staff recommendation to approve the project.the information sought does not fall within the exception noted in western states,supra,cal th,d.
the first category of discovery does not disclose any purported secret law applied by sj lafco.rather,the district suggests sj lafco relied on information not in the administrative record in making its decision.if so,its decision will not be supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record,subd.c.
the second category of information asks what more is needed to change the commissioners minds about the application.government code section sets forth the necessary information for an application,including information about costs and a plan for financing the establishment of the new class of services.section does not set a threshold of information for approval rather,sj lafco is faced with a policy decision.the commissioners voting against the application stated they found the information insufficient to carry the district burden.a resolution stated the application was denied for failure to satisfactorily demonstrate administrative,technical,and financial capabilities.
it is speculative that any additional information necessary to obtain approval existed,but,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,was unable to be presented to sj lafco.while the district argues there is some secret category of information it did not know was needed,we read the commissioners remarks as simply stating they were not persuaded by the district proposal.the denial was on the merits.if the district had a stronger case to make,reasonable diligence required the district to make that case at the hearing.
the district contends another exception to the rule of no evidence applies.in western states,the court outlined only one narrow exception to the rule of no evidence.it left open the possibility,however,that there might be other exceptions.w e do not foreclose the possibility that evidence may be admissible in traditional mandamus actions challenging administrative decisions under unusual circumstances or for very limited purposes not presented in the case now before us.western states,supra,cal th at,d.the court cited to asarco,cir,which stated evidence might be admissible for background information or for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether the agency considered all relevant factors or fully explicated its decision.the western states court also noted that commentators had proposed several exceptions for evidence relevant to issues such as standing and capacity to sue,affirmative defenses,accuracy of the administrative record,procedural unfairness and agency misconduct.western states,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the court made clear,however,evidence can never be admitted merely to contradict the evidence the administrative agency relied on in making a decision or to raise a question regarding the wisdom of that decision.id.at,d.
the district contends the exception for procedural unfairness applies because sj lafco applied secret standards to the application.as discussed above,the district has failed to show secret standards were applied to its application.sj lafco denied the proposal on its merits permitting disappointed applicants to inquire as what further showing was necessary would result in unending cases and impede upon the separation of powers and the deference accorded decisions.western states,supra,cal th at,d.
the district contends the exception for agency misconduct applies because the commissioners were influenced by their bias against the exercise of eminent domain.in moving to deny the request,commissioner giovanetti stated he was convinced it would be an eminent domain issue.chairman sieglock agreed with the comments about eminent domain.all of the commissioners voting to deny the application,however,also stated they did not believe the district had provided sufficient information about the financial aspects of the proposal.commissioner giovanetti was concerned about relying solely on the district information.commissioner mow found the documents supporting the financial analysis insufficient to substantiate the analysis.chairman sieglock found a lack of information to address the terms of government code section and commissioner nilssen found insufficient information on the total estimated costs.
assuming that evidence would be admissible to show agency misconduct,the district has failed to make a sufficient showing.in cadiz land rail cycle th,d,a company challenged approval of a landfill project.it sought discovery to show the approval was illicitly influenced by the project proponent.in particular,it sought to depose a man in prison about his illegal activities in regard to the landfill project.the trial court denied the discovery request and the appellate court affirmed.it found that since there was no personal knowledge of the alleged illicit acts,the trial court could reasonably find that cadiz failed to establish that the requested depositions were reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence of agency misconduct.id.at,d.the district has made a lesser showing of misconduct here.while the issue of eminent domain was mentioned,all of the commissioners voting against the application cited a legitimate lack of the reason for their vote the district has not established any exception to the
