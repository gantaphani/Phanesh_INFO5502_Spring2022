in this reverse validation action,plaintiff taxpayers challenged a storm drainage fee imposed by the city of salinas.plaintiffs contended that the fee was a fee requiring voter approval,pursuant to california constitution,article xiii d,section c,which was added by the passage of proposition.the trial court ruled that the fee did not violate this provision because it was not a fee and it met the exemption for fees for sewer and water services.we disagree with the trial court conclusion and therefore reverse the order.
background 
in an effort to comply with the amendments to the federal clean water act,et,a et,the salinas city council took measures to reduce or eliminate pollutants contained in storm water,which was channeled in a drainage system separate from the sanitary and industrial waste systems.on june,the city council enacted two ordinances to fund and maintain the compliance program.these measures,ordinance and,added former chapters and,respectively,to the salinas city code.former section allowed the city council to adopt a resolution imposing a storm water management utility fee to finance the improvement of storm and surface water management facilities.the fee would be imposed on users of the storm water drainage system.
on july,the city council adopted resolution,which established rates for the storm and surface water management system.the resolution specifically states there is hereby imposed on each and every developed parcel of land within the city,and the owners and occupiers thereof,jointly and severally,a storm drainage fee.the fee was to be paid annually to the city by the owner or occupier of each and every developed parcel in the city who shall be presumed to be the primary utility rate payer the amount of the fee was to be calculated according to the degree to which the property contributed runoff to the city drainage facilities.that contribution,in turn,would be measured by the amount of impervious area on that parcel.
undeveloped that had not been altered from their natural not subject to the storm drainage fee.in addition,developed parcels that maintained their own storm water management facilities or only partially contributed storm or surface water to the city storm drainage facilities were required to pay in proportion to the amount they did contribute runoff or used the city treatment services.
on september,plaintiffs filed a complaint under code of civil procedure section to determine the validity of the fee plaintiffs alleged that this was a fee that violated article xiii d,section,subdivision c,of the california constitution because it had not been approved by a majority vote of the affected property owners or a vote of the residents in the affected area.the trial court,however,found this provision to be inapplicable on two grounds the fee was not property related and it was exempt from the requirement because it was related to sewer and water services.
discussion 
article xiii d was added to the california constitution in the november election with the passage of proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.section of article xiii d requires notice of a proposed fee or charge and a public hearing.if a majority of the affected owners submit written protests,the fee may not be imposed,subd.a.the provision at issue is section,subdivision c hereafter section c,which states,in relevant part except for fees or charges for sewer,water,and refuse collection services,no property related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased unless and until that fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.
section defines a fee under this article as a levy imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service,subd.e.a service is a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership,subd.h.the city maintains that the storm drainage fee is not a fee,but a user fee which the property owner can avoid simply by maintaining a storm water management facility on the property.because it is possible to own property without being subject to the fee,the city argues this is not a fee imposed as an incident of property ownership or for a property related service within the meaning of section.
we can not agree with the city position.resolution plainly established a fee for a service,the management of storm water runoff from the impervious areas of each parcel in the city.the resolution expressly stated that each owner and occupier of a developed lot or parcel of real property within the city,is served by the city storm drainage facilities and burdens the system to a greater extent than if the property were undeveloped.those owners and occupiers of developed property should therefore pay for the improvement,operation and maintenance of such facilities.accordingly,the resolution makes the fee applicable to each and every developed parcel of land within the city.italics added.this is not a charge directly based on or measured by use,comparable to the metered use of water or the operation of a business,as the city suggests.see apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,d,article xiii d inapplicable to inspection fee imposed on private landlords howard jarvis taxpayers city of los angeles th,d,water usage rates are not within the scope of article xiii d.
the proportional reduction clause on which the city relies does not alter the nature of the fee as property related a property owner operation of a private storm drain system reduces the amount owed to the city to the extent that runoff into the city system is reduced.the fee nonetheless is a fee for a public service having a direct relationship to the ownership of developed property.the city characterization of the proportional reduction as a simple arrangement is misleading,as it suggests the property owner can avoid the fee altogether by declining the service.furthermore,the reduction is not proportional to the amount of services requested or used by the occupant,but on the physical properties of the parcel.thus,a parcel with a large impervious area driveway,patio,roof would be charged more than one consisting of mostly soil.residences are assumed to contain,on average,a certain amount of impervious area and are charged based on that assumption.

exception for sewer or water service 
as an alternative ground for its decision,the trial court found that the storm drainage fee was clearly a fee related to sewer and water services.the exception in section c applies to fees for sewer,water,and refuse collection services.thus,the question we must next address is whether the storm drainage fee was a charge for sewer service or water service.
the parties diverge in their views as to whether the reach of california constitution,article xiii d,section c extends to a storm drainage system as well as a sanitary or industrial waste sewer system.the city urg
