petitioners consolidated edison coned and other pipeline customers of transcontinental gas pipeline corporation transco ask this court to vacate three orders issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission,involving transco proposed rate change for several of its expansion projects.petitioners contend that the policy standards used by ferc to evaluate transco proposal violate the administrative procedure act apa.
reversing a decision by an administrative law judge alj,ferc approved transco proposal to shift from incremental pricing to rates based on standards enunciated in a policy statement.transcon.gas pipe line,wl,transco i,reprinted in joint appendix.after petitioners filed requests for rehearing on this matter,ferc issued a new policy statement for future rate change proposals.however,in addressing the petition for rehearing,the commission again evaluated transco proposal pursuant to the policy statement and ultimately upheld its initial ruling to approve the rate change.transcon.gas pipeline,wl,transco ii,reprinted in.subsequently,in response to a second petition for rehearing,ferc rejected objections to its reliance on the policy statement.order denying rehearing,transcon.gas pipe line,wl june,transco iii,reprinted in.
petitioners argue that the disputed orders are unreasonable,because they rely upon the policy statement rather than the policy statement.petitioners contend that ferc was obliged to apply the more recent policy statement,because it was issued while the transco case was still pending.we disagree.
the application of a newly adopted policy statement to a pending case is not presumed unless the policy change has the force of law.when an agency issues a policy statement that is not binding and merely signals how the agency may handle future cases,there is no legal principle that mandates retroactive application of the new policy statement to pending cases.retroactive application to pending cases may be permissible,but it is not required.an agency may decide to apply a policy to resolve a pending case,so long as that policy is not otherwise arbitrary and the agency provides a reasoned explanation for its decision.
on the record before us,we hold that ferc did not act unlawfully in applying its policy statement when it resolved transco proposal to implement rates.we further hold that the policy statement is not unreasonable,either facially or as applied in this case.finally,we hold that ferc sufficiently explained its reasons for relying on the policy statement rather than the policy statement to evaluate the rate change proposal.we reject petitioners arguments to the contrary.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
background 
regulatory framework 
under the natural gas act nga,ferc has jurisdiction to approve the construction of natural gas pipeline facilities and to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,et.any pipeline seeking to build or to expand its facilities must first apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity from ferc.after notice and hearing,ferc may authorize or certificate any pipeline project that the agency determines is necessary or desirable in the public interest.id.
the nga requires that all rates and charges by pipelines must be just and reasonable.id.a.rate cases before ferc are reviewed under either section or section of the nga 
t his court has strictly policed the statutory line that separates action taken under nga section from that taken under nga section.in algonquin,we described this distinction as follows 
t he commission may act under two different sections of the natural gas act nga or the act to effect a change in a gas company rates.when the commission reviews rate increases that a gas company has proposed,it is subject to the requirements of section e of the act.under section e,the gas company bears the burden of proving that its proposed rates are reasonable.on the other hand,when the commission seeks to impose its own rate determinations,rather than accepting or rejecting a change proposed by the gas company,it must do so in compliance with section a of the nga.
under section,the commission must first establish that the proposed or existing rate is unjust and unreasonable.it is only after this antecedent showing has been made that the commission properly can illustrate that its alternative rate proposal is both just and reasonable.

generally,a pipeline can allocate the costs associated with new or expanded facilities in one of two ways.the pipeline may roll in these costs,by distributing additional charges among all customers of the pipeline system.this pricing approach recognizes that the pipeline is not just a collection of discrete pieces and parts,but an integrated system serving all of its customers.battle creek gas fed.power comm n.the alternative to rates is incremental pricing 
whatever its virtues,use of a approach alone is not adequate in all situations,particularly where some assets are used by the utility solely for the benefit of one customer.at some point in every gas distribution facility the general system ends and connective links to the local distributors own equipment begins.at this point the facility becomes so identified with its function as a part of the local distributor gas plant that it may be unfair to charge its costs to all of the customers of the utility.this is particularly so where the extent and cost of such segregated facilities vary greatly among the customers.in such a situation the costs of these facilities are commonly charged as an incremental cost added in to the particular customer rate base.whether the cost of a particular facility is more properly treated as a systemic cost and to the rate base of all of the customers,or as a segregated cost to a particular customer,which should be treated on an incremental basis,is frequently a difficult issue of fact presented to the commission.

over time,ferc policy has moved away from routinely encouraging rates toward a preference for rate proposals that rely upon incremental pricing.see transcanada pipelines ferc.responding to this court directives to justify its evolving standard for evaluating rate allocation proposals,ferc adopted a policy statement discussing its revised approach.pricing policy for new and existing facilities constructed by interstate natural gas pipelines,wl,reh g denied,wl statement.the commission goals were to give the industry clear signals about which pricing approach would govern an expansion project and to avoid imposing rate shock on existing pipeline customers.statement,at.
ferc described two essential features of the policy statement 
first,the commission will make a determination of an appropriate rate design in a pipeline certificate proceeding.second,when the pipeline seeks pricing,the commission will base its pricing decision on an evaluation of the benefits of the project and the rate impact on existing customers.to reduce uncertainty,in those cases,the commission will establish a presumption for rates when the rate effect on existing customers is not substantial.
id.the commission indicated that a rate proposal was presumptively valid if the rate impact on existing customers was or less and the pipeline company also offered evidence of general systemwide benefits.id.at.
