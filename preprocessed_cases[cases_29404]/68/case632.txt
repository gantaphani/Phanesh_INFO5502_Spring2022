this appeal raises two central issues.first,should a refund of improperly collected sewer fees include interest we hold that it should.second,does the voluntary payment of such a refund,made without regard to any period of limitations defenses,equal a waiver of such defenses as to the payment of interest we hold that it does not.
introduction 
the city of los angeles city appeals from a judgment entered in favor of utility audit company,utility,in utility consolidated actions to recover interest on refunds paid voluntarily by the city.utility is the assignee of claims for sewer service fee refunds.the trial court granted summary judgment in the amount of approximately in favor of utility for unpaid interest on the refunds,finding that statutes of limitations and claims filing periods had either been waived or did not apply to bar any portion of the claims.we conclude that the city raised triable issues of fact regarding the application of the statute of limitations and claims filing periods and,accordingly,we reverse.
background 
beginning in,the city assessed sewer service charges against certain property owners who did not use the city sewer system,but rather used septic tanks or only used los angeles county county services.some owners used the sewer facilities of the county,but they used city sewer lines to transport sewage to county treatment facilities.although the city policy was to charge percent of its standard sewer fee for transport,certain of these property owners were charged the full amount for sewer service by the city,in addition to the county fee.
the problem received attention at the state and local levels.the legislature enacted section of the government code,which requires that local agencies refund any sewer service fees collected for which no services were delivered,subd.a.the statute also provides w here a person paid fees and is still residing at the same location,it shall be the responsibility of the local agency,upon determination that the premises is not connected to the sewer system,to return fees in their entirety,regardless of the amount of time the fees were wrongly collected,subd.c.section,subdivision e states that no statute of limitations shall apply to claims for fees paid before january.for fees paid on or after january,claims shall be filed within days of the date of payment.the statute does not address the question of whether interest must be paid on the returned funds.
locally,the city approved a series of measures.in,the city adopted a policy of crediting the utility bills of customers who were overcharged for the use of city sewer lines to transport sewage to county treatment facilities without regard for any limitations period.in,the city adopted a policy that provided for cash refunds to customers and waived the claim period for claimants who received no city sewer services.both policies limited the amount of any refund to actual overpayments made,without interest.
procedural and factual summary 
in january,utility filed an action seeking interest on certain sewer fee refunds made by the city.utility audit company,city of los angeles super.county,no.bc.it subsequently filed a first amended complaint fac for declaratory relief and for recovery of interest on money had and received.the fac alleges liability based upon civil code section,subdivision a,health and safety code section,and the united states constitution.
the fac alleges the following.twenty parties assigned their causes of action to utility for collection.utility submitted claims to the city for refund and interest thereon,for overcharged sewer service charges.the claims were submitted on various dates between and,and the city rejected the claims as to interest on various dates in and.
the city answered the fac.it admitted that it denied interest on the sewer fee refunds to all of the entities in question.it also admitted that it inadvertently and mistakenly collected sewer fees from some residents in the los angeles area since,and that city paid the refunds.the city asserted affirmative defenses,including that it is immune from claims for money had and received,that section of the civil code does not provide for interest under these circumstances,that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations,that the fees are not taxes and therefore not subject to interest,and that utility failed to comply with claims presentation requirements.
utility filed a motion for summary judgment.in july,before the motion was heard,utility filed a second action seeking interest on sewer fee refunds on behalf of additional claimants utility audit company,city of los angeles super.county,no.bc.their claims were alleged to have been made in and.the city answered the complaint.the trial court determined that the two cases were related and consolidated them.the parties filed supplemental motion papers dealing with the added claimants.
utility submitted papers in support of its motion that tend to show the following.claimants are individuals who were billed and paid full sewer service charges even though some of them were not connected to the city sewer system and others received only transport by the city sewer system.claimants assigned their claims to utility.the city determined that it would refund the overpayments of customers with no sewer service,consistent with section of the government code,and credit the accounts of the customers who received transport to a county sewage facility.
in,some of the claimants appealed the city decision,seeking full refunds without application of any limitations period and interest.the city adopted a new policy in may,and made full refunds without regard to any limitations period.it continued to deny interest.
utility urged that a claim for money had and received is proper against a city,that civil code section,subdivision a,health and safety code section,and the united states and california constitutions obligate the city to pay interest on the overcharges at percent per annum,that the statute of limitations was tolled during the administrative process,and that no facts support the city defense based upon the tort claims act.
the city opposed the motion.it stated that triable issues of material fact exist with regard to the timing of the claims and limitations on potential recoveries.it argued that claims and limitations periods bar the interest payments,that the city has no authority or duty to pay interest on sewer fee refunds,and that utility interest calculation was incorrect.
the trial court granted utility motion for summary judgment,and entered judgment in the amount of,an amount agreed to by the parties as an accurate calculation assuming a percent interest rate on the full refunds without regard for claims filing or limitations periods this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a plaintiff has met its burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.once the plaintiff has met that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.on appeal from the granting of a motion for summary judgment,we review the ruling de novo.kline turner th,d.we exercise our independent judgment on questions of law.austin board of retirement d.
ii.bases for liability 
civil code section 
under civil code section a,interest may generally be recovered against anyone,including governmental entities,for damages capable of being ascertained on a date certain 
relying upon weber board of retirement th,d weber,the city contends that civil code section does not authorize interest on the sewer service fee refunds.in that case,the court cited american federation of labor unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal th,d,for the proposition that employees are not entitled to interest on the lump sum portion of their disability benefits awarded to them by a county board of retirement because there has been no potential wrongful withholding of benefits until the board determines that the claimant is eligible for benefits.weber,at,d.in currie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,currie,however,our supreme court held that prejudgment interest is required under section of the civil code where the workers compensation appeals board awards reinstatement and backpay for discrimination.it distinguished weber and on the ground that the plaintiffs in those cases were seeking interest to make up for delay inherent in an administrative process,while the currie plaintiff was seeking interest to make up for the lost use of wages wrongfully withheld.currie,at,d.in the present case,utility is not seeking interest to account for delay inherent in the administrative process,but rather to make up for the loss of use of their funds.we conclude that section of the civil code authorizes the recovery of interest on the refund amounts.
constitutional taking 
the city contends that mistakenly assessing and collecting sewer service fees do not constitute a constitutional taking.we agree.utility provides no authority for its position that an inadvertent overcharge converts a lawful service fee to a constitutional taking.
the city contends that the sewer fees at issue are user fees,not taxes or special assessments,and therefore are not subject to interest.we agree with the first part of that contention,but not the second.user fees are amounts charged to a person using a service where the amount of the charge is generally related to the value of the services provided.isaac city of los angeles th,d.as a general matter,sewer service fees are user fees.that overcharges were made in some instances does not change their characterization to that of a tax.
the city also challenges utility position that revenue and taxation code provisions for payment of interest on tax refunds are made applicable to sewer service fees by section of the health and safety code.section of the health and safety code grants local entities power to prescribe and collect fees for sewer services.section grants them the power to have such charges collected on the tax roll.section provides all laws applicable to the levy,collection and enforcement of general taxes of the entity,including,but not limited to,those pertaining to the matters of delinquency,correction,cancellation,refund and redemption,are applicable to such charges emphasis added.the charges referred to are sewer service charges collected on the tax roll,not sewer service fees generally.
money had and received 
in california,all government tort liability must be based upon statute,county of los angeles superior court th,d.the city contends that recovery under a theory of money had and received is not available because the common count is not a statutory basis for liability.section of the government code allows for liability based upon contract or the right to obtain relief other than money or damages against a public entity.section of the government code provides that a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person,subd.a.
as witkin states in his text,a common count is proper whenever the plaintiff claims a sum of money due,either as an indebtedness in a sum certain,or for the reasonable value of services,goods,furnished.it makes no difference in such a case that the proof shows the original transaction to be an express contract,a contract implied in fact,or a.citation.kawasho,lakewood pipe service,d.a claim for money had and received can be based upon money paid by mistake,money paid pursuant to a void contract,or a performance by one party of an express contract.see schultz harney th,d kawasho,lakewood pipe service,supra,d at.whether an action is based on contract or tort depends upon the nature of the right sued upon,not the form of the pleading or relief demanded.if based on breach of promise it is contractual if based on breach of a noncontractual duty it is tortious.citation.if unclear the action will be considered based on contract rather than tort.citation.roe state of california th,d.here,the county merely realleged the factual basis for utility declaratory relief claim that the city paid refunds to the claimants,but rejected their demands for interest.a claim for refund of overcharges,without more,appears to be based upon breach of a contractual duty.in addition,utility provided statutory basis for the recovery,civil code section.the city has not shown that the claim is barred by governmental tort immunity.
government code section 
the city contends that because government code section does not expressly provide for the payment of interest,it has no statutory duty to pay interest on the sewer fee refunds.we disagree.currie addresses this point.it holds that the lack of express authorization for interest in a statute that provides for an award does not prevent the recovery of interest on the award under section of the civil code.it reasoned that such a statute did not expressly or impliedly preclude the award of interest and that the provision would be redundant where the legislature has provided for interest under section of the civil code.currie,supra,cal th at,d.we hold that an award of interest is consistent with the intent of government code section,to refund wrongfully assessed sewer service fees,and section of the civil code supports the award of interest.
iii.claims filing and limitations periods 
many of the city contentions concern whether utility recovery of interest on behalf of the claimants is barred by applicable limitations or claims filing periods.utility urges that the city waived these points by refunding the overcharges in full without asserting their provisions.
waiver requires an existing right,benefit,or advantage,actual or constructive knowledge of the right existence,and either an actual intention to relinquish it or conduct so inconsistent with any intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that it has been relinquished.in re marriage of paboojian d.rubin los angeles fed.sav.loan d.the waiver of a legal right can not be established without a clear showing of intent to give up such right.pacific valley bank schwenke d.the burden is on the party claiming the waiver to prove it by clear and convincing evidence that does not leave the matter doubtful or uncertain citation.ibid.
in the present case,the city was aware of the limitations and claims filing periods,and intentionally declined to apply them to the payment of refunds.a memo from the chair of thecity environmental quality and waste management committee states this legislation section of the government code did limit the refunds to of charges for those claims filed after january.however,because these residences and businesses did not receive any sewer services from the city,a full refund,without consideration of the claim deadline,seems consistent with the state statutory mandate that local agencies refund any sewer service fees collected for which no services were delivered.the same memo reports,on november,a council action nullified all statutes of limitations on refunds for customers whose sewage is treated at the carson county sewer treatment plant,but who paid the full rate sewer service charge.
the city refusal to pay interest was made on grounds other than application of any limitations period.it did not believe it was legally required to pay interest.a report to the city council from the budget and finance committee in states the city prefers to improve its claim processing rather than pay penalties interest which would involve additional administrative staff and expense.inasmuch as the city does not charge interest on overdue ssc bills,the city administrative officer believes it is not necessary to pay interest on overpayments by customers.a memo from the chair of the city environmental quality and waste management committee to the city council,also in,states since interest is mentioned neither in government code section for residences and businesses with septic tanks nor in the council action for county sanitation district customers,including interest in refunds is outside the intent of both.furthermore,governm
