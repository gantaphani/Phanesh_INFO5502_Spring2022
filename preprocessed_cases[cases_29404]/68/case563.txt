plaintiff mary jane galbiso galbiso appeals from a judgment entered in favor of defendant orosi public utility district opud after the trial court sustained opud demurrer to galbiso complaint without leave to amend.galbiso complaint sought a preliminary injunction to prevent opud from conducting a tax sale of her two parcels for the collection of sewer assessments,and a writ of mandate to correct opud alleged abuse of discretion in refusing to grant her request for a reassessment.the trial court concluded,among other things,that the complaint failed to allege a sufficient legal or factual basis to enjoin the tax sale or require a reassessment of galbiso parcels.on appeal,galbiso contends her complaint adequately alleged one or more of her claims for relief and,in any event,leave to amend should have been allowed.we disagree and affirm the judgment 
facts and procedural history 
this case is the latest in a series of legal battles between opud and galbiso concerning the sewer assessments imposed by opud against galbiso real property and the efforts undertaken by opud to enforce those assessments.as background to the present case,we begin with a brief synopsis of the parties previous appeals in this court.
a.the two prior appeals 
first foreclosure action 
in orosi public utility dist.galbiso,nonpub.unpub.lexis opud galbiso,opud initiated a judicial foreclosure action to recover unpaid sewer assessments owed by galbiso.at the time of trial,the case was expanded to include a number of issues submitted by the parties for declaratory relief.opud prevailed in the trial court,galbiso appealed,and we reversed the judgment in part.
as outlined in our nonpublished opinion in opud galbiso,supra,the underlying facts of that case included the following in,opud formed a special assessment district,known as the orosi sewer improvement district,to make improvements to its sewer system to be paid for by special assessments against property owners whose parcels would benefit from the improvements.a notice of assessment was recorded against the affected parcels in july of.galbiso was the owner of two parcels of undeveloped land,referred to as parcels and,located within the geographic boundaries of opud.she purchased parcel in and parcel in.galbiso first learned of the special assessments shortly before completing her purchase of parcel in.she proceeded with the purchase,despite her awareness of the assessment,in hopes that the assessment issue would be worked out in a satisfactory way between her and the opud board.opud galbiso,supra,at pp.
galbiso believed the special assessments imposed against her properties were unreasonable,unfair unenforceable because they were based on a previous owner abandoned proposal to build a residential complex needing sewer hookups,galbiso would use parcels and for organic farming and she needed only one or two sewer hookups,not,and although opud charged galbiso for sewer hookups,it could not actually provide sewer treatment capacity for that many residential units.although efforts were made by both sides to resolve the matter through a deferral agreement or other compromise,opud ultimately took the position that galbiso land received the benefit of the sewer improvements,she knew about the assessments when she purchased the parcels,and she must pay the sums assessed.opud galbiso,supra,at pp.
in,opud filed its complaint to judicially foreclose and sell parcels and for nonpayment of special sewer assessments,which case was numbered as tulare county superior court case.the remedy of judicial foreclosure was sought by opud in its complaint pursuant to section of the streets and highways code which section is a part of the improvement bond act of et.the assessment had been initiated under a distinct statutory scheme known as the municipal improvement act of et hereafter the act.at the time of trial,both parties requested that the complaint be deemed to state a claim for declaratory relief on certain issues related to the assessments.the trial court granted that request.after completion of the trial,the trial court resolved all of the submitted issues in opud favor,including that galbiso property received a proportional benefit from the sewer improvements that no reassessment by opud was required based on changed circumstances and that opud was entitled to bring an action to foreclose under section.a judgment granting foreclosure and determining the submitted issues was entered,and galbiso appealed.opud galbiso,supra,at pp.
on appeal from the judgment,we concluded that the trial court had no authority to grant judicial foreclosure under section,since that section was inapplicable to the assessment proceedings involved in that case.in particular,we found that section did not apply because no bond proceedings were initiated under the improvement bond act of,of which section was a part.opud galbiso,supra,at pp.accordingly,the portion of the judgment that had granted judicial foreclosure was reversed.in so holding,we noted that the remedy authorized by the applicable statutory scheme,the act was a tax sale,not judicial foreclosure.opud galbiso,supra,at.we affirmed the balance of the judgment,including the trial court determination of issues submitted for declaratory relief.id.at pp.in regard to those issues,we explained,among other things,that galbiso challenge to the validity of the original assessment was barred by the statute of limitations,and that opud was not required to reassess her property or take other corrective action based on changed circumstances or equitable considerations,although opud had discretion to do so.id.at pp.fn.
we commented in passing that opud could have reassessed galbiso parcels,it was not barred from doing so,as it previously believed,and opud presumably had discretion to proceed with a tax sale under the applicable assessment statute.opud galbiso,supra,at pp,fn.
second to enforce brown act and public records act 
the second appeal arising out of the parties ongoing controversy was galbiso orosi public utility dist.th.in that case,which was commenced in tulare county superior court as case,galbiso brought suit to prevent opud from proceeding with a tax sale of parcels and.she alleged,among other things,that opud board of directors resolution approving the tax sale was invalid under the ralph brown act,et hereafter the brown act,and that opud had also violated the california public records act,et hereafter the public records act.galbiso additionally sought to quiet title or to obtain declaratory relief relating to parcels and on the ground that the assessment,or the lien securing the assessment,was invalid.
prior to trial,the parties settled.opud agreed that it would not take any action to commence or to proceed with a tax sale of galbiso parcels until after the conclusion of the appeal in the foreclosure action,the first above,and that it opud would refrain from specified conduct that galbiso complaint alleged was in violation of the brown act and the public records act.in exchange,galbiso agreed to dismiss her lawsuit with prejudice.as part of the settlement,the parties reserved the issue of statutory attorney fees under the brown act and the public records act for determination by the trial court in a subsequent hearing.thereafter,when the trial court denied her motion for recovery of statutory attorney fees,galbiso appealed.galbiso orosi public utility,supra,th at.in that published opinion,we reversed the trial court order denying attorney fees under the brown act and the public records act and remanded the case to the trial court.galbiso orosi public utility,supra,at.
b.the present case 
in november of,in a somewhat remarkable turn of events,galbiso was elected to the opud board of directors.her election,however,did not awaken a spirit of greater cooperation or compromise between the parties.if anything,as reflected by subsequent developments,the parties positions regarding the assessments on parcels and had become even more entrenched.
on november,our opinion in the first appeal,opud galbiso,supra,was issued.as discussed above,in that opinion we reversed the portion of the judgment that granted judicial foreclosure.we also briefly noted,in passing,that opud could have reassessed galbiso parcels,a legal basis existed for doing so,and that opud presumably had discretion to proceed with a tax sale under the applicable assessment statute.id.at pp,fn.in the months that followed our opinion in opud galbiso,galbiso offered a particular formula for reassessment of her parcels in connection with a global settlement proposal to opud,while opud,after considering and rejecting galbiso proposal,pursued a tax sale.specifically,in may of,galbiso made a written request to opud that it reassess parcels and according to their agricultural use.that request was summarily denied and,instead of approving the proposed reassessment,a majority of opud board of directors voted on may,in resolution to hold a tax sale of galbiso parcels to collect the delinquent assessments.the tax sale was noticed for july.
galbiso filed her complaint in the present case on june.the complaint,filed as tulare county superior court case no,included several causes of action for injunctive relief to prevent the tax sale from going forward.on june,the trial court issued a temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo until a hearing could be held on galbiso request for a preliminary injunction.on august,the trial court denied the requested injunctive relief.thus,opud was allowed to proceed with the tax sale on august,as scheduled.galbiso paid the delinquent assessments due on one parcel before the tax sale,and she paid the delinquent assessments due on the other parcel shortly after the tax sale.she therefore was able to keep or redeem both parcels.
opud then filed a general demurrer to galbiso complaint.the complaint had alleged the following purported claims for relief enjoin tax sale the statutory time limit for a tax sale allegedly expired enjoin tax sale opud allegedly made a binding election to pursue other remedies nullification of tax sale opud allegedly did not comply with brown act declaratory relief opud brown act violation allegedly necessitated declaratory relief petition for writ of mandate opud decision to conduct tax sale beyond the statutory time limit was allegedly an abuse of discretion and petition for writ of mandate opud rejection of galbiso request for reassessment was allegedly an abuse of discretion.on august,the trial court sustained opud demurrer to the entire complaint without leave to amend.a judgment of dismissal was entered on september.galbiso timely notice of appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
ii.the trial court correctly sustained general demurrer to complaint for injunctive relief 
causes of action premised on section 
galbiso first cause of action for injunctive relief alleged that opud had no authority to conduct the tax sale because that remedy was under the provisions of section.she also alleged the same claim as a distinct ground for a writ of mandate,but we treat that as in essence the same cause of action.the trial court sustained opud demurrer to the cause of action,holding that section is not a statute of limitations for conducting a tax sale but is only directory.galbiso contends the trial court erred in its construction of the statute.we disagree.
section provides as follows the tax collector shall fix a time and place for the sale of various parcels of land upon which the assessments are unpaid,which date shall be not less than days nor more than six months after the date of the recordation of the diagram and assessment.italics added.according to the allegations of the complaint and attachments thereto,the recordation of opud diagram and assessment occurred in july of.assuming the date of recordation is correct,it is clear that the tax sale in the present case was beyond the time period indicated in the statute.galbiso argues that section is mandatory and jurisdictional,and thus the time period must be construed as a statute of limitation.opud counters that the time requirement in section is merely directory,and therefore opud still had authority to hold a tax sale after the period expired.we believe that opud is correct,as we now explain.
as a preliminary matter,it is necessary to provide a greater elaboration of the distinction,which must not be confused with the distinction between mandatory and permissive provisions in a statute.the two dichotomies are not the same,as our supreme court explained at length in the case of people mcgee cal d,as follows in determining the proper effect to be given this statutory language,we undertake at the outset to clarify some confusion in terminology that has frequently inhibited analysis of similar questions of statutory interpretation in the past.traditionally,the question of whether a public official failure to comply with a statutory procedure should have the effect of invalidating a subsequent governmental action has been characterized as a question of whether the statute should be accorded mandatory or directory effect.if the failure is determined to have an invalidating effect,the statute is said to be mandatory if the failure is determined not to invalidate subsequent action,the statute is said to be directory.as we explain below,in evaluating whether a provision is to be accorded mandatory or directory effect,courts look to the purpose of the procedural requirement to determine whether invalidation is necessary to promote the statutory design.
although the parties to this action have utilized the terminology in their briefs,both parties,sharing the confusion exhibited in some past judicial decisions,have improperly equated the duality with the linguistically similar,but analytically distinct,dichotomy.as we explained recently in morris county of marin cal d,in the latter context the term mandatory refers to an obligatory procedure which a governmental entity is required to follow as opposed to a permissive procedure which a governmental entity may follow or not as it chooses.by contrast,the directory or mandatory designation does not refer to whether a particular statutory requirement is permissive or obligatory,but instead simply denotes whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.citations.citation.although the and dichotomies are thus analytically distinct,in some instances there is an obvious relationship between the two.if,for example,a statute simply embodies a permissive procedure with which a governmental entity may or may not comply as it chooses,the entity failure to comply will generally not invalidate the entity subsequent action.the converse of this proposition is not always true,however,for as we observed in morris,m any statutory provisions which are mandatory in the obligatory sense are accorded only directory effect.citation.people mcgee,supra,cal d at see also woods department of motor vehicles d.
in addressing the issue of whether the time requirement set forth in section is directory,we follow established rules of statutory construction.in order to determine whether a particular statutory provision is mandatory or directory,the court,as in all cases of statutory construction and interpretation,must ascertain the legislative intent.in the absence of express language,the intent must be gathered from the terms of the statute construed as a whole,from the nature and character of the act to be done,and from the consequences which would follow the doing or failure to do the particular act at the required time.citation.when the object is to subserve some public purpose,the provision may be held directory or mandatory as will best accomplish that purpose citation morris.county of marin cal d,fn.omitted.
here,neither party has directed our attention to any legislative history or materials regarding section that might shed further light on the legislative purpose for the period therein,and our own search has not uncovered that information.nonetheless,the purpose of the time limitation set forth in section is reasonably apparent when that section is considered in light of the act as a whole,of which section is a part.
the act is plainly a statutory mechanism to finance,build and maintain municipal improvements,including provisions for creation of assessment districts,levying of assessments on properties that are specially benefited by the works of improvement,and collection of the sums levied.see.by its own terms,the entire act is to be liberally construed in order to effectuate its purposes.the section providing for liberal construction adds that n o error,irregularity,informality in any procedure taken under this division,which does not directly affect the jurisdiction of the legislative body to order the work or improvement,shall avoid or invalidate such proceeding or any assessment for the cost of work done thereunder.ibid.
procedures for collecting assessments are set forth in chapter of the act.in the event of a delinquency,unpaid assessments are collected by means of a tax sale process that is provided for in sections through.in addition,if bonds are issued under the improvement bond act of or the improvement act of,additional enforcement remedies may be available under the provisions of those other enactments.see.thus,the primary enforcement mechanism if bonds are not issued,as was the case here,is the tax sale process.
one of the salient features of the act is that assessments may be collected up front,prior to commencement of the work of improvement.schuetram granada sanitary dist.cal.app d,under the act,assessments may be collected before the work is performed,unlike the system under the improvement act of.provision is made in the act for prompt collection of assessments by the tax collector once the approved assessment and diagram have been transmitted to,and duly recorded by,the tax collector.a notice of recordation is then provided to the property owner specifying the amount due under the assessment and the consequences of failure to pay within days.after this period expires,section directs the tax collector to fix a time and place for a tax sale,which date shall be not less than days nor more than six months after the date of the recordation of the diagram and assessment.
the rationale for the prompt collection process is clearly the need to provide a source of funds to begin the work of improvement.the monies collected by the assessment are placed in a special fund out of which the costs of the improvement are to be paid.bonds may also be sold to finance the improvement,but a sale of bonds is not required.if the first assessment and any sale of bonds are insufficient to raise funds to pay the cost of the improvement,a supplemental assessment may be levied.
as this brief summary of the act reflects,the provision in section is simply to ensure that the tax collector takes action to collect the assessments in a reasonably prompt fashion so that the needed improvement will be timely financed.that is,the statute provides for a prompt collection of assessments up front so that there will be funds immediately available for the improvement project,since it is not a foregone conclusion under the act that any bonds will be issued.where no bonds are issued,and no other funding source is available,prompt collection of the assessment is the only way forward.
however,there is no indication in the act that the time requirement set forth in section is mandatory or jurisdictional.that is,it does not appear to constitute a statute of limitation or a jurisdictional barrier to utilizing the tax sale process.as helpfully summarized in woods department of motor vehicles,supra,d at page,such time requirements are generally construed as directory unless a contrary intention appears significantly our supreme court has held that generally,requirements relating to the time within which an act must be done are directory rather than mandatory or jurisdictional,unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.citations.in ascertaining probable intent,california courts have expressed a variety of tests.in some cases focus has been directed at the likely consequences of holding a particular time limitation mandatory,in an attempt to ascertain whether those consequences would defeat or promote the purpose of the enactment.citations.other cases have suggested that a time limitation is deemed merely directory unless a consequence or penalty is provided for failure to do the act within the time commanded.citations.
here,we observe that section contains no penalty for failure to comply with the time requirements,unlike most statutes of limitation.an apt comparison may be made to section,which does set forth a statute of limitation for challenges to the validity of an assessment.that section expressly provides that the validity of an assessment shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the time limitation set forth therein is met.thus,consequences of failure to meet the stated deadline were built into section,a statute of limitation,but that is not the case in section.
additionally,to interpret section as a strict statute of limitation would impede the purposes of the act.the act allows for alternative means of payment and flexibility in regard to collection.for example,payments of assessments may be deferred when bonds are issued,may be payable in installments,or may be postponed by a deferral agreement.see.in such circumstances,property owners might become delinquent long after the expiration of the initial period.we think it would be unreasonable to hold that the legislature,by enacting section,intended that in such cases the public entity would forfeit any and all rights to pursue a tax sale.for all of these reasons,we conclude that section is directory.see cake city of los angeles cal,time period for completing assessment under the street opening act of was directory.therefore,opud did not lose its right to pursue a tax sale in this case after the expiration of the statute period.the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer to the causes of action premised on section without leave to amend.
cause of action based on election of remedies 
the second cause of action sought to enjoin the tax sale on the ground that opud previously made a binding election of remedies to obtain a judicial foreclosure.the doctrine of election of remedies is clearly inapplicable here,for several reasons.first,a party should be entitled to change alternative remedies until satisfaction of judgment,or application of res judicata or estoppel,vindicates one of the inconsistent rights.southern christian leadership conference al malaikah auditorium d.here,opud obtained a foreclosure judgment that was ultimately reversed on appeal.since opud never realized the benefit of that judgment,and the judgment was set aside,it should be able to pursue other remedies.second,opud decision to pursue judicial foreclosure was mistaken,since its real remedy under the applicable statute was a tax sale.now that opud initial mistake of remedies has been corrected,it is not barred from pursuing its actual remedy.if the plaintiff was mistaken and undertook to avail himself of a remedy that he was never entitled to,this does not prevent him from subsequently availing himself of a remedy that he is entitled to under the facts of the case.citations.waters woods d.finally,even if both remedies had been available at the same time,galbiso has failed to show that the two were inconsistent,rather than simply alternative or cumulative remedies.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.for all of these reasons,the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action without leave to amend.
causes of action premised on brown act violation 
in the third cause of action of her complaint,galbiso sought to enjoin the tax sale of parcels and on the ground that opud resolution to pursue that remedy was invalid.allegedly,opud decision to proceed with a tax sale violated section of the brown act,which section provides,among other things.that a ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public,subd.a.as recourse for the alleged violation,the third cause of action requested the trial court to nullify opud resolution approving the tax sale per,subd.a,and on that basis to enjoin the tax sale.
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action on the grounds of lack of standing to sue,and failure to state facts constituting a violation of the brown act.we first address the issue of standing.in a nutshell,when a person becomes a member of a governing body of a public entity,that person forfeits standing as a to sue that public entity.holbrook city of santa monica th,carsten psychology examining com.cal d.although it is true that galbiso lacked standing as a member of the general public to sue opud for brown act violations,since she served on its board of directors,we do not believe that she asserted the third cause of action merely as a member of the general public.rather,she had a personal stake in the outcome of the relief sought specifically,whether the tax sale of her parcels would stand.that being the case,the demurrer to the third cause of action based on a lack of standing under the analysis of the above cases should have been overruled.see carsten psychology examining,supra,at exception to rule exists where member of board had personal interest in outcome of litigation.
we now turn to the issue of whether galbiso third cause of action stated facts sufficient to constitute a violation of the brown act.the only facts alleged in support thereof were that sometime before the public meeting was held to discuss the tax sale,attorneys for opud made public announcement s in the newspaper or elsewhere indicating that opud would be pursuing a tax sale or a foreclosure remedy.in light of these announcements,galbiso alleged that opud must have already decided to proceed with the tax sale in advance of the public meeting on that issue.her complaint makes no allegation that a secret meeting actually took place,but that is presumably what is being suggested in opposition filed in the trial court to opud demurrer,galbiso attorney acknowledged that the cause of action was premised on opud allegedly holding private meetings to decide the tax sale issue.
we agree with the position set forth in opud brief as respondent herein,that the comments made by its attorneys do not give rise to an inference that a secret meeting took place.one of the referenced comments was merely a statement in the fresno bee to the effect that opud probably will consider going forward with a tax sale.the other was made by opud attorney at a may,court hearing on whether galbiso was entitled to attorney fees under code of civil procedure section following her partly successful appeal in tulare county superior court case,the foreclosure action.opud attorney argued at that hearing that galbiso defense of the foreclosure action conferred no benefit on the public or anyone else since opud was still entitled to proceed with the tax sale,and he thought that opud was moving forward with that remedy 
these brief comments made by opud attorneys,when viewed in the context of the parties ongoing litigation,were insufficient as a matter of law to show the alleged brown act violation.we can not ignore the fact that opud previously resolved to use the tax sale remedy with respect to parcels and,but agreed to hold off until after the appeal of the foreclosure action was concluded.that agreement was part of the settlement reached in tulare county superior court case.galbiso orosi public utility,supra,th at prior resolution to use tax sale remedy,settlement terms summarized,including postponement of tax sale remedy.when we subsequently held in the foreclosure action that the applicable remedy under the act was a tax sale opud galbiso,supra,at since no bonds were issued,remedy was tax sale,not judicial foreclosure,it was not surprising that opud would thereafter resolve to move forward with that remedy.opud had consistently sought to collect the unpaid assessments levied against galbiso parcels.in such a context,the remarks by opud attorneys do not suggest that any wrongdoing occurred.if any inference may be drawn,it would be that opud attorneys merely stated what seemed to be the probable or inevitable outcome of the,that opud would press forward with the tax sale.in any event,we hold that the attorneys passing remarks did not constitute a sufficient factual basis for a claim that opud secretly met and decided the matter beforehand.since no other facts were set forth in the complaint to support the alleged brown act violation,we hold that galbiso failed to state a cause of action.
there is yet another reason the third cause of action was deficient.the cases have held that a violation of the brown act will not automatically invalidate an action taken by a local agency or legislative body.the facts must show,in addition,that there was prejudice caused by the alleged violation.cohan city of thousand oaks th,north pacifica llc california coastal com.th.even where a plaintiff has satisfied the threshold procedural requirements to set aside an agency action,brown act violations will not necessarily invalidate a decision.citation.appellants must show prejudice.citation.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th.here,no facts are alleged to show that galbiso was prejudiced in any way by the alleged violation.moreover,in light of the long history of this assessment dispute and litigation in which both parties were well aware of the other side position and arguments,no prejudice is apparent.
for all of the reasons noted above,galbiso failed to allege facts sufficient to state a brown act violation and the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action.galbiso failed to present any factual basis for leave to amend the third cause of action,as was her burden.smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th.we conclude that the trial court correctly denied leave to amend.
we now turn to the fourth cause of action,in which galbiso sought the following declaratory relief t hat when opud goes into closed session,and publicly announces its decision,the brown act requires opud to state what the decision or action was,the person who made the motion,the person who seconded the motion,and the persons who voted for and against the motion.the relief sought was prospective only and,unlike the third cause of action,galbiso had no personal interest at stake in the outcome.thus,the fourth cause of action was asserted by galbiso as an interested member of the public,a in order to ensure compliance with the brown act in future meetings.however,as an elected member of the opud board of directors,galbiso lacked standing to maintain such a cause of action.holbrook city of santa monica,supra,th at carsten psychology examining,supra,cal d at.moreover,the requested declaratory relief was unnecessary because a legislative body duties to publicly report any actions taken in closed session and the votes of each member are clearly spelled out in statute see,and substantially the same legal issue was raised and resolved as part of the settlement in tulare county superior court case see galbiso orosi public utility,supra,th at.we hold that the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.
iii.the trial court correctly sustained general demurrer to writ of mandate petition 
this brings us to the final claim for relief alleged in galbiso complaint namely,her petition for a writ of mandate based on opud refusal to grant her request for a reassessment of parcels and.allegedly,opud refusal to grant such a reassessment of her parcels constituted an abuse of discretion.the trial court sustained opud demurrer on the ground that although opud had discretion to grant a reassessment,it had no mandatory duty to do so.
in our nonpublished opinion in opud galbiso,supra,we noted that opud had discretionary power to grant a reassessment.id.at pp,fn.we stated that although the act does not have its own procedural mechanism for reassessment,section thereof has been construed to incorporate all the curative clauses and powers of reassessment provided under the improvement act of and the improvement bond act of harrison board of supervisors d,even if bonds have not been issued brenkwitz city of santa cruz d.opud galbiso,supra,at.we further explained this broad incorporation of reassessment powers would,we believe,necessarily include the reassessment provisions in the improvement act of as referenced in furey city of sacramento cal d,furey which give discretion to the legislative body to grant reassessments to relieve owners and allow such relief at any time before the assessments levied are fully paid and discharged.furey,supra,cal d at.opud galbiso,supra,at pp,fn.the parties do not challenge our conclusion that opud had discretion to authorize a reassessment of galbiso parcels.the sole question presented here is whether opud failure to grant galbiso reassessment proposal constituted an abuse of discretion.
as a preliminary matter,we agree with the trial court that traditional mandate under code of civil procedure section governs,rather than administrative mandate,because the proceeding before the opud board of directors was not one in which by law evidence was required to be taken code civ,subd.a,and because decisions to grant reassessments are predominantly in nature.see wilson hidden valley mun.water dist.d,traditional mandate applies as to acts,including a water district determination of a petition to remove lands from the water district gordon city of los angeles d,describing reassessment under improvement act of as discretionary legislative act.
a writ of mandate will lie to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station code civ,in cases where there is not a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law code civ.two basic requirements are essential to the issuance of the writ a clear,present and usually ministerial duty upon the part of the respondent citations and a clear,present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty citation.citation.people ex rel.younger county of el dorado cal d.
although mandate will not lie to control a public agency discretion,that is to say,force the exercise of discretion in a particular manner,it will lie to correct abuses of discretion.citation.in determining whether an agency has abused its discretion,the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency,and if reasonable minds may disagree as to the wisdom of the agency action,its determination must be upheld.citation.helena west contra costa unified school dist.th.the trial court inquiry in a traditional mandamus proceeding is limited to whether the local agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely without evidentiary support,and whether it failed to conform to procedures required by law.neighbors in support of appropriate land use county of tuolumne th.
here,while the complaint made reference to our holding that opud had discretion to approve a reassessment,it failed to allege any basis for a mandatory duty on the part of opud to grant galbiso particular reassessment request.the allegations stated as a mere conclusion that opud has abused its discretion in failing to grant galbiso request for reassessment of parcels and according to agricultural use,but no facts are alleged to support that claim in order to state a cause of action warranting judicial interference with the official acts of the administrative body the plaintiff must allege more than mere conclusions of law it must allege specific facts from which the conclusions entitling it to relief follow.california state psychological county of san diego d.galbiso did not do so here.in particular,her failure to allege a basis for a clear and present duty on the part of opud to grant her proposed reassessment request was fatal to her cause of action for a writ of mandate.code civ.the trial court correctly sustained opud demurrer to the writ of mandate cause of action.
moreover,since opud decision on whether to grant galbiso proposed resolution that opud approve particular terms of reassessment ante,fn.was one within opud discretion to make,and no legal basis was or is presented for concluding that opud was required,as a clear and present duty,to accept the particular terms proposed,no possibility for amendment existed for a claim against opud premised upon its rejection on may,of that proposed resolution.
iv.leave to amend 
galbiso contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint.to prove such abuse of discretion,however,the plaintiff must demonstrate how the complaint can be amended.smith state farm mutual automobile ins,supra,th at.while such a showing can be made for the first time to the reviewing court citation,it must be made.ibid.if there is a reasonable possibility that a plaintiff can amend his complaint to cure the defects,leave to amend must be granted.kong city of hawaiian gardens redevelopment agency th.
although specific grounds for amendment were not presented to the trial court,galbiso contends on appeal that under the same general set of operative facts,she could have stated a viable cause of action.in particular,she asserts that the enforcement of the special assessment against her parcels may be enjoined,that reassessment thereof may be required,on the basis of her purported due process and proposition claims.we now explore these contentions.
due process 
we begin with galbiso contention that she can successfully allege what she refers to as a due process claim.what she means by this is unclear,although a brief reference is made to the supreme court case of furey,supra,cal d.to place this matter in its proper context,it is important to recall that we previously addressed the issue of whether such a claim was tenable in our opinion in opud galbiso,supra,where it was contended by galbiso that reassessment or other relief was equitably constitutionally required,even after the initial statute of limitations for challenging the assessment expired,based on the furey case.see opud galbiso,supra,at pp.
in furey,the plaintiffs were property owners who sought relief because a land use ordinance that severely restricted use of their property meant that prior sewer improvements for which they paid assessments would no longer benefit their land.the supreme court held that under the circumstances alleged,in which subsequent government action,the land use ordinance rendered the prior sewer assessments constitutionally infirm,the benefit to the plaintiffs land of the assessed improvements could no longer be realized,appropriate relief would have to be granted to the property owners on equitable and constitutional grounds.furey,supra,cal d at.accordingly,the defendant public entity would either have to exempt the plaintiffs parcels from the new land use ordinance or,alternatively,grant a reassessment.id.at.acknowledging that reassessment was ordinarily discretionary,the supreme court also considered that a land use regulation may not be applied to one otherwise subject to it if to do so would result in a taking of property without just compensation.id.at.additionally,under the circumstances of that case,the supreme court held that the statute of limitations for challenging the original assessment could not be raised as a bar to the plaintiffs claims.id.at.
