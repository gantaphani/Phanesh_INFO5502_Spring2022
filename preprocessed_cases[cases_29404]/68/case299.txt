hacienda del cerezo,moss farms,energy concerned homeowners,and santa fe northwest advisory council intervenors appeal the dismissal of their complaint in intervention by the district court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse and remand.
this case involves a dispute among the parties stemming from the proposed construction of a powerline by the public service company of new mexico pnm through part of santa fe county.the powerline,which pnm states is necessary to improve power transmission in the santa fe area,is to be built aboveground and will cross indian,federal,and private lands.pnm began obtaining approvals for the powerline in the.
in december,the county of santa fe county filed suit in new mexico state court against pnm seeking to enjoin construction of the powerline.the county alleged that the powerline project was in violation of its land development code code because pnm had not obtained a required development permit and was not burying the powerline.after initially failing in an attempt to remove the case to federal court,pnm filed a complaint against the united states bureau of land management blm in the state court action.blm then removed the case to federal court.
live in the vicinity of the proposed initially moved to intervene on february,and were granted permission to intervene by the district court on january.on february,pursuant to a settlement agreement between them,both the county and pnm moved under federal rule of civil procedure a to dismiss with prejudice the county claims against pnm.despite intervenors objections,the district court granted the motion.the settlement agreement provided that pnm was not required to obtain a development permit from the county for its project and that an amendment to the code enacted in did not apply to the project.appellants app.at.
in february,intervenors filed their with the district court.intervenors complaint primarily sought injunctive relief against the powerline project as an anticipatory public nuisance,and a writ of mandamus requiring the county to enforce the code against the project in particular,the complaint alleged that the county settlement agreement lacks any basis in fact or law.id.at.pnm moved to dismiss intervenors complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in january,the district court heard argument on pnm motion and granted it in a ruling from the bench.intervenors now appeal the dismissal of their complaint they also appeal the district court approval of the county and pnm rule motion.

we first address the intervenors request for a writ of mandamus.under new mexico law,mandamus lies to compel the performance of an affirmative act by an official where the duty to perform the act is clearly enjoined by law and where there is no other plain,speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.lovato city of albuquerque.on appeal,the parties sole dispute is whether enforcement of the code by the county against pnm was clearly enjoined by law or was instead discretionary.
it is in new mexico that once a petitioner show s that there was a valid ordinance in existence and that it was being violated,the duty cast upon the local government bec omes ministerial and subject to enforcement by mandamus.state ex rel.edwards city of clovis,neither party on appeal argues that any relevant part of the code is invalid thus,we need only address whether pnm has violated or will violate the code through construction of its powerline.if pnm is in violation of the code,then the county has a duty to enforce the code against pnm,a duty that may be enforced through a writ of mandamus under new mexico law.
prior to,the santa fe code prescribed a development permit shall not be required for,and provisions of the code shall not apply to,utility easements,utility,and construction of utility line extensions.appellants app.at.in november,however,the county amended the language in the code that addressed utility lines.the new provisions require a development permit for all development including utilities,utility easements,utility,and construction of utility lines and facilities.id.at.the amendment also requires that a ll utility lines shall be placed underground unless an exemption is granted by the board of county commissioners.id.at.
intervenors argue that pnm project violates the code in one of two ways.if the project was begun before the amendment,then the project is in violation of the ordinance because pnm did not obtain a development permit and did not fully comply with other provisions of the code.alternatively,if the project was commenced after the enactment of the amendment,then the project is in violation of that amendment because pnm never obtained a development permit and the powerline will be built aboveground.a violation of either the code or the amendment to the code would be sufficient for intervenors mandamus claim to succeed.
as a prelude to the detailed analysis that follows,we provide a summary to aid the reader.because this case was resolved by the district court on a rule b motion,we must assume to be true the intervenors factual allegation that the settlement agreement between the county and pnm lacks any basis in fact or law to the extent that the parties agreed that the powerline project is not covered by the code.appellants app.at.
the first basis for intervenors mandamus allegation that pnm powerline project violated the code prior to the the court to interpret the meaning of the code.under new mexico law,in order to answer the question whether pnm project is in violation of the code,we must consider the prior history of enforcement and application of the code to similar projects.assuming intervenors allegations to be true,the prior history would show that the code applied to pnm project and that the county therefore had a duty to enforce the code against the project.thus,on a rule b motion,it was inappropriate for the district court to dismiss intervenors mandamus claim to the extent that the claim was based on the county failure to enforce the provisions of the code against pnm project.
the second basis for intervenors mandamus claim is an allegation that the project is in violation of the amendment to the code.intervenors argument can succeed only if on a belief that it did not need a permit from the never made significant expenditures on the project and had never begun actual construction of the powerline prior to the amendment of the code.intervenors must show the existence of this factual predicate in order to establish that the county had a ministerial duty to enforce the code.under new mexico law,mandamus would still be available to require the performance of a ministerial duty that depends on a showing of such a factual predicate.this is true even where a public official has previously concluded that the factual predicate did not exist and that therefore the ministerial duty was never the county did in this case by concluding that the amendment did not apply to the pnm project because construction of the powerline began prior to its enactment.in such a situation,the party seeking mandamus relief must show that there was no genuine factual basis for the official factual conclusions.at the rule b stage,intervenors need only allege that there was no genuine factual basis for the county conclusion that the code does not apply to the powerline project.because,again,intervenors made such an allegation in their complaint,dismissal on a rule b motion was improper.
according to pnm,the code language prior to provided it with a blanket exemption from any regulation by the county when it undertook construction within a utility or easement.thus,the powerline project could never have been in violation of any provision of the code.intervenors respond that the language of the code provision only applies to the utility or easement itself,and not to construction within the or easement see appellants br.at stating that the relevant provision does not apply to the construction of a main electricity transmission line.
we conclude that the language of the code is ambiguous,with neither explanation entirely convincing.pnm interpretation of the provision ignores the fact that the provision places construction next to utility line extensions alone,and not next to utility easements or that the exception only covers construction connected with utility line extensions and not construction connected with easements or.intervenors interpretation,on the other hand,would draw the scope of the exception very narrowly,applying only to the establishment of an easement or.
where the language of a local ordinance is ambiguous,new mexico courts will rely on prior administrative interpretations of the relevant ordinance or statute.the case of high ridge hinkle joint venture city of albuquerque,is instructive on this point.in high ridge,a landowner and the city disputed whether the term outside storage and activity in the zoning ordinance meant outside storage and related storage activities or outside storage and other outside activities.id.at.finding the language ambiguous,the court noted that city officials in charge of enforcing the ordinance had consistently adopted the landowner interpretation over a long period of years.id.at.the court then held that this interpretation of the ordinance by the city officials meant that the city was bound to that interpretation of the ordinance and could only change it through legislative action.id.at if an administrative gloss is indeed found to have been placed on a clause,the municipality may not change such a de facto policy,in the absence of legislative action,because to do so would presumably violate legislative intent.quoting conforti city of manchester,emphasis removed.
according to intervenors,county enforcement officials consistently interpreted and applied the code to require a development permit for construction within a utility easement or.if this allegation is true,then the code required pnm to obtain a development pnm has admittedly failed to construction of its powerline project would violate the code.moreover,it would also mean that the county was without power to change the meaning of the code to exclude pnm powerline project unless the county legislatively changed the code.the settlement of the lawsuit alone would have been insufficient.
pnm also argues that its project is a utility line extension such that it was exempt under the code.intervenors respond that the term utility line extension only applies to connections between main utility lines and individual buildings,rather than the large transmission line to be constructed by pnm.the code provides no definition of the term utility line extension.appellants app.at.given the ambiguity of the term meaning,the prior history of the county interpretation and enforcement of the code will again be relevant in determining whether the utility line extension exemption covers pnm project.
thus,whether the code applies to pnm depends in part on whether county officials had consistently enforced and applied the code to require a development permit for construction activities similar to this project.any evidence as to whether such a consistent enforcement and application of the code existed should be used by the district court to interpret the code and determine,as a matter of law,what the meaning of the code was on this point prior to.see high ridge,at.if the district court concludes that the past enforcement history means that the code applied to pnm project prior to,then intervenors would succeed on their mandamus claim.
pnm argues that we should defer to the county legal interpretation of ambiguous sections of the code,citing hyde taos zoning authority,and huning castle neighborhood association city of albuquerque.according to pnm,that deference means that mandamus is unavailable.respectfully,pnm argument confuses the deference that new mexico courts provide to agency interpretations of a statute with an absolute bar against mandamus in situations where statutes require interpretation by the courts.
first,there is no absolute bar against mandamus simply because the relevant statute or ordinance that determines whether an agency has a ministerial duty is open to interpretation.new mexico courts have regularly relied on their own interpretation of statutes to conclude that an agency was vested with a ministerial duty which could be enforced through mandamus.see,city comm state ex rel.nichols,construing state election laws in order to determine whether a city had a ministerial duty to hold a referendum election city of santa rosa jaramillo,construing state liquor statutes and rejecting attorney general opinions regarding those statutes in concluding that mandamus was proper.
moreover,even if deference to an agency interpretation of a statute is proper in considering a mandamus claim,this would not necessarily prevent a court from adopting a contrary interpretation of the statute.in cases where the new mexico courts have deferred to agency interpretations of statutes or ordinances,the courts have accorded substantial weight to the interpretation of the agency charged with enforcement of the statute.klumker van allred.because this is,new mexico courts may nonetheless conclude that an agency interpretation of an ordinance is improper and can not be sustained.see perea baca,granting mandamus relief based on a rejection of the state agency interpretation of the relevant state liquor statutes despite the canon of construction that a n administrative construction given a statute by the agency charged with its administration is persuasive and will not be lightly overturned downtown neighborhoods ass city of albuquerque,rejecting a city interpretation of an ordinance because it was inconsistent with state law.
if there is strong evidence that the county consistently enforced and applied the code against similar projects,then the county interpretation of the code would be improper despite any deference that it is owed.again,because intervenors alleged that the settlement agreement between the county and pnm lacks any basis in fact or law to the extent that the parties agreed that the powerline project is not covered by the code appellants app.at,intervenors have also alleged that such an enforcement history exists.and if there is evidence of just such an enforcement history,there would be a ministerial duty on the part of the county to enforce the code against pnm project,and mandamus would lie.dismissal of the mandamus claim based on this argument by the district court was improper.
in analyzing the intervenors mandamus claim to the extent that it is based on the code amendment,we begin with a discussion of how the amendment might apply to pnm powerline project.we then determine whether new mexico law would allow a mandamus claim in a situation such as this one.
applicability of the code amendment to pnm powerline project 
while the parties do not dispute that the language of the code amendment would cover pnm project,they nonetheless disagree over whether that amendment may be properly applied to the project.
pnm argues that the amendment does not apply to the project because the code specifically states that projects on which actual construction was lawfully begun before the effective date of any amendment to the code will not be covered by that amendment appellants app.at the county has interpreted the amendment as not applying to the powerline project,an administrative interpretation to which we must defer under new mexico law and pnm had obtained vested rights in the powerline project such that new mexico law prohibits the application of the amendment to the project.
under the code,any amendment will not apply to ongoing projects so long as actual construction has begun id.at.the code defines actual construction as permanently fastening construction materials in permanent position or substantial demolition or removal of an existing building or other structure preparatory to construction of a replacement.id.if actual construction of the powerline had begun prior to the enactment of the code amendment,under the code own terms the amendment would not apply to the powerline project.
before the district court,intervenors conceded that pnm had begun surveying for the powerline project before the amendment was passed.id.at.based on that concession,the district court concluded that the amendment did not apply to the powerline project.
everyone agrees that they did survey work out there,and that they got started,in that sense.i think we drawing too fine a line to say that we got to have poles up there,that surveying was not starting the line therefore,the new ordinance does not apply as the county found and agreed to.
id.at however,the plain language of the code requires that the permanent fastening of construction materials in permanent position must occur for there to be actual construction.we can not see how placement of flags or otherwise surveying the route of a only points that intervenors conceded id.at constitutes a permanent fastening of construction materials in permanent position.
pnm points out that during hearings leading to county enactment of the code amendment,the ordinance was described as appl ying prospectively.id.at.based on this statement,pnm argues that the county itself understood the amendment as not applying to the powerline project.appellees br.at.
pnm quote from the hearing is taken out of context.the statement explained why the code amendment would not require existing powerlines to be buried.see appellants app.at in other words,we would not require jemez pueblo to come in and underground all the utility lines which they use right now.the statement does not mean that the county did not intend for the amendment to apply to powerline projects on which no construction had yet begun,as is allegedly the case with pnm powerline project.indeed,at an earlier county hearing there was a strenuous debate between representatives of pnm and the county over the fairness of enacting an amendment that clearly would affect pnm powerline project.see id.at.
pnm third argument is that,under new mexico law,application of the code amendment to its powerline project would result in an improper retroactive application of the law in violation of article iv,of the new mexico constitution under new mexico law,the determination of whether a local zoning ordinance amendment may apply retroactively to a particular project depends on whether the project owner has obtained vested rights in the project once a landowner has achieved vested rights,subsequent changes to the zoning laws can not apply.see,brazos land,bd.of county comm rs.for vested rights to exist,there must be approval by the regulatory body and a substantial change in position in reliance thereon.id.
although the county has never granted pnm any approval to build its powerline,if pnm is correct that the code did not apply to its project,pnm was never required to obtain any sort of approval to construct its powerline prior to the enactment of the amendment.therefore,it would not need approval to obtain vested rights 
the district court held that,as a matter of law,surveying alone by pnm was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a substantial change in position.appellants app.at.there are few new mexico cases that address what substantial change in position means,and no new mexico case has held that surveying alone is sufficient for vested rights.see brazos land,at holding that the submission of a preliminary plat application alone did not result in substantial reliance or change in position see also el dorado at santa fe,bd.of county comm rs,holding that rights had vested where a landowner had surveyed,placed monuments,and sold subdivided properties in reliance on the approval of a subdivision chilili coop.ass sundance mountain ranches,in re sundance mountain ranches,holding that vested rights applied based on the expenditures,change of position,and reliance of the developer after obtaining approval,but without providing any specifics as to the nature of the expenditures or change in position 
one way a substantial reliance or change in position may be shown is through the expenditure of a considerable sum of money.sundance mountain,at quotation omitted.surveying is not the expenditure of a considerable sum of money when considered in the context of the cost of this entire project,nor would it appear to constitute any other form of substantial reliance,such as the sale of subdivided property to third parties.el dorado,at.
while surveying alone does not qualify,other questions may remain for resolution by the trial court in properly raised pleadings or on the merits as to whether pnm powerline project might have obtained vested rights.we will not consider such questions at this juncture.
applicability of new mexico mandamus law 
as noted above,the parties do not dispute that the language of the code amendment covers pnm powerline project.therefore,the question here is not one of the interpretation of the meaning of the code amendment,but instead of the application of that amendment to pnm project.
pnm insists that the district court engaged in no factual determinations of its own and that it merely concluded that the county determination that pnm began construction of the project before the enactment of the ordinance could not be in a mandamus proceeding.appellees br.at emphasis removed.in essence,pnm argument is that the county,in entering into the settlement agreement,resolved the question of whether the code amendment applied to the project in pnm favor by determining that one of the two conditions discussed above had been met by pnm.according to pnm,the county determination is a discretionary decision by the county which can not be in a mandamus proceeding 
the key question becomes whether,under new mexico law,mandamus is appropriate to compel ministerial action by a public official in this case,enforcement of the code where that ministerial act depends upon a determination by the agency as to the existence of certain facts in this case,that pnm had neither begun actual construction of the powerline project nor had made significant expenditures on the project prior to the code amendment.
even where the ministerial duty of a public official is triggered by factual determinations,mandamus still may be proper 
i t is well established that mandamus will lie to compel the performance of mere ministerial acts or duties imposed by law upon a public officer to do a particular act or thing upon the existence of certain facts or conditions being shown,even though the officer be required to exercise judgment before acting.
state ex rel.four corners exploration walker,see also sender montoya,stating that mandamus would practically never issue if an inflexible rule were followed that mandamus is inappropriate where interpretation and judgment are necessary,overruled on other grounds by state ex rel.reynolds molybdenum of.
pnm argues that the facts will show that the code amendment did not apply to its project and that therefore the ministerial duty to enforce the code was never triggered.given the rule b posture of the case,this is an allegation that the relevant facts that would trigger the ministerial duty are disputed and that mandamus is therefore inappropriate.at first glance,new mexico case law seems unclear as to whether allegations of disputes over facts may be litigated in a mandamus proceeding where resolution of those disputes is required to determine whether a public official has a ministerial duty.some cases have stated that if there is any dispute whatsoever between the parties over the facts that would give rise to a ministerial duty,mandamus will not lie.see rainaldi pub.employees ret,mandamus is used to enforce an existing right,not to resolve material issues of fact.kiddy bd.of county comm rs,stating that where the existence of facts which would require the performance on part of the board or officer remains the subject of judicial determination,mandamus is not proper brantley farms carlsbad irrigation,holding an application for mandamus was legally insufficient because the parties disputed the underlying facts giving rise to the public board duty to perform concerned residents for neighborhood shollenbarger,stating that i f issues of fact are raised,then mandamus should not issue,since it is only a method by which an existing right is enforced.
on the other hand,there are also one of the cases cited have allowed findings of fact in a mandamus proceeding where those findings determined whether a ministerial duty was imposed on the public official.see rainaldi,at,noting that the parties disputed whether relevant facts were proven and stating that mandamus was a proper remedy because the petitioner was able to satisfy the district court that the facts supported his position and that the board was required to perform by direction of law regardless of its own opinion as to the propriety or impropriety of doing so nichols,at noting that petitioner and the city disputed the total number of registered voters in the city,which would determine whether a petition was signed by a sufficient proportion of the registered voters such that the city was required to place the petition on the ballot,and stating that because the trial court found that the requisite proportion was met by the petition,nothing remains to be done by the city except to comply see also city of santa rosa,at where the discretion is as to the existence of facts entitling the relator to the thing demanded,if facts are clearly proved or admitted,mandamus will lie.quotation omitted.
the conflict in the cases and language,however,is more apparent than real.if there is any genuine dispute over the underlying facts based on admissible evidence,then mandamus should not lie,because the officer has exercised his discretion to resolve the factual dispute.however,if there is no admissible evidence that could support the factual determination of the officer,then the officer has no discretion in the matter.see sender,at stating that in the context of the application of mandamus to a judicial officer,where the express mandatory conditions for a dismissal are clearly established,and without contradiction,the court was without discretion in the matter quotation omitted.in other words,we interpret the language in the cases that state that mandamus will not lie to resolve issues of fact to mean that mandamus will not lie to resolve genuine issues of fact based on admissible evidence.otherwise,a public agency or officer could use baseless allegations of material factual disputes in their answer to a mandamus petition to force the dismissal of that petition and render the mandamus process ineffective whenever there is a factual predicate for the ministerial duty of an official.
we emphasize that the standard of whether there is an issue of fact is quite a low one.indeed,it might be compared to the burden on the party opposing a motion for summary judgment,who need only show that there is a genuine issue of material fact.if the agency or officer makes such a showing,then it had discretion to resolve the factual issue in the manner that it did,and mandamus is an inappropriate remedy.moreover,the party seeking mandamus must also provide sufficient evidence supporting its version of the,that the agency or official made the wrong that the court must conclude that this version has been clearly proved.santa rosa,at.
for intervenors mandamus action to be dismissed in the present case,therefore,the parties opposing mandamus must show that there was a genuine factual dispute regarding whether pnm had begun actual construction of the powerline project or had made substantial expenditures of money prior to the enactment of the code amendment,with the expenditures made in good faith reliance on an exemption from the code,and as defined by applicable law.
however,the corollary to this a genuine dispute of material fact based on admissible evidence will result in the dismissal of a mandamus that dismissal of a mandamus action is inappropriate at the rule b stage where a plaintiff has alleged that there is no genuine dispute of material fact.thus,if intervenors complaint can be fairly read to allege that there is no genuine dispute of material,that there is clear and uncontradicted evidence that pnm had not begun actual construction prior to the amendment and had no vested rights in the accepting as true the factual allegations of the complaint under sutton,at,intervenors have successfully stated a claim with respect to the code amendment,and b dismissal by the district court was error.
as noted above,when considering a rule b motion,we are required to take the facts alleged in intervenors complaint as true and to indulge all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,curtis ambulance,at.intervenors specifically alleged that the settlement agreement between the county and pnm lacks any basis in fact or law to the extent the parties agreed that the powerline project is not covered by the code.appellants app.at.we are required to presume that this allegation is true.in particular,we must presume that there is clear and uncontradicted evidence that pnm had not begun actual construction prior to the amendment and had no vested rights in the project.we must also therefore presume that intervenors could successfully show that the code amendment applied to pnm project.
in discussing the issue of whether the amendment applied to pnm project,the parties referred to the record in both their briefs and oral argument in order to contest the relevant factual issues.but,as noted above,when reviewing a decision based on a rule b motion a federal court may not consider that record.see miller,at failure to convert to a summary judgment motion and to comply with rule when the court considers matters outside the plaintiff complaint is reversible error.
the settlement agreement entered into by the county and pnm may be considered by us,because it is a document referred to in the complaint and it is a document that is central to the plaintiff claim whose authenticity is not in dispute.see jacobsen,at.the settlement agreement does state that the powerline project shall not be subject to the code as amended in,because construction of the powerline was begun prior to the passage of said amendment.appellants app.at.however,this portion of the settlement agreement can not establish that there was a genuine issue of material fact over when construction of the powerline had begun.it is this very document that the complaint alleges lacks any basis in fact or law.id.at.a document that is alleged by one party to be without any factual basis can not be relied upon by the other party to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact the contrary conclusion would effectively mean that a local government could immunize from mandamus claims any decision that required the resolution of a question of fact by simply drafting a document that purported to resolve that question 
intervenors remaining claim is for anticipatory public nuisance.the district court did not specify the grounds on which it dismissed intervenors complaint,stating simply,i do think there any way that this would ever be found to be a nuisance.appellants app.at.
in explaining the district court decision,the parties on appeal have relied exclusively on state ex rel.vill.of los ranchos de albuquerque city of albuquerque,the applicability of los ranchos was also advanced by pnm as a ground for dismissal below appellants app.at.according to pnm,under los ranchos its project is immune to any anticipatory nuisance claim.
at issue in los ranchos was the construction by the city of albuquerque of a bridge across the rio grande river and a nearby irrigation ditch.at.a neighboring municipality,the village of los ranchos de albuquerque,sought to prevent construction of the bridge by seeking an injunction against it as a public nuisance.id.at.the new mexico supreme court took the case for review to consider whether a public works project is subject to abatement as a public nuisance when it has been duly authorized by law and has,pursuant to law,been reviewed and approved by concerned municipal,state,and federal agencies.id.at.the court concluded that as a matter of law such a project could not be subject to abatement as an anticipatory public nuisance.id.
in establishing this rule,the los ranchos court emphasized the two requirements for the exemption from anticipatory public nuisance claims there must be due authorization,and the project must be a public works project.id.at.pnm argues that both requirements are met.
due authorization means that the project is in conformance with all the federal,state,and local laws,rules,and regulations pertinent to that particular project.id.because pnm never received a development permit from the county of santa fe for its powerline project,pnm could have due authorization only if it never needed such a permit.but,as noted above,intervenors allege that the code applied to the pnm project and therefore that pnm needed a development permit for the project.at the b stage,we must assume that those allegations are true dismissal by the district court of this claim was therefore error.
however,we have a more fundamental difficulty with the district court conclusion that los ranchos applies to the present case.the court in los ranchos explained that,
when a complaint of public nuisance is raised,public works projects are fundamentally different from private construction projects.a public project carries with it the presumption that it is for the public good.proof that it will be a nuisance must be balanced against its benefit for the public as a whole.
a public works project,unlike a private construction project,is a product of the exercise of the legislative power.the presumption is that the project is publicly scrutinized and balanced against all interests,public and private,upon which it will have impact.as the history of this project demonstrates,this process can take several decades and can involve government agencies,the voting public,advocates of private interests,and the courts.at the conclusion of this balancing of interests,a determination is made that,despite any adverse impacts,the project serves the public health,welfare,safety,and rights.
id.at citations omitted,emphasis added.although considered a public utility under new mexico law,stat.ann,pnm is essentially a private corporation,not a public governmental agency.pnm actions are not the product of the exercise of the legislative power,los ranchos,at,but instead the product of the exercise of the power of pnm corporate officers,directors,and shareholders.the powerline project planned by pnm is a project planned by a private entity in los ranchos,the bridge project was the project of a municipal city of members were accountable through elections to its citizens.while we presume that a politically accountable governmental agency has adequately balanced the multiple and conflicting interests,we indulge in no such presumption regarding a private corporation that is not politically accountable and that is not run by an elected government 
finally,intervenors challenge the district court grant of the county and pnm rule a motion to dismiss with prejudice the county lawsuit.we review a district court grant of a rule a motion for abuse of discretion.moore anthony,cir.
rule a requires a court to review a motion by a plaintiff to dismiss a complaint if the action has proceeded beyond service of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment,and there is not unanimous agreement among all parties supporting the dismissal.a a n action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.the purpose of the rule is primarily to prevent voluntary dismissals which unfairly affect the other side,and to permit the imposition of curative conditions.clark tansy,cir quotation omitted.when considering a motion to dismiss,the important aspect is whether the opposing party will suffer prejudice in the light of the valid interests of the parties.it is the prejudice to the opposing party,rather than the convenience of the court,that is to be considered in passing on a motion for dismissal.id.quotations and alterations omitted see also ohlander larson,cir absent legal prejudice to the defendant,the district court normally should grant such a dismissal.among the factors to be considered by the district court in making this evaluation are the opposing party effort and expense in preparing for trial excessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the movant insufficient explanation of the need for a dismissal and the present stage of litigation.ohlander,at.this list of factors is by no means exclusive,and factors that are unique to the context of the case must also be considered.id.in reaching its conclusion,t he district court should endeavor to insure substantial justice is accorded to both parties,and therefore the court must consider the equities not only facing the defendant,but also those facing the plaintiff.id.
intervenors argue that the dismissal will act as a shield against the resident intervenors complaint in intervention,particularly its claim for a writ of mandamus compelling the county to enforce the code,because res judicata would apply to bar any future suit by the county.appellants br.at.in granting the motion,the district court rejected intervenors arguments,concluding that s ince the parties are different in the,i find that res judicata would not apply and therefore intervenors would not be prejudiced by the voluntary dismissal.appellants app.at.the district court further noted that the county will be seriously prejudiced if forced to remain in the case since the purpose of the settlement was to avoid the expenses and inconvenience of litigation.id.
we disagree with the district court that res judicata will not negatively affect the intervenors.it is certainly true that neither the settlement agreement nor dismissal of the county lawsuit will act through either res judicata or collateral estoppel to bar intervenors from succeeding on the merits in their claim for a writ of mandamus against the county,because they are not a party to that agreement.however,dismissal of the county suit does foreclose intervenors from obtaining relief even if their writ of mandamus claim succeeds.intervenors amended complaint specifically requests as relief under their writ of mandamus cause of action that the county be command ed and compell ed to enforce the provisions of the code against pnm.id.at.but if the county is allowed to dismiss its suit with prejudice,that dismissal will act as res judicata and prevent the county from filing any additional claims or suits against pnm concerning alleged violations of the code by the powerline project.see id.at stating,in the settlement agreement,that the parties are released from all present claims arising with respect to this action,and all such claims are forever barred.by granting the rule a motion,the district court immunized pnm against any future suit by the county related to the powerline project,and therefore made it impossible for intervenors to obtain the relief that they sought under their writ of mandamus cause of action.given the particular circumstances of the the relief sought by intervenors is the prosecution of a cause of action by the very plaintiff seeking dismissal with prejudice of that cause of is a clear example of legal prejudice.the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion.
pnm argues,however,that we should adopt a rule that the district court must grant a motion to dismiss under rule a where the dismissal will be with prejudice.see smoot fox,cir see also shepard egan,i t is difficult,both practically and logistically,to imagine a court denying a plaintiff motion to dismiss her own action with prejudice.
we see no need for a new and distinct rule for motions to dismiss with prejudice.in most cases,the normal analysis will result in the district court granting the plaintiff motion to dismiss with prejudice.consider that the defendant will have obtained a judgment on the merits that vindicates his rights and precludes any future suit by the plaintiff.see,sec.exch.comm lorin,granting the government motion to dismiss claims with prejudice because under the standard analysis there is no legal prejudice to defendant.but there will be circumstances where granting a plaintiff motion to dismiss with prejudice may adversely affect the defendant or,more likely,other parties to the litigation.in such situations,a blanket rule that the court must grant the plaintiff motion would lead to injustice.to the contrary,in such circumstances the motion should instead be denied.see,atwood pac.ass n,refusing to dismiss with prejudice plaintiffs claims against a union because it would adversely affect the employers beaver assocs.cannon,refusing to dismiss with prejudice a plaintiff shareholder derivative claims against a corporation because it might result in the loss to the corporation of its only forum for considering the merits,if any,of the asserted derivative claim.the instant case is an example of the rare circumstance where dismissal with prejudice of a plaintiff claims would adversely impact another party to the litigation and,correlatively,why we should reject pnm proposed rule.
we are mindful of the fact that denying a plaintiff motion to dismiss with prejudice leaves the plaintiff in an awkward plaintiff is no longer desirous of pursuing the litigation and may seek effective dismissal of his case through or poor litigation tactics.see shepard.at could the court force the plaintiff to continue discovery,or offer evidence can or should the court require plaintiff to litigate a claim when plaintiff herself has attempted to dismiss it.these are important factors for a court to consider in deciding whether to grant the motion to dismiss with prejudice they are part of the requirement that the court consider the equities not only facing the defendant,but also those facing the plaintiff.ohlander,at.however,in this case we see little danger of such an awkward situation arising.the county suit against pnm can remain inactive while intervenors pursue their cause of action if intervenors are not successful in further efforts to reach and prevail on the merits of their claims,that will end the matter.on the other hand,if intervenors do succeed on the merits of their claims,they will necessarily have already proven the county case against pnm,as they will have shown that pnm was so clearly in violation of the code that the county had a clear duty to enforce it against pnm.
the judgment of the district court is reversed,and this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent from judge lucero carefully researched and well drafted opinion because i view this appeal very differently from my colleagues,even as to the nature of the issue presented.the fundamental difference arises from my consideration of the procedural history of the case below.i believe intervenors allegation that there was no legal or factual basis for the county settlement decision should be ignored,and the district court substantially affirmed.
long before litigation began,public service company of new mexico pnm pursued lengthy administrative processes in federal and state forums to obtain approval of the project.the project involved construction of an electrical power substation and a transmission line spanning approximately ten miles,which included tribal land,federal land,and less than of one mile of land located within the county of santa fe,new mexico.private landowners,who are appellants here,were parties to state proceedings before the new mexico public utility commission.in fact,they initiated those proceedings by petitioning for an investigation and a stay of construction in september.the landowners succeeded in obtaining a stay and a lengthy investigation,but the investigation culminated in a recommended decision by a hearing examiner in august that the project should be allowed to proceed.appellants app.at.the commission rejected the landowners objections to the recommended decision and adopted it as a final order in october.appellants app.at.the county also appeared in the state administrative proceeding by filing in september an unsuccessful motion to intervene and objections to the recommended decision.appellants app.at.
the case below began as a state court action brought by the county against pnm on december,to enforce the santa fe county land development code.in particular,the county alleged a violation of ordinance,an amendment to the code adopted on november,requiring among other things,that all transmission lines in the county be buried underground,unless otherwise permitted by the county commission,that the terrain management regulations in the code be satisfied when constructing a transmission line,and that all utility companies obtain a development permit from the county prior to the construction of any transmission line.appellants app.at.the action was triggered by an observation by a code enforcement officer a day earlier that pnm was constructing a transmission line within the county on federal bureau of land management land and was based on a position that pnm construction must comply with the county regulations even when that construction occurs on federal lands.appellants app.at.with the complaint,the county filed a motion for an injunction to halt pnm construction.appellants app.at.the case followed a tortured procedural history that need not be detailed here,but the case finally was removed to federal court and remained there after the county added the united states as a necessary party defendant.
early in the removed proceedings,appellants moved to intervene in the case.the district court granted the motion on january.within days,on february,the original parties the county,pnm and the united states department of interior,bureau of land management jointly moved for voluntary dismissal with prejudice of the action based on a written settlement agreement between the county and pnm to compromise their claims and counterclaims against each other.appellants app.at.appellants subsequently filed their complaint in intervention alleging in part that the county should be compelled by writ of mandamus to enforce its code,particularly ordinance,and to prosecute rather than dismiss its enforcement action.appellants app.at.appellants also filed a lengthy brief with numerous exhibits in opposition to the other parties motion for voluntary dismissal.appellants app.at.the county and pnm submitted a reply brief,also lengthy and accompanied by many exhibits,in further support of their motion to dismiss.appellants app.at.in august,the district court overruled the intervenors objections to dismissal of the main action,granted the motion for voluntary dismissal,and issued an order of dismissal that both approved the settlement agreement and terminated the litigation among the original parties.appellants app.at.while this ruling was made without an evidentiary hearing requested by the intervenors,it was made with full knowledge of the procedural history of the case and of evidence presented in prior hearings,the parties voluminous briefs,and their documentary submissions.
following the voluntary dismissal,the intervenors filed an amended complaint in intervention.pnm then moved to dismiss this complaint under.b on the ground that it was premised on an incorrect interpretation of the santa fe county land development code.appellants app.at.following oral argument in january,the district court granted pnm motion and dismissed the intervenors amended complaint for failure to state a claim.in so doing,the district court specifically acknowledged the restrictive standard of decision under rule b but reasoned that the intervenors allegations were not binding as to legal issues.concerning the mandamus claim,the district court concluded that the county settlement posture was a discretionary act of the county and,as to the nuisance claims,this would n ever be found to be a nuisance.appellants app.at.appellants challenge both dismissals,of the original action and their amended intervention complaint.
the focus of the intervenors appeal is the district court dismissal of their mandamus claim seeking to compel the county to enforce its ordinances through prosecution of its enforcement action against pnm to the bitter end.as i read the opinion,the majority concludes that the district judge erred in dismissing this claim because he failed to accept as true an allegation in the intervenors prolix pleading that the county lacked any factual or legal basis for its settlement decision and because,depending on the facts,the county may have a ministerial duty to enforce its code against pnm construction project.the intervenors allegation that the settlement agreement lacked a factual or legal basis had been presented before,however,in opposition to the motion for voluntary dismissal.appellants app.at the motion to dismiss presents no factual or legal basis for the settlement.the intervenors received an opportunity to be heard on this issue but lost.the district judge rejected this contention by overruling their objections,approving the settlement,and permitting voluntary dismissal of the enforcement action.he entered an order of dismissal that incorporated the settlement agreement executed by the county and pnm and expressly found that ordinance did not apply because construction of the project was begun prior to passage of said ordinance and that a county development permit was not required for the project.appellants app.at.intervenors made no attempt contemporaneously to appeal these findings.
in short,the intervenors conclusory averment in the amended intervention complaint carries no force.it is contrary to the district judge implicit finding,which is fully supported by the record in existence at the time of his decision,that the county did in fact have a valid basis for its decision not to litigate further against pnm more importantly,however,the county is in a better position than a federal court to interpret and apply its own ordinances.a determination by the county that its undergrounding and permit requirements were inapplicable to the project,in itself,provides a lawful basis for the settlement decision.the district judge acceptance of this determination further demonstrates the existence of a genuine dispute in litigation positions and,at the least,establishes an arguable basis for a compromise of the enforcement action that prevents issuance of the mandamus relief sought by the intervenors.
the intervenors were understandably concerned that the settlement agreement stated a particular position regarding the applicability of the code.regardless of the correctness of this position,however,appellants ultimately are not bound by it because they were not parties to the settlement contract.see,new mexico ex rel.energy and minerals dep t united states dep t of interior,a settlement agreement between state and federal officials that adopted a particular definition of indian lands was not binding on an intervenor tribe,who could continue to litigate its claims on the issue.
moreover,in my view,the majority poses the wrong enforcement question.the county has already initiated and concluded,if the voluntary dismissal stands its enforcement action against pnm.the question presented is whether under the law the county settlement decision was one that it had discretionary authority to make.in answering this question,i see no need to determine whether any county ordinances in fact applied to the project or whether the county change of position in the litigation was a wise move.the premise of a settlement and compromise is that each party has an arguable position that it agrees to give up in exchange for an expeditious,inexpensive,and amicable resolution of the matter.whether the county original legal position was in fact correct or whether it might ultimately have prevailed in the litigation is not dispositive or even material.the record before the district court clearly showed the existence of arguable legal positions in this case,in which the county and pnm asserted claims and counterclaims against each other concerning their opposing interpretations of county ordinances.by a simple allegation of no factual or legal basis for the settlement,intervenors could not have stricken the district court blind as to what the public utility commission and the district court had already decided.it is one thing for intervenors to assert that the district court was wrong,but another thing to accept as true an assertion that the district court does not know a genuine dispute when it sees one.i am persuaded by appellees arguments that the county has prosecutorial discretion with regard to enforcement actions and that its litigation position can not be dictated by concerned citizens or the courts.
as to appellants challenge to the district court dismissal of the original action,i do not disagree with the principle stated in the majority opinion that a district court would abuse its discretion in permitting a voluntary dismissal with prejudice of claims between some parties based on a settlement between them if the dismissal would cause legal prejudice to another party.i also share the majority view that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel would later bar the intervenors claims because they were not parties to the settlement.slip op.at.i differ with the majority conclusion that this case presents the rare circumstance where dismissal of the plaintiff claims would adversely impact another party.the majority finds that the district judge abused his discretion in granting the rule a motion because he failed to appreciate the resulting legal prejudice to the intervenors pending mandamus claim against the county.his ruling effectively immunized pnm against any future suit by the county related to the powerline project,and therefore made it impossible for intervenors to obtain the relief sought under their writ o
