southern california edison company sce sued the commissioners of the california public utilities commission puc in the united states district court for the central district of california,claiming puc regulation of electricity rates violated federal law in several respects.the parties later reached an agreement settling the action,which became the basis for a stipulated judgment proposed to the district court.the utility reform network turn,which had intervened in the action,opposed the stipulated judgment,claiming,among other things,that puc agreement to the settlement violated california law.the district court approved the settlement as fair and entered the stipulated judgment over these objections.
on appeal,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit discerned a serious question whether the agreement violated california law in several respects,both substantive and procedural.southern california edison lynch cir.because as a matter of federal law,state officials can not enter into a federally sanctioned consent decree beyond their authority under state law,the federal court of appeals believed the resolution of state law issues was essential to determining the validity of the stipulated judgment.id.at.the court of appeals therefore certified to this court cal.rules of court,former rule see,rule three questions of california law.we accepted the certification request,modifying one of the questions slightly.as accepted,the questions to be answered are 
did the commissioners of the california public utilities commission have the authority to propose the stipulated judgment in light of the provisions of assembly bill reg.sess.codified in public utilities code sections stats,ch.
did the procedures employed in entering the stipulated judgment violate the open meeting act,
does the stipulated judgment violate section of the public utilities code by altering utility rates without a public hearing and issuance of findings 
having analyzed these questions,we conclude the settlement did not violate california law in any of these three respects.
background 
the essential background of this case lies in california attempt,beginning in,to move the system for provision of electrical power from a regulated to a competitive market,the crisis caused in to early by soaring prices for electricity on the wholesale market,and the urgency legislation enacted in january in response to that crisis.
assembly bill reg.sess.hereafter assembly bill,which became law in stats,ch,was intended to provide the legislative foundation for california transition to a more competitive electricity market structure.assem.bill,subd.a.the new market structure included the creation of the california power exchange calpx,which was to run an efficient,competitive auction among electricity producers,and the independent system operator,which would control the statewide transmission grid,subd.c.the state main electric utility companies sce,pacific gas and electric company pg e,and san diego gas and electric company sdg e hereafter the utilities were expected to divest themselves of substantial parts of their generating assets,while retaining others at least during the period of transition,adding pub,former.under the assembly bill scheme as implemented,all generators,including the utilities,sold their power through the calpx the utilities also bought,through that exchange,the electricity they needed to supply their retail customers.cal.exchange ferc in re cal.power exchange cir.
because this competition among producers was expected to bring down wholesale prices,the utilities believed that some of their generating assets,which they had built or improved with puc approval,would become uneconomic,in that the costs of generation and of certain contracts between the utilities and other generators would be higher than prevailing wholesale rates would support.the costs associated with these potentially uneconomic assets are also known as stranded costs or transition costs.the legislature,in assembly bill,intended to allow for a ccelerated,equitable,nonbypassable recovery of transition costs stats,ch,subd.b and thereby to provide the investors in these electrical corporations with a fair opportunity to fully recover the costs associated with commission approved assets and obligations,subd.t.the legislative scheme for doing so without subjecting consumers to increased rates was complex,but consisted in its essentials of the following 
under public utilities code section puc was to identify and quantify potentially uneconomic costs,the costs that may become uneconomic as a result of a competitive generating market.the identified costs were to be recoverable through rates that would not exceed the levels in effect on june,and the recovery was not to extend beyond december,subd.a.the component of rates dedicated to recovery of transition costs was nonbypassable,it had to be paid to the utility whether the consumer bought power from the utility,from a generator in a single direct transaction,or from a generator in an aggregated direct transaction with other consumers,subd.b.
section required each utility to propose,and puc to approve,a cost recovery plan for the costs identified in section that would set rates at june,levels,with a percent reduction for residential and small commercial customers.section,subdivision a continues these rate levels shall remain in effect until the earlier of march,or the date on which the costs for utility assets and obligations have been fully recovered.the electrical corporation shall be at risk for those costs not recovered during that time period.
puc implemented this scheme in part by creating,for each electric utility,a transition cost balancing account sometimes herein referred to as a tcba,in which the stranded costs were tracked.transition costs were not to be forecast,but rather entered in the transition cost balancing account as the puc determined them.costs associated with generating assets were to be determined by comparing the book value of the assets with their market valuations,a process to be completed by the end of.these uneconomic generating costs were to be netted against the benefits of any economic generating assets those having higher market than book value.the difference between rate revenue and the utility other costs was designated the utility headroom and was to be credited against the stranded costs in the transition cost balancing account.the portion of each rate serving as headroom was designated the competition transition charge.in re pacific gas electric cal,wl.
in the first few years of the transition period,the utilities recovered much of their stranded costs.sdg e was found to have recovered all its transition costs,ending the rate freeze for that utility under section.sce and pg e,however,were still subject to the rate freeze when,in the summer of,power procurement prices,and particularly prices on the calpx spot market,rose drastically.they incurred huge debts buying electricity through the calpx.cal.exchange ferc in re cal.power exchange,supra,at.
in november,as the wholesale price and supply problems continued,sce brought its federal action against puc,the subsequent settlement of which is the subject of this decision.in essence,sce claimed the rate freeze imposed by assembly bill was now depriving sce of its right,under federal law,to recover the costs of purchasing electricity for its customers.more particularly,sce claimed the freeze rates had become unconstitutionally confiscatory and violated the federal filed rate rule,which assertedly allows a utility to recover in retail rates the costs of purchases made under federally approved tariffs.
puc granted sce and the other utilities emergency rate relief in early.deeming the crisis one that involves not only utility solvency but the very liquidity of the system,puc in january authorized a temporary surcharge of one cent per.application of southern california edison cal,wl.two months later,still finding that sce and pg e continued financial viability and ability to serve their customers has been seriously compromised by the dramatic escalation in wholesale prices,puc made the january increase permanent and authorized an additional three cents per increase.application of southern california edison cal,wl.puc refers to these increases collectively as the four cent surcharge,a usage we adopt.according to sce,the surcharge amounted to an average increase of percent in retail rates.puc march decision,while authorizing an increase to pay for ongoing power purchases,did not address recovery of past power purchase costs and other costs claimed by the utilities.id.at.
the legislature also took action in january,in an extraordinary session called to address the power crisis.in that session assembly bill stats,ch.hereafter assembly bill,the legislature authorized the state department of water resources to begin buying power for customers of sce and pg,adding.in assembly bill of that session stats,ch.hereafter assembly bill,the legislature amended several provisions of assembly bill,halting at least temporarily the transition to a competitive electricity market.in particular,public utilities code section,as first enacted by assembly bill,had provided that puc would continue regulating the utilities retained nonnuclear generating assets until those assets have been subject to market valuation,after which they would be sold off unless the utility convinced the puc their retention was in the public interest.stats,ch.as amended by assembly bill,section provides that all the remaining generating assets are subject to puc regulation and may not be sold until january,at the earliest.assem.bill.similarly,as enacted by assembly bill,public utilities code section,subdivision l had provided that the generating assets should be transitioned from regulated status to unregulated status through means of market valuation mechanisms.stats,ch.assembly bill deleted this language,leaving only the general statement that g eneration of electricity should be open to competition.puc subsequently issued decisions,based on assembly bill,reestablishing rate regulation of sce retained generating assets and modifying restrictions on the use of the four cent surcharge,application of southern california edison cal,wl application of southern california edison cal,wl.
in october,sce and puc reached a settlement of sce federal rate action.in the settlement recitals,the parties agreed that during the period of very high wholesale power prices,sce accumulated liabilities and indebtedness of about billion,creating severe liquidity and credit problems for the company.conditions in,including the four cent surcharge,had allowed sce to collect retail revenues in excess of current costs.the settlement was intended to use the opportunity thus provided to restore sce creditworthiness and avoid further instability and uncertainty for the company and consumers.settlement,recitals.
puc principal substantive concession in the settlement was its agreement to permit sce to recover its past costs by maintaining the existing rates until the end of,if necessary.the parties agreed to establish a obligations account sometimes herein referred to as the proact,the initial balance of which was sce liabilities less its cash on hand.the parties estimated the initial balance at about billion.settlement,a.sce agreed to apply all its surplus its revenue in excess of defined recoverable costs,with some exceptions,to the account,gradually reducing its balance.settlement,b.the puc agreed to maintain the rates in effect on the settlement date with some adjustments during the rate repayment period,which was defined to end when the proact was paid down to zero or on december,whichever came first.settlement,p,w,a.a potentially longer recovery period was defined as ending when the account was completely paid down or on december,whichever came first.settlement,q.the parties agreed that,if necessary,any obligations left in the proact at the end of the rate repayment period,at the end of would be amortized in retail rates ratably during all or a portion of the remainder of the recovery period.settlement,b.
over turn objection,the federal district court entered a stipulated judgment incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement,finding the agreement adequate and fair.on turn appeal,the court of appeals resolved the federal law issues in favor of sce and puc southern california edison lynch,supra,at,but found that the settlement and stipulated judgment appeared to violate california law in certain respects and,following principles of comity id.at,tendered those state law questions to this court and stayed further proceedings pending our response id.at.we proceed to decide the certified questions.
question did the commissioners of the california public utilities commission have the authority to propose the stipulated judgment in light of the provisions of assembly bill reg.sess.codified in public utilities code sections stats,ch.
answer yes.
puc authority derives not only from statute but from the california constitution,which creates the agency and expressly gives it the power to fix rates for public utilities.cal.statutorily,puc is authorized to supervise and regulate public utilities and to do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction this includes the authority to determine and fix just,reasonable and sufficient rates to be charged by the utilities.adverting to these provisions,we have described puc as a state agency of constitutional origin with duties,functions and powers whose power to fix rates and establish rules has been liberally construed.san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,quoting consumers lobby against monopolies public utilities com.cal d.if puc lacked substantive authority to propose and enter into the rate settlement agreement at issue here,it was not for lack of inherent authority,but because this rate agreement was barred by some specific statutory limit on puc power to set rates.see assembly public utilities com.cal th,d.
turn contends,first,that puc agreement to the settlement violated a legislative directive in section,enacted as part of assembly bill,which froze rates at june levels during the transition period.in particular,turn argues the settlement illegally extend ed the freeze period.but turn errs in assuming that section requires that rates be reduced at the end of the freeze period.in this respect,section provides only that the freeze rates shall remain in effect until the earlier of march,or the date on which the costs for utility assets and obligations have been fully recovered.section does not dictate that rates be reduced,or changed in any way,at the end of the freeze period.true,section,subdivision a recites the legislature intent that a cumulative rate reduction of at least percent be achieved by april,but section consists of findings and declarations providing guidance in carrying out the provisions of assembly bill,not binding limitations on puc authority.while the legislature certainly intended its assembly bill scheme to bring down retail rates through wholesale competition,progress toward that result was delayed,to say the least,by the unanticipated rise in wholesale rates.
with more force,turn contends the settlement allowed sce to recover in the postfreeze period,in violation of section,costs incurred during the freeze period.turn relies on the third sentence of section,subdivision a,which provides the electrical corporation shall be at risk for those costs not recovered during that time period,the freeze period ending march.after careful consideration,we conclude,contrary to turn contentions,that after the enactment of assembly bill in,which required electrical utilities to retain their generating plants until at least and returned retained rates to regulation,puc was authorized to approve rates allowing sce to recover the costs covered by the settlement agreement.while assembly bill did not repeal section or reverse all aspects of electricity deregulation,it constituted a major retrenchment from the competitive approach of assembly bill,reemphasizing instead puc duty and authority to guarantee that the electric utilities would have the capacity and financial viability to provide power to california consumers.
we first consider whether,the effect of assembly bill aside,the costs slated for recovery by the settlement agreement are uneconomic costs,stranded or transition costs restricted by section.on their face they are not the settlement agreement expressly provides for postfreeze recovery of energy procurement,rather than generation,costs.under the settlement,puc agrees to maintain the rates in force at the time of the settlement until the earlier of december or the date the obligations recorded in the obligations account have been recovered.sce liabilities are tallied in schedule of the settlement,and include sce debts to banks,electricity generators,the calpx and independent system operator,and the department of water resources,which in january began purchasing electricity for sce customers.these liabilities resulted from wholesale electricity procurement costs settlement,recital d rather than from the costs for assets and obligations referred to in section,the recovery of which sections and restrict to the freeze period.
puc nevertheless maintains that the costs to be recovered in retail sales under the settlement are not procurement costs but rather sce costs which were previously called stranded costs.puc bases this characterization on an accounting change it made in march,at turn suggestion,by which sce accumulated procurement liabilities were transferred into its transition cost balancing account,which had previously been used to track recovery only of stranded costs and which was,according to sce,overcollected,in the black at that time as a result of this change,puc later determined that sce had,at the time of the settlement,a substantial amount of unrecovered transition costs.application of southern california edison,supra,cal,wl see cal.res.thus,puc explains,the effect of the settlement is to recover the large stranded cost balance in the tcba.cal.res,supra.
although puc position is consistent with its earlier determination in proceedings unrelated to this case that costs are fungible for purposes of assembly bill restrictions on cost recovery we do not fully accept for present purposes puc equation of sce procurement liabilities accumulated during the wholesale rate crisis with its unrecovered transition costs.as discussed below,sce true unrecovered transition costs appear indeterminable in light of puc failure,following the changes wrought by assembly bill,to complete the planned transition by assigning market values to sce generating assets,a step that would have reduced the transition cost balancing account balance by an unknown but potentially significant amount.but whatever the amount of sce unrecovered transition costs,there is no reason to assume it was exactly equivalent to the amount of the utility unrecovered procurement costs.even assuming that when the march accounting change was made,some amount of transition costs should have remained in sce transition cost balancing account,neither puc nor turn endeavors to explain why that amount would necessarily have been equal to the amount of sce procurement costs about billion,according to the settlement and hence,why the settlement recovery figure of billion,calculated from sce outstanding procurement liabilities,should be deemed to represent instead the exact amount of transition costs unrecovered at the time of the settlement.while the march accounting change may have been properly used to determine that the assembly bill rate freeze had not then ended see fn,ante,it should not bind us to a counterfactual characterization of all the procurement costs at issue here.
the passage of assembly bill in january introduced additional grounds against deeming recovery of procurement liabilities to be limited by section.assembly bill eliminated assembly bill requirement for market valuation of generating assets,required sce to keep its remaining generating assets until,and allowed puc to regulate the rates for power so generated pursuant to ordinary ratemaking.puc was thus authorized to permit sce such recovery of past costs as necessary to render the utility financially viable and to ensure sce would be able to continue serving its customers through electricity generated in its retained plants.in a technical sense,moreover,assembly bill largely eliminated the category of uneconomic generating asset costs,the only costs whose recovery is limited under section.since uneconomic costs are those that may become uneconomic as a result of a competitive generating market in that they may not be recoverable in market prices in a competitive market,and under assembly bill the retained assets will not be included in a competitive generating market until at least,section,as puc argues,no longer applies to the costs of the utilities.
turn concedes that assembly bill returned to regulation those generating assets sce still owned when the law was enacted the january measure,turn further concedes,meant that puc would be able to ensure,by rate regulation,that sce would be given an opportunity,in the future,to earn a return on its investment in those plants and that,consequently,t he remaining of generation is not any part of the unrecovered stranded costs.but turn argues assembly bill did not affect section mandate that sce be at risk for what turn calls the stranded costs represented by the plants it did sell,or by the depreciation expense already recorded on its retained plants during the rate freeze.the stranded costs accumulated by january were,turn argues,unrecoverable under section after the freeze period ended in march.
we are not persuaded the settlement violates section as turn claims,even if the settlement is regarded as permitting recovery of some costs rather than,as indicated on its face,only procurement costs.sce transition cost balancing account,designed to track its transition costs,was overcollected at the beginning of.even if,as turn claims,the january account balance understated sce transition costs,sce persuasively argues it also overstated such costs because it did not reflect the increased market value of sce retained generating assets in an environment of higher wholesale prices.
the process of selling,appraising,or otherwise placing a market value on the utilities generation assets,to be completed by december,subd.b,was essential to the assembly bill scheme,since the true stranded cost of an asset depended in part on its market value.see in re pacific gas electric,supra,cal.at,wl.each utility transition cost balancing account tracked not only its generating assets amortized book values and its competition transition charge revenues,but also any market valuation credits.id.at.the utilities thus expected to adjust the transition cost balancing account when assets are sold or.id.at.but according to sce,puc had never rendered a decision assigning market values to sce generation that became extremely valuable in a market in which prices had risen dramatically.the passage of assembly bill,which ended the sale of generating assets and returned them to traditional puc rate regulation,removed the rationale and opportunity for market valuation,thus preventing the transition cost balancing account from serving as a complete or accurate record of transition costs.
finally,we note that the legislature,in section,gave puc the authority to identify uneconomic costs.pursuant to that authority the agency has determined that after passage of assembly bill,costs are,for the reasons already stated,no longer uneconomic within the meaning of section.application of southern california edison,supra,cal,wl.cognizant of the principle that puc interpretation of the public utility code should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language greyhound lines,public utilities com.cal d,we are unable to reach a different conclusion here.
whether we regard the costs to be recovered under the settlement as procurement costs or as costs,therefore,they were not uneconomic costs restricted in recovery by section.consequently,puc agreement to the settlement was not in violation of assembly bill.
question did the procedures employed in entering the stipulated judgment violate the open meeting act,
the open meeting act the act applies to most state boards and commissions,including puc.see,subd.d.the purpose of the law,stated in government code section,is to ensure that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly.the act implements this policy by mandating that a ll meetings of a state body shall be open and public,by requiring advance public notice of meetings,by authorizing legal actions to prevent threatened violations of the act or declare its applicability to past or threatened future actions of a body,and to declare null and void an action taken in violation of government code sections or.action taken is defined broadly to include a collective decision of the members and a collective commitment or promise to make a positive or negative decision.
the october settlement,which the subsequent stipulated judgment implemented,was signed by the five puc commissioners and was both a collective decision of the commissioners and a collective commitment or promise to take further actions.it was thus an action taken by puc and subject,under the above provisions,to the act.the parties,moreover,agree this action was taken in a meeting,to wit,the closed or executive session of the regularly scheduled puc meeting of october.the published agenda for the october meeting listed,in the closed session section,this item conference with legal litigation.case name unspecified.disclosure of case name would jeopardize existing settlement negotiations.e a.according to puc,the commissioners unanimously approved the settlement during the closed session,then reconvened in public session to announce their action.this is confirmed by the published puc results sheet for the october meeting,which lists this item sce settlement.approved staff recommendation as modified.reconvened in public session at to announce the action taken in executive session.
puc contends taking this action in closed session did not violate the act,but,rather,was permitted under an exception to the law requirement,government code section,subdivision e,which provides as follows nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent a state body,based on the advice of its legal counsel,from holding a closed session to confer with,or receive advice from,its legal counsel regarding pending litigation when discussion in open session concerning those matters would prejudice the position of the state body in the litigation.we agree.on its face,subdivision e permits a body only to confer with and receive advice from its attorney regarding litigation.but subdivision e must be read in light of its purposes and in consonance with a closely related provision of the act,government code section,subdivision a,which allows a body to withhold the identity of litigation to be considered in closed session if to identify it would jeopardize its ability to conclude existing settlement negotiations to its advantage.italics added.read in light of its purposes and in that statutory context,government code section,subdivision e was,as will be seen below,clearly intended to permit the body not only to deliberate with counsel regarding a settlement,but actually to settle the litigation in a closed session when closure is deemed necessary to avoid prejudice to a favorable settlement.
settlement discussions with counsel are obviously an aspect of litigation particularly vulnerable to prejudice through public exposure and are thus one of the areas government code section,subdivision e was centrally intended to shelter from public revelation.in sacramento newspaper guild sacramento county board of supervisors d,the court held that the enactment of the ralph brown act,hereafter brown act,the open meeting law applicable to local public entities,was not intended to remove protection of the privilege from local government bodies deliberations with their attorneys concerning litigation.public entities have as great a need for confidential counsel from their attorneys as private litigants and should not be put at a disadvantage in litigation by depriving them of that essential assistance.sacramento newspaper guild,supra,at.in particular,the court explained,a public entity discussion with counsel about possible settlement must occur in private,for such conferences require a frank evaluation of the case strengths and weaknesses,and i f the public right to know compelled admission of an audience,the ringside seats would be occupied by the government adversary,delighted to capitalize on every revelation of weakness.id.at.accord,roberts city of palmdale cal th,d.the legislature subsequently added protective provisions to both the and brown acts,vindicating the view expounded in sacramento newspaper guild.both new provisions were phrased in the language of current government code section,subdivision e.see stats,ch,adding former subd.q to,stats,ch,adding.
in,the california attorney general office construed government code section,the brown act provision paralleling government code section,subdivision e,as authorizing a public entity to act on a settlement proposal,as well as deliberate on it,in closed session with its counsel.the attorney general noted,first,that the brown act personnel exception,has been construed to permit action on appointments and dismissals see lucas board of trustees d,even though on its face the statute authorizes only a closed session to consider such personnel matters.the parallel between section to consider and section to confer warrants similar treatment,supra,at.
the same parallel may be drawn between the corresponding provisions of the act.subdivision a of government code section permits closed sessions to consider personnel matters.though case law has not yet addressed the point,we note that the immediately following provision,subdivision a,refers to any disciplinary or other action taken against any employee at the closed session,indicating that the legislature intended,in the act as according to the attorney general in the brown act,that the government body could not only deliberate,but act,in closed session.the language used in government code section,subdivision e,permitting a body to confer with counsel on settlement of pending litigation,is not so dissimilar to that in subdivision a to consider as to warrant a different interpretation.
interpreting the brown act counsel provision,the attorney general also reasoned that consultation with counsel in the course of litigation often focuses on possible,whether to file a suit or countersuit,what claims and defenses to plead,what parties to join.conferring with counsel on these matters necessarily includes deciding on a course of action and instructing or authorizing counsel to pursue it.the same applies to settlement discussions.unless a local agency is to be a second class citizen with its opponents filling the ringside seats sacramento newspaper guild sacramento county bd.of,supra,d at,it must be able to confer with its attorney and then decide in private such matters as the upper and lower limits with respect to settlement,whether to accept a settlement or make a counter offer,or even whether to settle at all.these are matters which will depend upon the strength and weakness of the individual case as developed from conferring with counsel.a local agency of necessity must be able to decide and instruct its counsel with respect to these matters in private,supra,at.
this reasoning is equally applicable to state bodies governed by the act.in providing in,subd.e for private conferences with counsel regarding pending litigation,the legislature must have intended the scope of privacy to be broad enough to include the bodies instructions to their attorneys as to how to proceed,including whether and with what limits to negotiate settlement.the legislative purpose of placing public agencies on a roughly equal footing with private parties in litigation would otherwise be defeated.
in this case,of course,puc went beyond instructing counsel in the closed meeting of october,it actually concluded the settlement,unanimously voting to accept the proposed agreement with sce,and reconvened in public session only to announce the action taken.theoretically,the puc commissioners could instead have deliberated in private on this step,then reconvened in public session at the same or a later meeting to actually vote.but such a procedure could serve the purposes of the act only if the body announced,before the public session,the identity of the litigation proposed for settlement,for only then could the public possibly be informed of,and comment on,the substance of the proposed action.see,subds.a,g state bodies,specifically including puc,to provide opportunity for public comment during consideration of each agenda item,subd.d requirement does not apply to closed session items.to convene publicly simply to vote on an unidentified and undescribed litigation proposal,without the opportunity for meaningful public comment,would be an empty gesture,which we will not assume the legislature intended to require.
the question,then,is whether the act requires a state body,after deliberating on a proposed settlement in closed session pursuant to government code section,subdivision e,to announce its proposed decision in public the litigation accept public comment on the proposed settlement before voting on it.to this question we think government code section,subdivision a dictates a negative answer.
government code section sets forth the required procedures for closed sessions.subdivision a mandates public disclosure of the general nature of each closed session item by,for example,a listing on the public agenda.the last sentence of subdivision a provides if the session is closed pursuant to subparagraph a of paragraph of subdivision e of section pending litigation or administrative adjudications,the state body shall state the title of,or otherwise identify,the litigation to be discussed unless the body states that to do so would jeopardize the body ability to effectuate service of process upon one or more unserved parties,or that to do so would jeopardize its ability to conclude existing settlement negotiations to its advantage.italics added.
under the quoted provision,a body may decline to identify the litigation under discussion in closed session if the body states that to identify it would jeopardize the conclusion of an advantageous settlement.were the body required,after its deliberations but before actually concluding the settlement,to announce publicly the proposed settlement and the name of the litigation,the protective purpose of government code section,subdivision a would be defeated.the legislature clearly intended,in enacting government code section,subdivision a,that a state body be able to keep private the identity of litigation it is considering settling until it has conclude d the settlement assuming the body believes privacy is strategically necessary to the settlement negotiations.construing the closely related provisions of government code section,subdivision e to require a public identification of the proposed settlement,before it has been concluded,would defeat that purpose and could not have been the legislative intent 
in this case puc strictly followed the procedure mandated in government code section,subdivision a,noting in the agenda item,case name unspecified.disclosure of case name would jeopardize existing settlement negotiations.e a.to require puc,under government code section,subdivision e,to reconvene in open session and publicly announce it was considering settling sce federal litigation would subject puc to the potential loss of the very negotiating equality that government code section,subdivision a was designed to preserve.reading government code section,subdivision e in statutory context,therefore,we conclude it authorized puc not only to discuss,but also to conclude the settlement in closed session.
turn contends that even if government code section,subdivision e generally permits state bodies to take action on a settlement in closed session,another provision of that section,subdivision d,specifically required this settlement agreement to be acted on in public session because the settlement raised electricity rates.government code section,subdivision d provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,any meeting of the public utilities commission at which the rates of entities under the commission jurisdiction are changed shall be open and public.
we agree,however,with puc and sce that by agreeing to the settlement puc did not change the rates,subd.d that sce could charge for electricity.the central commitment puc made in the settlement was to maintain the then existing rates for an agreed period.settlement,a.
according to turn,the settlement agreement changed rates by making regulatory concessions to sce that turn asserts will lead to future rates higher than would otherwise obtain.government code section,subdivision d,turn argues,applies to any puc decision that results in customers paying higher rates than they would absent the action.we reject this interpretation of the statute as establishing a standard impossible to apply,because it depends on the unknowable course of future events under hypothetical conditions.had puc not settled sce federal lawsuit,sce might have won its case and rates might have been raised even higher or been kept in place longer had sce lost or continued in protracted litigation,it might have gone into bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court might have approved higher rates.this court,moreover,can not know whether at some time in the future puc would or would not have ordered rate reductions,customer refunds,or changes that might indirectly have resulted in lower rates.under turn interpretation,virtually any regulatory action would be a change in rates because puc could have taken some other action potentially leading to lower rates in the future.see toward utility rate normalization public utilities com.cal d,puc authorized no changes in rates in adopting accounting procedure that prevented otherwise automatic rate reduction.
in this case,for example,turn asserts the settlement agreement deprived customers of refunds they would otherwise have been entitled to receive for overcollection of the four cent surcharge,that is,for any collections of the surcharge not needed for current power purchases,as was the originally stated purpose of the surcharge.but turn can not show puc would,absent the settlement,have ordered refund of surcharge revenues used to pay procurement debts incurred during the crisis.while the march puc decision allowing the surcharge stated that the surcharge purpose was to pay for ongoing power purchases and that surcharge revenues were subject to refund if,at a later date,we determine that the utilities failed to use the funds to pay for future power purchases,that decision explicitly did not address recovery of past power purchase costs and other costs claimed by the utilities.application of southern california edison,supra,cal,wl.later,the puc explicitly permitted use of the surcharge revenues to pay utilities past power purchase debts.application of southern california edison,supra,cal,wl.given puc stated concern with restoring sce to reasonable financial health in order that it be able to reliably provide electric power to its customers application of southern california edison,supra,at,we can not assume puc would have taken a different regulatory course absent the settlement 
turn also cites legislative history documents indicating that the amendment adding the language in government code section,subdivision d was intended to require that meetings for any puc deliberation on rate proceedings or at which rates of entities under puc jurisdiction are considered be open and public.legis.analyst,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.ways means,staff analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.the cited history,however,does not indicate an intent to apply government code section,subdivision d to regulatory decisions other than rate changes.as the language of subdivision d reflects,the primary legislative concern was with decisions to change rates decisions leaving rates unchanged,but taking regulatory action that results in rates remaining at current levels longer than they otherwise most that can be said about the settlement agreement not clearly within the legislative purpose.for this reason,and because we have earlier found a clear legislative intent,expressed in government code sections,subdivision e and,subdivision a,to allow settlement of pending litigation without a public meeting,we conclude puc agreement to the settlement was not a meeting at which the rates of entities under the commission jurisdiction are changed for purposes of government code section,subdivision d.
question does the stipulated judgment violate section of the public utilities code by altering utility rates without a public hearing and issuance of findings 
section,subdivision a provides that no public utility shall change any rate or so alter any classification,contract,practice,or rule as to result in any new rate,except upon a showing before the commission and a finding by the commission that the new rate is justified.contrary to the premise of the certified question,section does not require puc to hold a public hearing before allowing a change in rates.indeed,the statute provides that puc may adopt rules governing the nature of the showing required and the form and manner of the presentation of the showing,with or without a hearing,subd.b,italics added see also wood public utilities commission cal d,the public utilities code does not require public hearings before rate increases or rule changes resulting in rate increases may be authorized.
section contemplates an application for a rate change by the utility and requires a showing in support of the application and a finding by puc that the change is justified.how the statutory requirements of a showing and finding might be applied to a settlement agreement,rather than an application,is unclear.but the problem in applying section is more fundamental still sce submitted no application for a change in rates.if,as appears from section,a major rate change may be made only by application see pacific bell public utilities com.th,d under and puc implementing regulations,a utility may raise rates significantly only through the process of a formal application to puc,then a settlement agreement like that in dispute here,which resolved a federal court suit rather than an application before the commission,could not include a change in rates.we need not decide whether such a reading of section is correct,however,because the settlement agreement effected no rate change subject to section 
as discussed in relation to the second certified question,puc agreed,in the settlement,to maintain sce approved rates for a specified period,rather than to change them nor did the other regulatory actions promised in the agreement change rates.turn suggests that by allowing the current rates,including the surcharge,to be used for past procurement debts,the settlement established a new rate within the meaning of section.the premise of turn argument is that,absent the settlement,rates would have been reduced when the freeze ended in march and wholesale prices dropped,making the surcharge unnecessary for current power purchases.in answering the first certified question,however,we explained that nothing in assembly bill required freeze rates to be changed after march,and in answering the second question we noted that the original restriction on use of the surcharge revenue could have been,and was,eventually removed on grounds independent of the settlement.again,to assert puc would have reduced rates at any particular time,if not bound by the settlement to maintain them,would be to speculate.turn effort to transmute a continuing rate into a new rate therefore fails.
section,moreover,contemplates a formal application for a change in rates or for alteration of some condition of service so as to create a new rate.that a utility would formally apply merely to maintain a rate appears not within the statute contemplation.the setting of a future rate to be the same as the present rate,as here,is thus not within the purview of section,which focuses more narrowly on changed or new rates,which must be pursued by application.
for these reasons,we conclude puc agreement to the settlement did not violate section requirement that a rate change or new rate be justified by a showing and finding.
conclusion 
in response to the court of appeals certified questions,we conclude that puc agreement to the settlement and stipulated judgment did not violate the provisions of assembly bill and that the procedures employed in entering the stipulated judgment did not violate either the act or public utilities code section.
i accept the majority conclusion that the terms of the settlement between the public utilities commission puc or commission and southern california edison company sce,which became the basis for a stipulated judgment in federal district court,did not exceed the commission authority under assembly bill reg.sess.assembly bill,as codified in public utilities code sections.stats,ch.unlike the majority,however,i believe the process by which the puc entered the settlement violated two other important statutes.
first,the puc contravened the open meeting act act or act,et.the commission misused an exception in the act,intended to permit closed meetings to confer with,or receive advice from,counsel about pending litigation,subd.e,to approve in secret a legal settlement in which it guaranteed sce billions of dollars in past and prospective rate relief,and thus changed the rates to be paid by sce customers,subd.d.
second,the puc acted illegally under the public utilities code,by so chang ing sce rates,through a secretly approved settlement,without any showing before the c ommission and a finding by the c ommission that the new rate was justified,subd.a,italics added.
the act was adopted to require state agencies to exercise their essential regulatory authority through public deliberations and decisions,subject to direct scrutiny and comment from the citizens whose daily lives these decisions affect.because the puc power over utility rates is especially crucial,the legislature added specific provisions,in both the act and the public utilities code,requiring the commission to make its rate decisions openly,and to follow formalities designed to ensure its determination that the approved rates are in the public interest.
the majority holding that the puc could bypass these protections if it did so to settle litigation opens the door to a widespread danger of secret government by lawsuit,in which state agencies conduct their most important regulatory business in private,through the device of settling litigation between themselves and the entities they regulate.by the same device,the majority allow the puc to engage in significant ratemaking decisions without showings or findings that the rates thereby set are just and reasonable.i can not accept such a conclusion.i therefore respectfully dissent from the majority answers to questions and certified by the ninth circuit court of appeals.
i address the two critical statutes in turn.
the majority correctly note the general outlines of the act,adopted in stats,ch,and often amended thereafter.the act states i t is the public policy of this state that the proceedings of covered state agencies be conducted openly,and declares the intent of the statute to be that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly,italics added.
accordingly,the act mandates that,except as otherwise specifically provided,a covered state body,must conduct its meetings open ly and public ly,subd.a,provide advance public notice and an agenda for each such meeting,allow members of the public to address the body on each agenda item,subd.a and permit public criticism of the body policies or actions,subd.c.the attorney general,a district attorney,or an interested person may sue to prevent future violations of the act,or to determine the applicability of the act to past or threatened future conduct by a state body,subd.a.an interested person may also sue to obtain a judicial determination that an action taken in violation of the requirements is null and void,subd.a.any member of a state body who attends a meeting of that body in violation of the act,with intent to deprive the public of information to which the member knows or has reason to know the public is entitled under the act,is guilty of a misdemeanor.except as expressly provided by the act,no closed session may be held by any state body.
a meeting includes any congregation of a majority of the members of a state body at the same time and place to hear,discuss,or deliberate upon any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the state body to which it pertains,subd.a,italics added.an action taken includes a collective decision of the members and any collective commitment or promise to make a positive or negative decision,italics added.
thus,except as otherwise specified,the act directly prohibits closed or secret meetings of state bodies to discuss or deliberate on public business,and separately provides for nullification of the actions and decisions taken at such illegal meetings.
as the majority indicate,all agree that the puc decision to approve the sce settlement was an action taken at a meeting that did not conform to the open and public requirements of the act.the puc published agenda for the regularly scheduled commissioners meeting of october,listed conference with legal litigation.case name unspecified as a matter to be discussed in closed session.as suggested by the official minutes of the october meeting,the commissioners unanimously approved the sce s ettlement during the closed discussion,then reconvened in public session to announce their action.
to validate the action taken at this closed meeting,the puc,sce,and the majority invoke an exception to the openmeeting requirements,set forth in subdivision e of government code section.subdivision e states that n othing in the act shall be construed to prevent a state body,based on the advice of its legal counsel,from holding a closed session to confer with,or receive advice from,its legal counsel regarding pending litigation when discussion in open session concerning these matters would prejudice the position of the state body in the litigation.italics added.but neither the plain meaning of this read in isolation or in the overall statutory its legislative history supports the majority conclusion that the limited right to confer with counsel in closed session connotes the additional right to take final action in secret on the matter discussed.
the majority concede that o n its face,subdivision e permits a state body only to confer with and receive advice from its attorney regarding litigation,ante,d at,at,italics added.indeed,subdivision e uses more restrictive language in this regard than the several other exceptions contained in government code section.these variously allow the state body,meeting in closed session,to consider,discuss,deliberate on,or even give instructions concerning the subject matter addressed.see,subds.a state body may consider employee personnel matters,c state body may deliberate on decision under administrative procedure act,state body may consider term,parole,or release of prisoner if public disclosure of subject matter is prohibited by statute,state body may consider conferring of honorary degrees,or gifts,donations,or bequests,where donor desires confidentiality,a state body may give instructions to negotiator regarding purchase,sale,exchange,or lease of real property,e state body may discuss eminent domain proceedings,california postsecondary education commission may consider appointment or termination of commission director,council for private postsecondary and vocational education may consider appointment or termination of council executive director,franchise tax board may consider appointment or termination of board executive officer,appropriate state body may consider investment decisions for retirement or pension funds,state body may hold closed sessions when discharging responsibilities with regard to labor negotiations,state body may consider matters posing criminal or terrorist threats to its personnel or property,d puc may deliberate on disciplinary actions against any person or entity under its jurisdiction.
moreover,government code section,subdivision e makes clear that the confer with counsel exception is not intended to grant state bodies a general license to decide in secret whether to enter settlements.instead,the purpose of subdivision e is merely to preserve for a state agency,in the context of actual,threatened,or proposed litigation see,subd.e a c,a limited form of the privilege available to private litigants for confidential communications between lawyer and client.subdivision e specifies that f or purposes of the act,all expressions of the privilege other than those provided in this subdivision are hereby abrogated.this subdivision is the exclusive expression of the privilege for purposes of conducting closed session meetings pursuant to the act.italics added.
the legislative history of subdivision e of government code section confirms that a state body privilege to confer privately with counsel about pending litigation should be construed narrowly,to cover only consultation and advice.as originally adopted,neither the act nor its counterpart,the ralph brown act brown act,et,included any reference to an agency right to meet in private to consult with its counsel or discuss litigation.a subsequent court of appeal decision,sacramento newspaper guild sacramento county bd.of suprs.d.sacramento newspaper guild,addressed whether the provision of the brown act abrogates by implication the statutory policy of evidence code sections assuring opportunity for private legal consultation by public agency clients.sacramento newspaper guild,supra,at,italics added.the court of appeal concluded that public agencies involved in actual or pending litigation,facing the same stakes and realities as private litigants,should have the same privilege as their private counterparts to the effective aid of legal counsel,and thus to the opportunity for confidential legal advice.id.at,italics added.
the court reasoned that s ettlement and avoidance of litigation are particularly sensitive activities,whose conduct would be grossly confounded,often made impossible,by undiscriminating insistence on open conferences.in settlement advice,the attorney professional task is to provide his client a frank appraisal of strength and weakness,gains and risks,hopes and fears.if the public right to know compelled admission of an audience,the ringside seats would be occupied by the government adversary,delighted to capitalize on every revelation of weakness.sacramento newspaper guild,supra,d,italics added,fn.omitted.
the legislature later codified this principle in the act by adding former subdivision q to section.stats,ch.as adopted in,former subdivision q simply provided that n othing in the act shall be construed to prevent a state body from holding a closed session to confer with legal counsel regarding pending litigation when discussion in open session concerning those matters would adversely affect or be detrimental to the public interest.
in,however,the legislature tightened and refined the act provision for private conferences with counsel concerning pending litigation.stats,ch.at that time,former subdivision q of government code section was rewritten in language roughly equivalent to that of current subdivision e.the amendment removed permission for state bodies to meet with counsel in closed session about pending litigation whenever public discussion would adversely affect the public interest.under the amendment,a consultation was allowed only when public discussion would prejudice the position of the state body in the litigation,subd.e see,former subd.q.the amendment added the further proviso that,for purposes of the act,the section is the exclusive expression of the privilege,which is otherwise abrogated.ibid.
the amendment also included the extensive discussion,now contained in government code section,subdivision e,of when litigation shall be considered pending for purposes of the privilege to confer in private with counsel.this requires that an adjudicatory proceeding before a court,an administrative body,a hearing officer,or an arbitrator,to which proceeding the state body is a party,has already been initiated existing facts and circumstances have persuaded the state body,based on counsel advice,that it faces significant exposure to litigation or based on existing facts and circumstances,the state body has decided to initiate,or is deciding whether to initiate,litigation,subd.e a,b i,c i see,former subd.q,a.
finally,the amendment added the requirement,still in effect,that counsel prepare and submit to the state body,prior to the closed session if possible,but in no event more than a week thereafter,a memorandum stating the specific reasons and legal authority for the closed session.this memorandum must include,in the case of litigation not yet formally initiated,the facts and circumstances justifying a belief that the body faces a significant exposure to litigation or should decide whether to initiate such proceedings,subd.e c ii see,former subd.q.
the source of the legislation was senate bill reg.sess.senate bill.the bill was described as codif ying the exclusive use of the privilege for the purpose of conducting closed sessions,and as allowing c losed sessions to seek the advice of legal counsel with regard to pending litigation if discussion with legal counsel in open session would prejudice the position of the public entity.assem.subcom.on admin.of justice,analysis of bill,as amended may,italics added.
urging passage of senate bill in the assembly,the california attorney general explained the concerns that had prompted the proposed legislation which made conforming amendments to both the brown and acts briefly,the problem is this several years ago the courts ruled that,absent specific legislation to the contrary,the brown act will not be construed to limit the availability of the traditional privilege to local governmental bodies.citations.this leaves public agencies with broad freedom to go into executive session for confidential discussion of virtually any issue which may involve pending litigation or the avoidance of litigation.senate bill no.will eliminate this loophole by placing clear and reasonable limitations upon when governmental agencies may hold closed meetings to discuss legal issues.it protects the legitimate need of public officials to obtain confidential legal advice on issues which may end up in litigation but does not sacrifice the public right to open meetings.in short,the bill strikes an appropriate balance between two important but often conflicting principles of public policy.john van de kamp,letter to assembly member lloyd connelly,re bill,july,italics added.
the amendments,and the accompanying analyses and comments,do not directly address whether,during a closed litigation conference,a state body may make its final decision on how to resolve the pending proceeding.however,the amendments do confirm these general principles first,government code section,subdivision e defines,and strictly limits,a state agency exercise of its privilege under the act.see roberts city of palmdale cal th,d,construing parallel provisions of the brown act.second,this privilege has been statutorily narrowed over time,and is not coextensive with a private party rights to maintain secrecy in litigation matters.third,the scope of the privilege has been carefully calibrated to allow the state body to conduct necessary private consultations with its counsel about pending litigation,while still maintaining,to the maximum possible extent,the act overall requirement of public deliberation and decision.all these circumstances suggest that the privilege must be narrowly,not broadly,construed,where final decisionmaking by the agency is at stake.
the majority expansive interpretation of the privilege contravenes these tenets.the majority imply,on the basis of obsolete authority,that the public and private privileges are coextensive,ante,d at,at,citing sacramento newspaper guild,supra,d.more importantly,the majority construction far exceeds a public agency need for confidentiality,while unduly restricting the right of the people to public decisionmaking by state agencies.
as major support for their conclusion that the provision extends beyond the limited privilege to confer with counsel,and encompasses a final decision by the state body to accept a proposed settlement,the majority cite another provision of the act,government code section,subdivision a.under this provision,a state body that intends to consult its counsel in closed session about already existing litigation must publicly identify,by name or other specific means,the litigation to be discussed unless the body states that to do so would jeopardize its ability to conclude existing settlement negotiations to its advantage,italics added.the puc availed itself of the privilege not to identify the sce settlement as the subject of its closed session on october,stating in its public agenda that d isclosure of case name would jeopardize existing settlement negotiations.
focusing on the single word conclude in government code section,subdivision a,the majority reason broadly that this must mean the state body can use the cloak of confidentiality,not only to discuss the pros and cons of settlement with its counsel,but also to conclude the settlement.but this is a thin reed for the majority to grasp.just as the inability to confer with counsel in private might compromise the agency strategy and jeopardize its ability to conclude a settlement to its advantage,a requirement that the agency prematurely identify the matter to be discussed in such a conference may also do so.but however confidential such preliminary legal discussions and negotiations may be,nothing in section,subdivision a states or implies that the agency may actually resolve pending litigation in a regulatory matter without warning that a settlement of the particular case is imminent,explaining in public the proposed settlement terms,and allowing public response,at a public meeting,before making its final decision.
certainly a state body may frankly discuss with its counsel,in private,the progress of ongoing settlement negotiations,including a candid assessment of the agency negotiating strategy,the strength and weakness of the agency position,and the gains and risks,hopes and fears a settlement entails,without affording its opponents ringside seats at these preliminary discussions.sacramento newspaper guild,supra,d.no doubt the agency may privately instruct its counsel,negotiating on its behalf,concerning terms it is inclined to accept moreover,it may well be that in subsequent public consideration of the matter,the state body need not fully disclose the concerns that it discussed privately with its counsel under cover of the privilege,even if this means the public is less than fully informed about all the reasons the agency is tentatively prepared to accept a resolution on particular terms.
but none of this implies that a final regulatory decision,framed as the settlement of a pending lawsuit,itself can be undertaken without any public scrutiny or input,as occurred here.government code sections,subdivision e and,subdivision a were not intended to provide state agencies conducting the public business with the same right private litigants may have to resolve their disputes entirely away from the public prying eyes.where significant regulatory decisions are at stake,parties involved in litigation with a state agency must understand that this is so.whatever incidental litigation disadvantage this may impose on state agencies in the conduct of their regulatory business,as opposed to individuals and organizations in the conduct of their private affairs,is a necessary corollary to the express statutory policy of public decisionmaking.
to this extent,i am not persuaded by the california attorney general construction of government code section,the brown act analog to section,subdivision e.the attorney general reasoned that the language of section a local governmental body may meet in closed session to confer with,or receive advice from,its legal counsel regarding pending litigation allows a local government body not simply to consult and confer in private on litigation matters,but also to take final action to settle a lawsuit.
for this conclusion,the attorney general first cited language in the brown act personnel exception,now contained in subdivision b of government code section,which permits closed meetings to consider the appointment,employment,evaluation of performance,discipline,or dismissal of a public employee italics added see,subd.a parallel act personnel exception.noting that several court of appeal decisions had construed the personnel exception to permit not only deliberation,but final action,the attorney general asserted that the operative word consider in the personnel exception,and the operative word confer in the exception,were enough alike to dictate a similar interpretation of the latter provision,supra,at.
the attorney general also reasoned that a public agency right to confer with counsel in secret about confidential litigation and settlement strategy necessarily implies the further right to decide,in confidence,what course to take.otherwise,the attorney general cautioned,an agency litigation adversaries would have ringside seats for its decisions,and public litigants would be citizen s,at a disadvantage compared to their private counterparts,supra,at,quoting sacramento newspaper guild,supra,d.
for reasons i have already discussed at length,i believe these conclusions are flawed.the words of the and personnel exceptions,respectively,are materially different.the former permits the public entity only to confer with,or receive advice from,its counsel in private,subd.e,while the latter,by its use of the broader word consider,subd.a,specifically allows active deliberation on the issue under discussion.in light of the narrowing of the privilege,and given the overall statutory policy of open deliberations and actions,these linguistic distinctions should not be conflated to allow a broad right of agencies to settle regulatory litigation in private.
moreover,as we have seen,the current exception is not intended to afford public agencies litigation privacy entirely equivalent to that enjoyed by private parties.instead,the statutory exception seeks to balance competing policies by providing a limited,and exclusive,form of confidentiality for public agencies,while interfering as little as possible with the fundamental requirement that the collective actions of such agencies be taken in public.thus,the exception does not imply a loophole allowing agencies covered by the act to meet in secret to make final decisions on matters of significant regulatory interest.
in this age of litigation,the majority contrary conclusion opens the door to secret government by lawsuit,allowing governmental bodies to exercise significant portions of their regulatory authority in private by the device of settling lawsuits between themselves and the entities they regulate.i can not accept such a weakening of the clear purposes of the act.i conclude that subdivision e of government code section did not permit the puc to act in secret to finally approve a settlement of its litigation with sce.
but even if government code section,subdivision e generally allowed state bodies to approve regulatory settlements in closed session,respondent the utility reform network turn correctly urges that the puc approval of this particular settlement nonetheless violated the act.turn points to another portion of section d that deals specifically with this agency and the subject matter of this settlement.section,subdivision d provides that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,any meeting of the public utilities commission at which the rates of entities under the c ommission jurisdiction are changed shall be open and public.italics added.by any common understanding,the puc agreement to entry of the stipulated judgment in sce federal action constituted the commission commitment to change the electricity rates sce could charge.
as the majority indicate,the parties to the october settlement agreed that,because of falling wholesale electricity prices during,sce existing rates had allowed sce to collect retail revenues in excess of current costs,ante,d at,at.among other components,these rates included emergency surcharges,totaling four cents per,which the puc had granted to sce,and to pacific gas and electric company pg e,in early,at a time of very high wholesale power prices.when the puc granted these surcharges,it had restricted their application to future power purchases,not past liabilities,and had made surcharge revenues refundable to ratepayers to the extent not used for this limited purpose.application of southern california edison cal,wl application of southern california edison cal,wl.
in the settlement,however,the puc agreed,as its principal substantive concession,ante,d at,at,to permit sce to recover certain past costs by applying the overcollections already in sce,its cash on hand ibid.to this purpose and maintaining sce existing rates until the end of,if necessary,to allow further such recovery,italics added.the settlement called for the establishment of a tracking account,known as proact,that would record sce progress toward recouping these costs.ibid.proact initial balance would be the gross amount of sce accumulated past liabilities subject to amount the parties agreed to be about the surplus sce had already collected,at,at.under this formula,the initial proact balance was estimated at some billion,at,at.the settlement rates would remain in effect until the proact account was paid down to zero or december,whichever came first.citation.ibid.
the settlement thus authorized three fundamental change s in sce rates.first,it either provided,or extended,a guaranteed duration to the rates in existence at the time of the settlement second,it cancelled,nunc pro tunc,ratepayers rights to refunds of amounts sce had already collected under the surcharges,but had not used for ongoing power purchases as the terms of those surcharges originally required.third,it removed,for the future,the original limitation on sce use of the surcharges.that allowed sce to continue to assess the surcharges,and to retain the revenues therefrom,under circumstances not permitted by the original terms and conditions of these special rates.
the majority insist the puc did not agree in the settlement to change sce rates,but only made a commitment to maintain the then existing rates for an agreed period,ante,d at,at.this pinched and hypertechnical analysis ascribes too narrow a meaning to the broad statutory phrase rates are changed,subd.d.surely it does not comport with the legislative purpose to ensure that the puc core ratemaking decisions be open and public.
the complex and crucial task of ratemaking does not simply set the amount of money a utility may charge for a unit of service at any particular moment.it also necessarily establishes the terms and conditions attached to the authorized charge.when,as here,the puc agrees to grant or extend a rate freeze,or alters the circumstances under which a rate may be charged or its revenues retained,it change s the rate.
the majority reject turn argument that the settlement changed rates because it will lead to higher future rates than customers would otherwise have paid.this is an impossible standard to apply,the majority reason,because it depends on the unknowable course of future events under hypothetical conditions,ante,d at,at.in other words,the majority explain,for all we know,events other than the settlement,whether regulatory,legal,or economic,would have produced those same future rates.
this rationale misses the point.the settlement effect was to provide,or extend,the guaranteed duration of a rate,allow sce to retain past and future surcharge revenues that would otherwise have been subject to refund,and thereby narrow the opportunity for electricity customers to obtain rebates,or to enjoy lower future rates,based on the conditions that might then prevail.in making these fundamental alterations in the structure of sce existing rates,the settlement changed the rates.and the effect on sce ratepayers was hardly minimal.the settlement avowed purpose was to enable sce to secure from its customers billions of dollars in excess of current operational costs that were deemed necessary to restore sce to financial health 
the legislature can not have meant to allow ratemaking decisions with such significant effect on the public to escape the requirement set forth in subdivision d of government code section.indeed,this is confirmed by the legislative history of subdivision d,a factor discounted by the majority.the substance of present subdivision d was adopted in as part of former subdivision p.stats,ch.legislative analyses of this provision,as enacted by senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,frequently described its effect as prohibiting the puc from holding closed sessions for deliberation on rate proceedings legis.analyst,analysis of bill,as amended,see also assem.of.of research,dig.for assem d reading of bill,as amended,and as requiring any puc meeting where rates are considered to be open and public assem.ways means,staff analysis of bill,as amended june.
the puc urges that even if its initial acceptance of the settlement in closed session violated the act requirement,the commission cure d or correct ed the violation,subd.a by two subsequent actions taken in public meetings.but the two actions the puc cites merely implemented the terms of a settlement,and the resulting stipulated judgment,already reached in violation of the act.
by resolution no,the commission simply granted,with minor modifications,sce request to establish the proact account called for by the settlement.no.indeed,in the resolution,the puc rebuffed an argument by the california manufacturers technology association that granting sce request would impermissibly change certain prior commission decisions.according to the puc,this issue argue d the legality of the s ettlement,which was beyond the scope of the proceeding then before the commission,at.
the puc also points to its decision,which modified application of southern california edison,supra,cal.decision.as indicated above,decision,issued in march,had granted both pg e and sce a surcharge and had also made permanent an additional surcharge granted to those utilities in january,but had restricted use of these surcharges to ongoing power procurement and made them otherwise refundable.decision relaxed this restriction by allowing the surcharges to be used both for future power purchases and for the more general purpose of returning each utility to financial health.application of southern california edison cal,wl.
but decision neither mentioned the sce settlement nor reflected any effort to reconsider its terms.moreover,as applied to sce,repeal of prior restrictions on use of the surcharge had already occurred by virtue of the settlement,and was required in any event by the resulting stipulated judgment in the federal action,entered october.nothing in decision indicates it was a sincere and effectual attempt by the commission to reassess the sce settlement itself in an open and public meeting 
for all these reasons,i would answer yes to the ninth circuit question whether the puc approval of the sce settlement in a closed session violated the act.
public utilities code section.
as indicated above,the public utilities code separately provides,in pertinent part,that no public utility shall change any rate or so alter any classification,contract,practice,or rule as to result in any new rate,except upon a showing before the c ommission and a finding by the c ommission that the new rate is justified,subd.a section a,italics added.the obvious purpose of the statute is to require a demonstration by the utility,and a resulting determination by the commission,that the rate change is just and reasonable.
as discussed above,the settlement between the puc and sce constituted their agreement to a change in sce rates.the settlement either froze rates or extended a freeze already in effect.it eliminated,for both past and future purposes,prior restrictions on sce use of the surcharges.it cancelled ratepayers rights,both past and future,to refunds of surcharge amounts overcollected by sce under the terms and conditions originally applicable to these rates.it thus afforded sce the opportunity to recover from its ratepayers some billion in liabilities already accrued by sce,with approximately billion of that amount to appear on their future electricity bills.insofar as the puc accepted this change without resort to the requirements of public utilities code section a,it acted illegally 
sce and the puc argue that even if the settlement did authorize a change in sce rates,public utilities code section a has no relevance here.according to sce and the puc,the statute and its implementing regulations are concerned solely with the procedures by which a utility may seek the commission approval to change the utility tariff,or published schedule of rates see,subd.a,cal.order,vi pacific bell public utilities com.th,d procedures that simply do not pertain to a settlement and stipulated judgment in a lawsuit.see also,ante,d at,at.
moreover,sce and the puc insist,a utility may change its rates only through the formal alteration of its tariff.see pub,subd.a,cal.order,supra,vi see also transmix southern pacific d.as sce and the puc observe,any modification of sce tariff did not occur directly by virtue of the settlement and stipulated judgment,but only through implementing decisions,such as resolution no.see discussion,ante,that resulted from formal commission proceedings.hence,these parties conclude,the settlement itself did not violate public utilities code section a.
neither sce nor the puc cites authority holding that the commission may authorize a utility rate change,by means of a legal settlement,without complying with the basic requirements of public utilities code section a.the majority in this case deliberately avoid that issue by concluding,erroneously in my view,that the instant settlement involved no change in sce rates,ante,d at,at.
in any event,the technical arguments advanced by sce and the puc obscure the fundamental purpose of the scheme for public utility regulation.such utilities are subject to control by the legislature cal,art.xii,which has mandated in the public utilities act that their rates be just and reasonable.regulatory authority over the rates of public utilities is vested in the commission cal,art.xii,which is responsible,through specified procedures,to assure that these rates meet the just and reasonable standard required by law,a.allowing the commission to use a legal settlement to grant a significant change in a utility rates,without resort to a showing and finding that the change is just and reasonable,fundamentally undermines this regulatory structure.it invites such utility litigation as a means of the established regulatory process.
as turn suggests,the contention by sce and the puc that rates are change d,for purposes of public utilities code section a,only upon completion of the process unduly elevates the ministerial act of implementing rate changes already mandated,in essential outline,by a prior commission decision.section a is superfluous unless it means that the fundamental determination whether a proposed change in rates is to be allowed at all can be made only upon a showing and finding,under normal regulatory procedures,that the change is just and reasonable.
i recognize that the regulatory process for approving rate changes is not readily compatible with the practicalities of settling lawsuits.my conclusion that public utilities code section a nonetheless applies may well mean that the commission simply can not engage in significant ratemaking by such means.but any disadvantage this may ascribe to the commission,or to a financially distressed utility,in a particular case is outweighed by the overarching regulatory policy of assuring that the rates paid by california utility customers are just and reasonable.
for all these reasons,i would answer yes to the ninth circuit question whether the settlement and stipulated judgment between sce and the puc violated public utilities code section.
all further st
