the electricity consumers resource council elcon challenges two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission approving a rate design for the installed capacity market administered by the new york independent system operator,nyiso.see indep.operator,wl,initial order ny indep.operator,wl,rehearing order.while maintaining that the commission orders violate both the just and reasonable ratemaking standard of the federal power act fpa,a,and the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act apa,a,elcon urges a heightened standard of review for incentive ratemaking requiring the commission to demonstrate that the rate increase is no more than necessary to achieve its purpose of encouraging investment in new generation facilities in new york state.because we conclude that the rate design does not impose an incremental rate increase above traditional rates but rather seeks to stabilize rates to promote the development and retention of installed capacity,there is no basis for applying a heightened standard of review.upon applying the usual apa standard,we conclude that the commission approval of the rate design is supported by substantial evidence in the record and is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
to prevent electricity shortages during periods of peak demand,the new york state reliability council required retail utilities,known as load serving entities lses,to purchase installed capacity icap equal to of their peak loads.see initial order,at.if an lse failed to procure the required amount of icap through its own supply or through bilateral contracts,it was required to purchase the deficient quantity through nyiso auctions,at which the price equaled a deficiency charge of per,or three times the annualized cost of installing a new peaker power plant.see id.this rate design resulted in a vertical demand curve for icap,with the price equal to for all quantities up to,and for all quantities exceeding.see id.according to nyiso,the vertical demand curve caused extreme volatility in icap prices,thus discouraging investment in new generation facilities and creating the potential for a capacity deficiency in new york state.id.at.
to address this problem,nyiso applied to the commission for approval of amendments to its tariff to incorporate a new rate design replacing the vertical demand curve with a sloped icap demand curve,which would be used in monthly auctions to determine both the quantity and price of required id.for of peak load,the price would equal the annualized cost of a new peaker plant.see id.as supply increased above,the price would gradually decrease until it reached zero for of peak load,and as supply decreased below,the price would gradually increase until it reached a maximum of two times the annualized cost of a new peaker plant.see id.
each month,capacity suppliers,including lses with excess capacity,would bid into an icap auction and create the supply curve the point of intersection between the supply curve and the icap demand curve would determine the quantity and price of required icap.see id.at.if the monthly auction yielded a quantity less than of peak load,nyiso would purchase the deficient amount outside the auction market and charge each lse a supplemental supply fee equal to times the annualized cost of a new peaker plant.see id.at.nyiso also proposed a periodic independent review of the demand curve every three years to determine whether adjustments are warranted.id.
elcon,which represents industrial consumers of electricity,intervened and protested the new rate design,arguing that it would increase electricity prices for consumers without spurring investment in new generation capacity,and that it violated incentive ratemaking case law because the icap demand curve was not carefully calibrated to increase investment in new generation facilities without granting a windfall to existing capacity suppliers.the commission approved nyiso rate design with modifications,finding that it would benefit customers because it would provide better price signals to investors for construction of new generation,encourage the formation of bilateral transactions,and reduce incentives to withhold capacity.id.at.the commission agreed with nyiso that the icap demand curve would encourage greater investment in generation capacity and thus improve reliability,by reducing the volatility of icap revenues,and concluded that it would provide net benefits especially compared with the existing vertical demand curve.id.at.the commission eliminated the supplemental supply fee based on the concern that suppliers would withhold capacity from the monthly icap auction in order to sell capacity at the higher price of the supplemental supply fee.see id.at.characterizing the icap demand curve as a novel proposal requiring some measure of judgment in setting the specific parameters,and observing that it will be important to evaluate and monitor the appropriateness of these parameters after some experience is gained,the commission required nyiso to file a detailed evaluation of the demand curve and its implementation by december,and annually for two years thereafter.id.at.the commission denied elcon petition for rehearing and approved nyiso proposal to set the supplemental supply fee equal to the monthly icap auction price.see rehearing order,at.this petition for review followed.
the court ordinarily reviews the commission orders to determine whether they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see pub.utils.comm ferc.such review is limited to whether the commission has examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action,including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mutual auto.ins,d quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.specifically,our review of whether a particular rate design is just and reasonable is highly deferential because i ssues of rate design are fairly technical and,insofar as they are not technical,involve policy judgments that lie at the core of the regulatory mission.pub.utils.comm n,at alteration in original quoting power partners,ferc,internal quotation marks omitted.the commission factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record,b,and the court defers to the commission resolution of factual disputes between expert witnesses,see.valley improvement ferc.
elcon contends that the challenged orders are subject to a heightened standard of review because the icap demand curve is neither nor but rather administratively constructed to encourage investment in new generation capacity.according to elcon,the commission must demonstrate that such incentive ratemaking is in fact needed,and is no more than is needed,for the purpose.city of detroit fed.power comm n.in support of this heightened standard of review,elcon cites a line of cases involving the commission approval of incremental rate increases above rates to encourage increases in energy supply.see,farmers union cent,ferc,city of charlottesville ferc,pub.serv.comm ferc,city of detroit,at.elcon also cites the commission policy statement on incentive ratemaking,which states that the commission is free to set rates above rates to provide incentives so long as there is a correlation between the incentive and the result to be induced.incentive ratemaking for interstate natural gas pipelines,oil pipelines,and electric utilities,wl.elcon maintains that the new rate design violates the incentive ratemaking case law and the policy statement because it offers increased revenues to all capacity suppliers,regardless of whether they invest in new generation facilities.in elcon view,the new rate design grants a windfall to existing capacity suppliers at the expense of lses and their customers.
in the initial order,the commission explained that the incentive ratemaking cases and the policy statement were inapplicable to the icap demand curve because they involved incremental rate increases levied upon all customers,whereas icap charges are not automa
