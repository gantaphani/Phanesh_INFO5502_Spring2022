worldcom,and time warner telecom of minnesota,llc collectively worldcom appeal the district court entry of a permanent injunction barring the minnesota public utilities commission from requiring appellee qwest corporation to provide worldcom with reports regarding the provision of certain telecommunications services.because we conclude that the federal communications commission fcc has not preempted the authority of the minnesota public utilities commission in this area,we reverse.
qwest corporation is an incumbent provider of local telephone services in minnesota.long distance providers,such as worldcom,rely on local telephone providers,such as qwest,to connect customers to their long distance networks.one method of connecting local and long distance networks is through a special access line,which provides a direct connection from a home or business to a long distance network through a dedicated line,rather than through the switched public telephone network.special access services generally are used by entities,such as large businesses or public institutions,that engage in a high volume of long distance telephone calling,and also allow for the provision of internet connections to homes and businesses.
because of alleged discrimination and quality problems in the provision of special access services by qwest formerly west,referred to herein as qwest,at t communications of the midwest filed a complaint with the minnesota public utilities commission minnesota commission on august.on august,over qwest objection,the minnesota commission asserted jurisdiction over the regulation of qwest performance,and found that an investigation should be opened to determine whether quality standards should be developed for qwest.communications of the midwest,west communications,docket no,at,wl.the minnesota commission also ordered qwest to conform to detailed reporting requirements.id.at.
the investigation arising out of the at t complaint was consolidated with a separate proceeding,which examined the quality of qwest provision of various wholesale services to numerous other telecommunications companies,including worldcom.following consolidation,the minnesota commission heard worldcom proposed measurement plan for special access services.on march,the minnesota commission issued an order requiring qwest to provide reports regarding special access performance data to at t and worldcom,in accordance with worldcom suggested requirements.in the matter of qwest wholesale serv.quality standards,docket no,at,wl.march.it did so over qwest continued assertion that the minnesota commission lacked jurisdiction to require such reports.id.qwest petition for reconsideration of this order was denied by the minnesota commission.see in the matter of qwest wholesale serv.quality standards,docket no,at,wl.may.
qwest brought suit in district court,alleging that the minnesota commission lacked jurisdiction to require qwest to comply with the reporting requirements.the district court found that the fcc has exclusive jurisdiction over lines that the fcc classified as interstate through a federal regulatory procedure known as jurisdictional separations,and that the minnesota commission reporting requirements were preempted with respect to those lines.the district court therefore granted qwest motion for a permanent injunction as to those special access lines which had been classified as interstate,leaving the minnesota commission able to regulate only those lines that had been classified as intrastate through the fcc jurisdictional separations process.
a district court grant of a permanent injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion,forest park ii hadley,cir,but where,as here,the determinative question is purely legal,our review is more accurately characterized as de novo.see united states blue bird,cir.
the communications act of the act,codified at et,established a system of dual state and federal regulation over telephone service.louisiana pub.serv.comm fcc,d louisiana psc.the fcc has authority to regulate interstate wire and radio communications,but the act specifically denies the commission jurisdiction to regulate intrastate communication services,and leaves that authority with the states.b smith illinois bell.while it may,at first blush,seem a simple matter to divide communication services between intrastate and interstate categories,the realities of technology and economics belie such a clean parceling of responsibility.louisiana psc,at.
this clean parceling is not possible,because facilities and equipment used to provide intrastate telecommunications services often are used for interstate telecommunications services as well.such facilities are conceivably within the jurisdiction of both state and federal authorities,and are described by the fcc as jurisdictionally mixed or mixed use facilities,southwestern bell.fcc,cir.the special access lines at issue in this case are in the mixed use category,because they carry both interstate and intrastate traffic.
recognizing that conflicts may emerge because of this dual regulatory system,the act establishes a process designed to resolve what is known as jurisdictional separations matters,by which process it may be determined what portion of an asset is employed to produce or deliver interstate as opposed to intrastate service.louisiana psc,at.citing c,c.the supreme court explained that b ecause the separations process literally separates costs such as taxes and operating expenses between interstate and intrastate service,it facilitates the creation or recognition of distinct spheres of regulation.id.the fcc has promulgated regulations entitled jurisdictional separations procedures.according to the commission,the procedures are designed primarily for the allocation of property costs,revenues,expenses,taxes and reserves between state and interstate jurisdictions.b.
in,the fcc revised the jurisdictional separations procedures for mixed use special access lines,such as the lines at issue in this case,which carry both interstate and intrastate traffic.see in the matter of mts and wats mkt.structure,amendment of part of the commission rules and establishment of a joint,at,wl order.the fcc explained that prior to this revision,the cost of special access lines carrying both state and interstate traffic was generally assigned to the interstate jurisdiction.id.at.this allocation was known as the contamination doctrine any interstate traffic was deemed to contaminate the service,even when the facilities involved were physically located intrastate.see in the matter of mts and wats mkt.structure,amendment of part of the commission rules and establishment of a joint,at,wl recommendation.the contamination doctrine was criticized because it deprived state regulators of authority over largely intrastate private line systems that carried only small amounts of interstate traffic to otherwise intrastate lines.order,at.
the commission therefore adopted a rule known as the ten percent rule,under which interstate traffic is deemed de minimis when it amounts to ten percent or less of the total traffic on a special access line.under the ten percent rule,the cost of a mixed use line is directly assigned to the interstate jurisdiction only if the line carries interstate traffic in a proportion greater than ten percent.id.at,see also a b.the fcc concluded that the new rule would resolve existing concerns in a manner that reasonably recognizes state and federal regulatory interests and fosters administrative simplicity and economic efficiency.order,at footnote omitted.
the question presented in this case is whether the order issued by the fcc through its jurisdictional separations procedure preempts the minnesota commission authority to regulate the quality of special access services on interstate lines provided by qwest and other companies.does the order allocate between federal and state jurisdictions all regulatory authority over special access lines based on the ten percent traffic threshold,or was the fcc intent more limited worldcom argues that the ten percent rule is only a cost allocation measure,and does not assign to the fcc exclusive regulatory a
