southern california water company,a public utility that distributes electricity to retail customers in san bernardino county,california,challenges two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission.it contends that the commission misapplied the concept of incremental cost as used in the western system power pool wspp agreement as a result,southern california says,ferc incorrectly found that a sale of electricity by southern california violated statutory filing requirements for the making of jurisdictional sales.see federal power act.because the commission failed to explain its interpretation of incremental cost adequately,we reverse and remand.
at the beginning of march,southern california was committed to buying electricity for its retail customers in two wholesale contracts a baseload contract with dynegy power marketing for megawatts mw of energy at per mwh,and a contract with illinova energy partners iep to meet any hourly demand in excess of mw at,a name given the spot market price in the south of path zone,a common delivery point.dynegy later assumed iep obligations,but for ease in distinguishing between the baseload and the contracts we refer to this as the iep contract.as the dynegy contract was scheduled to expire on april,southern california entered into a contract with mirant americas energy marketing on march to purchase mw of energy at a price of.the contract was under the wspp agreement,which the parties identified as the enabling agreement.
for reasons not entirely clear,the mirant baseload contract was to start april,and thus overlapped with the dynegy baseload contract for the month of april.to address this overlap,southern california entered into a separate contract with mirant on march,again under the wspp agreement,agreeing this time to sell mirant mw of energy for the month of april at a price of minus.although the overlap of baseload contracts obviously occasioned southern california interest in making such a sale,the contract was not formally tied to or contingent on the mirant baseload contract.in the immediate to the march contract,the price fluctuated between a peak high of about and an low of about.these were historically high prices march fell in the midst of california electricity crisis.
at the time of the april sale,southern california had no authority to sell energy at prices.in july,in a move unrelated to the april sale,it applied to the commission for such authority.mirant intervened,seeking a refund and contending that the april sale was itself at rates.the commission granted southern california the requested authority prospectively,southern california water,ferc,but simultaneously initiated an inquiry into the april sale.
southern california defended the sale on the ground that the rates were not but,as they fell it argued within the wspp agreement provision that prices must not exceed the seller forecasted incremental cost plus a adder.it argued that the relevant incremental cost was,the price that it would pay iep for the last unit needed to meet the obligation to mirant whenever its total sales commitments,the sum of its retail customers demand,which typically ran between and mw,with occasional deviations in both directions,see joint appendix,and the mw needed for the april sale to mirant exceeded the mw that it could count on from its baseload contracts with dynegy and mirant.
the commission rejected this defense,classified the sale as having been at rates and therefore unauthorized,and ordered a refund of the difference between the revenue collected under the contract and the price under southern california baseload contract with mirant,plus interest.see ferc compliance order,order on reh g,ferc rehearing order.in denying rehearing the commission explained its rejection of the argument that equaled incremental cost under the wspp agreement,saying that would only be southern california incremental cost once the sale to mirant is consummated.rehearing order,ferc at p,emphasis added.in addition,the commission relied on the arguments that southern california simply resold to mirant the same energy that it bought,ferc at p,and that the incremental cost could not have been because exceeded its sale price of minus,ferc at p.
in a later order the commission reduced the refund by the amount of an adder,which the wspp agreement allowed in excess of incremental costs for all sales under the agreement that were not at rates.the commission explained that it now understood that the agreement permitted sellers to charge the adder on top of the forecasted incremental cost,because the agreement made no distinction between owned resources and purchase contracts.southern california water company,ferc at p.
southern california challenges the compliance order and the rehearing order as being arbitrary and capricious,a,and as unsupported by substantial evidence,b.
the crux of the case is whether the commission coherently explained its conclusion that the price of southern california april sale to mirant exceeded the ceiling established by the wspp california forecasted incremental cost.the agreement defines that term as t he forecasted expense incurred by the seller in providing an additional increment of energy or capacity during a given hour.western systems power pool agreement.
the commission prior orders have shed little interpretive light on the phrase.in initially approving the agreement,the commission said that the seller incremental cost for setting ceiling prices should be forecasted at the time of specific transactions under an agreement to reflect the actual cost with greater certainty and that incremental cost may be forecasted hourly,weekly,or monthly,western systems power pool,ferc western systems power pool i,order on reh g,ferc at western systems power pool ii,aff sub,environmental action ferc.in el paso electric,ferc,the commission approved el paso incremental cost methodology without explanation,but did make clear that a firm without authority for sales could sell under wspp ceiling,a point confirmed in northpoint energy solutions,ferc.
at the outset the commission understanding of incremental cost seems hard to square with the language of the wspp agreement.recall that wspp defines incremental cost as the forecasted expense incurred by the seller in providing an additional increment of energy or capacity during a given hour emphasis added.the commission objection to southern california reading of the agreement was that would only be its incremental cost once the sale to mirant is consummated.rehearing order,ferc at p,emphasis added.in other words,the commission faults southern california for taking the projected sale into account,evidently reading the agreement in providing to mean without providing.this linguistic twist might itself be grounds for reversal.
once we try to set the language in a purposive context the commission approach appears still odder.consider a seller with physical capacity,the type for which the wspp agreement was originally contemplated.see western systems power pool i,ferc at.a seller with a portfolio of facilities can typically minimize the overall cost of providing any given total quantity by drawing on those facilities in increasing order of cost.moreover,it seems plain that when contemplating an extra sale,the supplier must look at the facilities actually needed to make its total sales the new one and those already contracted.

this is laid out in figure,with the panel depicting costs as continuously increasing.see paul samuelson william nordhaus,economics ed.better fitted to our case,and to the ordinary electricity market,is the situation depicted in the panel,with cost levels coming in discrete segments.in that panel the seller owns three generating facilities,a,b,and c,with costs of mwh,and and capacities of producing,and any foreseeably needed extra amount,respectively.if the seller at the outset has no commitments and then sells mw of electricity to buyer,costs are minimized if it produces at facility a.the incremental cost of that cost of providing an additional mwh of clearly be mwh.as the seller increases its simultane
