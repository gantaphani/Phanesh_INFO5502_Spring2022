the district court had previously awarded partial summary judgment to the charles machine works cmw,finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact that misstatements and omissions made by the inventor,john mercer,during prosecution of the patents in suit were material.digital control,v.the charles mach.works,no,summary judgment.after a bench trial on the issue of intent,the district court determined that the misstatements and omissions were made with intent to deceive the united states patent and trademark office pto and that the level of materiality and the inference of intent were both high,warranting a finding that the patents were unenforceable for inequitable conduct.bench trial,slip op.at.
for the reasons stated below,we find that although there are no genuine issues of material fact as to the materiality of the misstatements in mercer rule declaration,there are genuine issues of material fact as to the materiality of mercer failure to disclose prior art.as the district court determination of inequitable conduct was premised on the materiality of both the misstatements in the rule declaration and the failure to disclose prior art,we must vacate the district court determination that the patents were unenforceable for inequitable conduct and remand for further proceedings.
the patents in suit involve horizontal directional drilling hdd,which enables creation of horizontal bores in the ground through which utility lines can be laid by allowing a worker to pinpoint the location orientation of a boring tool as it moves through the ground.generally,hdd devices involve an underground transmitter attached to a boring tool and receivers which are either stationary or,in a system,are held by a worker walking over the tool.conventional technology involves a display that shows the orientation or location of the tool,which is specified using values for pitch,yaw,and roll.
in,mercer filed the first in a series of related patent applications regarding hdd locating technology in,mercer filed a continuation application that later issued as the patent the patent claims a method of monitoring the orientation of a boring tool that is disposed within the ground,said method involving a sensor arrangement,which detects the orientation of the boring tool,and a separate transmitter that can communicate via an electromagnetic signal to an locator or receiver.that receiver,in turn,creates a visual representation of the orientation of the boring tool.patent,ll.
as illustrated in the specification at figure,reproduced above,an operator holding the receiver uses it to locate the surface position directly above the tool head and then to determine the depth and orientation yaw,pitch,and roll of the tool head.
representative claim of the patent reads as follows 
in a technique for locating a boring tool which is disposed within the ground,a method of monitoring the orientation of the boring tool,said method comprising the steps of 
a providing the boring tool with a sensor arrangement including an orientation sensor which senses at least one particular component of the orientation of the boring tool and separate transmitter means for transmitting a corresponding electromagnetic signal from the boring tool 
b providing an locator with a visual orientation display and with a receiver arrangement which receives said electromagnetic orientation signal and which converts it to a corresponding orientation display driving electric signal 
c with the boring tool in the ground at a specific orientation and the locator above ground,causing the sensor arrangement to transmit electromagnetic orientation signals corresponding to the particular orientation component of the boring tool specific orientation 
d thereafter causing said receiver arrangement to produce in response to said electromagnetic signal a corresponding orientation display driving electric signal and 
e using said visual orientation display,visually displaying at the locator the particular orientation component of the boring tool specific orientation in response to said orientation display driving electric signal.
approximately half of the claims of the patent were initially rejected by the pto on the ground that they were obvious in light of patent the rider patent.in order to overcome that rejection,mercer submitted a declaration under pto rule the rule declaration,whereby he submitted a sworn affidavit establishing that he had reduced his invention to practice prior to the effective date of the prior art reference,in this case,june.mercer colleague,john olsen,also submitted a brief declaration to the pto stating that he had read mercer declaration and that he could confirm that john mercer showed me and operated for me in confidence the complete system referred to in that paragraph at the meeting recited therein.decl.of olsen dated,at.finding that mercer rule declaration was sufficient to overcome the rider reference,the examiner withdrew the rejection.
in addition,during prosecution of the patent,mercer disclosed patent the geller patent and patent the chau patent,both of which list mercer as a,as well as patent the bridges patent.patent,ll,ll.however,mercer did not disclose patent the rorden patent,although he had submitted that patent as prior art in regard to a separate,unrelated patent application,patent,filed on april.

determining at summary judgment that a patent is unenforceable for inequitable conduct is permissible,but uncommon.a genuine issue of material fact is not raised by the submission of merely conclusory statements or completely insupportable,specious,or conflicting explanations or excuses.monsanto bayer bioscience,quoting paragon podiatry,klm.thus,we have upheld grants of summary judgment on inequitable conduct where,for example,the affidavits submitted to explain the representations made to the pto were bare declaration s of lack of intent to mislead and the explanations provided in the affidavits were either nonresponsive or lacked evidentiary support.id.quoting paragon podiatry,at.however,we have refused summary judgment where the plaintiff submitted an affidavit that set forth a explanation that could lead a finder of fact to determine that his declaration to the pto was not false or misleading,id.at,or where the plaintiff state d facts supporting a plausible justification or excuse for the misrepresentation,id.quoting paragon podiatry,at.
before reviewing de novo the district court determination that cmw was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of materiality,we must address the proper standard for determining whether a misstatement or omission is material.for many years,we have held that materiality for purposes of an inequitable conduct determination require s a showing that a reasonable examiner would have considered such prior art important in deciding whether to allow the parent application.dayco,total containment,quoting driscoll cebalo.this standard is based in part on the standard of materiality articulated in the pto rule,which describes the duty of candor and good faith,otherwise known as the duty of disclosure,before the pto.see a.however,in,the pto amended rule,creating an arguably narrower standard of materiality.see dayco,at noting that the pto amended its rules to provide a different standard for materiality.the new rule reads as follows 
i nformation is material to patentability when it is not cumulative to information already of record or being made of record in the application,and 
it establishes,by itself or in combination with other information,a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim or 
it refutes,or is inconsistent with,a position the applicant takes in i opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the office,or ii asserting an argument of patentability.
a prima facie case of unpatentability is established when the information compels a conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of evidence,standard,giving each term in the claim its broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification,and before any consideration is given to evidence which may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of patentability.
although we have affirmed findings of materiality based upon the new rule standard,see,purdue pharma endo pharms,slip op.at,wl,and bruno indep.living aids,acorn mobility,we have declined to address whether the new rule standard replaced the old reasonable examiner standard,see dayco,at.that is,we have not yet determined whether the new rule is the same as the reasonable examiner standard of the old rule,or,if the new standard is narrower,whether a misstatement that is material under the reasonable examiner standard,but arguably not material under the new rule standard,still meets the threshold level of materiality required for a finding of inequitable conduct.
however,this is not the first time that this court has been faced with applying more than one standard of materiality.the inequitable conduct doctrine,a judicially created doctrine,was borne out of a series of supreme court cases in which the court refused to enforce patents whereby the patentees had engaged in fraud in order to procure those patents.see precision instrument auto.maint.mach.glass.keystone driller excavator.although the supreme court did not articulate precisely what rendered a patent unenforceable,the courts generally tended to apply a doctrine somewhat akin to that of common law fraud,albeit broader.see digital equip.diamond,cir norton curtiss.that is,the courts required a showing that the information that was misrepresented to or withheld from the pto was material and a showing of wrongfulness,such as deceptive intent,willful misconduct,or gross negligence.in,the pto created its first version of rule,prohibiting fraud before the pto.
however,neither the supreme court nor the pto articulated exactly what constituted a material misrepresentation.thus,several different standards of materiality emerged from the courts.these standards included the objective but for standard,where the misrepresentation was so material that the patent should not have issued the subjective but for test,where the misrepresentation actually caused the examiner to approve the patent application when he would not otherwise have done so and the but it may have standard,where the misrepresentation may have influenced the parent examiner in the course of prosecution.see am.hoist derrick sowa sons,citing plastic container cont l plastics of,cir gemveto jewelry lambert.
in addition,in,the pto amended rule to clarify the duty of candor and good faith before the pto.that version of rule required applicants to disclose information they are aware of which is material,stating that information is material where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent.in adopting this standard of materiality,the pto did not claim to be replacing or supplanting the existing case law addressing materiality,but rather noted that it was codif ying the existing office policy on fraud and inequitable conduct,which is believed consistent with the prevailing case law in the federal courts.duty of disclosure.
in american hoist,one of the first cases of inequitable conduct addressed by this court,we noted that this rule standard of materiality was yet a fourth official standard.at.although strikingly similar to the but it may have guideline,we noted that the pto standard was an appropriate starting point for any discussion of materiality,for it appears to be the broadest,thus encompassing the others and because that materiality boundary most closely aligns with how one ought to conduct business with the pto.id.at.further,we noted that t here is no reason to be bound by any single standard,as a finding of inequitable conduct requires a balancing of materiality and intent.id.at.thus,where a reasonable examiner would merely have considered particular information to be important but not crucial to his decision the requisite finding of intent must be high.id.conversely,where an objective but for standard of materiality is shown,a lesser showing of facts from which intent can be inferred may be sufficient.id.
subsequent cases also discussed all four tests for materiality.see,argus chem.fibre,litton indus,solid state,atlas powder du pont de nemours.however,because a party alleging inequitable conduct need only prove a threshold level of materiality in order to proceed to the second balancing portion of the inequitable conduct inquiry,and because the pto reasonable examiner standard was broader than the other three standards,the pto standard gradually became the sole standard invoked by this court.see,dick burroughs,applying the rule standard,noting that it is o ne of the standards identified by this court as appropriate to determine materiality akzo int l trade comm n,noting that the major standard for determining materiality is identical to the pto rule standard see also halliburton schlumberger tech,applying the reasonable examiner standard of materiality molins plc,at same.
even though the pto reasonable examiner standard became the dominant standard invoked by this court,in no way did it supplant or replace the case law precedent.rather,it provided an additional test of materiality,albeit a broader and test.similarly,the pto recent adoption of an arguably narrower standard of materiality does not supplant or replace our case law.rather,it merely provides an additional test of materiality.that is,if a misstatement or omission is material under the new rule standard,it is material.similarly,if a misstatement or omission is material under the reasonable examiner standard or under the older three tests,it is also material.as we reasoned in american hoist,to the extent that one standard requires a higher showing of materiality than another standard,the requisite finding of intent may be lower.
that the new rule was not intended to replace or supplant the reasonable examiner standard is supported by the pto comments during the passage of the new rule.the pto noted that the rule has been amended to present a clearer and more objective definition of what information the office considers material to patentability and further that t he rules do not define fraud or inequitable conduct which have elements both of materiality and of intent.duty of disclosure,as quoted in dayco,at.
in this case,the district court,faced with the two versions of rule,determined that the new rule standard was essentially the same as the reasonable examiner standard,and thus applied the reasonable examiner standard and our case law interpreting that standard.summary judgment,slip op.at.because the reasonable examiner standard and our case law interpreting that standard were not supplanted by the pto adoption of a new rule,when reviewing the district court decision,we will do the same.
the district court determined on summary judgment that mercer made material misrepresentations in his rule declaration and that his failure to cite the rorden patent was a material omission.we agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the materiality of the misstatements in the rule declaration.however,because what a reference teaches is a question of fact,the district court was incorrect in determining on summary judgment that the failure to cite the rorden patent was a material omission.
as noted above,a grant of summary judgment on the issue of inequitable conduct is permissible,but uncommon.generally,however,the concerns attendant to awards of summary judgment on inequitable conduct relate to the inherently factual nature of the issue of intent.direct evidence of intent is rare,such that a court must often infer intent from the surrounding circumstances.critikon,becton dickinson vascular access.in the summary judgment context,all inferences must be made in favor of the nonmovant thus,it is often improper to determine at summary judgment that a patentee made intentional misstatements or omissions to the pto.however,in this case,the court did not award summary judgment on the issue of intent,which it rightly characterized as inherently factual.summary judgment,slip op.at.rather,the district court determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of material misrepresentations and omissions.
indeed,the factual circumstances surrounding the mercer rule declaration are not in dispute.the parties do not dispute the wording of the rule declaration,which describes mercer reduction to practice of the invention,nor the manner in which the invention was demonstrated and reduced to practice.mercer declaration stated that t his prototype board functions to send boring tool orientation information from the boring tool,underground,to an above ground locator and actually did so prior to the critical date,as will be seen.rule decl.at.the declaration goes on to describe a demonstration of the prototype board made to john olsen.id.at.in addition,the declaration states that t he system shown to john olsen and operated for him prior to the critical date comprised within the boring tool a sensor arrangement including pitch and roll sensors.id.at.
further,the parties do not dispute that in his deposition,mercer admitted that he did not demonstrate his invention underground and that the sensor arrangement was not within the boring tool.thus,mercer declaration that he demonstrated a system comprising a sensor arrangement within the boring tool was a misstatement.in addition,although dci argues that mercer declaration did not state that the invention was demonstrated to john olsen underground,there is no other plausible reading of the declaration.the declaration clearly states that the prototype board actually sent orientation information from a boring tool located underground to a transmitter located above ground,that this actual performance will be seen later in the declaration,and then describes the performance of the tool before john olsen.thus,the district court correctly concluded that the declaration gives the distinct impression that mercer demonstrated a boring tool to john olsen underground.summary judgment,slip op.at.this,too,was a misstatement.
dci argues that these misstatements were not material,as the invention would have been reduced to practice,and therefore would be patentable,even if the system had not been tested underground,or if the sensor arrangement had not been contained within the boring tool.thus,dci seems to encourage us to apply a but for standard of materiality since the patent would have issued,regardless of the misstatements,the misstatements can not be material.we agree with the district court,however,that a reasonable examiner would have considered the true nature of mercer reduction of the invention to practice to be important in deciding whether to allow the patent.
under the reasonable examiner standard,a misstatement or omission may be material even if disclosure of that misstatement or omission would not have rendered the invention unpatentable.see,squibb rorer,withheld reference was material notwithstanding patent examiner determination that it did not render the invention unpatentable roche,promega,finding misstatements regarding an alternative argument in favor of patentability to be nonetheless material perseptive biosystems,pharmacia biotech,stating that a patent may be valid and yet be rendered unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
in addition,affirmative misrepresentations in contrast to misleading omissions,are more likely to be regarded as material.roche,at citing rohm haas crystal chem.indeed,as noted by the district court,we are especially cognizant of misstatements made in an affidavit to the pto.as such,we have previously found that the submission of a false affidavit may be determined to be inherently material.refac int lotus dev,see also rohm haas,at t here is no room to argue that submission of false affidavits is not material.thus,we have explicitly held that an affidavit,such as a petition to make special,is material as a matter of law if it succeeds in prompting expedited consideration of the application.electro music samick music.mercer made affirmative misstatements as part of an affidavit submitted with the purpose and effect of preserving his patent application.because the patent examiner relied on mercer description of his reduction to practice of his invention when issuing the patent,we agree with the district court that a reasonable examiner would have considered the true nature of mercer reduction to practice to be important,such that his misstatements unquestionably meet the threshold requirement for materiality.
as noted by the district court,inequitable conduct may also be found where a patentee has failed to disclose material information,such as a prior art reference,to the pto.see,baxter int l,mcgaw,molins plc,at.when a defendant alleges that the patentee omitted a material reference,there must be clear and convincing evidence that the applicant made a deliberate decision to withhold a known material reference.baxter int l,at citing molins plc,at.thus,the reference must be material,under the same standards outlined above,and the patentee must have actual knowledge of the prior art reference.
the district court found that it was undisputed that mercer knew of the rorden patent during prosecution of the patents in suit,as evidenced by his submission of that reference to the pto on april,during the prosecution of an unrelated patent.summary judgment,slip op.at.further,the district court found that the rorden patent was material,as an application for a continuation patent using the same specification,united states patent the patent,was rejected by the examiner as anticipated by the rorden patent while one of the patents in suit,the patent,was still pending.thus,the district court found that g iven the similarity between the patent and the patent,it is logical to assume that the patent would have been rejected on the same basis had the rorden patent been disclosed to the examiner.id.at.
however,a withheld otherwise material prior art reference is not material for the purposes of inequitable conduct if it is merely cumulative to that information considered by the examiner.molins plc,at citing scripps clinic research found.genentech.the district court rejected dci contention that the rorden patent was merely cumulative of those references disclosed,noting that rorden claims methods of determinin
