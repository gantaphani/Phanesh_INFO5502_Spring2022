background 
the case has a lengthy history.in,santa fe submitted applications to vernon for conditional use permits in connection with the expansion project.vernon refused to process the applications,asserting that santa fe needed to obtain a permit for the entire hobart yard,not just the additions it wished to make.in,santa fe filed a complaint in superior court for declaratory relief,contending that vernon actions were illegal.in january,vernon filed a complaint with the commission.vernon complaint alleged,among other things,that santa fe had failed to comply with applicable local regulations and that the expansion project violated ceqa in that an eir had not been prepared.in february,the superior court ruled in favor of santa fe.atchison,topeka santa fe railway city of vernon,no.on november,the commission issued its ruling on vernon complaint.city of vernon atchison,topeka santa fe railroad cal.wl,hereafter vernon santa fe 
in vernon santa fe i,the commission held that,because the hobart yard expansion was a project of a public utility that did not require approval or other discretionary acts,the project was exempt from ceqa.however,with respect to the possibility of further environmental inquiry,the commission observed that under the provisions of public utilities code sections and,an aggrieved party may complain about utility conduct which may comply with all existing laws and regulations but nonetheless be unreasonable.vernon santa fe i,supra,at,citing ranches,southern california edison company d.the commission further noted that in ranches it had also emphasized that such complainants,as the moving parties,bear the burden of demonstrating the unreasonableness of a utility conduct.vernon santa fe i,supra,at 
the decision in vernon santa fe i continued vernon should be granted leave to amend its complaint,if it can,to allege with particularity facts to show why,in light of the economically feasible alternatives,if any,available to accomplish the same objectives,the means by which santa fe has chosen to implement its plan of expansion unnecessarily create avoidable adverse environmental effects of sufficient magnitude so as to make the expansion unreasonable.citation.in assessing the adequacy of any amended complaint,we shall be guided by ceqa section vernon may propound discovery upon santa fe vernon,however,shall be solely responsible for conducting all environmental studies and analyses of such plans in connection with its complaint and may not lay off such studies and analyses on santa fe in the guise of discovery except to the extent that santa fe has already conducted any such studies or analyses and reduced them to written form.we include this stricture to emphasize the difference from environmental review under ceqa,in which the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of a proposed action lies with the proponent of a project.vernon santa fe i,supra,at.
in april,the superior court judgment in santa fe declaratory relief action was affirmed in a nonpublished opinion of division two of this court.atchison,topeka santa fe railway city of vernon.also in april,vernon filed an amended complaint against santa fe with the commission.
in april,a hearing on vernon amended complaint was conducted before an administrative law judge.in its opening statement,vernon asserted that it would prove three basic facts that expansion of the hobart yard would increase truck traffic on nearby roadways,that the increase in traffic would cause unsafe reductions in the level of service at five surrounding intersections,and that santa fe could substantially reduce the negative impacts by contributing percent of the total projected cost of a million intersection improvement project that had been planned for the area.santa fe responded that it needed to expand the hobart yard in order to facilitate commerce in the los angeles area and that vernon could not meet its burden of demonstrating that adverse environmental effects of the expansion were of sufficient magnitude as to make it unreasonable.at the hearing,oral and documentary evidence from employees of the parties and independent experts was presented by both sides.
on december,the commission rendered its decision.cal,hereafter vernon santa fe ii.in prefatory portions of vernon santa fe ii,the commission posed the question presented as whether santa fe plans of expansion create adverse environmental effects so as to make expansion of the hobart yard unreasonable.id.at.the commission also reiterated that it was being guided by public resources code section.vernon santa fe ii,supra,at.
the opinion continued with the commission noting that all of vernon evidence had been directed to the environmental impact of increased traffic at five specific intersections.vernon santa fe ii,supra,at.the commission held that the incremental traffic conditions did not constitute an adverse environmental impact which requires mitigation.id.at.indeed,t he evidence show ed,and vernon witness conceded,that traffic conditions in the vicinity of hobart yard will be sufficiently bad and the classification will be identical,irrespective of the hobart yard expansion.id.at.thus,the commission concluded,the projected significant environmental effects are unavoidable.vernon presented no evidence to show that santa fe could change the traffic effects of its expansion by selecting another location,by changing the arrangement of its site entrances or exits,or by adopting a plan of operations to shift traffic from peak hours to other hours.vernon only suggestion was that santa fe could mitigate the traffic effects by contributing toward the funding of improvements to one of the five intersections.however,the evidence showed that those improvements would be constructed whether or not santa fe contributed to their cost or expanded hobart yard.id.at accordingly,vernon complaint was dismissed.id.at.
vernon applied for a rehearing.in california public utilities commission decision,dated april,wl hereafter vernon santa fe iii,the commission issued an order granting limited rehearing to modify vernon santa fe ii and denying rehearing of modified decision.vernon santa fe iii,supra,at.the modifications included a new finding of fact that t here are regional benefits from increased intermodal freight rail transportation and regional truck traffic will be lessened with the hobart yard expansion.id.at.additionally,language was moved from a finding of fact to a conclusion of law and was revised to read vernon has failed to prove that the traffic impacts arising from santa fe expansion project are so significant that its project is unreasonable.therefore,santa fe has not violated pu code sections or.vernon santa fe iii,supra,at.
following the decision in vernon santa fe iii,vernon filed a petition for writ of review in this court pursuant to public utilities code section.on february,we directed the commission to certify a copy of the record and set the matter for oral argument oral argument was conducted on march.
