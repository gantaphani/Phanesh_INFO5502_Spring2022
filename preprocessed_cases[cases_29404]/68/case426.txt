petitioner,the pacific gas electric company,seeks this court review of final orders issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that establish a procedure for funding the costs of the california power exchange corporation calpx.those orders established a regime whereby former calpx customers,like,were assessed a charge for calpx costs that correlated to the absolute value of any outstanding account balances the customers had with calpx as of march.because the methodology is both unreasonable and violates the doctrine,we vacate the orders and remand the matter to ferc for further consideration.
background 
in,california restructured its electric power industry to a rate system.in doing so,it created calpx,a entity that provided various auction markets for the trading of electricity under tariff and rate schedules.under this system,calpx determined the amounts to be paid by buyers purchasing power and how those amounts would be distributed to the sellers.calpx recovered its administrative costs by assessing a charge to entities using its services.
in,wholesale prices for electricity in california increased dramatically and resulted in the california energy crisis.paid the higher prices,but owing to price freezes on retail rates,could not pass along the increased costs to its customers.ultimately,could not meet its obligations to calpx,its credit ratings were reduced,and it filed for chapter bankruptcy.
shortly thereafter,ferc began an investigation into the california energy crisis.the many matters at issue in that investigation have been consolidated and are collectively referred to as the refund proceedings.those refund proceedings are massive in scope,but only a narrow segment is pertinent to this case,as detailed below.
ferc first determined that prospective relief was insufficient,and that refunds related to transactions in the electricity spot markets operated by the california independent system operator caiso and calpx were appropriate.refunds of approximately three billion dollars have been tentatively granted.san diego gas sellers of energy and ancillary services into markets operated by the cal.indep.operator and the california power,ferc,wl,order on reh g,ferc,wl.these determinations are on appeal before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.cal.pub.util.comm ferc,et,wl cir.in addition to the refund proceedings,the events surrounding the california energy crisis have spawned a variety of litigation,some of it criminal.
also as a result of the california energy crisis,calpx was suspended from operating its markets.in re cal.power,cir.in october,sellers in the california market,acting through the calpx creditors committee,filed a proposal with ferc requesting a distribution of calpx funds.ferc deferred the issue,pending resolution of the refund proceedings.san diego gas sellers of energy and ancillary services into markets operated by the cal.indep.operator and the california power,ferc,wl.ferc has also denied several other requests from individual sellers to release calpx collateral and funds,again stating that the proper allocation can not be made until the refund proceedings are resolved.ferc denials of these requests are on appeal to this circuit.constellation power source,ferc,wl consolidated with powerex ferc.
with calpx out of the energy business,its sole remaining function is winding up its business affairs.this includes several responsibilities,such as acting as custodian of certain financial rights owed by and to participants in its defunct markets acting as records custodian for transactions in california markets and participating in ongoing commission and judicial proceedings.in other words,calpx is complying with the refund proceedings.because it is no longer in the energy business,calpx has no current funding source during the period.according to calpx,without some source of revenue,it would have exhausted its reserve of operating funds by august of.ferc attempt to remedy this problem is the subject of this petition.
in order to recover its operating cost during the period,calpx filed a new rate schedule under the federal power act,to apportion the costs of calpx and ongoing operations equitably among the participants for whose benefit calpx is continuing those operations.ferc agreed,and ultimately adopted a regime whereby calpx costs would be allocated among its participants in proportion to their relative exposure,as measured by the absolute value of their current payables and receivables,with calpx.ferc stated that t his is consistent with the fact that calpx ongoing activities are essentially centered around the appropriate and orderly disposition of these payables and receivables.cal.power,ferc,wl.thus,any party that has a balance positive or negative outstanding with calpx is required to pay a percentage of calpx costs equal to its percentage of the total outstanding account balances.additionally,ferc found that calpx was required to use the most current account information,which was reflected in the march,account summaries the account balances.id.furthermore,recognizing that the outstanding balances would change pursuant to the ongoing refund proceedings,ferc required calpx to modify the allocation in subsequent sixmonth rate filings to track any changes.id.from that time until oral argument in this case,the march,account balances have been used for each period.finally,ferc also excluded caiso account balance,which is the largest outstanding balance amount in calpx account,from the cost allocation.
among others,sought a rehearing of ferc august,order that adopted calpx charges.argued that ferc order violated the doctrine by imposing new charges for past services.ferc disagreed,claiming that was confusing two distinct issues rates previously charged for transactions in the calpx market and the responsibility for newly incurred costs.also challenged calpx reliance on march account balances as the basis for allocating cost among participants.ferc denied rehearing on this claim as well,because it believe d that the primary focus of calpx activities is to support this commission efforts to calculate just and reasonable rates and associated refunds for participants in calpx markets,including.cal.power,ferc,wl.according to ferc,each participant account balance was the best approximation of what the participant would ultimately owe to,or be owed by,the calpx,once all the refund proceedings and related matters were resolved.id.
further argued that caiso account balance should have been included in the cost allocation.ferc defended the exclusion of caiso balance from the cost allocation on the ground that any energy charges assessed to calpx by caiso would have been assessed to it as a scheduling coordinator for its customers.cal.power,ferc,wl.therefore,those amounts were already reflected in the account balances and used to determine the cost allocation.any counting of caiso balances would therefore result in,because ferc considers caiso a entity.ferc offered the further justification that caiso,as a nonprofit entity,had no stake in the outcome of the refund proceedings.id.
having not received the relief it requested below,now petitions this court for review of ferc orders.under the current scheme,pays percent of calpx costs.
ii.analysis 
a reviewing court sets aside final action of ferc if that action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a power partners ferc.ferc must be able to demonstrate that it has made a reasoned decision based upon substantial evidence in the record.northern states power ferc.we also must ensure that ferc articulate s a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.ins,d quotations omitted.for reasons more fully set forth below,we hold that ferc decision does not survive that standard of review.
a.the doctrine and rule against retroactive ratemaking 
citing the doctrine,contends that ferc erred in allocating calpx administrative costs based on balances incurred for previous transactions
