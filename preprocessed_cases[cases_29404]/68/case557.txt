in this proceeding,we consider the petition for writ of review filed by the utility consumers action network ucan challenging public utilities commission of the state of california commission decision and which granted san diego gas and electric company sdg e application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn to construct the sunrise powerlink transmission project sunrise.pub,undesignated statutory references are to the public utilities code.ucan does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to support the commission findings.instead,it argues that the commission applied the wrong burden of proof,improperly relied on material facts to support its findings,and failed to assess alternatives as required under section.we find no merit in ucan arguments and deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
we begin by reminding the parties that this original proceeding is governed by the appellate rules.cal.rules of court,rule.california rules of court,rule a c,which applies to writ proceedings cal.rules of court,rules,a,requires that the parties briefs s upport any reference to a matter in the record by a citation to the volume and page number of the record where the matter appears here,the parties omitted citations to the record or incorrectly cited numerous documents,or,when stating a single fact,cited an entire,sometimes lengthy,document.we are not required to independently search this extensive record to verify the factual or procedural points cited by the parties.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.because all parties failed to comply with california rules of court,rule a c,we take most of the factual and procedural background from the commission two decisions.see doppes bentley motors,th,rather than striking appellant brief for violation of the rule requiring citations to the record,the reviewing court simply declined to consider the portions of the statement of facts that failed to comply.we shall refer to the commission december decision granting sdg e application as the decision and its july decision modifying the decision as modified decision.
in december,sdg e applied for a cpcn authorizing construction of sunrise.due to deficiencies in the application,sdg e filed an amended application in august which the commission treated as a new proceeding.sdg e original plans for sunrise the proposed project included new kilovolt kv transmission lines running approximately miles between the imperial valley substation and the western portion of sdg e san diego service area,a new substation in central san diego county,and other system upgrades and modifications.a portion of the proposed kv line crossed desert state park.sdg e stated in its application that sunrise was needed by to meet the grid reliability requirements of the california independent system operator caiso,to enable sdg e to meet its renewable energy targets,and to mitigate energy costs.
the commission evaluation of the proposed project followed two parallel tracks the cpcn track which focused on economics and the environmental track which assessed impacts as required by the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et and the national environmental policy act nepa et.the final environmental impact report feir made no recommendation regarding the approval or denial of the proposed project,but its contents provided information used by the commission in deciding whether to issue the cpcn.public resources code section gives the supreme court exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the commission approval of the feir.the supreme court is holding that challenge in abeyance pending our resolution of the issues.utility consumers action network california public utilities com.order filed,cal.lexis.
the cpcn proceedings under section considered whether sdg e established a need for the proposed project or for an alternative evaluated in those proceedings.the cpcn proceedings were devoted to quantifying the benefits claimed by sdg e to determine whether the proposed project could meet the goals of reliability,use of renewable energy,and reduced cost more economically than other alternatives.for this purpose,the commission adopted a slightly modified version of caiso modeling approach,based on numerous assumptions described in the decision as forming the analytical baseline.
in,the legislature adopted assembly bill,which requires california to reduce its green house gas ghg emissions to levels by.health,including historical and statutory notes,west ann.health supp.foll.the commission adopted policies and rules designed to achieve these goals in the energy sector,including the recommendation that the electricity sector achieve renewable procurement at percent renewable portfolio standard rps by.the california air resources board carb was tasked with implementing those rules.models used in the cpcn proceedings reflected california ghg policy goals.
on the track,the commission as lead agency performed detailed analysis of alternatives to the proposed project,including the no project alternative.the alternatives offered both and plans,and both minor adjustments and major route changes.the no project alternative included as possibilities the generation alternative,the renewable generation alternative,and the lake elsinore advanced pump storage leaps alternative.together with the united states bureau of land management blm,the commission prepared an feir.the feir ranked the proposed project and various alternatives in terms of environmental superiority in the following order generation alternative renewable generation alternative leaps alternative and final environmentally superior southern route alternative.the last alternative was the only choice among the top four that included transmission lines providing direct access to new renewable resources in imperial county.it ranked the proposed project and other alternative routes through portions of desert state park below the first four because of their unmitigable impacts on that environmentally sensitive region.
the commission represents that the assigned administrative law judge and at least two members of the commission issued alternate proposed decisions,and that four of the five commissioners ultimately adopted the decision at issue here.the commission found the first three environmentally superior alternatives infeasible because they failed to meet california broader policy goals of facilitating renewable energy development and reducing ghg emissions in the energy sector.in december,it granted sdg e cpcn request for the routing alternative identified in the feir as the final environmentally superior southern route and certified the feir.the commission also analyzed the cost of the final environmentally superior southern route in comparison to the alternatives,concluding 
assuming renewable procurement at the level of renewable portfolio standard rps,we estimate that the final environmentally superior southern route will generate net benefits of over million per year,and we find that it is the second highest ranked alternative that will facilitate our policy to achieve greenhouse gas ghg reductions through renewable procurement at rps levels in the shortest time possible.
ucan filed an application for rehearing listing appealable deficiencies in the commission decision.the commission denied rehearing but filed the modified decision which corrected or clarified parts of the original decision.among other things,the modified decision altered the commission calculation of the capital cost of the generation alternative.ucan filed a timely petition for writ of review in august.in december,before filing its answer to ucan petition,the commission acted on its own motion to correct inadvertent calculation errors in the decision and modified decision,including an error relating to the capital cost of the generation alternative.

governing law 
the commission is charged with ensuring that public utilities furnish and maintain such adequate,efficient,just,and reasonable service,instrumentalities,equipment,and facilities as are necessary to promote the safety,health,comfort,and convenience of its patrons,employees,and the public.thus,no electrical corporation may begin construction or extension of lines without having first obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction.in granting the cpcn pursuant to section,the commission shall give consideration to the following factors 
community values.
recreational and park areas.
historical and aesthetic values.
influence on environment.
in addition,when considering an application for an electric transmission facility,the commission shall consider alternatives to transmission facilities that meet the need for an efficient,reliable,and affordable supply of electricity,including,but not limited to,alternatives such as targeted energy efficiency,ultraclean distributed generation,as defined in section,and other demand reduction resources.the electric corporation application for a cpcn shall include a cost analysis comparing the project with any feasible alternative sources of power.the corporation shall demonstrate the financial impact of the plant,line,or extension construction on the corporation ratepayers,stockholders,and on the cost of the corporation borrowed capital,subd d.

ucan application for rehearing referenced section and argued the commission committed legal error in ways.it challenged the decision on four grounds listed in section the commission did not proceed in the manner required by law the decision was not supported by the findings the findings were not supported by substantial evidence and the commission abused its discretion.however,ucan generally failed to identify the specific ground for challenging each of the claims of error.
in its petition for writ of review,ucan expressly declines to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings,but asserts that the commission acted in excess of its powers and jurisdiction,failed to proceed consistent with california law,and abused its discretion.because the question of the commission power and jurisdiction is not properly before us,and ucan does not brief abuse of discretion in its points and authorities cal.rules of court,rule a b in re marriage of falcone fyke,supra,th at,our review of the decision and modified decision is limited to the question whether the commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law,subd.a.

with these principles in mind,we turn to the merits of ucan petition for writ of review.
ii.the commission applied the correct standard of proof 
the commission applied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof stating in its decision that t he preponderance of the evidence is generally the default standard in civil and administrative law cases.ucan argued in its application for rehearing that the commission erred in rejecting ucan argument that the higher clear and convincing standard should apply to cpcn applications involving projects such as sunrise which are likely to impact utility rates.the commission reiterated in the modified decision that it had limited application of the clear and convincing standard to general rate cases and reasonableness reviews which are specialized proceedings.ucan,the commission and sdg e repeat those arguments here,ucan maintaining that the lesser burden of proof should not have been used in a case which poses a billion expenditure to be paid by the state ratepayers.
the difference between the two standards of proof is easy to articulate,but often difficult to apply.witkin states that t he phrase preponderance of evidence is usually defined in terms of probability of truth,such evidence as,when weighed with that opposed to it,has more convincing force and the greater probability of truth.witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of proof and presumptions,see caci more likely true than not true.in contrast,the phrase clear and convincing is defined as clear,explicit and unequivocal,so clear as to leave no substantial doubt,and sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.citation.otherwise stated,a preponderance calls for probability,while clear and convincing proof demands a high probability.witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of proof and presumptions,see caci it is highly probable that the fact is true.
contrary to ucan representations,the commission does not characterize the question of burden of proof in a cpcn proceeding as a matter of first impression.the commission stated in its modified decision that b y default it has applied the preponderance standard in cpcn proceedings,and therefore there is precedent for applying the less stringent standard.
ucan attempts to shift to the commission the burden of establishing error by urging us to require the commission to justify its use of a lesser standard for cpcn cases that pose very large cost exposure to ratepayers.however,the party seeking judicial review of a commission decision has the burden of establishing grounds for setting aside the decision.see,market street ry.railroad commission cal d.
turning to the merits,ucan offers no statutory or case authority to support its argument the commission should change its procedure,or that the commission failed to proceed in the manner required by law when it applied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof to sdg e application,subd.a.nor does ucan provide any authority to bolster its theory that the projected cost of a project such as sunrise should determine the standard of proof to be applied.accordingly,the presumption of validity provides sufficient grounds to reject ucan arguments.greyhound,supra,cal d at.
we also reject any suggestion that the burden of proof question involves statutory interpretation of evidence code section,which reads in part except as otherwise provided by law,the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.the california constitution authorizes the commission to establish its own procedures.cal,art.xii.the commission need not apply the technical rules of evidence.moreover,the legislature placed evidence code section in the definitions section of that code and the statute does not purport to govern the standard of proof applicable in any particular proceeding.see,et in any event,in the absence of authority to support its argument in favor of the higher burden of proof in cpcn cases,it is difficult to see how evidence code section helps ucan.
based on the foregoing,we defer to the commission use of the preponderance of the evidence standard as the default standard in administrative proceedings and therefore the appropriate standard for cpcn applications.
iii.the commission properly considered oral argument and other facts cited by ucan 
ucan contends the commission failed to act in the manner required by law by relying on evidence that is either inexpert,oral argument or received after the close of the evidentiary record.in support of this argument,ucan cites the commission rules of practice and procedure,section which governs written comments made by the parties on proposed or alternate decisions,tit.commission rules of practice and procedure,section reads in part comments shall focus on factual,legal or technical errors in the proposed or alternative decision and in citing such errors shall make specific references to the record or applicable law,tit,subd.c,italics added.
ucan asserts there are four facts which,if not adopted by the commission,would have precluded the approval of the cpcn.ucan describes those facts and their impact as follows 
yakout mansour,the chief executive officer of the caiso,stated during oral argument you can not expect the developers to,you know,financially committing,financially binding contracts now,many years ahead of time even at the difficult times we have now,within the time frame that is suggested in the alternate decision.you ca.ucan maintains the commission modified decision relied solely on this statement for its claim that regulatory constraints make a renewable requirement unworkable.ucan asserts that the reliance on oral argument was improper and the commission misinterpreted mansour statement.
finding of fact of the decision states sdg e has committed to not contract,for any length of term,with conventional coal generators that deliver power via sunrise,replace currently approved renewable energy contract deliverable via sunrise that fails with a viable contract with a renewable generator located in imperial valley in other words,opt for a contract with a renewable generator in imperial county,and voluntarily raising sdg e rps goal to percent by.ucan maintains that the evidentiary record contains no such commitment.without a citation to the record,ucan asserts that the reference is found only in the oral argument presented by sdg e president and ceo,deborah reed,after the evidentiary record was closed and the case submitted.ucan argues that absent reference to sdg e commitment,the commission would not have had a basis to reject the conditions suggested by commissioner grueneich dissent to the decision,which ucan also fails to cite.
without citing to the decision or modified decision,ucan contends the commission based its decision on inexpert representations made in oral argument consisting of data tendered by the caiso in august.ucan argues that h ad the commission not relied upon the caiso analysis,it would not have had a basis to reject the case analysis,which it also fails to explain or cite.
the modified decision referenced caiso modeling and the california air resources board carb climate change scoping plan,and stated that the decision concludes that whether or not the sunrise line carries renewables,when projects across the rest of the region are considered,there is no substantial difference in the ultimate ghg impacts.the decision explained that carb used estimates provided by the commission to adopt the percent rps recommendation.ucan contends that the commission improperly relied on the carb estimates which consisted of unsubstantiated commission estimates.ucan maintains that the commission created its own factual basis that carb estimates relied upon to issue a guideline and then reference d carb estimates that were,in fact,unsubstantiated commission estimates.
in the points and authorities accompanying the petition,ucan maintains the t hese facts are sufficiently material to justify remand of the decision for additional evidentiary scrutiny.ucan cites southern pacific public utilities com.cal d,and reiterates in its reply brief that the decision must be remanded for failure to contain valid findings of fact for all material issues in the proceeding.as we explain,there are several grounds for rejecting ucan argument.
we are not persuaded that section of the commission rules of practice and procedure applies here.by its language,section governs written comments on proposed and alternate decisions.at minimum,it is inapplicable to the statements made in oral argument.because ucan points and authorities fail to provide the procedural context for the remainder of the challenged facts,we are unable to determine whether they were included in written comments on proposed or alternate decisions.furthermore,ucan offers no other authority to support its argument that the commission may not consider points offered at oral argument.to the contrary,section of the rules of practice and procedure states that the commission may direct the parties to present oral argument,tit,subd.a.a proceeding shall stand submitted for decision by the commission after the taking of evidence,the filing of briefs,and the presentation of oral argument as may have been prescribed,tit,subd.a,italics added.the clear inference is that the commission may consider oral argument along with the evidence and briefs in reaching its decision.we therefore conclude there is no merit in ucan argument that the commission improperly considered the first three challenged facts and therefore failed to act in the manner required by law.
we also reject ucan argument that the commission reliance on the carb estimates improperly circumvented the record.the portion of the modified decision cited by ucan also referenced caiso modeling which incorporated the percent rps goal.ucan does not dispute the commission statement that t here is no prohibition against an agency going beyond the factual analysis in the eir to incorporate policy forecasts that go beyond the physical impacts of the projects themselves.moreover,other evidence in the record supports the commission conclusion that it is in the public interest to reach the percent rps goal for the electricity sector.
finally,ucan fails to explain how remand is justified under southern pacific public utilities,supra,cal d.that case holds that in a cpcn proceeding,the commission decision must separately state findings of fact and conclusions of law on all material is,resolve every issue to reach the ultimate finding of public safety,welfare,convenience and necessity.ibid.the commission appears to have done so.although ucan purports not to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,it attempts a backdoor challenge to the factual findings by arguing the evidence is insufficient if the facts challenged here are removed from the commission consideration.because we conclude the commission properly considered these facts,there is no ground for remand and no basis for claiming insufficient evidence to support the commission findings.
iv.the commission considered the feasible,alternatives 
section provides in considering an application for a certificate for an electric transmission facility pursuant to section,the commission shall consider alternatives to transmission facilities that meet the need for an efficient,reliable,and affordable supply of electricity,including,but not limited to,alternatives such as targeted energy efficiency,ultraclean distributed generation,as defined in section,an
