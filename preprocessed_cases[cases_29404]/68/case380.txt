pjm interconnection llc is a regional transmission organization rto that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or part of thirteen eastern states and the district of columbia.its more than members include power generators,transmission owners,electricity distributors,power marketers,and large consumers.an open access tariff,filed with and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission,provides the terms and conditions for new interconnections.when a firm submits an interconnection request,the rto undertakes in sequence three types of studies estimating the cost of effecting the interconnection.the process culminates in an interconnection service agreement.this case addresses the circumstances under which pjm is permitted to repeat its interconnection studies,thereby changing the amount the interconnecting firm must pay.
petitioners transmission owning members of pjm,state agencies and an industrial user argue that the tariff permits unlimited restudy prior to the completion of the interconnection service agreement.on this view,the charge for interconnection would take account of the impact of all events transpiring up to that moment.ferc found that the tariff was ambiguous on the subject,that unlimited restudy would be unreasonable,and that a better reading of the tariff would permit restudy in only a limited set of circumstances.we find ferc reading amply worthy of deference.
neptune is a firm sponsoring a merchant transmission project that will deliver mw of capacity from new jersey to long island via a,underwater transmission cable.projects such as neptune add additional capacity to an electric grid,enhancing market integration and competition by expanding transmission and trading opportunities between regions.neptune initiated its interconnection request with pjm in december,and established its place in pjm,interconnection queue in march.
interconnection provisions added to pjm tariff in require it to undertake three studies of each queued project.the first is a feasibility study that preliminarily determines both what system upgrades are necessary to accommodate a new interconnection and the requesting party responsibility for those upgrade costs.tariff section.next,pjm must conduct a system impact study,which refines cost responsibility estimates for necessary system upgrades.tariff section.customers may terminate or withdraw their interconnection requests based on the impact study findings.pjm then conducts a final facilities study and makes its ultimate good faith estimate of the cost to be charged the interconnecting customer.tariff section.
by october pjm completed its initial study system impact,estimating the cost of network upgrades due to neptune interconnection at million.it soon revised that study because of the withdrawal of a interconnection project this revision,undisputed by neptune,yielded a new estimate of million.in march,however,pjm informed neptune that its system interconnection costs had to be restudied yet again on account of several generator retirements in the pjm system.pjm thus undertook a third then a fourth.by june the estimate had risen to million.it appears undisputed that the withdrawal of generators may imply additional upgrade costs associated with an interconnection.in september,on account of further generator retirements,pjm informed neptune of the need for a fifth system impact study.neptune objected to the third,fourth,and fifth studies,but pjm refused to conduct a facility study the third and final interconnection study step or enter into an interconnection service agreement until it completed its fifth system impact study.
in december,neptune filed a complaint with ferc under of the federal power act,asking it to compel pjm to move forward toward an interconnection service agreement based on the second system impact study.without an interconnection service agreement,neptune was unable to secure construction financing in time to build needed facilities and meet a commitment to be operational by june.neptune sought expedited consideration.
in february the commission granted neptune complaint,finding that pjm final three restudies were not performed in accordance with its tariff.neptune regional transmission system,llc pjm interconnection,llc,ferc complaint order.noting that the pjm tariff was silent as to some aspects of the restudy issue and ambiguous as to others,id.at,the commission interpreted the tariff to generally preclude restudies based on most events an interconnector establishment of its place in the queue.it stressed the role of queue position in creating a coherent system for assigning interconnection costs and facilitating interconnection 
t he queue position provides a potential customer a reasonable degree of certainty as to its financial costs.if an interconnection customer were to be held financially responsible for the costs of events occurring after its system impact study is completed it would be impossible for the customer to make reasoned business decisions.instead,the customer would be susceptible to constant changes within the provider system in fact,as in this case,there could be a series of changes,creating havoc for interconnection providers and customers alike.
id.at p.the commission concluded that cost allocations due to the announcements of generator retirements should have no bearing on the facility study the third type of study,and that pjm should have provided to neptune a facility study immediately upon the completion of its second system impact study.id.at p.
in reaching its decision,the commission explicitly drew on the principles of order,id.at p,which it had adopted in,well after its approval of the relevant language in pjm tariff.see standardization of generator interconnection agreements and procedures,order.see also notice clarifying compliance procedures,ferc.the order limits restudy to three circumstances when a project drops out of the queue,when the modification of a project is required,or when the point of interconnection is.the restudies to which neptune objected fell completely outside these exceptions.order reasons for limiting restudy and thus making queue position critical were essentially the same practical considerations as the ones the commission invoked here.see complaint order,ferc at p.
ferc deferred issues of classification and recovery of any costs above the million interconnection costs to a later date,when transmission service was requested.id.at p.on petition for rehearing and clarification,the commission reaffirm ed that a project queue position forms the basis for the determination of an interconnection customer cost responsibilities,but said that costs above the million appropriately charged to neptune for interconnection are solely reliability upgrade costs and should be allocated to transmission owners and then assigned to transmission customers as specified in the pjm tariff.neptune regional transmission system,llc pjm interconnection,llc,ferc at p p rehearing order.petitioners brought a timely challenge to the orders.
the commission raises two preliminary objections to petitioners challenge.first,it questions their standing,denying that they have suffered or are in imminent peril of suffering injury in concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d citations omitted.second,ferc argues that petitioners claims are unripe,asking us to evaluate whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action and whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.ohio forestry ass sierra club,d.standing and ripeness often overlap significantly,and they do here as to both,we find ferc arguments unavailing.
ferc argument rests largely on its conclusion that costs above the million identified in the second system impact study will be classified and recovered in future is,that their disposition has not been settled,making judicial review more appropriate at a future time,if and when those charges are assigned to petitioners.but the
