california independent system operator corporation caiso,a public benefit corporation,along with two state agencies of california,petition this court for review of a final order of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc purporting to replace the governing board of caiso,chosen according to a method dictated by california statute,with a new board chosen through a method dictated by ferc.because we agree with the petitioners that ferc has no authority to make or enforce such an order,we grant the petition and vacate the order under review.
background 
until very recently,vertically integrated electric utilities sold generation,transmission,and distribution services as a single bundled package.changes in regulatory laws and technological advances have led to increased entry into the wholesale electric power generation markets.because the transmission market has remained restricted and difficult to enter,utilities owning or controlling transmission facilities have enjoyed a natural monopoly which they could exploit to favor their own generation and exclude or burden their competitors.see transmission access policy study group,et ferc,per curiam taps,aff sub,new york ferc,d.in the orders under review in taps,ferc found that the vertically integrated utilities were using their monopoly control over interstate transmission facilities to disadvantage potential competitors and thus thwart competition,to the detriment of the public interest.in ferc order ferc sought to remedy this market burden by requiring jurisdictional electric utilities to unbundle wholesale electric power services and to file nondiscriminatory transmission tariffs.see taps,at.as one means of compliance with ferc remedial orders,public utilities could,and were,encouraged by ferc to participate in independent system operators isos.an iso conducts the transmission services and ancillary services for all users of such a system,replacing the conduct of such services by the system is,the integrated electric utilities whose market power ferc was attempting to control by encouraging the creation and operation of the isos.in order to accomplish that purpose,ferc deems it crucial that an iso be independent of the market participants so that decisions of policy,operation,and dispute resolution be free of the discriminatory impetus inherent in the old system.order at.
caiso is an entity created by the state of california pursuant to statutes of that state.ab,cal.restructuring law,stats,ch,and senate bill,stats,ch.the original legislation leading to the creation of caiso created a california electricity oversight board ceob and directed it to incorporate caiso as a public benefit corporation to operate electric grid facilities in california for the purpose of ensur ing efficient use and reliable operation of the transmission grid ab.that statute directed the ceob to put in place procedures for selecting a board of directors for the new public benefit corporation composed exclusively of california residents and including representatives of eleven stakeholder classes.ab.the same legislation mandated the creation of a power exchange px.to implement this restructuring,in april of california three largest electric utilities filed a joint application with ferc to transfer control of transmission facilities to caiso and to sell electricity to the px.ferc conditionally granted the applications,including generally approving the proposed governance structure as consistent with the principles of isos under order,but ruled that the proposed california residency requirement was unduly discriminatory.pacific gas electric,ferc 
in the summer and fall of,california underwent a period of much publicized turmoil in its electricity market.ferc,the legislature and governor of the state of california,and caiso all concluded separately that a new board structure was needed for caiso in light of that turmoil.on november,ferc proposed a new board selected from candidates identified by an independent search firm.ferc.on december,ferc ordered that if no consensus is reached as to an acceptable means of selecting new iso board members,then the method proposed in the november order would be carried out.on january,also in response to the electricity crisis,the california legislature passed a statute that replaced the current iso board with a board appointed by the governor.pursuant to those procedures,a board was appointed.also in january,the governor authorized the california department of water resources dwr to purchase energy.shortly thereafter,the dwr became a major market participant in the california wholesale energy markets.
thereafter,in response to a ferc directive,caiso filed a comprehensive market redesign proposal to improve the california energy markets.in an order issued july,ferc,in response to this filing,ordered that the procedures it had proposed in november and december to replace caiso board be implemented.see order concerning governance of the california independent system operator,ferc.ferc primary concern with the board composition was that having caiso run by a state appointed board conflicted with the principles,as expressed in order and in ferc november and december orders,that isos should be independent of market participants.because the california governor appointed the board and because california,through its dwr,had been a major market participant in the electricity market administered by caiso,the composition of the board,ferc reasoned,violated those principles of independence.id.at.
caiso,the public utility commission of the state of california,and the ceob all seek review of ferc order.because ferc has no authority to replace the selection method or membership of the governing board of an iso,let alone to compel a corporation created by state law to employ a governing board chosen in violation of that law,we grant the petitions.
first,lest there be any mistake,ferc has done nothing less than order a public utility subject to its regulation to replace its governing board.we offer no citation to any comparable order by ferc,or any other similar federal regulatory body,because to the best of our knowledge,there is none.ferc has claimed the authority of no such precedent,the petitioners have found none,nor has our independent research disclosed any.while the petitioners offer several grounds for setting aside that action,chief among those grounds is the argument by petitioners that ferc simply has no authority to do such a thing.because we agree with petitioners on that basis,and because that basis alone is sufficient to set aside ferc order,we need consider no other argument by petitioners.
in seeking to answer the question of ferc authority,we start with a fundamental proposition of federal law.as a federal agency,ferc is a creature of statute,having no constitutional or common law existence or authority,but only those authorities conferred upon it by congress.atlantic city ferc,quoting michigan epa,emphasis in atlantic city.therefore,if there is no statute conferring authority,ferc has none.id.as the supreme court has recognized,an agency literally has no power to act unless and until congress confers power upon it.pub.serv.comm fcc,d.it is therefore incumbent upon ferc to demonstrate that some statute confers upon it the power it purported to exercise in its replacement of the governing board of the regulated utility.ferc best,indeed only,answer,is that it possesses the authority under federal power act sections and,respectively codified as and.upon review of those sections,it is not immediately apparent that either has anything to do with the authority claimed by ferc to discharge and replace the governing board of a utility with governors chosen by a process of its own choice.
the title lines of the codified versions denominate section as concerning rates and charges schedules suspension of new rates automatic adjustment clauses,and section as power of commission to fix rates and charges determination of cost of production or transmission.we recognize that the section title of a statute is not dispositive of its meaning,but it is not too much to expect that it has something to do with the subject matter of the statute.in this case,review of the statutory text reveals that it has everything to do with the subject matter.congress in those sections did precisely what the titles suggest it was doing.it set forth the power of the commission with respect to rates and charges,and entered certain legislative directions concerning determination of cost of production or transmission.it therefore remains ferc task to show how those provisions somehow empower it to make the unprecedented invasion of internal corporate governance it has undertaken in the orders under review.
ferc points specifically to the language of section,which states 
whenever the commission,after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint,shall find that any rate,charge,or classification,demanded,observed,charged,or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,or that any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate,charge,classification,rule,regulation,practice,or contract to be thereafter observed and in force,and shall fix the same by order.
still more specifically,ferc claims that the composition of the governing board of a utility and the method of its selection is a practice affecting a rate and that because ferc has found that the selection method is discriminatory or preferential,the commission has the authority to determine a just and reasonable practice and to place such practice in force and fix the same by order.needless to say,petitioners disagree.
in reviewing ferc construction of the word practices in the context of section a,we apply the familiar formula of chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and its progeny.under that regime,we first employ the traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.at.however,if the statute is ambiguous and the agency has acted within its delegated authority,we will defer to the agency interpretation if it is reasonable.motion picture ass of,fcc,citing chevron,at.at therefore,it is our task to determine whether congress,when it used the word practices in section,was intending to empower ferc to the corporate governance of regulated utilities,or,if congress did not plainly so intend,if it was reasonable of ferc to so interpret the words of the statute as to vest it with such power.
in considering clarity and specificity of congressional intent expressed in the word practice,we recall that a mbiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.brown gardner,d.the issue is not so much whether the word practice is,in some abstract sense,ambiguous,but rather whether,read in context and using the traditional tools of statutory construction,the term practice encompasses the procedures used to select caiso board,that is,in the words of chevron,whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.at.on this point,congress intent is crystal clear,and we therefore need not reach chevron step two.
at the first step we begin with a plain language analysis of the statutory text.that is,we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.sec.indus.ass bd.of governors,d.the word practices is a word of sufficiently diverse definitions that the only realistic approach to determining congress plain meaning,if any,is to regard the word in its context.the canon of statutory construction noscitur a sociis,a word is known by the company it keeps is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid giving unintended breadth to the acts of congress.amgen,smith,quoting jarecki searle,d other citations omitted.
petitioners argue,with considerable convincing force,that the intent of congress in section is actually quite plain the grant of authority to regulate rates,charges,classifications,and closely related matters.therefore,petitioners argue,ferc interpretation of the section should fall at the first stage of chevron review,as the statute is not ambiguous on the point at issue.certainly,petitioners accurately describe the context.none of the words surrounding the word practice in the statutory section suggest a congressional concern with corporate governance or structure.by its terms,the section only comes into play when the commission has had a hearing and finds that a rate,charge,or classification employed by a regulated utility in its jurisdictional transactions is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.granted,the alternative formulation for the commission use of power under the section incorporates rule,regulation,practice,or contract affect ing such rate,charge or classification.it is quite a leap to move as ferc has from that context of transactional terms to an implication that by the word practice,congress empowered the commission not merely to effect a reformation of some practice in a more traditional sense of actions habitually being taken by a utility in connection with a rate found to be unjust or unreasonable,but also to empower the commission to reform completely the governing structure of the utility on the commission assertion that it is obligated not only to remedy past discrimination but also to take all reasonable steps to prevent possible undue discrimination from occurring ferc at.
fpa section bolsters this reading of section.section delegates to ferc limited authority to regulate conflicts of interest among the directors of public utilities and market actors who deal with such utilities.were ferc reading of section a correct,section would be superfluous,as a would already give ferc plenary authority to resolve such conflicts by altering the corporate governance structure of public utilities,so long as ferc concluded that the change would remedy unjust discrimination of some kind.traditional principles of statutory construction counsel against reading acts of congress to be superfluous.see,am.red cross,d.congress specific and limited enumeration of ferc power over corporate governance in section is strong evidence that section a confers no such authority on ferc.
ferc construction of practice in this context is therefore a sufficiently poor fit with the apparent meaning of the statute that the statute is not ambiguous on the very question before us.in brown gardiner,the supreme court opined that the poor fit of statutory language with a construction urged by the agency charged with administering the statute made the agency reading unreasonable.at.at.while this discussion of reasonableness may sound like chevron step two,the brown court reminded us that where the text and reasonable inferences from it give a clear answer against the government that is the end of the matter.id.quoting good samaritan hospital shalala,d emphasis supplied see also chevron,at.at.as the supreme court did in brown,we are prepared to strike the agency interpretation down at chevron step one,as this clear textually grounded conclusion in petitioner favor is fatal to the remaining principal arguments advanced against it.id.
in support of the breathtaking scope which ferc construes the statute as conferring upon it,the commission cites city of cleveland ferc,for the proposition that there is an infinitude of practices affecting rates and service.ferc apparently would have us hold that the existence of an infinitude of practices supposes that there is also an infinitude of acceptable definitions for what constitutes a practice to give it the authority to regulate anything done by or connected with a regulated utility,as any act or aspect of such an entity corporate existence could affect,in some sense,the rates.we are not biting.the language taken out of the context of city of cleveland by ferc occurred in a discussi
