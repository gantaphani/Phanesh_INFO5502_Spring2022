petitioners,the independent energy producers association,california retailers association,and steven kelly,filed this original proceeding in this court seeking a writ of mandate to restrain respondent,california secretary of state,from placing an initiative measure on the ballot and in the ballot pamphlet for the special election to be held on november.we take judicial notice that the initiative,certified by the secretary of state,is designated as proposition.as of july.
the proponents of the challenged initiative,the utility reform network,robert finkelstein,and michel peter florio,are named as real parties in interest.we will refer to them collectively as turn.
petitioners contend that proposition is invalid because it usurps the legislature plenary power to confer additional authority and jurisdiction on the public utilities commission puc.we agree and shall grant the relief requested.
as we will explain,court review of the validity of an initiative measure ordinarily is more appropriate after the election so as not to unduly prevent the exercise of the voters power.however,this general rule does not apply when it is shown that an initiative measure is unquestionably invalid on its face.as the california supreme court has explained,there is no value in allowing an invalid measure to be on the ballot.to do so would be a disservice to the voters because it could unjustifiably divert attention,time,and resources away from valid measures on the same ballot,and it ultimately could cause voter frustration and distrust if the invalid measure nonetheless is approved by the electorate but then must be struck down by the courts.american federation of labor eu cal d.in fact,it would wrongly deceive the voters to permit a measure to remain on the ballot knowing that most of its provisions,including those provisions which are most likely to excite the interest and attention of the voters,are invalid.id.at,fn.
proposition is such an unquestionably invalid initiative measure.its primary purpose is to confer additional authority and jurisdiction on the puc with respect to the electricity market in our state.it would do so by statutory amendment if enacted by the voters.however,proposition runs afoul of the voters decision years ago to give the legislature the exclusive authority to effect such change.article xii,section of california constitution explicitly states the legislature has the plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions of the constitution but consistent with this article,to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the puc plenary means full,absolute,and unqualified.thus,in giving the legislature such plenary authority,unlimited by other provisions of the constitution including the electorate power to enact laws by initiative,the voters chose to prevent the use of the initiative process to effect such change.
of course,times have changed,and voters can change the state constitution to allow use of the initiative process to achieve what the proponents of proposition want concerning the electricity market in california.but proposition does not seek to amend our state constitution to eliminate the legislature plenary authority to confer additional authority and jurisdiction on the puc.without such an amendment,proposition attempts to do what the voters many years ago said an initiative measure can not do.in other words,proposition is invalid on its face.
bound by the will of the voters when they passed article xii,section of our state constitution,we must direct the secretary of state not to place proposition on the ballot or in the ballot pamphlet for the special election of november.
facts and procedural background 
in,the legislature began the process of deregulating the electricity market in california by adding to the public utilities code an electrical restructuring chapter.stats,ch,pub,et further section references are to this code unless otherwise specified.its intent,said the legislature,was to,among other things,allow competition in the supply of electric power by permitting customers to choose from among competing suppliers of electric power,subds.d,k.
as an apparent means of effectuating its intent,the legislature authorized electric service providers to sell electricity directly to customers without puc regulation of the providers rates or terms and conditions of service.an electric service provider is defined as an entity offering electrical service to customers within the territory of an electrical corporation,including the unregulated affiliates and subsidiaries of electrical corporations,but not including electrical corporations,certain entities offering electrical service solely to serve customer load,and certain public agencies offering electrical service,subd.a.the puc was directed to take actions as needed to facilitate direct transactions between electricity suppliers and customers,subd.a.although it requires electric service providers to register with the puc,subd.b,the legislature stated explicitly that registration with the puc is an exercise of the puc licensing function and does not constitute regulation of the electric service providers rates or terms and conditions of service,and that n othing in this part authorizes the puc to regulate the rates or terms and conditions of service offered by electric service providers,subd.f 
on june,the secretary of state certified for the special election on november,an initiative measure now designated proposition.the first two sections of proposition contain its title and legislative intent.the next five sections,through the repeal and addition of public utilities code provisions,propose four substantive changes to the statutory law of california regarding the electricity market as follows 
sections and of proposition would,by two methods,subject electric service providers to the puc jurisdiction,control,and regulation through an amendment to the definition of electric service provider in section,and through a new subdivision f of section,stating that an electric service provider registration with the puc constitutes the provider agreement to puc jurisdiction,control,and regulation of its rates and terms and conditions of service in the same manner as the puc jurisdiction,control,and regulation of electrical corporations.
section of proposition would prohibit new direct transactions for retail electric service,by repealing and replacing section,and by repealing sections,and,which,among other things,express the legislature intent to allow electric service providers to sell electricity directly to customers.
section of proposition would amend section,subdivision b to require all retail sellers of electricity to increase procurement of eligible renewable energy resources so that percent of their retail sales are procured from eligible renewable energy resources by december.
section of proposition would add chapter,the reliable electric service act,to the public utilities code,directing the puc to establish a process to ensure each electrical corporation achieves the best value for its ratepayers by maintaining a diversified portfolio of generation,taking into account various specified factors,and to establish resource adequacy requirements to ensure that all load serving entities maintain adequate physical generating capacity to meet peak demand.
in addition to these four substantive statutory changes,proposition,in section,also provides that the legislature may amend this act only to achieve its purposes and intent and by at least a vote.and in section,proposition contains a standard severability clause.
turn,the proponent of proposition,has obtained from the california attorney general a title and summary for its proposed initiative measure.we take judicial notice of the title and summary,which emphasizes the provisions of proposition that would place electric service providers under puc jurisdiction.as of july.the attorney general title states electric service providers.regulation.initiative statute.the summary states in pertinent part subjects electric service providers,as defined,to control and regulation by california public utilities commission.imposes restrictions on electricity customers ability to switch from private utilities to other electric providers.provides that registration by electric service providers with commission constitutes providers consent to regulation.requires all retail electric sellers,instead of just private utilities,to increase renewable energy resource procurement by at least each year,with of retail sales procured from renewable energy by,instead of current requirement of.imposes duties on commission,legislature and electrical providers.
petitioners filed their original petition for writ of mandate in this court on june.we issued an alternative writ of mandate on july,and expedited briefing and oral argument,to permit this court to resolve the matter prior to august,the date that the ballot pamphlet is scheduled to be submitted to the state printer for the special election on november.we directed turn to file its return to the writ by july,and petitioners to file a replication,if any,by july.and we set the matter for oral argument on july.
discussion 
as a general rule,absent a clear showing of invalidity,court review of an initiative measure is more appropriate after the election to avoid disrupting the electoral process by preventing the exercise of the voters power.american federation of labor eu,supra,cal d at.however,this general rule applies only to a claim that a substantive provision of the initiative is unconstitutional it does not apply where the electorate lacks the power to adopt the proposal in the first instance.id.at,see also senate of the state of cal.jones cal th,d.t he principles of popular sovereignty which led to the establishment of the initiative and referendum in california do not disclose any value in putting before the people a measure which they have no power to enact.the presence of an invalid measure on the ballot steals attention,time and money from the numerous valid propositions on the same ballot.it will confuse some voters and frustrate others,and an ultimate decision that the measure is invalid,coming after the voters have voted in favor of the measure,tends to denigrate the legitimate use of the initiative procedure.american federation of labor eu,supra,cal d at.
proposition is unquestionably invalid on its face because,as expressed in greater detail in part ii of this opinion,post,it runs afoul of a plain and unambiguous provision of our state constitution,adopted by the voters many years ago,that effectively precludes use of the initiative process to accomplish what proposition proposes to do.consequently,preelection review is proper,indeed essential.
we pause to note that petitioners have not filed this petition for writ of mandate in the superior court in the first instance.we have discretion to decline to consider a writ petition when the petitioner has not sought relief in the superior court.county of sacramento hastings d.the reasons for this rule are obvious.the orderly processes of justice favor initiating proceedings in the superior court,which is equipped to resolve any factual disputes that might arise.the superior court may more easily shorten its time for briefing and hearing.and the superior court may grant relief in the nature of an injunction which is immediately final as to that court and subject to immediate review in an appellate court.
nevertheless,because proposition so plainly violates the california constitution,we exercise our discretion to review the writ petition in the first instance.to deny the petition without prejudice to its filing in the superior court might do a disservice to the voters,as explained above,by delaying the resolution of this matter such that relief could not be granted in time to prevent this obviously invalid initiative from being placed on the ballot for the special election on november.
the puc is a regulatory body of constitutional origin,deriving certain of its powers by direct grant from the constitution which created it.people western air lines,cal d.california constitution also authorizes the legislature to confer other powers on the puc.ibid.
article xii,section of the california constitution provides the legislature has plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article,to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the puc,to establish the manner and scope of review of puc action in a court of record,and to enable it to fix just compensation for utility property taken by eminent domain.hereafter article xii,section.
whether an initiative measure,like proposition,can confer additional authority and jurisdiction on the puc turns on the meaning of language in article xii,section,which gives plenary power to the legislature,unlimited by other provisions of california state constitution,to effect such change as long as the additional authority and jurisdiction is consistent with article xii.
in construing a constitutional provision,such as article xii,section,that was adopted by the voters,a court primary task is to determine the voters intent in adopting the provision.delaney superior court cal d.in undertaking this determination,we are mindful of this court limited role in the process of interpreting a provision of the constitution we must follow the electorate intent regardless of what we may think of the wisdom,expedience,or policy of the provision.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.this is so because the judicial role in a democratic society is fundamentally to interpret laws,not to write them.the latter power belongs primarily to the people and the political branches of government citation.it can not be too often repeated that due respect for the political branches of our government requires courts to interpret the laws in accordance with the expressed intention of the legislature or the electorate that adopted the laws.id.at,d.
to ascertain the electorate intent in adopting a provision of our state constitution,we turn first to the provision words themselves for the answer.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.we do so because the words are the most reliable indicator of the provision intent.people lopez cal th,d.the words must be considered in context and given their ordinary meaning.lungren deukmejian cal d,accord,dafonte,cal th,d,words are given their usual and ordinary meaning.if the language is unambiguous,we presume that the electorate meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the provision governs.people robles cal th,d.
thus,when the language of the provision is unambiguous,courts will not look to legislative history for the purpose of ascertaining the intent of the provision.people robles,supra,cal th at,d.where the language is clear,courts will not interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.citation.hartford fire ins.macri cal th,d.
article xii,section plainly and unambiguously states that the legislature power to confer additional authority and jurisdiction on the puc is plenary and unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution.the usual and ordinary meaning of plenary is complete,entire,perfect,not deficient in any element or respect full absolute,unqualified.oxford english dict.ed accord,webster new internat.dict.therefore,the usual and ordinary meaning of the phrase plenary power connotes total power,to the exclusion of all others.
in an exceptionally,indeed alluring,brief that is nonetheless unpersuasive upon close inspection,turn claims we must construe the words of article xii,section liberally in favor of the people right to exercise the powers of initiative thus,turn would have us read the words plenary power as simply remov ing any doubts that additional authority could be conferred on the puc by statute,without the necessity of a constitutional amendment.in turn view,the words plenary power had nothing to do with exempting this area of law from the initiative power.
such a reading of the phrase plenary power not only would be inconsistent with the ordinary,plain meaning of the phrase,it would require us to ignore that article xii,section goes on to say that the legislature plenary power is unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution.the people right to enact laws through the initiative process is one of those other provisions of our state constitution.the usual,ordinary meaning of the word unlimited is not bounded by exceptions.webster new internat.dict.at.thus,to say the legislature power not only is plenary,absolute,but also unlimited by other provisions of the constitution which include the people initiative power,is to say that only the legislature has power to confer additional authority and jurisdiction on the puc,provided as specified by article xii,section that the additional authority and jurisdiction is consistent with article xii.
turn argument is premised on its view that constitutional references to the legislature include the people acting by initiative.it is true that the people initiative power is legislative in nature and coextensive with the legislative power of the legislature.however,it does not follow that article xii,section must be interpreted to mean that the people,too,have plenary power via initiative to expand the puc authority and jurisdiction.significance should be given,if possible,to every word of a constitutional provision.citation.conversely,a construction that renders a word surplusage should be avoided.citations.delaney superior court,supra,cal d at.article xii,section uses the word legislature,not legislative.consequently,we would impermissibly rewrite the constitutional provision if we were to construe it to give the people the power by initiative to expand the puc authority and jurisdiction.this is particularly so because,as we have emphasized,section of article xii explicitly states that the legislature plenary power is unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution,which includes the constitutional provision that reserves to the people the initiative power.
for nearly a century,california supreme court has recognized the plenary power conferred on the legislature with respect to the puc by article xii,section,and by the same language contained in former article xii,sections and.
in pacific telephone.eshleman cal,the supreme court described the legislature power under former sections and now section of article xii as perhaps the first instance where a constitution itself has declared that a legislative enactment shall be supreme over all constitutional provisions,but nevertheless this is but a reversion to the english form of government which makes an act of parliament the supreme law of the land.id.at.
in county of sonoma state energy resources conservation.com.cal d,the supreme court observed that section of article xii,adopted in,in effect restates provisions in former sections and of article xii,originally adopted in,which gave the legislature comprehensive powers over puc matters.id.at.noting that the powers are plenary and unlimited by any provision of the constitution,the court concluded that they empower the legislature not only to restrict judicial review of puc decisions,as by eliminating the jurisdiction of courts other than this one to conduct such review citation,but also to expand the scope of this court review powers beyond the jurisdiction provided in article vi of the constitution citation.id.at.
nevertheless,turn argues that california courts have routinely concluded that constitutional provisions which give the legislature authority must be interpreted to recognize the people coextensive legislative authority through initiative.but the cases upon which turn relies are readily distinguishable.
kennedy wholesale,state bd.of equalization cal d,involved a voter passed initiative that raised taxes on tobacco products.it was challenged on the ground that it conflicted with article xiii a,section of the california constitution,which states that tax increases must be imposed by an act passed by not less than of all members elected to each of the two houses of the legislature id.at.the supreme court explained that the constitutional provision was susceptible to two reasonable interpretations only the legislature can raise taxes,or when the legislature raises taxes,it must do so by a supermajority.id.at.concluding that the former interpretation would implicitly repeal the initiative power reserved by the people to themselves in article iv,section of california constitution,the court noted that any doubt in interpreting the constitution must be resolved in favor of the exercise of the initiative power.id.at.
however,article xii,section is not reasonably susceptible to an interpretation other than that the legislature alone has exclusive power to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the puc.as we have explained,because article xii,section grants this plenary power to the legislature,unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution,it necessarily limits the initiative power recognized in article iv,section.turn contention,taken to its logical conclusion,is that the constitution can never limit the initiative power.not so.a constitution that creates the initiative power obviously can impose limitations on that power.article xii,section plainly and unambiguously does so.
other cases cited by turn simply stand for the proposition that constitutional provisions authorizing the legislature to act do not implicitly repeal the people power through initiative to undertake the same legislative act,state comp.ins.fund state bd.of equalization th,d carlson cory d.however,in contrast to the provisions at issue in those cases,article xii,section does not simply authorize the legislature to act it plainly provides that only the legislature may act.
in disputing our conclusion that the wording of article xii,section unambiguously prevents use of the initiative to confer on the puc additional authority and jurisdiction,turn argues that we place far more weight on the language of the provision than it can possibly be expected to bear.arguing the words of article xii,section were intended to make sure that the legislature had the authority to enlarge the jurisdiction of the puc,while at the same time reserving to themselves the power to exercise that authority themselves if the legislature refused to do so italics added,turn directs us to cases board of retirement santa barbara county grand jury th,d and westly board of administration th,d construing language in article xvi,section of the california constitution,which provides notwithstanding any other provisions of law or this constitution to the contrary,pension retirement boards have plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the system,subject to specified requirements.hereafter article xvi,section.
turn misses the point of those cases.board of retirement santa barbara county grand jury,supra,th,d concluded that article xvi,section can not be read to insulate pension boards from judicial oversight and thus does not preclude a county grand jury from investigating complaints regarding board delays in processing disability retirement applications of county employees.id.at,d.westly board of administration,supra,th,d concluded that the plenary authority granted by article xvi,section to the board to administer the system does not extend to the remuneration of those who administer the system rather it is limited to actuarial services and to the protection and delivery of the assets,benefits,and services for which the board has a fiduciary responsibility,and thus does not preclude the state controller from issuing warrants to employees of the board and auditing payments to ensure that expenditures are authorized by law.id.at,d.
those cases simply interpreted what it is that the board has plenary authority over,what the words investment of moneys and administration of the system encompass,and concluded that such plenary authority does not preclude action by other entities when the action does not intrude upon the specific subject matter reserved to the plenary authority of the board.the cases can not be construed to say that plenary authority over a specific subject does not really mean plenary authority.
with respect to article xii,section,the constitutional provision at issue in this
