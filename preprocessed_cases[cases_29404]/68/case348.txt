today we address a question we have twice deferred whether the federal energy regulatory commission has jurisdiction to review something called the installed capacity requirement icr,a key input into the mechanism that determines transmission tariffs and costs in the new england bulk power system.the question is presented here by the connecticut department of public utility control and allied intervenors,all petitioning for review of various instances where the commission has approved or modified the amount of the icr.although the details of this market mechanism are somewhat opaque and surely complicated,the ultimate legal issue before us reduces to a clear and simple one does the commission review of the icr constitute direct regulation of electrical generation facilities if so,it exceeds the commission authority under the federal power act if not,it falls within the commission jurisdiction over practices affecting wholesale rates.finding no direct regulation of electrical generation facilities in the commission review of the icr,we deny the petitions for review.
capacity is not electricity itself but the ability to produce it when necessary.it amounts to a kind of call option that electricity transmitters purchase from,can either produce more or consume less when required.the penultimate and most proximate buyers of capacity before the consumers who ultimately shoulder the costs in their utility bills are called load serving entities or public utilities that deliver electricity to end users.the goal is for lses to purchase sufficient capacity to easily meet expected peaks in electricity demand on their transmission systems.
because local lses will experience demand peaks at different times,and because interconnected lses can easily share excess capacity when necessary,these utilities can capture considerable efficiencies through cooperative decision making about how much capacity to buy as a whole and at what cost.see generally gainesville utils.dep t.power,d explaining reserve capacity efficiencies from interconnection.indeed,cooperation may be necessary to avoid a free rider problem,where some utilities count on the capacity they expect others to buy in order to support their own reliability.accordingly,new england has a history of cooperative decision making about capacity,dating back to the creation of the new england power pool nepool,the voluntary association of all new england public utilities that,subject to commission review,set capacity requirements for each individual utility and administered deficiency charges for those that failed to obtain their share.see municipalities of groton ferc.that role has since shifted to iso new england,a regional transmission organization that administers open access to transmission facilities in the new england bulk power system pursuant to the commission deregulatory mandate.see me.pub.utils.comm ferc,describing see generally transmission access policy study group ferc,affirming commission open access transmission approach to fostering competition.despite this cooperation,however,inefficiencies remained.
lacking open market mechanisms for setting capacity prices and quantities,struggled to incentivize innovation and investment in the capacity market while simultaneously suppressing costs.in an initial effort to respond to concerns over short supply,entered into reliability agreements with older and less efficient generators,pursuant to which paid for their inefficiencies so as to keep them on line and ensure system reliability.but the commission disfavors such agreements because they suppress prices and make it difficult for new generators to profitably enter the market.me.pub.utils.comm n,at quoting devon power llc,at.responding to these concerns,endeavored to create a different system with an demand curve that would establish the price and quantity of capacity that must be procured in the various of the new england grid.id.internal quotation marks omitted.but this too ran into problems it produced enormous controversy over the shape of the hypothetical curve.id.at criticizing the very concept of a demand curve constructed by a central decision maker.in short,these efforts failed to harness the power of competitive markets in determining the appropriate price of capacity,leading to inaccurate or inefficient levels of investment in or compensation for capacity providers.
enter the forward capacity market,which the commission approved as part of a settlement agreement among new england power system stakeholders on june.see id.at.in the forward details of which are at issue providers bid for contracts three years in the future as part of a descending clock auction.here how it works.determines the installed capacity requirement,or icr,which represents the estimated amount of capacity the system as a whole will require for reliability three years hence.it then announces the starting agreement,twice the estimated cost of new capacity providers state an amount of capacity they would be willing to offer at that price.if these offerings exceed the icr,lowers the offering price,which in turn lowers the quantity offered in response.this descending price clock stops when the quantity offered equals the icr,and that price point becomes the market clearing price.the capacity charge for each utility in the system is thus its share of the icr multiplied by the clearing price.
bidders in the forward market include existing generators,new entrants who believe they can obtain the necessary state and municipal permits to construct new generation,and resources,including users who can produce their own power or reduce their demand during shortages.their bids commit them to supply the amount they offer at the clearing price.by using competitive bidding for future capacity contracts,this system both incentivizes and accounts for new entry by more efficient generators,while ensuring a price both adequate to support reliability and fair to consumers.
in maine public utilities commission ferc,we reviewed a broad settlement among the many parties involved in new england bulk power system and rejected a challenge to the commission authority to create and review the operation of the forward market.at.in so doing,however,we expressly reserved the question whether the commission review of the icr created an independent jurisdictional problem,emphasizing that another pending that very question.id.at.when this issue was initially before us in,we remanded to the commission so that it could explain the statutory basis for its jurisdiction to review the icr.see.dep t of pub.util.control ferc.on remand,the commission explained its view that icrs have a significant and direct effect on jurisdictional rates and services,and therefore fall within the commission jurisdiction.iso new england,at.the case now returns to us for review,having been consolidated with other petitions presenting the same issue.
notwithstanding our approval of the forward market in maine public utilities commission,petitioners argue that the commission authority to approve or modify the icr as part of its review of transmission tariffs exceeds its jurisdiction under the federal power act.in their view,any movement upward in the installed capacity requirement requires installing capacity,and under section of the federal power act,the commission shall not have jurisdiction over facilities used for the generation of electric energy.b.the commission responds by emphasizing its broad power over practices affecting wholesale rates,see a,and by arguing that the effect of the icr on new generation capacity is sufficiently incidental to avoid section bar.we afford chevron deference to the commission assertion of jurisdiction.natural gas ferc,see also chevron natural res.def.council,d.
a twin pair of concessions radically simplifies the legal question before us.petitioners concede that the commission may determine just and reasonable capacity charges,petrs.reply br,and that it may set those charges so as to incentivize the procurement or creation of additional capacity to ensure system reliability,id.at.for its part,the commission concedes that while it has broad po
