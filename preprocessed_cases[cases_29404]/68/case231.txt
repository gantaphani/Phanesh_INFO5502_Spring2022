petitioners in this consolidated appeal seek review of the wholesale power rates set by the bonneville power administration bpa during its rate proceeding.two sets of petitioners contend that bpa unlawfully inflated the rates charged to public utilities and preference customers.first,the public generating pool and pacific northwest generating cooperative argue that bpa shifted onto its preference customers the costs of supplying power to its industrial customers.second,the western public agencies group,public power council,and public utility district of grays harbor argue that bpa shifted onto its preference customers the costs of settling its obligations to its utility customers.in addition,a third group of petitioners,confederated tribes of the umatilla indian reservation and the yakama nation,argues that the rates are not sufficient to satisfy bpa fish and wildlife obligations 
we hold that bpa acted lawfully when it allocated to its preference customers part of the cost of acquiring power to serve its industrial customers.however,consistent with our decision in a companion case filed at the same time as this one,portland general electric bpa,cir,we hold that bpa acted contrary to law when it allocated to its preference customers part of the cost of the settlement bpa reached with its utility customers.we also hold that bpa fish and wildlife cost estimates and,by extension,the rates based on those estimates,are not supported by substantial evidence.
background 
bpa is a federal agency that markets power generated primarily by federal hydroelectric projects in the columbia river basin.bpa customers include public utilities,cooperatives,and federal agencies collectively preference customers utilities ious and industrial users dsis.see aluminum of am.alcoa cent.lincoln peoples util,d describing bpa customer groups.other opinions of this court chronicle the history of bpa and describe the tangle of statutes that govern its operations.see,portland bpa,cir pub.power council,bpa,cir pub.power agency bpa,cir as amended ass of pub.agency customers,bpa,cir.we focus here only on those facts directly relevant to this appeal.
pursuant to the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act northwest power act or nwpa,bpa periodically determines the wholesale power rates it will charge its customers.section of the nwpa,governs bpa ratemaking activities.section requires,among other things,that bpa charge rates sufficient to cover its costs,including the amortization of the federal investment in the federal columbia river power system.id.a.section imposes limits,however,on how much bpa may charge its preference customers.see id.b.when the rate ceiling for preference customers is triggered,bpa must recover its additional costs through supplemental rate charges for all other power.see id.b.
in order to establish rates for fiscal years,bpa initiated the wholesale power rate adjustment proceeding rate case in august.see bpa,proposed wholesale power rate adjustment,public hearing,and opportunities for public review and comment announcement.after conducting hearings and compiling an administrative record,bpa proposed its rates in a record of decision issued on may,the initial rod.see bpa,final power rate proposal,administrator record of decision may.according to bpa,the rates represented the pricing implementation of the power subscription strategy that bpa had adopted in.see also bpa,power subscription strategy,administrator record of decision subscription rod.
bpa proposed rates do not become effective until they are confirm ed and approv ed by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.a.bpa therefore submitted its rates for ferc approval on july.shortly thereafter,the energy market became unexpectedly volatile,and market prices increased precipitously.in light of those market developments,bpa projected that demand for its relatively power would be higher than it had previously anticipated.in august,bpa requested that ferc temporarily delay consideration of the rates proposed in the initial rod.bpa then began to consult with interested parties regarding possible rate adjustments,including the development of new cost recovery adjustment charges cracs.
on december,bpa announced a revised rate proposal and commenced a new,abridged rate proceeding.see bpa,proposed amendments to wholesale power rate adjustment proposal supplemental announcement.bpa strategy was to amend its risk mitigation tools through three separate cracs,while retaining the base rates it had established in the initial rod.following a comment period and formal hearings,bpa issued a new record of decision on june,the supplemental rod.see bpa,supplemental power rate proposal,administrator final record of decision june.
bpa filed its supplemental rod rates with ferc on june.three months later,ferc granted interim approval.see order approving rates on interim basis and providing opportunity for additional comments,ferc.ferc gave final approval to the proposed rates on july.see order confirming and approving rates on a final basis,ferc july.the columbia river fish commission filed a petition for rehearing,which ferc denied on october.see order denying rehearing,ferc.
ii.jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,bpa argues that we lack jurisdiction to review petitions filed more than days after ferc july,order approving bpa rates.under section of the northwest power act,judicial challenges to final rate determinations must be brought within days of the time such action or decision is deemed final.e g,e.we have previously held that rate determinations are not deemed final until ferc denied the petitioners petition for rehearing.pacificorp ferc,cir see also.utilities transp.comm wutc ferc,cir cp bpa,cir as amended.thus,the key date in this case is not july,but october.because petitioners sought review within days of october,their petitions are timely.
bpa suggests that pacificorp and wutc were wrongly decided because ferc lacks authority to conduct a rehearing after approving bpa rates.without suggesting that pacificorp and wutc were wrongly decided,we note that a sufficient response to bpa suggestion is that we are required to follow our previous rulings.see,miller gammie,cir en banc.in any event,it does not matter in this case whether we deem bpa rate determination to be final on july or on october.petitioners filed an initial set of petitions with this court within days of ferc july order approving bpa rates.they then filed a second set of petitions within days of ferc october order denying rehearing.the two sets of petitions were consolidated for our review.given that at least one set of petitions is undeniably timely,we have jurisdiction to consider petitioners claims.
iii.recovering the cost of supplying power to industrial users 
the public generating pool and pacific northwest generating cooperative petitioners contend that bpa violated the northwest power act by supplying power to its dsi customers at the expense of its preference customers.the nwpa,which was enacted in,required bpa to enter initial long term contract s to sell power to its dsi customers.see d b.the idea was to ensure that dsis had continued access to federal power at a time when bpa obligation to serve its preference customers threatened to preclude bpa from supplying other customers.bpa was deemed to have sufficient resources for the purpose of entering into the initial contracts.id.g.bpa was then authorized to acquire additional resources necessary to meet its contractual obligations.id.a.bpa initial contracts its dsi customers expired on september.
anticipating the expiration of these contracts,bpa began in the late to develop a plan for allocating federal power among preference and customers.during this process,which culminated in the subscription rod,bpa concluded that it had authority under the nwpa to enter successor contracts with its dsi customers but that it was under no obligation to do so.see id.d.based on that understanding of the law,bpa agreed in principal to continue to supply power to its dsi customers.however,bpa decided to wait until the rate proceeding to determine how much power it would sell to the dsis and at what price.it set september,as the deadline for executing new dsi contracts.
in the initial rod,bpa proposed to sell to the dsis amw of firm power.of that amount,amw was to be priced,pursuant to c,at a rate representing the rate charged to bpa preference customers plus a margin.the remaining amw was to be priced,pursuant to f,at the market rate,which was higher.the two prices were then combined to establish a single average rate for the dsi customers.bpa explained in the initial rod that it adopted this approach in order to enhance dsi smelter survivability,but without raising other customers rates.
bpa also determined that its existing power generation capabilities would be inadequate to supply both its dsi and other customers.bpa estimated in the initial rod that it would need to acquire approximately amw of additional power to meet the needs of these customers.it explained that it would classify most of this additional power as federal base system fbs replacements.under the nwpa,fbs resources include three components the federal columbia river power system hydroelectric projects resources acquired by the administrator under contracts in force on december,and resources acquired by the administrator in an amount necessary to replace reductions in capability of the first two sources.id.bpa estimated that declines in the capability of its primary fbs resources allowed it to purchase up to amw of replacement fbs resources far more than the amount of power it actually planned to acquire.
shortly after issuing the initial rod,bpa recognized that,due to changing market conditions,it had significantly the amount of additional power it would need to purchase in the market.see supplemental rod calculating that bpa would need to make system augmentation purchases of amw.bpa briefly suspended execution of new power sale contracts in august,but lifted that suspension and continued to sign contracts during the fall of.bpa then initiated a supplemental rate proceeding in order to establish new cost recovery mechanisms.
during that supplemental proceeding,petitioners argued that bpa no longer had sufficient fbs resources to serve its dsi customers.according to petitioners,entering contracts to sell power to the dsis when bpa has none to sell them is unlawful the only way the contracts with the dsis can be lawfully performed is to require the dsis to pay the full costs of service.in other words,petitioners asserted that bpa could not allocate to its preference customers any of the costs of purchasing power at market prices to serve the dsis.
bpa rejected petitioners arguments in the supplemental rod.it explained that the northwest power act expressly grants bpa the authority to purchase power to replace reductions in the capability of the fbs and to acquire power to meet its forecasted contractual obligations to all its customers.supplemental rod.bpa further concluded that the fbs is a single resource pool,not a segmented resource to be divided into separately priced portions that serve any particular customer class.
to the extent petitioners here seek to challenge bpa authority to enter into successor contracts with dsis,their claim is barred by res judicata.we previously held in an unpublished disposition that petitioners attempt to contest the validity of bpa power sales to its dsi customers was untimely.coop.ass dep t of energy,cir.because p ower sale contracts are final agency actions,the statute of limitations begins to run from the date such contracts are executed.see also e b providing that power sales are final agency actions subject to judicial review.the petitions in this case were filed some three years after bpa entered into its new dsi after the prescribed statutory window for judicial review had expired.
in we also held,however,that petitioners would be entitled to raise ratemaking issues in subsequent litigation.at.specifically,we may consider in this litigation whether it was unlawful for bpa to charge its preference customers a rate that reflects the costs of acquiring additional power to serve dsis.our analysis takes the existence of bpa contractual obligations to its dsi customers as given we express no independent view as to whether,or under what circumstances,section d of the nwpa,d,permits bpa to contract with its dsi customers once their initial contracts have expired.
our review of bpa actions is governed by the administrative procedure act apa.see e.under the apa,we must uphold bpa actions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.pub.power council,at quoting a.in determining whether bpa has acted in accordance with law,we defer to bpa reasonable interpretations of its governing statutes.see,nw.envtl.def.ctr.bpa,cir.deference is especially appropriate when the agency is responding to unprecedented changes in the market resulting from deregulation.ass of pub.energy customers,at.however,r egardless of how serious the problem an administrative agency seeks to address,it may not exercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that congress enacted into law.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting etsi pipeline project missouri,d.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.public power agency,at quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
our task is to decide whether applicable law clearly precludes bpa from allocating to its preference customers certain costs of supplying power to its dsi customers.under section b of the nwpa,rates for electric power sold to meet the general requirements of preference customers shall recover the costs of that portion of the federal base system resources needed to supply such loads until such sales exceed the federal base system resources.b.petitioners construe fbs resources as referring only to bpa unaugmented power generation capabilities.according to petitioners,as long as preference customer loads do not exceed bpa unaugmented fbs resources,section b requires bpa to charge its preference customers rates that recover no more than the cost of those resources.bpa,joined by intervenor alcoa,counters that it is entitled to charge preference customers a rate that reflects the total cost of all fbs resources,including resources acquired to replace losses in the generation capabilities of bpa primary resources.
we conclude that bpa approach does not contravene the northwest power act and related provisions.contrary to petitioners claim,fbs resources are not limited to unaugmented fbs resources.rather,the statutory definition of fbs resources expressly includes resources acquired by bpa in an amount necessary to replace reductions in capability of bpa primary resources.id.section of the nwpa confirms bpa authority to acquire sufficient power to meet its contractual obligations.id.a see also alcoa,at.noting that o nce a contract between bpa and a customer is signed,the project act makes clear that the contract is binding in accordance with the terms thereof quoting a.bpa took this language to mean that,once it had satisfied the needs of its preference customers,it could use any remaining fbs fbs replacement supply its dsi customers.
once fbs replacement resources were acquired,nothing in section b precluded bpa from considering the costs of those replacement resources when calculating its preference rate,even though bpa would not have incurred such costs absent its dsi contracts.if fbs resources include both primary and replacement resources,and if bpa must recover the costs of that portion of fbs resources needed to supply preference customer loads,then it follows that bpa may impose rates based on the average cost of fbs resources as a whole.this result is consistent with central lincoln peoples utility district johnson,cir,which rejected the premise that preference customers were entitled to purchase not just available power,but the cheapest available power.id.at.
bpa approach is not contrary to the general statutory preference provisions on which petitioners rely.section of the bonneville project act,for example,requires that bpa shall at all times,in disposing of energy at said project,give preference and priority to public bodies and cooperatives.a.similarly,section a of the nwpa provides that a ll power sales under this chapter shall be subject at all times to the preference and priority provisions of the bonneville project act.id.a see also id.c.we have explained that these provisions protect the preference customers access to power supply they do not speak directly to price.see cent.lincoln,at see also alcoa,at.noting that the preference system merely determines the priority of different customers when the administrator receives conflicting or competing applications for power.there is no allegation here that bpa failed to provide the power necessary to meet the firm power load of its preference customers.b.
bpa is,of course,required to honor its preference customers right to purchase power at a reasonable price.cent.lincoln,at.petitioners cite to legislative history for the proposition that the nwpa protects preference as to both supply and price and that preference rates will be no higher than they would have been absent sales to customers,pt,at,cong.we agree that section b provides price benefits to preference customers in the form of a rate ceiling.id.at.we also agree that the legislative history contains some indications that congress did not intend for preference customers to bear the costs of acquiring fbs replacement resources.see,id.explaining that preference customers cost of power from bpa will not exceed the costs they would have paid for power if they were served from available federal base system resources emphasis added,pt,at cong,stating that t he lowest rates will be reserved for the normal loads of preference utilities.
bpa rate determination,however,accords with the notion that preference customers enjoy price benefits.after all,the preference rate will always be lower than even the lowest possible dsi rate,which consists of the preference rate plus the typical margins included by preference customers in their retail industrial rates.c.moreover,if fbs resources,including replacement resources,are not sufficient to satisfy bpa contractual obligations to its customers,bpa may not allocate to its preference customers the costs of acquiring power.bpa may,however,allocate the cost of fbs resources,including replacement resources,to both its preference and customers.we therefore hold that bpa decision to set a preference rate that reflects the cost of fbs replacement resources was based on a permissible construction of the nwpa 
iv.recovering the cost of settling obligations to utilities 
the western public agencies group,public power council,and public utility district of grays harbor petitioners argue that bpa violated the northwest power act by forcing its preference customers to bear the costs of a global settlement between bpa and its utility iou customers.in addition to requiring bpa to enter initial contracts with dsis,the nwpa also created a residential exchange program rep to ensure that ious would continue to enjoy access to power.the details of the rep are set out in section c of the nwpa.see c.the program permits ious to sell power to bpa at the ious average system cost and then purchase,in exchange,an equivalent amount of bpa power at a lower price,which the ious may then sell to their residential customers.id.c.as we explain in our separate opinion filed today,t he rep essentially acts as a cash rebate to the ious where the ious power costs exceed those of the bpa.portland,at see also wutc,at cp,at.
the nwpa requires that the ious exchange benefits not come at the expense of bpa preference customers.under section b,preference customer rates must be calculated as if bpa made no purchases or sales under the b.any amounts not charged to preference customers as a result of section b rate ceiling test must instead be recovered through supplemental rate charges for all other power sold by bpa to all customers.b.the practical effect of the rate ceiling is that once it is reached,qualifying ious must then pay for the costs of the additional benefit they receive,thereby reducing the overall value of their benefits.portland,at.
over time,as the cost of bpa power increased,the value of the rep benefit declined,and bpa began to consider new ways to lower the power costs of the ious.in its subscription rod,bpa proposed a global settlement with its iou customers.bpa explained that it was acting under its general authority to settle claims arising under its contracts.see f,a.the proposed settlement guaranteed the ious a certain amount of power at rates no higher than the rates charged to preference customers.in exchange,the ious agreed to release bpa from future rep obligations.portland,at.the total cost of the proposed settlement significantly exceeded bpa own projection of future rep costs.id.
even though section of the nwpa normally ensures that the costs of the rep are not passed along to bpa preference customers,bpa classified the cost of the rep settlement as an ordinary cost of doing business that could be recovered through higher rates on all its customers.see id.at see also g.in setting its preference rates,bpa first determined how much it could charge its preference customers pursuant to section b rate ceiling.b.bpa then adjusted the preference rate upward in order to recover costs associated with the rep settlement.according to petitioners,this additional step contravened the nwpa cost allocation rules.rather than including settlement costs in the preference rate,petitioners explain that bpa should have recovered those costs through supplemental rate charges for all other power pursuant to section b.id.b.
in portland general electric,we hold today that bpa construed and exercised its settlement authority in a manner that was contrary to the clearly expressed intent of congress in the bonneville project act and the nwpa.portland,at.we explain that bpa settlement authority is subject to the constraints of b of the nwpa.id.at see also id.at bpa may enter into rep settlement contracts with ious,but only on terms that will protect the position of its preference customers,consistent with section b.by burdening its preference customers with part of the cost of the rep settlement,bpa ignored its obligations under sections b and.id.at.our holding in portland general electric is dispositive here bpa plain ly violat ed the rule that the rates it charges preference customers must be calculated as if no purchases or sales were made under the rep program.id.quoting b c.
fish and wildlife costs 
confederated tribes of the umatilla indian reservation and the yakama nation the tribes contend that bpa underestimated the cost of fish and wildlife programs when it set its rates.according to the tribes,those rates therefore provide insufficient revenue to satisfy bpa fish and wildlife obligations.unlike the other petitioners,the tribes seek review not only of bpa rate determination but also of ferc decision to confirm and approve the rates.apart from structuring the relationship between bpa and its customers,one of the primary purposes of the northwest power act was to protect,mitigate and enhance the fish and wildlife,including related spawning grounds and habitat,of the columbia river and its tributaries,particularly anadromous fish which are of significant importance to the social and economic of the pacific northwest and the nation.the nwpa requires bpa and other federal agencies to exercise their responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this chapter and other applicable laws,to adequately protect,mitigate,and enhance fish and wildlife in a manner that provides equitable treatment for such fish and wildlife with the other purposes for which the system and facilities are managed and operated.id.h a i see also nw.envtl.def.ctr.bpa,cir nw.res.info,nw.power planning council,cir wildlife fed ferc,cir.
the nwpa requires bpa to take into account its fish and wildlife obligations when it sets its wholesale power rates.rates must be high enough to ensure that bpa will recover it
