this appeal presents the question of whether a court may retroactively declare a railroad right of way abandoned under the abandoned railway right of way act.we conclude that the act does not permit a nunc pro tunc abandonment declaration.
the storied clark fork river in montana was formed from floods left by the last ice age and named by meriwether lewis during the expedition return from the west coast.its tributaries were celebrated by author norman maclean in his novella a river runs through it one of the most spectacular settings in the lower clark fork river valley is just over a bridge from noxon,montana,where the use of the rails ended and our controversy began.

by the early,northern pacific had constructed its rail line on the south bank of the clark fork river in northwestern montana.the rail line crossed what would later be surveyed as government lot of section in township north,range west.in,arthur hampton acquired the patent to government lot under the homestead act of.the patent purported to convey all of government lot,and contained no mention of northern pacific right of way.
in the early,washington water power,a predecessor of avista,began construction of the cabinet gorge dam in idaho,which created the cabinet gorge reservoir on the clark fork river in idaho and montana.to fill the reservoir,washington water power needed to secure either fee title to the shoreline or water flowage easements over shoreline property.accordingly,in july,arthur hampton widow,fanny hampton,deeded a ll that part of government lot lying north of the northern pacific right of way to washington water power.the conveyance included roughly acres lying in between the northern pacific right of way and the clark fork river,as well as 
all tenements,hereditaments,and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining,and the reversion or reversions,remainder and remainders,rents,issues,and profits thereof and also all the estate,right,title,interest,right of dower and right of homestead,possession,claim,and demand whatsoever,as well in law as in equity of fanny hampton of,in or to the said premises,and every part and parcel thereof,with the appurtenances thereto belonging 
one year later,in july,northern pacific purported to relinquish to the united states a one hundred foot wide strip of the right of way,adjacent to the land conveyed to washington water power by fanny hampton.the united states bureau of land management sent a letter to northern pacific approving the relinquishment.
in july,northern pacific and washington water power entered into an agreement under which northern pacific would abandon its right of way on the south side of the clark fork and relocate its rail line to the north side of the river.the move would facilitate washington water power efforts to construct and maintain a power dam and reservoir,known as the noxon rapids development,on the river.under the relocation agreement,washington water power agreed to convey to northern pacific a portion of land on the north bank of the clark fork over which the relocated tracks would run and to construct the new rail line at its own expense.in exchange,northern pacific agreed to convey to washington water power,to the extent that it may lawfully do so,the existing right of way and the trackage and improvements on it.the parties agreed that the conveyances would occur simultaneously after the new track was completed and northern pacific commenced service on the relocated line.
in two letters to washington water power in march and april,northern pacific reiterated its understanding that the right of way was to be abandoned upon relocation and that any use thereafter would be private use by washington water power at its own expense.on august,the montana board of railroad commissioners ordered the northern pacific stations on the south bank of the clark fork at tuscor and noxon to be deemed discontinued and abandoned.by late,the relocation of northern pacific rail line to the north side of the clark fork was completed and the railroad released its track and other personal property on the south side of the river to washington water power.
in january,northern pacific informed washington water power that it was planning to install a derailment point east of the new line,after which northern pacific would discontinue handling of traffic along the southern right of way.northern pacific would deliver traffic consigned to washington water power to a point immediately east of the derail on what formerly was our main track.in february,washington water power proposed an arrangement under which the parties would divide responsibility for handling cars carrying materials for dam construction.t he intention of the proposed arrangement was that the expense involved would be paid as nearly equally as possible by northern pacific and washington water power.based on its calculations of the number of cars to be utilized and the traffic schedule,washington water power proposed that northern pacific handle all traffic until september,after which washington water power or its contractor would handle cars left by northern pacific at the derailment point.
several months later,counsel for washington water power expressed concern that title to the right of way might revert to the united states or vest in another third party upon abandonment by northern pacific.to avoid such a result,washington water power requested northern pacific convey title to portions of its right of way,including the section crossing government lot,to sanders county.
on october,northern pacific executed a quitclaim deed conveying its interest in those portions of the right of way to sanders county for use as a highway.the conveyance states that the rail line had been relocated to the north side of the clark fork on account of the construction of the noxon rapids dam,and that the track and other structures on the right of way had been conveyed to washington water power by a bill of sale.on the same date in a letter to washington water power,northern pacific stated that effective october only traffic directly consigned to washington water power would pass on the southern rail line with handling by your firm or agent and that all other traffic would route through the new line.
sanders county accepted the quitclaim deed on february,and public use of a road over the former right of way began in the early.on january,sanders county quitclaimed to the descendants of arthur and fanny hampton all of its interest in the right of way,reserving to itself two wide easements on the existing public roads.the hampton descendants subsequently submitted a subdivision application for their section of government lot,including the former northern pacific right of way,to sanders county.the final plat of the subdivision,the hamptons,was approved by sanders county and filed on june.
avista instituted this action in the district of montana against the descendants of arthur and fanny hampton hamptons and sanders county after learning of the proposed subdivision of government lot.avista amended complaint includes declaratory judgment and quiet title claims,seeking a declaration regarding the ownership of the right of way traversing government lot and quieting title in sanders county.avista also claims that sanders county acted negligently by disclaiming its interest in the to the hamptons without following the montana statutory requirements for the abandonment or sale of public land 
the defendants collectively submitted a motion for summary judgment.in its for summary judgment,avista asserted that it has title to the centerline of the abandoned right of way as an adjacent landowner and successor in interest to arthur hampton.at the hearing on the summary judgment motions,the parties agreed that the authenticity of the documents in the record was not in dispute,that no additional relevant evidence was available and that therefore the court should decide the case on summary judgment and cancel the proposed trial.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and denied avista for summary judgment.the district court concluded that under the abandoned right of way transferred by operation of law to the hamptons as successors in interest to arthur hampton.the court further held that even if sanders county took title to the right of way pursuant to the exception for public highways,the county would only hold title to the land underlying the county roads,with the remainder reverting to the hamptons.finally,the court rejected avista centerline theory on the grounds that avista was neither a successor in interest to the hampton estate nor an adjacent landowner.this timely appeal followed.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.qwest comm ns,berkeley,cir 
our consideration of the abandoned railroad right of way act is guided by our decision in vieux.in vieux,we adopted an analysis of from idaho oregon short line,which paraphrased the statute requirements 
whenever public lands which have been may be granted to railroads for use as 
use and occupancy of the land for such purposes has ceased 
a by forfeiture 
or b by abandonment 
as decreed by a court with jurisdiction or as declared by act of congress 
all of the united states in such lands shall be transferred to and vested in any person or entity to whom the united states has granted title by a conveyance purporting to convey lands traversed by a railroad.
a lands embraced in a public highway established within one year of declaration of forfeiture or abandonment shall belong to the state 
id.emphasis in original vieux,at.
thus,vieux first clarified that only applied to grants of public land.none of the procedures applied to railroad rights of way over land 
second,vieux underscored that for any reversionary property rights to vest,the use and occupancy of the land must have ceased by abandonment or forfeiture and the abandonment or forfeiture must have been declared by congress or a court of competent jurisdiction.
third,vieux explained that vested reversionary rights are subject to divestment if a public highway is legally established within one year after the declaration of abandonment or forfeiture by congress or a court of competent jurisdiction.id.at.
finally,if the two prerequisites have been satisfied,and a public highway is not established within a one year period after the declaration of forfeiture or abandonment,then the right of way shall be transferred to and vested in any person or entity to whom the united states has granted title by a conveyance purporting to convey lands traversed by a railroad,oregon short line.at.
in addition to explaining how private property rights could vest and be divested under,vieux explained how reversionary interests should be analyzed.these reversionary interests are the inchoate reversionary rights that private property owners have after abandonment of use and occupancy of the right of way by the railroad,but before congress or a court has declared the right of way abandoned or forfeited.id.at.as to these interests,vieux held that reversionary interests arose after physical abandonment of the use and occupancy of the right of way.id.at.vieux also held that these nonvested reversionary interests could be extinguished if the former rights of way are embraced in a public highway legally established within one year after the date of said abandonment.id.at quoting in part.in short,the creation of a public highway within one year of the physical abandonment would serve to extinguish the reversionary interests,which then could never become vested.
under vieux,then,there are two time periods in which the creation of a public highway would operate to extinguish reversionary rights.first,if a public highway were created within one year after physical abandonment but prior to any declaration by congress or court that would vest the rights,then the rights that arose at the time of abandonment would be extinguished.second,after a declaration of forfeiture or abandonment by congress or a court had vested the reversionary rights,the vested reversionary rights that arose after the declaration could be divested by the creation of a public highway within one year of the declaration 
the first question in our case,then,is whether any nonvested reversionary interests arose by the railroad cessation of use and occupancy of the noxon right of way.the record supports the district court conclusion that northern pacific physically abandoned the right of way in october.
the question of when a railroad has ceased using and occupying a right of way for railroad purposes involves a factual inquiry.vieux,at.the inquiry is guided by the plain and apparent meaning of the statutory terms,as well as common law principles of abandonment.id.common law principles of abandonment include a present intent to abandon,and physical acts evidencing clear intent to relinquish the property interest.id.at citing oregon short line.at.other circuits have characterized abandonment to be an intention of the carrier to cease permanently or indefinitely all transportation service on the relevant line.id.at quoting chicago transp.kalo brick tile,d.among the indicia relevant to the use and occupancy inquiry are whether railway services have been discontinued,whether the railroad has removed its tracks and other railroad structures,whether it uses the right of way for storage or other railroad purposes such as training exercises,whether maintenance of the line has been discontinued,and whether the railroad continues to pay property taxes on the right of way as operating property.vieux,at oregon short line.at.
here,the evidence in the record strongly supports the district court finding that northern pacific had ceased its use and occupancy of the railroad right of way in october.the relocation agreement established northern pacific intent to transfer,insofar as it may legally do so,all its rights and title in the present railroad property to be abandoned to washington water power following relocation of its line to the north side of the clark fork.the agreement further provided that washington water power was to r emove the abandoned line of railroad and could salvage the track that it replaced.in march and april,northern pacific reiterated its understanding that following relocation,its main line on the south side of the river between the two new river crossings,was to be abandoned and all service eliminated,and that it would transfer all its rights and title in the present railroad property to be abandoned to washington water power and the abandoned line would become the property of washington water power.these documents unmistakably evidence northern pacific intent to abandon the right of way on the south side of the river.
northern pacific thereafter followed through on its plans to abandon the right of way.in august,the montana board of railroad commissioners ordered that northern pacific stations on the south side of the river at tuscor and noxon be closed and abandoned.by late,the relocation of northern pacific rail line to the north side of the clark fork was completed and the railroad released its track and other personal property on the south side of the river to washington water power.northern pacific and washington water power later agreed that as of september,washington water power would exclusively handle all traffic on the right of way.after questions arose regarding whether northern pacific could transfer title to washington water power,it executed a quitclaim to the right of way to sanders county on october,
avista argues that the fact that northern pacific did not obtain a court decree of abandonment,despite its familiarity with,or petition the interstate commerce commission for permission to abandon the right of way,suggests that it did not intend to abandon the right of way.while petitioning the for abandonment proceedings is indicative of a railroad intent to abandon,t he does not determine abandonment.vieux,at.rather,action by the is only a determination that under its congressional mandate,cessation of service would not hinder purposes.id.here,interstate railroad transportation was not implicated therefore,approval was not required.
avista also makes several alternative arguments about the timing of the abandonment,suggesting that northern pacific continued its use of the rail line into the.although there is some evidence of incidental use,the record as a whole supports the district court conclusion that northern pacific physically abandoned the right of way by october.
given the conclusion that abandonment occurred in october,the next question is whether a public highway was constructed within one year after that date,which would operate to extinguish any reversionary private property rights.the record supports the district court conclusion that a public road was not established within the one year period.the county did not accept a purported conveyance of the property until february,and the record supports the district court conclusion that public use of a road over the former railroad right of way did not commence until the early.indeed,as late as,the county questioned its authority over the former right of way.
given the undisputed evidence in the record,the district court properly concluded that a public highway was not established within the statutory one year period.therefore,the private reversionary interests in the right of way were not extinguished by public highway use after physical abandonment 
under vieux,the next question presented would be whether congress or a court of competent jurisdiction had declared the right of way abandoned,thereby vesting the private reversionary interests.here,all parties concede that prior to the district court declaration of abandonment,neither congress nor a court of competent jurisdiction had acted.therefore,the district court order constituted a declaration of abandonment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,as contemplated by.
normally,the analysis would end here.a final declaration of abandonment would be entered as a final judgment and the inchoate reversionary interests would be declared vested,subject to divestment if a public highway were established within a year after the formal declaration.however,in this case,the district court made its declaration of abandonment retroactive to the date of physical abandonment.reasoning from that premise,the district court then determined that,because a public road had not been established within a year of physical abandonment,the private reversionary interests vested as of october.the district court erred in doing so.
the district court reached its conclusion that a retroactive declaration was proper based on its analysis of vieux,reasoning that if application of the highway exception could extinguish private interests retroactively,then the vesting of those interests could be declared retroactively.this reasoning ignores the distinction made in vieux between inchoate and vested interests.as we have discussed,vieux held that any inchoate interests created by physical abandonment could be extinguished by establishment of a public highway within one year of physical abandonment.however,vieux also held that no inchoate reversionary interest could become vested until either congress or a court of competent jurisdiction declared the right of way forfeited or abandoned.thus,vieux does not support the conclusion that a court could declare abandonment retroactively.contrary to the district court conclusion,the vieux panel did not issue a retroactive declaration of abandonment,which would have the effect of vesting private property reversionary rights nunc pro tunc.rather,vieux held first that no vested rights were created because there had not been a congressional or court declaration of abandonment,and second that any inchoate rights created by physical abandonment had been extinguished by application of the public highway exception.
a declaration of retroactive abandonment would be inconsistent with the plain language of,which requires both physical abandonment and a formal declaration of abandonment for reversionary interests to vest.a retroactive declaration would also be incompatible with the structure of,because it would deprive local and state governments of the opportunity to acquire the right of way pursuant to the highway exception for example,here,the operation of the district court decision deprived sanders county of the opportunity to acquire the right of way by first applying a declar
