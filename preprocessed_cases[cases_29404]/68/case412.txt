electricity utility companies entergy services,southern company services,and nevada power company,petition for review of various orders of the federal energy regulatory commission in which the commission held that certain costs incurred by customers connecting generators to petitioners networks must be spread across all customers and not directly assigned to the respective generator companies.specifically,the commission found that because the connection facilities in each case were located at or beyond the point of connection to the network,they constituted network upgrades not directly assignable to individual generators.
petitioners contend that the commission orders should be reversed because they are unsupported by substantial evidence,and that the commission orders should be reversed because the at or beyond rule constitutes an arbitrary departure from commission precedent.because we agree with intervenor tenaska,that entergy and southern lack standing to pursue their claims,we limit our review to the objections advanced by nevada power.however,because we hold that the order from which nevada power petitions has not adequately explained the commission apparent departure from prior practice,we vacate and remand that order for further proceedings.
background 
regulatory background 
petitioners in this services,entergy,southern company services,southern,and nevada power nevada power are electricity utility companies that own transmission systems providing electricity to large geographic regions.in order to foster a more competitive,efficient market for electricity,federal regulation requires that such transmission providers open their networks to transmission sellers of electricity seeking to supply power to their own customers.see promoting wholesale competition through open access nondiscriminatory transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,order,ferc stats.regs,fed.reg.order,on reh g,order,ferc stats.regs,fed.reg,on reh g,order,wl,on reh g,order,wl,aff,transmission access policy study group ferc,aff sub,new york ferc,d.
in implementation of order,the commission promulgated a pro forma open access transmission tariff oatt that sets forth the minimum terms and conditions under which transmission providers may offer their services to customers.see order at including the final oatt c requiring public utilities owning,controlling,or operating facilities transmitting electricity in interstate commerce to have on file with the commission a tariff of general applicability for transmission services or a tariff approved by the commission consistent with order.
under this tariff regime,some costs incurred by an interconnecting customer are borne by the respective customer,while other costs are spread across all customers on the network.in general,when a generator of electricity connects to a transmission provider network consistent with order,the transmission provider can not require the generator to bear costs incurred for the development of equipment that benefits all users of the network.duke energy,wl,at.such costs,spread across all customers,are known as network upgrades.the generator must initially finance the costs,but upon completion of the interconnection project the transmission provider spreads the cost among all customers and rebates to the generator its initial investment by providing it with transmission credits against its tariff expenses.by contrast,when a new generator incurs cost developing equipment of no benefit to the existing customers,the costs are assigned to the generator alone.this is known as direct assignment,and the equipment is known as direct assignment facilities.
the specific tariff and other interconnection details are finalized in an interconnection agreement ia between the transmission provider and the generator.ias are drafted by the parties and are submitted to the commission for approval.
factual overview 
the consolidated cases before this court arise from the commission disapproval of four ias submitted for its approval.
entergy submitted an unexecuted ia to the commission on november.amelia energy center,lp amelia was the other party to the agreement.at issue were two connection facilities a new switching station section to accommodate two new kv radial power lines from the generators and the of three existing power lines.the commission held that the ia could not directly assign costs for the facilities at issue to amelia,because the facilities were located at or beyond the point of interconnection with the grid,and as such provided benefit to all users.see entergy gulf states,wl,reh g denied,wl.on june,the commission accepted entergy proposed termination of the ia prior to termination,the ia was of indefinite duration.
southern submitted two ias for commission approval.it submitted its first ia,between its alabama power transmission system and blount county energy,llc blount,on november.at issue was a replacement breaker at the miller steam plant substation.the commission held that the cost of the breaker could not be directly assigned to the generator,in light of the at or beyond rule.southern company services,letter order,docket no,reh g denied,wl.on january,the commission accepted southern request to terminate the blount ia prior to termination,the ia was of a term,subject to prior termination by mutual assent.
southern submitted its second ia,between its georgia power transmission system and athens development,llc athens,on june.at issue were three kv breakers at two georgia power substations.the commission held that the cost of the breakers could not be directly assigned to athens,in light of the at or beyond rule.southern company services,letter order,docket no.july,reh g denied,wl.on august,southern filed a notice of cancellation regarding the athens ia.see southern company services,wl.the ia was cancelled effective january,when the parties submitted a revised ia.prior to cancellation,the original ia was of a term of no less than ten years,subject to exceptions.
nevada power submitted an unexecuted ia to the commission on may.genwest,llc genwest was the other party to the agreement.at issue was a one line terminal to be added to nevada power harry allen kv switchyard.the commission held that the cost of the one line terminal could not be directly assigned to genwest,in light of the at or beyond rule.nevada power,wl,at nevada power i,reh g denied,wl,nevada power ii.neither party has cancelled the agreement.it is for a term of at least ten years,subject to exceptions.
following these administrative proceedings,entergy,southern,and nevada power filed these petitions for review.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
three of the four ias at issue in these consolidated cases have been cancelled by the parties,with the consent of the commission.therefore,the cases arising under those three contracts are now moot,and we lack jurisdiction to hear these petitions.moreover,because petitioners fail to show injury in fact resulting from the commission at or beyond rule per se,they lack standing to challenge generally the commission policies that underlie those orders.
a challenge to a specific commission order regarding an interconnection agreement is moot when the contract is terminated.northwest pipeline ferc,obviously,the challenged rate terms disappeared into the regulatory netherworld when the certificates themselves entered the archives thus,to the extent it seeks review of orders affecting the certificates,petitioner claim is,beyond reasonable dispute,moot.the entergy and southern ias have joined their predecessors in the regulatory netherworld entergy and southern bring no live controversy to this court.arguably,at least,the flaw in jurisdiction over two of the ias should be viewed entirely in terms of standing rather than mootness,as entergy and southern with reference to its second petition had already terminated their ias before seeking the assistance of an article iii court.by way of comparison,in advanced management technology,faa,we had to decide whether standing or mootness doctrine applied in a situation where the petitioner filed its challenge to the agency termination of a contract after the agency had the contract to petitioner.the claim may sound like one of justiciable controversy existed but no longer the timing makes petitioner problem one of standing standing is assessed at the time the action commences,in this case,at the time petitioner sought relief from an article iii court.id.at quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d internal citation omitted.in any event,we lack article iii jurisdiction to consider their specific complaints.
petitioners treat the justiciability analysis as a question of mootness.under the mootness analysis,petitioners argue that a challenge to agency action is not moot where there is a reasonable chance of the dispute arising again between the government and the same petitioner.legal assistance for vietnamese asylum seekers dep t of state,lavas,vacated on other grounds,d.granted,we so held in lavas,but that is not a parallel for the present case.in lavas,we noted that the precedents upon which we relied therein stood for the proposition that the government can not escape the pitfalls of litigation by simply giving in to a plaintiff individual claim without renouncing the challenged policy id.that is not what happened in the petition before us today.the government did not give in petitioners abandoned the petition.while it may be true that the government can not by selective surrender establish mootness to prevent challenge to its policies,this does not prevent mootness from occurring where the challengers have abandoned the case or controversy that they would have us decide.the entergy and southern petitions fall into the latter category,not the former.there is no ongoing case or controversy.these challenges are moot.
these petitioners can not take refuge under the broader doctrine of capable of repetition yet evading review.see,weinstein bradford,d.the very contracts at issue establish operative terms of at least ten years.some were of indefinite duration.such contracts provide ample time for both administrative and judicial review.indeed,the present petition did not evade review petitioners themselves chose to abandon the undertakings that gave rise to the controversy.if further proof is needed that such contracts do not fall within that exception to the mootness rule,the petition of nevada power,which remains an active controversy before us,clearly establishes that an ia need not evade review.
southern and entergy claim that they are nonetheless before the court with a justiciable controversy because they are asserting facial challenges to the ongoing policy as well as seeking review of their underlying contracts.this argument also fails to keep them in court.while it is true that a petitioner with a mooted individual controversy may at times have standing to challenge an ongoing policy,such a petitioner must demonstrate standing to obtain each type of relief sought.see city of houston hud.even if we assume that entergy and southern have properly raised a challenge to commission policies beyond the specific orders for which they have sought review,they have not demonstrated that they have standing to challenge such ongoing policies.
to meet the irreducible constitutional minimum for standing,petitioners must show,inter alia,that they suffer an actual injury in fact which is caused by the commission policy.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the commission at or beyond rule challenged by petitioners does not affect entergy or southern until they are confronted with it in a matter before the commission regarding a live interconnection agreement.until then,they are in a position identical to that of any other utility company whose hypothetical future interconnection agreements may be evaluated according to the rule.to open the courthouse doors to entergy and southern for the purposes of their policy challenge disembodied from the original commission orders would open the door to every other utility company challenges to commission policies.federal courts do not have the jurisdiction to render advisory opinions on such matters,with respect to ferc or any other administrative agency.
entergy and southern lack standing to proceed before this court.this court therefore lacks jurisdiction over the entergy and southern petitions their cases are dismissed.
limitation of issues 
the elimination of the entergy and southern cases limits the matters remaining for this court consideration.this court power to review ferc petitions is tightly circumscribed no objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.b.parties seeking review of ferc orders must petition for rehearing of those orders and must themselves raise in that petition all of the objections urged on appeal.platte river whooping crane critical habitat maint.trust ferc,emphasis in original.
we construe narrowly.in kelley ex rel.dep t of resources ferc,we held that objections not explicitly presented in proceedings below,but arguably implicit in other objections,were not properly preserved suffice to say that an argument implicit in prior requests before the commission staff does not satisfy the strict standard of b of the federal power act,codified at.
while offers petitioners an,a reasonable ground for failure to urge the objection power offers no such reasonable ground for its failure to raise several objections in its petition for ferc rehearing.therefore,any objections raised by petitioners consolidated briefs but not raised by nevada power in its administrative proceedings are not properly before this court.
the only issues raised by nevada power in its petition for rehearing and preserved in petitioners consolidated briefs are whether the commission determination that the facilities at issue benefit the entire network was not supported by substantial evidence,and the commission at or beyond rule represents an unjustified departure from past precedent.request for rehearing at,nevada power,docket no.a different version of these arguments advanced by entergy or southern that was not advanced by nevada,that the commission ignored evidence that the facilities in question actually decrease network not properly before this court in our consideration of nevada power case.such an argument was not even alone nevada power objections before the commission.indeed,the evidence allegedly ignored by the sworn introduced in southern proceedings,not nevada power.
substantial evidence 
nevada power argues that the commission finding that facilities located at or beyond the point of interconnection to the network benefit the entire network was not supported by substantial evidence.see e the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be unsupported by substantial evidence.it argues that genwest was the sole beneficiary of the facilities at issue,and that geographic location of the additions to the harry allen switchyard is not itself sufficient justification for a finding to the contrary.
but nevada power view of benefit is too narrow.like the petitioners in another recent challenge to the commission policy,this petitioner suffers from a cramped view of what constitutes a benefit.entergy services,ferc,entergy i.nevada power focuses on the benefit of reliability or stability,which we recognized in entergy i,id.at.see brief for petitioners at.so does nevada power expert.answer of nevada power at ex.a whalen aff.at,nevada power,docket no.july.but stability is not the only benefit recognized by the commission the commission cites the new facilities contribution to the switchyard expanded energy flow.brief for respondent at.indeed,the whalen affidavit recognizes that,but for the added facilities,genwest could not contribute its energy flow to the network.id.this court has recognized that system expansion is a benefit sufficient to support the commission pricing policy,entergy i,at,and we repeat that recognition here today.
the justifications that this court accepted for the commission application of the cost allocation policy to those specific facilities also warrant this court approval of the policies application to the facilities here.as we noted,o ur conclusion that the commission has adequately set forth its rationale rests on its explanation in the consumers energy decisions that the commission relied upon in the order to review.id.at.
the consumers energy explanation was the commission justification of a standard policy that requires credits for network upgrades,consumers energy,wl,at consumers energy ii emphasis added,quoted in entergy i,at,not just for certain types of network upgrades.petitioner contends that the facilities before us are not network upgrades.however,consumers energy resolves the question by its reference to the commission may,order.the commission defined network upgrades by the point of connection of facilities,without a analysis of marginal benefit to other users 
the commission policy regarding credits for network upgrades associated with the interconnection of a generating facility has been,and continues to be,that all network upgrade costs the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator connects to the grid,including those necessary to remedy and stability problems,should be credited back to the customer that funded the upgrades once delivery service begins.
consumers energy,wl,at consumers energy i emphasis added.in short,the commission definition of network upgrade,accepted by entergy i,includes any changes to facilities located on the grid.the consumers energy i justification,quoted above and in entergy i,set forth an overarching defense of at least a from test all facilities from the point where the generator connects to the grid.id.emphasis added.
petitioners urge us to read entergy i narrowly,restricting it to the facilities at issue in that case and stability network upgrades.at.but to adopt such a narrow reading would be to adopt a cramped view of entergy i less cramped view.id.at.entergy i does not endorse the commission policy merely with respect to short circuit and stability network upgrades.as this court said in that case,such a limited holding was a mere consequen ce of the much larger holding that the commission had reasonably explained its crediting pricing policy generally.id.that pricing policy,spelled out in consumers energy,makes no mention of specific reference to short circuit and stability network upgrades.it referred to all facilities from the point of interconnection.consumers energy i,at emphasis added.
departure from precedent 
the only though it is a small one,it is one upon which potentially millions of dollars of cost allocation whether from as a test of allocation justified by the commission in consumers energy i equates to at or beyond as the commission urges in the present controversy,or merely to beyond.either is a natural reading of from.for example,when a bridal couple declares their fealty from this day forward,we would not likely interpret this as a declaration of faithfulness to begin the next day.the commission at or beyond test is consistent with such an immediate beginning inclusive of everything from the point of commencement including that point.on the other hand,if a travel guide tells us that it is one hundred miles from city a to city b,we would not necessarily assume that any distance within the city of commencement is included within that one hundred miles.neither construction would be unreasonable.normally,we would defer to the commission interpretation of its own prior ruling.cassell fcc.however,such deference would presuppose that the commission had justified the subsequent usage in the prior declaration it purports to interpret.such justification is not present on the record before us.
as we noted above,ferc explanation of its policy application to the present contract depends upon its adoption of its rationale from the consumers energy decisions.as we further discussed above,justification by adoption of a prior ruling is perfectly appropriate and adequate.the difficulty is that the commission explanation in consumers energy,at least on its face,is not consistent with the commission application of the test to the facts before us.nevada power petition does not depend on any inherent flaw in the from test as applied to improvements beyond the point of interconnection,but only as to those precisely at the interconnection.it appears from the face of consumers energy ii that the commission application of its test to the facts before it in that case may have been consistent with nevada power interpretation rather than the one ferc advances now.the total interconnection cost at issue in consumers energy was million.of that total,the commission permitted albeit almost sub silentio direct assignment of the million attributable to the physical interconnection of the generating facility with consumers transmission grid,and approved credit for the remaining million in network upgrade costs consumers energy i,at.if the commission had intended from to mean at or beyond rather than simply beyond,then it is not at all clear what accounts for the million in direct assignment,as the interconnection presumably is at the determinative point.we therefore must vacate the order under review and remand the controversy to the commission for further proceedings.
the progression of commission pronouncements of its network upgrade policy demonstrates that the at or beyond test is the product of regulatory by change,not with consumers energy.the commission issued consumers energy i on may.there it described all network costs as the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator connects to the grid.at emphasis added.as we noted,supra,in that analysis the commission did not consider the physical interconnection of the generating facility with the grid to be a network upgrade.consumers energy i itself was a clarification,see entergy i,at,of a prior order in which the commission excluded from system upgrades the cost of minimum facilities needed to establish the interconnection.amer.power service,wl,at aep,quoted in consumers energy ii,at.
less than one month after the issuance of consumers energy i,commissioner wood called for a change in policy.he proposed that costs of transmission beyond the power plant busbar which are needed to accommodate the output of the new generation facility should be borne by the transmission service provider detroit edison,wl,at.commissioner wood credited his recent experience on texas regulatory body with demonstrating the need for interconnection policies that foster fair,efficient competition between old and new generators.id.while this may appear to be a restatement,not change,of policy in light of consumers energy i,the concurrence further explanation reveals a difference.looking back to commissioner wood experience,we see that the policies of the public utility commission of texas reflected an at or beyond test rather than a from test.in at least one case the texas commission,in a decision authored by wood,included as transmission costs the transmission switching facilities,necessary to provide the interconnection between generator and transmission service provider.petition of pasadena cogeneration,for declaratory order,docket,public util.comm.of texas,at.puc lexis.commissioner wood discussion of the role of efficient in generator competition in detroit edison mirrors his discussion in pasadena cogeneration.given the facts in pasadena cogeneration,he clearly endorsed an at or beyond test in.he appears to have called for a similar test in his detroit edison concurrence.
one month after commissioner wood statement in detroit edison,the commission denied a rehearing in consumers energy,and it made no reference to either a from test or an at or beyond test,but it referred only to network upgrade costs.consumers energy ii,at.
the day after consumers energy ii,however,the commission stated its policy in a manner resembling an at or beyond test more than a from test of the sort suggested in consumers energy i,as it described the difference between a interconnection facility and a network upgrade.as t
