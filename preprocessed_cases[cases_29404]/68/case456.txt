granted access to florida power light electricity transmission lines for the purpose of establishing network transmission service,petitioner florida municipal power agency challenges three decisions of the federal energy regulatory commission rejecting its request for pricing credits.finding the commission decisions supported by substantial evidence and neither arbitrary nor capricious,we deny the petition.
after determining that utilities were discriminatorily denying power suppliers access to electricity transmission lines,the federal energy regulatory commission issued order requiring public utilities that own,control,or operate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs under which they agree to provide access to their transmission networks in addition to the service they had been offering.promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,order,stats.regs,wl,clarified,and,wl,modified,order,stats.regs,fed.reg,order on reh g,order,wl,fed.reg,order on reh g,order,wl,aff transmission access policy study group ferc,per curiam taps,aff,new york ferc,d.in transmission service,utilities pay for energy transmission from designated points of receipt to designated points of delivery.taps,at.as order explains,however,n etwork service allows more flexibility by allowing a transmission customer to use the entire transmission network to provide generation service for specified resources and specified loads without having to pay multiple charges for each pairing.order,fed.reg.at.thus,unlike service,network service permits a utility using another utility transmission lines to fully integrate load the total demand for service on a utility system and resources on an instantaneous basis in a manner similar to the transmission owner integration of its own load and resources.id.at.
three additional features of order are relevant to this case.first,the order requires load ratio pricing for network transmission service,a form of transmission that provides the customer with the same full system ability for transmitting power as the transmission owner.taps,at.under load ratio pricing,the costs of the transmission system are allocated on the basis of the ratio of the network customer load to the transmission provider entire load on its transmission system.respondent br.at.
the second relevant principle from order responded to arguments made by utility customers like petitioner florida municipal power agency fmpa that because some customers sell power in a way that does not bear on network as ratio pricing use of total load for determining a customer rate might require payment for unneeded network transmission.taps,at.these transmission customers thought they should therefore receive pricing credits for all facilities.id.ferc agreed in part.although holding that customers were entitled to pricing credits for facilities integrated into the transmission network,the commission cautioned that t he fact that a transmission customer facilities may be interconnected with a transmission provider system does not prove that the two systems comprise an integrated whole such that the transmission provider is able to provide transmission service to itself or other transmission customers over those key requirement of integration.order.at emphasis in original.f or a customer to be eligible for a credit,ferc explained,its facilities must not only be integrated with the transmission provider system,but must also provide additional benefits to the transmission grid in terms of capability and reliability,and be relied upon for the coordinated operation of the grid.order,fed.reg.at.in other words,ferc would determine credits on a basis.
third,order adopts the principle of comparability,meaning that the same integration standard that applies to transmission customers for the purpose of determining eligibility for pricing credits also applies to transmission providers for rate determination purposes.order.at.thus,if a transmission provider includes a facility in its rate base,then its transmission customers may receive rate credits for any similarly situated facilities.
running parallel to the development of order,and in many respects providing a basis for it,this case began in when fmpa,a nonprofit public agency that provides electric power supply to its member cities that sell retail electricity to the public,developed a plan for offering network transmission service.fmpa requested the right to purchase transmission service from intervenor florida power light,owner of the state largest transmission system.when florida power rejected that request,fmpa filed a complaint with ferc.granting fmpa request for network transmission service,ferc ordered the parties to agree on rates,conditions,and terms of service within sixty days.mun.power agency.power light,wl,reh g dismissed,wl.
when fmpa and florida power failed to reach an agreement,ferc issued a final order addressing issues.mun.power agency.power light,wl fmpa i.foreshadowing order,ferc adopted florida power load ratio pricing proposal,but agreed that in certain circumstances fmpa might be entitled to pricing credits for facilities that are integrated into florida power network.the commission explained 
if fmpa has transmission facilities that will operate as part of the integrated transmission system,a credit would be reasonable.indeed,this is in line with florida power position that it is redefining the native load served by the florida power transmission system to include all of fmpa resources and loads.if fmpa owns grid facilities that are now used to integrate the same resources and loads,those facilities are part of the integrated transmission system,and florida power must include an appropriate credit for any such grid facilities when it submits its compliance filing in this case.
in,acting on several requests for rehearing,ferc rejected fmpa argument that florida power had improperly refused to grant fmpa pricing credits,holding that none of fmpa facilities was integrated into florida power network.mun.power agency.power light,wl fmpa ii.at the same time,ferc recognized the comparability principle that later found its way into order just as fmpa can not obtain credit for facilities not used by florida power to provide service,so florida power can not charge fmpa for facilities not used to provide transmission service.id.at.
in fmpa ii,ferc rejected fmpa request to supplement the record to include evidence relating to a facility fmpa operates in lake worth,florida,as well as evidence relating to the rate case.id.at.the latter refers to a separately docketed ferc proceeding that began in when florida power filed a proposed tariff adjustment that would have affected the prices it charged transmission users,including fmpa.power light,wl.although florida power and fmpa reached a settlement,that settlement did not resolve fmpa claim that florida power rate base should be adjusted to exclude facilities that are not integrated with the rest of florida power transmission system.power light,wl.this issue,referred to as a reserved issue,remains pending before the commission.respondent br.at.in fmpa ii,therefore,ferc denied fmpa request that if the commission rejects the proposed credits for fmpa facilities,florida power be directed to exclude from its transmission rates the cost of transmission facilities that fmpa believes are not part of the integrated grid fmpa ii,at.this issue,the commission explained,is among the rate issues being litigated in the rate case,and the parties have agreed that all rate issues will be resolved in the rate case.id.
finally,in fmpa iii,the commission denied fmpa second petition for rehearing.mun.power agency.power light,wl.rejecting fmpa request for pricing credits,ferc again held that fmpa failed to demonstrate that its facilities were integrated into florida power network.id.at.ferc also ruled that fmpa contention that the commission should reduce the florida power rate base to be consistent with a disallowance of fmpa facilities that are necessary to connect generation and l
