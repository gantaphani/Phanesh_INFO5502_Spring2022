three years ago,in interstate natural gas ass of america ferc,ingaa,we resolved several matters relating to the federal energy regulatory commission efforts to increase flexibility and competition in the natural gas industry,but remanded two issues to the commission for further consideration.the first issue is whether ferc abandonment scheme appropriately balance s the protection of captive customers with the furtherance of market values.id.at.twice the commission imposed caps on the contract length existing customers must bid to retain service rights in the face of competing bids from new customers.twice we rejected ferc justification for the cap length selected and remanded the issue for further explanation.in the order now before us the commission removed the cap altogether.the second issue involves ferc decision to allow shippers to make what are known as forwardhaul and backhaul deliveries of gas to a single point in an amount greater than the shipper contracted for capacity at that point.id.at.on remand,ferc again defended,though in greater detail,its decision to allow these transactions.
various petitioners now challenge the new order.finding that the commission engaged in reasoned decision making with respect to both issues,we deny the petitions for review.
we begin with the cap.in ingaa we held that section b of the natural gas act nga,b,protects pipeline capacity holders by prohibiting natural gas compan ies from ceasing to provide service to their existing customers when their contracts expire unless,after due hearing,ferc finds that the present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment.ingaa,at quoting b.for twenty years the commission has struggled to streamline the regulatory process for contract termination by allowing abandonment while meeting its obligations under b to protect customers from pipeline market power.see id.at.
in united distribution ferc,udc,we reviewed ferc regulation providing captive shippers with a right of first refusal rofr which allowed such shippers to avoid abandonment and extend their contracts if they matched the rate and to a by competing bidders.we approved the basic structure of the mechanism,finding that it provides the protections from pipeline market power required for abandonment under.id.at.at the same time,we remanded the cap,in part because we saw no reasoned explanation of how it would adequately meet the commission b obligation to protect captive customers from the exercise of pipeline market power.id.at.
on remand,ferc adopted a cap.pipeline service obligations and revisions to regulations governing transportation under part of the commission regulations,at,wl.we vacated and again remanded,citing ferc unsupported decision to rely on the median contract length ferc concerns that the cap would result in a bias toward contracts,fostering an imbalance of risks between pipelines and existing shippers and raising the overall cost of pipeline transportation and ferc earlier suggestion that elimination of the cap would foster efficient competition.ingaa,at internal quotations marks omitted.we also noted that the commission provided neither an affirmative explanation for the selection of five years,nor a response to its own or the pipelines objections.id.at.
w hether a cap must be required as part of the rofr,ferc explained,turns on whether it is necessary to protect the existing shipper from the pipeline exercise of market power.regulation of natural gas transportation services,and regulation of interstate natural gas transportation services,at,wl order on remand citing udc,at,aff,order on rehearing.according to the commission,m arket power is exercised through the withholding of capacity to create an artificial scarcity,thereby raising prices.id.at.finding that existing regulations adequately control the exercise of market power,ferc abolished the cap altogether.id.at.
in finding the term cap unnecessary,ferc employed the reasoning we sustained in process gas consumers group ferc,pgc ii,a recent decision in a parallel line of cases addressing caps for new,rather than existing,customers.in pgc ii,we rejected challenges to ferc removal of a cap for new shippers,accepting the commission determination that existing regulatory controls already limit pipelines market power,thereby minimiz ing any danger that the pipeline will withhold capacity from the market to create the artificial scarcity necessary to force shippers to bid for supercompetitive contract terms.id.at alteration and omission in original internal quotation marks omitted.in the order at issue here,the commission cited several existing controls it believed would protect existing shippers from any pipeline exercise of market power traditional rate regulation pipelines obligation to offer to sell all existing capacity the commission complaint process,order on remand,at order on rehearing,at the opportunity customers have to offset the cost of unwanted capacity through capacity release,order on rehearing,at and the constraints on contract conditions imposed by the pro forma tariff reviewed by ferc,id.at.given these regulatory controls,ferc concluded that pipelines could exert market power only by refusing to build additional capacity when demand requires it.order on remand,at.according to the commission,however,pipelines would have a greater incentive to build new capacity since pipelines could only increase profits by investing in additional facilities to serve the increased demand.moreover,if pipelines did refuse to build new capacity,the shippers could file a complaint.id.
ferc acknowledged that unlike the new customers at issue in pgc ii,existing shippers enjoy statutory protection from pipeline market power.id.at.the commission explained,however,that the rofr adequately protects existing customers by ensur ing that,if the existing customer is willing to pay the maximum approved rate and match the contract term of a rival bidder,the pipeline may not abandon service to that customer.id.
represented by petitioner american gas association,a collection of existing shippers now challenge ferc elimination of the cap,charging that the commission reversed ten years of practice and failed to provide coherent support for the conclusion that the commission need no longer concern itself with the exercise of pipeline monopoly power upon contract expiration.pet rs opening br.for such claims,our standard of review is both well established and highly deferential.we will uphold ferc factual findings if supported by substantial evidence and endorse its orders so long as they are based on reasoned decision making.texaco,ferc.in addition,we must ensure that ferc has adequately responded to our concerns in ingaa.pgc ii,at.as we have already recognized,however,because selection of the matching cap duration must be somewhat arbitrary,we defer to the commission expertise if it provides substantial evidence to support its choice and responds to substantial criticisms of that figure.udc,at.
in ingaa,we evaluated the evidence upon which ferc relied to determine appropriate term caps,examining the data it used as well as its explanation linking those data to the cap length selected.see at see also process gas consumers group ferc,pgc i asking the same questions.we do the same here.
as to the first inquiry,petitioners argue that ferc ignored available,that it failed to look at any data at all.ferc responds that the only existing evidence came from regulated markets and that such evidence reveals nothing at all about the duration of pipeline contracts in competitive markets.order on rehearing,at.ferc is correct.as we explained in pgc i,the relevant question for assessing a term cap is whether it will prevent the pipelines from compelling shippers to offer the pipeline longer contracts than they would in a competitive market.pgc i,at emphasis added.
even were we to find the available data useful,under our second linkage between the evidence before the commission and the cap length analysis of the evidence is reasonable.first,ferc found that the evidence gathered both before and after the imposition of the cap demonstrates that the cap ha
