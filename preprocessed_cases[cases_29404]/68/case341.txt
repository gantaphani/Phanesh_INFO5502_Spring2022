the florida municipal power agency florida municipal petitions for review of two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regarding the rate base for network transmission service using the facilities of florida power light company florida power.florida municipal resists the conclusion that the comparability principle,under which ferc applies the same integration standard to florida municipal and florida power in determining whether their facilities provide any benefit to florida power transmission system,bars the relief florida municipal seeks.in regard to ferc approval of florida power april compliance filing,florida municipal first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the finding that the test florida power used in on its facilities to identify unneeded redundancy was comparable to the test florida power used in to evaluate florida municipal vero pierce facilities.second,florida municipal contends its facilities were required to be treated no differently than florida power local facilities,so that florida power rate base must exclude the costs associated with florida power local facilities.we deny the petition.
the background to these proceedings appears in florida municipal power agency ferc,florida municipal i.florida municipal obtained access to florida power network transmission system but did not receive pricing credits for using its own transmission facilities if they were interconnected rather than integrated with florida power transmission system.see.mun.power agency ferc,florida municipal i in denying credits,ferc explained that it had not direct ed a merging of the parties transmission systems or the operation of a joint transmission network.mun.power agency.power light,ferc,fmpa ii.in affirming that denial,the court described ferc pricing system as allocating the price of network transmission services based on the ratio of each network customer load to the total load on the transmission system.mun.i,at.in addition,the court described ferc principle of comparability,in which the same integration standard that applies to transmission customers for the purpose of determining eligibility for pricing credits,also applies to transmission providers for rate determination purposes.id.at.
on january,ferc agreed with florida power that to be considered integrated into its transmission system,a facility would need to pass a test,with one factor being a facility that provides only unneeded redundancy is not eligible for cost recovery.power light,ferc at p january order.ferc determined florida power had not applied this factor to its facilities in the same way it applied the factor to florida municipal facilities,and florida power needed to show that each facility included in its transmission rate base was needed to deliver power to customers in the area where the facility is located and to other florida power load centers.id.emphasis added.
in april,florida power submitted a compliance filing proposing to remove approximately million in costs from its network transmission service rate.ferc concluded it was unclear whether florida power had failed to test its,looped facilities in a manner comparable to the way it tested florida municipal facilities.see.power light,ferc at p december order.specifically,florida power had not indicated whether unserved load resulting from tests of its facilities referred to load that is directly connected to or supplied by the facility being tested load in other florida power load centers.id.at p.so ferc accepted florida power compliance filing in part but stated that the test florida power had applied to its facilities should have been whether,even without the facility being tested,florida power is able to deliver power to its customers in the facility area and to other florida power load centers.id.at p.florida power requested rehearing on the ground that through this use of the word and ferc had shifted the comparability standard from that previously used in evaluating the tests of florida municipal facilities eligibility for pricing credits.ferc denied the request as untimely.see.power light,ferc at p july order.florida power sought rehearing and reconsideration.
by order of february,ferc reconsidered its denial of rehearing.power light,ferc recons.order.ferc acknowledged that it had erred in its interpretation of the test applied to florida municipal vero pierce facilities,and concluded that the test florida power applied to its facilities to determine whether they provide unneeded redundancies was comparable to the test.id.at p.in support of this change in position,ferc relied on the affidavits of two experts,karabet adjemian and hector sanchez,submitted by florida power.ferc accepted florida power april compliance filing.one commissioner dissented on the ground the majority had not adequately explained its reversal of previous findings on comparability and florida municipal had raised serious concerns about the speculativeness of the adjemian and sanchez affidavits.recons.order,dissenting statement.
ferc denied florida municipal request for rehearing,reiterating that in its january and december orders it had misinterpreted adjemian affidavit and thus misstated the test for integration.power light,ferc at p,p order den.reh g.ferc affirmed its determination that the florida municipal facilities were unneeded because they were not necessary to serve either florida power local or remote load,and that florida power similarly unneeded facilities were properly eliminated from its transmission rate base.id.at p.weighing the evidence,ferc concluded sanchez affidavit describing his testing of florida power facilities in showed he used models and methodologies consistent with adjemian testing of florida municipal facilities.in contrast,florida municipal expert evidence purporting to recreate the test was unpersuasive because it failed to follow the methodology employed in adjemian test.ruling that florida municipal objections to the adequacy of adjemian affidavit were brought too late,because ferc had relied on it in the january order,ferc also rejected florida municipal suggestion that an adverse inference should be drawn from florida power failure to produce a copy of the test,observing that florida power had produced substantial evidence supporting its position from a record that stretches back to.order den.reh g at p.one commissioner dissented on the ground that the record evidence did not justify the reconsideration order.
florida municipal petitions for review of the reconsideration order and the order denying rehearing.the court review s ferc orders under the arbitrary and capricious standard and uphold s ferc factual findings if supported by substantial evidence in the record.mun.ii,at a.
florida municipal contends the challenged orders are not supported by substantial evidence and violate the principle of comparability between transmission transmission and transmission transmission.as to the former,florida municipal objects to ferc revised interpretation of florida power expert evidence on its test of florida municipal facilities in.it notes that adjemian,who conducted the test,does not remember how the test was done and produced no documentation of the test,and that sanchez,who conducted the test,was not sure which testing model and method adjemian used in.it asserts adjemian and sanchez provided conflicting affidavits on the comparability of the and tests.for instance,adjemian affidavit at referred to testing whether florida power could deliver power even without florida municipal line,while sanchez affidavit at referred to testing each florida power transmission facility and described adjemian as having removed the fort beach line.florida municipal maintains the evidence of the comparability of the and tests is therefore speculative and conjectural.
a n agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed,not casually ignored.greater boston television fcc.where ferc carefully explained its reasoning t he fact that ferc changed its approach required no additional or special explanation.westar energy,ferc.to provide a reasoned analysis,ferc must first establish that its finding of testing comparability is supported by substantial evidence in the record.we conclude it has.
first,adjemian affidavit stated that florida municipal vero pierce electric facilities are interconnected with the florida power system and with each other but that,other than the florida municipal line connecting vero beach and fort pierce,the florida municipal facilities internal to each city deliver power to or from florida power and where applicable from local generation.from florida power perspective,he explained,florida municipal vero pierce line does not change the fact that vero beach and fort pierce each interconnect directly at florida power delivery points and that internal city facilities do not reduce florida power costs in providing transmission service.observing that even if one could assume florida municipal facilities and florida power transmission system are part of an integrated transmission grid,the question would remain whether florida municipal facilities in any way benefit florida power,reduce florida power costs.to answer this question,adjemian stated he applied two tests whether the florida municipal facilities reduce florida power costs in providing transmission to florida municipal cities,and whether the cities facilities reduce florida power costs in serving florida power other customers.adjemian concluded t he answer to both questions is no.adjemian aff.emphasis added.he further explained that although a negligible amount of power can flow over the vero pierce line,this fact is not determinative of whether the line benefits florida power because t he question is whether florida power has sufficient transmission facilities in the area such that,even without the line,florida power is able to deliver power to retail customers in that area and to transmit power to florida power other load centers in south florida.id.at.ferc had previously focused on this sentence but failed to read it in the context of adjemian no answers to both questions about whether the florida municipal facilities benefit florida power.
second,adjemian additionally explained that for cities interconnected to florida power system at a single point,the facilities florida power needed to transmit power to and from each city do not depend on each city internal facilities.for cities like vero beach and fort pierce that are connected by their own power line,a loop,he had tested florida power system with and without the line and found that the line did not benefit florida power because it did not allow florida power to defer or cancel facilities included in its current transmission expansion plan.indeed,adjemian opined,florida power would have not built this line to provide reliable service to vero beach fort pierce.id.at.adjemian affidavit was to the same effect,repeating that because florida power could meet all of its service obligations without florida municipal fort beach line,the line provided no benefit to the florida power transmission system.adjemian aff.
third,sanchez affidavit described how his test of florida power facilities applied the same model and methodology that adjemian had used to test florida municipal facilities in.reading the january order that florida power apply to its facilities the system modeled by florida power to analyze the integration of florida municipal fort beach line,january order at p,to refer to adjemian testing,sanchez stated he believed adjemian had used a load flow model compiled by the florida electric power coordinating group fcg to analyze whether florida municipal was entitled to credits for the costs of the fort beach line.he explained this load flow model provides a snapshot of the system at the time of peak load,and consists of data that includes the florida companies respective forecasted loads,generation,expansion plans,and firm wholesale obligations.sanchez aff.sanchez gave three reasons for his belie f adjemian used the vintage fcg load flow model to analyze the fort beach line.id.first,that model was officially made available in may or june and was thus the most recent model available to adjemian when he conducted the test.second,adj emian had explained that the fort beach line had been a kv line and was not included in the fcg model until the line was upgraded to kv.see adjemian aff.third,florida power records indicate that the kv line was not placed into service until therefore,a model year of would need to have been used to test that line.sanchez aff.sanchez concluded it was reasonable to use the fcg model to test the florida power system in the test was consistent with the methodology florida power used in to test florida municipal fort beach line because,like adjemian removing that line from the model,see adjemian aff,he sanchez removed from the model the transmission facility being tested and determined whether simulating a first contingency a sudden loss of a transmission line,transformer,or generator resulted in a violation of the model reliability criteria,whether,without that line or facility,florida power would be able to meet its wholesale transmission and retail obligations.
from this evidence,ferc could reasonably conclude that florida power comparably tested florida municipal facilities in and its own in to determine whether the tested facilities were necessary for florida power to be able to serve either its remote or local loads,not both.substantial evidence in the record requires more than a scintilla,but can be satisfied by something less than a preponderance of the evidence.mun.i,at quotation marks omitted.it is true that adjemian stated in his affidavit that he had examined whether florida power had sufficient transmission facilities in the area such that,even without the florida municipal line,florida power is able to deliver power to retail customers in that area and to transmit power to florida power other load centers in south florida.recons.order at p quoting adjemian aff.emphasis in recons.order.but he also stated he answered no to both of the questions he posed in his redundancy analysis.read together,his statements are consistent with use of an or test in.further,adjemian and sanchez affidavits clarified the salient point could florida power serve its customers without relying on florida municipal facilities.
ferc explained upon reconsideration that it now recognized adjemian affidavit did not signal that florida power had used a threshold for integration,but rather that adjemian focused on whether florida power s facilities could serve all loads absent florida municipal vero pierce facilities.recons.order at p.that is,the test examined whether removing facilities during the test curtails either local or remote load,not whether it curtails both.id.ferc also relied on sanchez affidavit,finding the tests he and adj emian performed considered the threshold question,whether a given facility provided any benefit to florida power system.id.at p citing sanchez aff,adjemian aff.
contrary to florida municipal contention on appeal,the record evidence permitted ferc reasonably to conclude that florida power evidence was neither speculative nor conjectural.it is true that adjemian did not recall precisely which test he had used in,but as ferc observed,adjemian conducted the test and thus was in the best position to describe the test.order den.reh g at p.ferc found his affidavit confirming the test methodology credible because it was consistent with his affidavit.adjemian affidavit,regarding the two cost reduction questions he addressed,that t he answer to both questions is no,adjemian aff.emphasis added,was properly understood,ferc now recognized,to mean that florida municipal facilities were not necessary for florida power to serve any load,either remote or local.this interpretation of the test is supported by adjemian affidavit,by sanchez affidavit describing the model and why adjemian logically would have used it,and by the focus of both the and tests on determining any benefit to florida power in terms of reducing its costs,namely whether florida power could provide reliable wholesale and
